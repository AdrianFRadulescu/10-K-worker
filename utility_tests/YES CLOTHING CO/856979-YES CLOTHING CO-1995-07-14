ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
  YES Clothing Co.(R), "the Company", designs, contracts for the manufacture
of and markets diversified lines of apparel for women in junior sizes, young
men and kids. The Company sells its apparel to retail department stores and
specialty chains and stores. The Company's garments are made in the United
States and to a lesser extent in the Far East.
 
  The Company was incorporated in California in 1982. Its principal executive
offices are located at 1380 West Washington Boulevard, Los Angeles, California
90007, and its telephone number at that address is (213) 765-7800.
 
ACQUISITION TRANSACTION
 
  On January 31, 1995, control of the Company changed when its two principal
owners sold all of their shares, amounting to approximately 80% of the
Company's outstanding stock, to affiliates of Georges Marciano, founder and
former Chairman of Guess, Inc.
 
  In November 1994, former Company Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, George Randall, and former Company President, Moshe Tsabag, signed an
agreement to sell their holdings in the Company to affiliates of Georges
Marciano. The transaction closed on January 31, 1995, resulting in the
acquisition by Marciano affiliates of approximately 80% of the outstanding
common stock of the Company. As a result of the Acquisition Transaction,
George Randall resigned his positions with the Company in January 1995 and
Moshe Tsabag resigned as President in January 1995 and as a Board Member and
employee in April 1995. This transaction is known herein as the Acquisition
Transaction.
 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
  Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction by affiliates of Georges Marciano,
the Company has embarked upon several new manufacturing, design and sales
relationships. The Company has changed its product focus in styles produced,
the price of its products and targeted gross margins. Most of its senior
executive officers and a substantial portion of its Board of Directors have
been replaced, its design staff has been supplemented, it has acquired new
trademarks and terminated its previous agreements with licensees in Canada and
the United States. The Company has shifted its focus from primarily using
cotton/spandex knit, cotton jersey and denim in the production of dresses,
skirts, pants, tank tops, jackets, leggings and jeans to using primarily denim
and knit/woven cotton for shirts, pants, shorts, vests, jackets, dresses,
T-shirts and sweatshirts.
 
APPAREL AND APPAREL DESIGN
 
  The Company offers clothing for the women's "junior" market and for young
men's and children's markets. The Company's business is generally divided
among five retail selling seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Back-to-School and
Holiday. For each selling season, the Company introduces a separate apparel
collection each year. Seasonal factors can cause some variance in production
and sales levels among fiscal quarters in any fiscal year, but the Company
does not regard its overall business as highly seasonal.
 
  Junior's. The Company's clothing for the "junior" market incorporates
current styles, fabrics and colors with a look that is designed to appeal to a
broad cross-section of young women. Clothing for the junior market is
characterized by sizes tailored for youthfully figured women. Prior to the
Acquisition Transaction, the Company's Junior lines incorporated fabrics,
primarily of cotton/spandex knit, cotton jersey and denim, in the production
of dresses, skirts, pants, tank tops, jackets, leggings and jeans. Subsequent
to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company changed its focus to using
primarily denim and, to a lesser degree, twill, for shirts, pants, shorts,
vests, jackets and dresses and knit and woven cotton for T-shirts, sweatshirts
and other types of shirts. In addition, the Company has developed novelty
knits for tops, using fabrics such as second skin satin,
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
 
printed mesh and printed nylon. The GM Surf(TM) women's line uses novelty
fabrics of printed denim and pencel (a mixture of denim and nylon) for shirts,
pants, vests, dresses and jackets.
 
  The Company's in-house design staff, under the direction of Georges
Marciano, is responsible for all phases of product development.
 
  Young Men's. Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company offered
casual apparel for young men, principally between the ages of 15 to 30, in
collections of knits and woven shirts, jackets, vests, and denim and casual
pants and jeans. These were marketed under the YES Clothing Co.(R), and
Sedan(R) brands and the YES Men(R) trademark. Subsequent to the Acquisition
Transaction, the Company discontinued marketing under the Sedan(R) brand and
began marketing under the YES U.S.A.(TM) label, denim jeans, shorts, jackets
and vests and cotton and denim shirts, T-shirts and sweatshirts. The GM
Surf(TM) men's line, with its distinctive Hawaiian look, uses denim, flannel,
polar fleece, corduroy, cotton and rayon twill, wool and rayon gabardine,
cotton pique and nylon in the production of T-shirts, sweatshirts, shirts,
shorts, vests, jackets and pants.
 
  Children's Wear. Prior to fiscal 1994, the Company had manufactured
children's wear, mainly for girls aged 7 to 14. In fiscal 1994, the Company
discontinued the manufacture of children's wear and licensed out the YES(R)
name for the production of children's apparel. Subsequent to the Acquisition
Transaction, the Company reacquired the children's wear license and began
marketing, under the YES Kids(R) label, denim jeans, overalls, shorts,
shortalls, skirts, skirtalls, vests, and jackets, cotton T-shirts and
sweatshirts and denim and cotton shirts.
 
PRODUCTION
 
  Manufacturing. The Company manufactures its garments using independent
cutting and sewing contractors located principally in the Los Angeles area.
Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company manufactured certain goods
in Hong Kong and other locations in the Far East. The Company substantially
decreased these overseas activities after the Acquisition Transaction. The
Company seeks to produce high quality garments through its use of quality
fabrics, insistence on quality workmanship and use of comprehensive fabric and
garment inspection programs.
 
  The Company acquires fabric from suppliers and supplies such fabric,
together with the garment pattern, to an independent contractor for cutting.
The cut fabric and any buttons, zippers and other trim to be used on the
garments are then delivered to independent sewing contractors. Under the
Company's supervision, these contractors assemble and sew the fabric and add
trim in accordance with production samples. The Company also employs a
production coordinator and three full time production assistants who regularly
visit the Company's contractors to review the quality of the work in progress.
Prior to distribution, the garments are delivered to the Company's warehouse
for final inspection in the Quality Control Department, which has two full
time employees.
 
  The lead time to fill new orders placed by the Company with its
manufacturing contractors generally ranges from three to four weeks for
domestically produced garments. The Company generally schedules the
manufacture of apparel based on orders received to reduce the risk of
obsolescence of its garment inventory. The Company continuously monitors for
obsolete and damaged inventory. Such inventory is usually sold to customers
who specialize in merchandising off-price clothing and sold through a Company
owned factory outlet store.
 
  The Company has long-standing relationships with its cutting contractor and
many of its sewing production contractors but does not have written agreements
with any of its contractors. For its domestically produced garments, the
Company currently utilizes only one cutting contractor (who is located in the
Company's facility and who works mainly for the Company) and approximately 25
sewing contractors (all of whom are located in the Los Angeles area).
 
  The Company believes that its relationships with its cutting and sewing
contractors are satisfactory. The Company does not believe that the loss of
any contractor would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
 
operations as there are a large number of domestic and foreign cutting and
sewing contractors who can manufacture the Company's garments. However, the
Company believes that it is the largest customer of certain of its sewing
contractors.
 
  Fabric. Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the fabrics used by the
Company in its domestically produced garments were primarily cotton/spandex
knit, which was acquired from suppliers located in Hong Kong, and cotton
jersey and denim, which were acquired from suppliers located in the United
States. The Company made its foreign purchases of fabric from its resident
agent in Hong Kong, who placed orders with a number of fabric suppliers.
Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company substantially reduced
its use of cotton/spandex knit. The Company primarily uses denim, cotton knits
(jersey) and woven cotton (chambray and poplin), which are purchased
domestically.
 
  The Company believes that during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995,
approximately 82% of its expenditures for fabrics used in its domestically
produced garments were paid to suppliers located in the United States. For the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, approximately 16% of the Company's
expenditures for domestically purchased fabrics was accounted for by its
largest domestic fabric supplier, approximately 41% of such expenditures was
accounted for by the Company's four largest domestic suppliers and
approximately 58% of such expenditures was accounted for by the Company's ten
largest domestic suppliers.
 
  The Company does not have any long-term arrangements with any of its fabric
suppliers. To date, the Company has not experienced any difficulty in
satisfying its fabric requirements and it believes that the large number and
diversity of potential suppliers minimizes the risk of the loss of any one
supplier. The Company believes that the effect of the loss of one or a few of
its fabric suppliers on the Company's operations would be minimal due to the
large number and diversity of potential suppliers and the relative ease with
which new supplier relationships may be established.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
  The Company sells its apparel throughout the United States to retail
department stores, specialty chains and specialty stores. Prior to the
Acquisition Transaction, the Company had nominal sales in England, Europe,
Japan and Korea. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, the Company sold
its apparel to over 1,300 retailing customers. Approximately 44% of sales were
made to the Company's ten largest customers and approximately 89% of sales
were made to the Company's 100 largest customers.
 
  Sales of the Company's garments are made through independent sales
organizations and directly by the Company's sales staff. The Company maintains
showrooms in New York City and Los Angeles for women's and men's apparel. The
Company also engages the services of independent sales organizations located
in Miami, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Philadelphia, which operate showrooms
displaying the Company's products. Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the
Company had also engaged the services of an independent sales organization in
Puerto Rico. Sales representatives at each showroom are responsible for
marketing the Company's apparel within an assigned territory. Each sales
representative meets with customers in the showroom, makes sales calls to
customers and represents the Company at trade shows within the assigned
territory. The sales organizations are retained on a non-exclusive basis. All
of the Company's independent sales organizations are compensated on a
commission basis on terms consistent with industry practice. The Company does
not sell its garments on consignment.
 
  The Company generally sells its products on net-30 day terms, except for
Misfits and GM Junior products which are sold on 8/10 end of month terms.
 
  The Company's backlog consists of purchase orders that have been received
but not shipped, and amounted to approximately $3,200,000, $9,137,000 and
$8,400,000 as of June 20, 1995, June 20, 1994, and June 20, 1993,
respectively. The Company expects to ship substantially all of the orders
comprising the backlog prior to
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
 
September 30, 1995. Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction the Company's
backlog decreased significantly due to a restructuring of product lines and
the discontinuance of the Sedan(R) brand division.
 
  While the failure to fill orders on a timely basis could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's sales, the Company has generally not
experienced difficulty in shipping orders by the dates requested by its
customers. The Company does not generally accept returns except for damaged or
defective garments or with respect to late deliveries. However, the Company
does grant markdown money for slow moving goods.
 
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION
 
  Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company's advertising strategy was
to promote an image that associated a fashionable look and youthful style and
to promote the YES Clothing Co.(R) name. The Company advertised in national
magazines, including Details, In Fashion, Sportswear International, Vogue,
Seventeen Magazine, Elle and Source, among others. The Company had no
cooperative advertising program for its retailers although it did, with
advance approval, reimburse its customers for advertising the Company's
products. The Company's expenditures for advertising and promotion were
approximately $442,000 during fiscal 1995 (1.5% of net sales), $524,000 during
fiscal 1994 (1.9% of net sales), and approximately $779,000 during fiscal 1993
(2.1% of net sales). Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company
has promoted the YES Clothing Co.(R) name in Women's Wear Daily, a trade
newspaper, and Sportswear International and the GM Surf(TM) and Misfits(R)
brands in In Fashion, Los Angeles Magazine, Surfer and Sportswear
International.
 
BRANDS AND TRADEMARKS
 
  The Company's principal trademarks, YES Clothing Co.(R), YES Men(R), YES
Kids(R) and YES Jeans(R) are registered with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office. The Company also has registered or has trademark
applications pending, for these trademarks in other countries. The Company
believes that these trademarks have significant value in the marketing of its
apparel. While the Company is not aware of any claims against its right to
these trademarks, the loss of the right to use these trademarks would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's operations.
 
  There are other companies in the apparel and apparel-related industries that
incorporate the word "yes" in their trademarks, and there can be no assurance
that these or future trademarks which may be granted will not diminish the
value of the Company's "YES Clothing Co.(R)" or "YES(R)" trademarks.
Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company applied for domestic
and foreign trademarks for YES U.S.A.(TM) in a diamond design.
 
  Prior to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company sold under the YES
Clothing Co.(R) and Sedan(R) brand names. The Company also manufactured and
marketed its garments under private label for several large customers.
Subsequent to the Acquisition Transaction, the Company discontinued private
label and Sedan(R) brand sales, and, in addition to the YES(R) brand, began
marketing under the GM Surf(TM) and Misfits(R) labels which are licensed to
the Company under an agreement with Marble Sportswear, Inc., a company
controlled by Georges Marciano (see Related Party Transactions).
 
COMPETITION
 
  The segments of the apparel industry in which the Company competes are
highly fragmented. The Company competes with numerous other apparel
manufacturers, which vary in size and in the products with which they design
and manufacture. In addition, department stores, including some of the
Company's customers, sell competing apparel under their own labels. Many of
the Company's competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than
the Company.
 
  The marketing of apparel is highly competitive. The Company believes that
the ability to gauge effectively and to respond to changes in consumer demands
and tastes as well as the ability to produce and deliver its products on a
timely bases are necessary to compete successfully in the apparel industry.
The Company believes
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
 
that consumer acceptance depends on the image, design, quality and price of
its garments, and that its continuity will depend on its ability to remain
competitive in these areas. The failure to design garments that meet with
acceptance in the marketplace in the future could result in the material
deterioration of customer loyalty and the Company's image and could adversely
affect the Company's business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
  As of March 31, 1995, the Company employed 98 persons. None of the Company's
employees are represented by a labor union. The Company considers its
relations with employees to be satisfactory.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
 
  The cost and effect of complying with environmental regulations are not
material due to the nature of the Company's business.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
  Effective May 1, 1992, the Company's executive offices, merchandising,
production, shipping and warehousing facilities became located in a facility
in Los Angeles totaling approximately 75,000 square feet, occupied pursuant to
a lease expiring in May 1997. The Company also leases the following showrooms
pursuant to leases expiring as indicated: Los Angeles Women's (August 1997)
and Men's (August 1996) and New York City Women's (September 1997), Men's
(June 1996) and combined Women's/Men's showroom (June 2000). The Company is
attempting to sublease its Women's New York showroom and does not anticipate
any significant losses associated with the subleasing activity. Management
expects that in the normal course of business, such leases will be renewed or
replaced by other leases. The Company believes its current facilities are
generally in good operating condition and are suitable and adequate for its
foreseeable needs. The Company does not believe the loss of any of these
facilities would have a material adverse effect on its operations as
equivalent facilities are readily available. The Company also operates an
Outlet Store located in Park City, Utah for the sale of slow moving/off season
merchandise.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
  The Company is not involved in any legal proceeding.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
  There were no matters submitted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
1995 to a vote of security holders.

APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK SECURITIES
 
  The Company had approximately 775 holders of record of Common stock as of
March 31, 1995.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
  The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common equity. The Company
is not restricted from making any cash dividend payments under its current
credit agreement with its factor. However, the Company intends to retain any
earnings within the Company for the foreseeable future.
 
POTENTIAL DELISTING
 
  On June 14, 1995 the NASD notified the Company that its net worth as of
March 31, 1995 had been reduced below the NASD's minimum standards for
continued listing and suggested that the Company would be delisted from the
NASD/NMS. In light of the capital infusion by Mr. Marciano--See "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition--Subsequent Events", the
Company believes its net worth is now in excess of the minimum standards and
has applied to the NASD for a waiver from delisting. There is no assurance
that the waiver will be granted.

</TABLE>
 
FISCAL YEARS 1995, 1994 AND 1993
 
  NET SALES increased by $697,000 or 2.5% to $28,580,000 in fiscal 1995 due to
the addition of the GM Surf(TM) and Misfits(R) product lines.
 
  In fiscal 1994, net sales decreased by $10,060,000 or 26.5% to $27,883,000
due to significantly decreased sales in all divisions except for an increase
in sales in the Sedan(R) line of young men's and boy's knits and woven shirts.
The decline in sales reflects both continued intense competition as well as a
general decline in apparel purchases by consumers.
 
  GROSS PROFIT as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.8% in fiscal 1995
from 13.2% in fiscal 1994 due to higher levels of markdowns and a reduction in
prices negotiated by retailers in response to cost conscious consumers. Gross
profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 13.2% in fiscal 1994 from
21.2% in fiscal 1993. The significant decrease in gross profit percentage in
1994 reflects a number of factors, including decreased sales volume,
significant price competition, increased materials costs primarily for trim,
washing, bleaching and dying, and an increased unit cost for design and
production salaries and expenses (as these total costs are spread over the
decreased production).
 
  COMMISSION INCOME decreased by $306,000 or 44.4% to $383,000 due to the
discontinuation of commission transactions subsequent to the acquisition
transaction. Commission income is generated from shipments of goods
manufactured in the Orient to domestic and overseas customers. In fiscal 1994,
commission income decreased $264,000 or 27.7% to $689,000 from $953,000 in
fiscal 1993 due to a general decline in sales.
 
  ROYALTY INCOME decreased by $9,000 to $51,000 in fiscal 1995 from $60,000 in
fiscal 1994 due to the termination of licensee agreements in Canada and the
United States. In fiscal 1994, royalty income decreased by $81,000 from
$141,000 in fiscal 1993. The main reason for the decrease was the transition
from a bankrupt licensee in Canada to a new licensee in 1994.
 
                                      10
<PAGE>
 
  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ("S,G&A") decreased to
$7,972,000 in fiscal 1995 from $8,816,000 in fiscal 1994, which represented
27.9% and 31.7% of net sales, respectively. (When commission and royalty
income is added to net sales, the percentage of S,G&A is reduced to 27.5% and
30.8%, respectively.)
 
  The main factors reducing S,G&A in fiscal 1995 were as follows:
 
    (1) Payroll and payroll tax decreased to $2,795,000 in fiscal 1995 from
  $3,364,000 in fiscal 1994 due to a reduction in the number of employees.
 
    (2) Insurance expense decreased to $467,000 or 1.64% of net sales in
  fiscal 1995 from $712,000 in fiscal 1994 or 2.56% of net sales due to
  renegotiated insurance rates and a workers' compensation insurance rebate.
 
    (3) Advertising, travel, contributions and profit sharing expenses were
  reduced to $775,000 in fiscal 1995 from $1,064,000 in fiscal 1994 in order
  to conserve working capital.
 
  S,G&A expenses decreased to $8,816,000 in fiscal 1994 from $10,564,000 is
fiscal 1993 primarily due to decreases in advertising, legal and accounting
expenses incurred in connection with the Company's business interruption claim
and lower than anticipated bad debt expenses.
 
  OTHER INCOME--INSURANCE--Subsequent to March 31, 1992, the Company incurred
the loss of substantially all of its finished goods inventory in connection
with civil disturbances in the City of Los Angeles. During the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1993 the Company recovered, from one insurance company, the
cost of the inventory lost and its normal gross profit which would have been
derived from the sales of those goods. During the fiscal year ended March 31,
1994 the Company recovered $1,658,000, net of costs, from a second insurance
company for business interruption losses related to the civil disturbance.
 
  INTEREST INCOME decreased to $3,000 in fiscal 1995 from $74,000 in fiscal
1994 due to a net loss of $4,652,000 for fiscal 1995 and less funds being
available for investment. Interest income increased to $74,000 in fiscal 1994
from $39,000 in fiscal 1993 due to more funds held on deposit with the factor
in 1994.
 
  INTEREST EXPENSE increased to $255,000 in fiscal 1995 from $128,000 in
fiscal 1994 due to increased working capital requirements and borrowings from
the Company's Factor. Interest expense increased to $128,000 in fiscal 1994
from $107,000 in fiscal 1993 due to decreased borrowings from the Company's
Factor.
 
  INCOME TAXES in fiscal 1995 includes a valuation allowance of $3,109,000
which is equal to 100% of the net deferred tax asset. This valuation allowance
is considered appropriate since the Company cannot conclude that it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
 
  On June 17, 1995, Georges Marciano agreed to provide $3,300,000 in
additional capital to the Company in exchange for 2,640,000 shares of common
stock and to convert additional shares of common stock at $1.25 per share in
exchange of approximately $700,000 owed by the Company to Mr. Marciano and his
affiliates for advances and expenses incurred by them on the Company's behalf,
subject in both cases to the receipt of a formal valuation and fairness
opinion. Without the infusion of these funds and due to continuing losses, the
Company would have completely depleted its working capital by June of 1995.
Prior to receipt of the opinion, the Company operated on overdrafts from its
factor guaranteed by letters of credit supplied by Mr. Marciano. The opinion,
which is included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K was delivered on July 7,
1995 and the Company issued 3,184,693 shares to Mr. Marciano shortly
thereafter.
 
  Prior to the capital infusion and its recent liquidity crisis, the Company
had funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations
and credit facilities with its institutional lender.
 
 
                                      11
<PAGE>
 
  The Company had an agreement with a factor and through June 1994 with a
bank, whereby the factor purchased accounts receivable from the Company on a
non-recourse basis and remitted the funds on a maturity basis. The bank
provided the Company with an unsecured $3,000,000 facility for commercial
letters of credit and at March 31, 1994, the Company had $1,618,000 of letters
of credit outstanding. Under the facility agreement, the Company was
prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on any class of its stock.
 
  The Company entered into a new factoring agreement with Republic Factors and
a letter of credit facility with Republic National Bank of New York (the
financing bank) effective through March 1996. Both the old and new agreements
are non-recourse (ie, the factor purchases the Company's accounts receivable
that it has preapproved, without recourse, except in cases where there are
merchandise disputes in the normal course of business).
 
  Under the new factoring agreement, the Company sells substantially all of
its trade accounts receivable, without recourse, and may request advances, up
to 80% on the net sales factored at any time before their maturity date. The
factor is responsible for the accounting and collection of all accounts
receivable sold to it by the Company and receives a commission of 0.6% of
purchased net receivables on a guaranteed minimum volume for the contract year
of $30,000,000. The commission rate will increase to 0.75% of total invoices
factored and be applied retroactively for the contract year if the guaranteed
minimum volume is not attained.
 
  Under the letter of credit facility, the financing bank provides a credit
line for letters of credit, ledger debt and factor guaranties up to the 80%
advance rate provided under the factoring agreement with an additional over
advance facility of $1,050,000. Commitments outstanding under the letter of
credit facility as of March 31, 1995 amounted to $652,000.
 
  The agreements are collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory
imported under letters of credit. The Company or the factor may terminate the
credit agreement on the anniversary date of the agreement with at least 60
days prior written notice.
 
  As of March 31, 1995, the Company had net working capital of $866,000, as
compared to $5,250,000 as of March 31, 1994. The Company's current ratio as of
March 31, 1995 was 1.3, as compared to 3.0 as of March 31, 1994. The decreases
in working capital and current ratio are primarily due to net losses amounting
to $4,652,000. Funds due from factor as of March 31, 1995 was $678,000 as
compared to $3,383,000 as of March 31, 1994 due to increased working capital
requirements.
 
  Inventories at March 31, 1995 were $2,158,000 as compared to $3,213,000 at
March 31, 1994, a decrease of $1,055,000. The decrease was due to a reduction
of inventories to levels consistent with seasonal requirements, reduced
backlog and the discontinuation of various product lines.
 
  The Company has funded its activities principally from cash flow generated
from operations and credit facilities with its institutional lender.
 
  In recent years, the Company has experienced financial difficulties due to
major customers filing for reorganization proceedings under bankruptcy laws
and the unfavorable economic climate being experienced in the apparel
industry. These conditions have had a significant negative impact on the
Company's operations being reflected in declining sales and eroding margins,
resulting in net losses amounting to $4,652,000 and $2,934,000 in fiscal 1995
and 1994, respectively. On January 31, 1995, control of the Company changed
when approximately 80% of the Company's outstanding stock was acquired by
affiliates of Georges Marciano. Georges Marciano has subsequently made
unsecured non-interest bearing advances from an entity affiliated through
common ownership, due on demand, and amounted to $538,000 as of March 31,
1995. Additional material financial difficulties encountered by the Company
would require additional borrowing to avoid a negative impact on the Company's
future operations.
 
  The Company believes that the working capital infusion provided by Georges
Marciano and affiliates and the availability of credit under current lending
agreements and other financial sources available to it will provide
 
                                      12
<PAGE>
 
sufficient resources to finance the Company's currently anticipated working
capital needs and capital expenditures through the end of summer of 1995.
Continued financial difficulties encountered by the Company would require
additional borrowings and infusions of capital to avoid a negative impact on
the Company's continued future operations after that time period.
 
  The Company has continued to cut its payroll. It has also reduced other
operating costs such as advertising and payroll related costs. Notwithstanding
the foregoing measures, the Company anticipates that it may not be profitable
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996.
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
  On June 17, 1995, Georges Marciano agreed to become Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of the Board of the Company, to provide additional capital for
the Company, and to license to YES certain trademarks controlled by Marciano
affiliates. The additional capital was received by the Company on July 12,
1995 after receipt of a required valuation opinion.
 
  As Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of YES Clothing Co.(R),
Mr. Marciano will receive a salary of $1 per year plus options to acquire
500,000 shares of common stock per year at $1.25 per share for four years (the
closing price of the Company's common stock on June 13, 1995) vesting monthly
during continued employment. In addition to his duties as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Marciano will supervise all of the Company's design
departments.
 
  Mr. Marciano agreed to contribute $3,300,000 in additional capital to the
Company in exchange for 2,640,000 shares of common stock and to convert
additional shares of common stock at $1.25 per share in exchange of
approximately $700,000 owed by the Company to Mr. Marciano and his affiliates
for advances and expenses incurred by them on the Company's behalf subject in
both cases to the receipt of a formal valuation and fairness opinion. In
addition, the Company has granted Mr. Marciano a two-year warrant to acquire
an additional 2,000,000 shares at $1.25 per share.
 
  The Company has also agreed to enter into five-year trademark license
agreements for Mr. Marciano's "GM Surf(TM)" and "Misfits(R)" lines of clothing
at royalties of 7% of gross sales, plus an additional 2% for advertising.
 
  In connection with the employment of the principal shareholder as Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, the Company has granted an option
for 500,000 shares per year at $1.25 per share over four years, vesting
ratably, expiring in ten years.
 
  If all of the shares, warrants and options described above are issued and
exercised, Mr. Marciano and his affiliates' ownership of the Company may
increase to approximately 93% by the end of four years. Shareholder approval
will be sought for the grant of the options and warrant to Mr. Marciano.
 
  Copies of all of the agreements reflecting the foregoing are attached here
to as exhibits.
 
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

<PAGE>
 
                             REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
 
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by management in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, and necessarily
include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates and
judgments.
 
  Yes Clothing Co. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed
to provide management with reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are
executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly.
The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost
of a system of internal control should not exceed the benefits derived and
that the evaluation of those factors requires estimates and judgments by
management. Further, because of inherent limitations in any system of internal
accounting control, errors or irregularities may occur and not be detected.
Nevertheless, management believes that a high level of internal control is
maintained by Yes Clothing Co. through the selection and training of qualified
personnel, and the establishment and communication of accounting and business
policies.
 
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of outside
directors, meets periodically with management and with Yes Clothing Co.'s
independent auditors to review matters relating to the quality of financial
reporting and internal accounting control, and the nature, extent and results
of their audits. Yes Clothing Co.'s independent auditors have free access to
the Audit Committee.

Board of Directors
Yes Clothing Co.
 
  We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Yes Clothing Co. as of
March 31, 1995 and the related statements of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended. We have also
audited the financial statement schedule for the year ended March 31, 1995,
listed under item 14. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audit.
 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Yes Clothing Co. as of
March 31, 1995, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
In our opinion, the schedule for the year ended March 31, 1995 presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

its styles, which are shipped directly from the manufacturer to customers in
the United States, Europe and Japan. In connection therewithin, the Company
received a percentage of the sales price charged by the manufacturer and
recognized this amount as commission income in the accompanying statement of
operations. Subsequent to the acquisition transaction as described below, the
Company discontinued these commission transactions.
 
  In January 1995, control of the Company changed when its two principal
shareholders sold all of their shares, amounting to approximately 80% of the
Company's outstanding stock, to affiliates of an individual. This transaction
is herein referred to as the "Acquisition Transaction" and the collective new
majority interest as the "Principal Shareholder". The principal shareholder
currently holds approximately 88% of the Company's outstanding stock.
 
  B) FINANCIAL CONDITION--The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which
contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company
sustained a substantial loss for the year ended March 31, 1995 and has
experienced operating and net losses each year since 1992. The operating
results for the three months ended June 30, 1995 are anticipated to reflect
continued net losses. At this time, the Company is not able to sustain
operations without a significant infusion of capital. The Company is currently
operating on short-term overdrafts provided by the factor (Note 3) which are
guaranteed by limited letters of credit totaling $2,000,000 supplied by the
principal shareholder.
 
  In June 1995, the Company's principal shareholder expressed an intent to
provide additional capital in return for common stock, stock option, warrant
and other considerations. The Company's Board of Directors has approved the
transaction which was consummated after receipt of a formal valuation and
fairness opinion (the grant of options remains subject to shareholder
approval.) The significant terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
  . Contribution of $3,300,000 cash in exchange for common stock at $1.25 per
    share.
 
  . Conversion of amounts owed to the principal shareholder and his affiliate
    (Note 10) into approximately 560,000 shares of common stock, at a rate of
    $1.25 per share.
 
  . Issuance of 2,000,000 common stock warrant immediately exercisable,
    expiring in two years, at $1.25 per share.
 
  . Five year trademark license agreement with affiliates of the principal
    shareholder for "GM Surf(TM)" and "Misfits(R)" lines at a royalty rate of
    7% of gross sales plus 2% for advertising.
 
  . In connection with the employment of the principal shareholder as Chief
    Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, the Company has granted an
    option for 500,000 shares per year at $1.25 per share over four years,
    vesting ratably, expiring in ten years.

sales factored at any time before their maturity date. Under the letter of
credit facility, the financing bank provides a credit line for letters of
credit, ledger debt and factor guarantees up to the 80% advance rate provided
under the factoring agreement with an additional overadvance facility of
$1,050,000.
 
  The factor charges a commission on the net sales factored and interest on
advances at prime plus a negotiated rate. The agreements are collateralized by
accounts receivable and inventory imported under letters of credit.
 
  Open letters of credit at March 31, 1995 amounted to $426,000. Included in

</TABLE>
 
  The Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred
tax asset as the Company cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that
the net deferred tax asset will be realized.
 
  The Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$6,550,000 and $8,286,000, respectively, expire from the years 2007 through
2010. Because ownership of the Company changed control during the year, a
portion of the net operating loss carryforwards will be limited. Approximately
$5,826,000 and $7,598,000 of Federal and State net operating losses,
respectively, are subject to a maximum annual utilization totalling
approximately $522,000.
 
  Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial and
tax reporting. The effects of these differences on income taxes are as
follows:

conduct of Tenant, Tenant's subtenants, agents, employees, invitees or 
licensees, or which arise out of any work, labor, service or equipment done for
or supplied to Tenant or any subtenant or arising out of the installation, use 
or operation of the property or equipment of Tenant or any subtenant. Tenant 
shall also repair all damage to the building and the demised premises caused
by the moving of Tenant's fixtures, furniture and equipment. Tenant shall
promptly make, at Tenant's expense, all repairs in and to the demised premises
for which Tenant is responsible, using only the contractor for the trade or
trades in question, selected from a list of at least two contractors per trade
submitted aby Owner. Any other repairs in or to the building or the facilities
and systems thereof for which Tenant is responsible shall be performed by Owner
at the Tenant's expense. Owner shall maintain in good working order and repair
the exterior and the structural portions of the building, including the 
structural portions of its demised premises, and the public portions of the
building interior and the building plumbing, electrical, heating and ventilating
systems (to the extent such systems presently exist) serving the demised 
premises. Tenant agrees to give prompt notice of any defective condition of 
which Tenant has actual knowledge in the premises for which Owner may be 
responsible hereunder. There shall be no allowance to Tenant for diminution of
rental value and no liability on the part of Owner by reason of inconvenience,
annoyance or injury to business arising from Owner or others making repairs,
alterations, additions or improvements in or to any portion of the building or
the demised premises or in and to the fixtures, appurtenances or equipment 
thereof. It is specifically agreed that Tenant shall not be entitled to any
setoff or reduction of rent by reason of any failure of Owner to comply with
the covenants of this or any other article of this Lease. Tenant agrees that
Tenant's sole remedy at law in such instance will be by way of an action for
damages for breach of contract. The provisions of this Article 4 shall not
apply in the case of fire or other casualty which are dealt with in Article 9
hereof. 

Window        5. Tenant will not clean nor require, permit, suffer or allow
Cleaning:     any window in the demised premises to be cleaned from the outside

able law or of the Rules of the Board of Standards and Appeals, or of any other
Board or body having or asserting jurisdiction.*

Insurance,    future laws, orders and regulations of all state, federal, munic-

orders, rules and regulations of the New York Board of Fire Underwriters,
Insurance Services Office, or any similar body which shall impose any violation,
order or duty upon Owner or Tenant with respect to the demised premises, whether
or not arising out of Tenant's use or manner of use thereof,(including Tenant's
permitted use) or, with respect to the building if arising out of Tenant's

*Landlord shall make all repairs within ten (10) days of written notice by
Tenant. If such repairs cannot be completed within ten (10) days, Landlord 
must undertake such work within the ten (10) day period.

use or manner of use of the premises or the building (including the use 
permitted under the lease). Nothing herein shall require Tenant to make 
structural repairs or alterations unless Tenant has, by its manner of use of the
demised premises or method of operation therein, violated any such  laws, 
ordinances, orders, rules, regulations or requirements with respect thereto. 
Tenant may, after securing Owner to Owner's satisfaction against all damages, 
interest, penalties and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable 
attorney's fees, by cash deposit or by surety bond in an amount and in a company
satisfactory to Owner, contest and appeal any such laws, ordinances, orders, 
rules, regulations or requirements provided same is done with all reasonable 
promptness and provided such appeal shall not subject Owner to prosecution for
a criminal offense or constitute a default under any lease or mortgage under 
which Owner may be obligated, or cause the demised premises or any part thereof
to be condemned or vacated. Tenant shall not do or permit any act or thing to be
done in or to the demised premises which is contrary to law, or which will
invalidate or be in conflict with public liability, fire or other policies of
insurance at any time carried by or for the benefit of Owner with respect to the
demised premises or the building of which the demised premises form a part, or
which shall or might subject Owner to any liability or responsibility to any
person or for property damage. Tenant shall not keep anything in the demised
premises except as now or hereafter permitted by the Fire Department, Board of
Fire Underwriters, Fire Insurance Rating Organization or other authority having
jurisdiction, and then only in such manner and such quantity so as not to
increase the rate for fire insurance applicable to the building, nor use the
premises in a manner which will increase the insurance rate for the building or
any property located therein over that in effect prior to the commencement of
Tenant's occupancy. Tenant shall pay all costs, expenses, fines, penalties, or
damages, which may be imposed upon Owner by reason of Tenant's failure to comply
with the provisions of this article and if by reason of such failure the fire
insurance rate shall, at the beginning of this lease or at any time thereafter,
be higher than it otherwise would be, then Tenant shall reimburse Owner, as
additional rent hereunder, for that portion of all fire insurance premiums
thereafter paid by Owner which shall have been charged because of such failure
by Tenant. In any action or proceeding wherein Owner and Tenant are parties, a
schedule or "make-up" of rate for the building or demised premises issued by the
New York Fire Insurance Exchange, or other body making fire insurance rates
applicable to said premises shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein
stated and of the several items and charges in the fire insurance rates then
applicable to said premises. Tenant shall not place a load upon any floor of the
demised premises exceeding the floor load per square foot area which it was
designed to carry and which is allowed by law. Owner reserves the right to
prescribe the weight and position of all safes, business machines and mechanical
equipment. Such installations shall be placed and maintained by Tenant, at
Tenant's expense, in settings sufficient, in Owner's judgement, to absorb and
prevent vibration, noise and annoyance. The Tenant shall not be liable for all
of the laws, ordinances, regulations, etc. . ., in which the demised premises is
in violation if the violation is not a direct result of Tenant's use or manner
of use thereof.

Subordination:    7.  This lease is subject and subordinate to all ground or 
                  underlying leases and to all mortgages which may now or 
hereafter affect such leases or the real property of which demised premises 
are a part and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and 
extensions of any such underlying leases and mortgages. This clause shall be 
self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be required by 
any ground or underlying lessor or by any mortgagee, affecting any lease or the 
real property of which the demised premises are a part. In confirmation of such 
subordination, Tenant shall execute promptly any certificate that Owner may 
request.
                                                                             
Property-         8.  Owner or its agents shall not be liable for any damage 
Loss, Damage,     to property of Tenant or of others entrusted to employees
Reimburse-        of the building, nor for loss of or damage to any property
ment, Indem-      of Tenant by theft or otherwise, nor for any injury or damage
nity:             to persons or property resulting from any cause of whatsoever 
                  nature, unless caused by or due to the negligence of Owner, 
its agents, servants or employees. Owner or its agents will not be liable for 
any such damage caused by other tenants or persons in, upon or about said 
building or caused by operations in construction of any private, public or quasi
public work.

 If at any time any windows of the demised premises are temporarily 
closed, darkened or bricked up (or permanently closed, darkened or bricked up, 
if required by law) for any reason whatsoever including, but not limited to 
Owner's own acts, Owner shall not be liable for any damage Tenant may sustain
thereby and Tenant shall not be entitled to any compensation therefor nor 
abatement or diminution of rent nor shall the same release Tenant from its 
obligations hereunder nor constitute an eviction. Tenant shall indemnify and 
save harmless Owner against and from all liabilities, obligations, damages, 
penalties, claims, costs and expenses for which Owner shall not be reimbursed by
insurance, including reasonable attorneys fees, paid, suffered or incurred as a 
result of any breach by Tenant, Tenant's agents, contractors, employees, 
invitees, or licensees, of any covenant or condition of this lease, or the 
carelessness, negligence or improper conduct of the Tenant, Tenant's agents, 
contractors, employees, invitees or licensees. Tenant's liability under this 
lease extends to the acts and omissions of any sub-tenant, and any agent, 
contractor, employee, invitee or licensee of any sub-tenant. In case any action 
or proceeding is brought against Owner by reason of any such claim, Tenant, 
upon written notice from Owner, will, at Tenant's expense, resist or defend 
such action or proceeding by counsel approved by Owner in writing, such 
approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

Destruction,      9.  (a) If the demised premises or any part thereof shall be
Fire and Other    damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give 
Casualty:         immediate notice thereof to Owner and this lease shall 
                  continue in full force and effect except as hereinafter set 
forth. (b) If the demised premises are partially damaged or rendered partially 
unusable by fire or other casualty, the damages and additional rents thereto 
shall be repaired by and at the expense of Owner and the rent, until such repair
shall be substantially completed, shall be apportioned from the day following 
the casualty according to the  part of the premises which is usable. (c) If 
the demised premises are totally damaged or rendered wholly unusable by fire 
or other casualty, then the rent shall be proportionately paid up to the time
of the casualty and thenceforth shall cease until the date when the premises 
shall have been repaired and restored by Owner, subject to Owner's right to 
elect not to restore the same as hereinafter provided. (d) If the demised 
premises are rendered wholly unusable or (whether or not the demised premises
are damaged in whole or in part) if the building shall be so damaged that Owner
shall decide to demolish it or to rebuild it, then, in any of such events, Owner
may elect to terminate this lease by written notice to Tenant, given within 90
days after such fire or casualty, specifying a date for the expiration of the
lease, which date shall not be more than 60 days after the giving of such
notice, and upon the date specified in such notice the term of this lease shall
expire as fully and completely as if such date were the date set forth above for
the termination of this lease and Tenant shall forthwith quit, surrender and
vacate the premises without prejudice however, to Landlord's rights and remedies
against Tenant under the lease provisions in effect prior to such termination,
and any rent owing shall be paid up to such date and any payments of rent made
by Tenant which were on account of any period subsequent to such date shall be
returned to Tenant. Unless Owner shall serve a termination notice as provided
for herein, Owner shall make the repairs and restorations under the conditions
of (b) and (c) hereof, with all reasonable expedition, subject to delays due to
adjustment of insurance claims, labor troubles and causes beyond Owner's
control. After any such casualty, Tenant shall cooperate with Owner's
restoration by removing from the premises as promptly as reasonably possible,
all of Tenant's salvageable inventory and movable equipment, furniture, and
other property. Tenant's liability for rent shall resume ten (10) days after
written notice from Owner that the premises are substantially ready for Tenant's
occupancy. (e) Nothing contained hereinabove shall relieve Tenant from liability
that may exist as a result of damage from fire or other casualty.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall look first to any insurance in
its favor before making any claim against the other party for recovery for loss
or damage resulting from fire or other casualty, and to the extent that such
insurance is in force and collectible and to the extent permitted by law, Owner
and Tenant each hereby releases and waives all right of recovery against the
other or any one claiming through or under each of them by way of subrogation or
otherwise. The foregoing release and waiver shall be in force only if both
releasors' insurance policies contain a clause providing that such a release or
waiver shall not invalidate the insurance. If, and to the extent, that such
waiver can be obtained only by the payment of additional premiums, then the
party benefitting from the waiver shall pay such premium within ten days after
written demand or shall be deemed to have agreed that the party obtaining
insurance coverage shall be free of any further obligation under the provisions
hereof with respect to waiver of subrogation. Tenant acknowledges that Owner
will not carry insurance on Tenant's furniture and/or furnishings or any
fixtures or equipment, improvements, or appurtenances removable by Tenant and
agrees that Owner will not be obligated to repair any damage thereto or replace
the same. (f) Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 227 of the Real
Property Law and agrees that the provisions of this article shall govern and
control in lieu thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Tenant shall be entitled to cancel and terminate this Lease if Owner
fails to completely repair and restore the Premises within six (6) months of the
date that such damage occurs.

Eminent           10.  If the whole or any part of the demised premises shall
Domain:           be acquired or condemned by Eminent Domain for any public or 
                  quasi public use or purpose, then and in that event, the term 
of this lease shall cease and terminate from the date of title vesting in such 
proceeding and Tenant shall have no claim for the value of any unexpired term of
said lease and assigns to Owner, Tenant's entire interest in any such award 1 
and all rents and additional rents shall be prorated as of such date.

Assignment,       11.  Tenant, for itself, its heirs, distributees, executors,
Mortgage,         administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns,
Etc.:             expressly covenants that it shall not assign, mortgage or 
encumber this agreement, nor underlet, or suffer or permit the demised premises 
or any part thereof to be used by others, without the prior written consent of 
Owner which shall not be unreasonably withheld in each instance. Transfer of the
majority of the stock of a corporate Tenant shall be deemed an assignment. If 
this lease be assigned, or if the demised premises or any part thereof be 
underlet or occupied by anybody other than Tenant, Owner may, after default by 
Tenant, collect rent from the assignee, under-tenant or occupant, and apply the 
net amount collected to the rent herein reserved, but no such assignment, 
underletting, occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of this covenant,
or the acceptance of the assignee, under-tenant or occupant as tenant, or a 
release of Tenant from the further performance by Tenant of covenants on the 
part of Tenant herein contained. The consent by Owner to an assignment or 
underletting shall not in any wise be construed to relieve Tenant from obtaining
the express consent in writing of Owner to any further assignment or 
underletting.

Electric          12.  Rates and conditions in respect to submetering or     
Current:          rent inclusion, as the case may be, to be added in RIDER   
(Symbol           attached hereto. Tenant covenants and agrees that at all
appears here)     times its use of electric current shall not exceed the 
                  capacity of existing feeders to the building or the risers or 
wiring installation and Tenant may not use any electrical equipment which, in 
Owner's opinion, reasonably exercised, will overload such installations or 
interfere with the use thereof by other tenants of the building. The change at 
any time of the character of electric service shall in no wise make Owner liable
or responsible to Tenant, for any loss, damages or expenses which Tenant may 
sustain.

Access to         13.  Owner or Owner's agents shall have the right (but shall 
Premises:         not be obligated) to enter the demised premises in any
                  emergency at any time, and, at other reasonable times, to 
examine the same and to make such repairs, replacements and improvements as 
Owner may deem necessary and reasonably desirable to the demised premises or to 
any other portion of the building or which Owner may elect to perform. Tenant 
shall permit Owner to use and maintain and replace pipes and conduits in and 
through the demised premises and to erect new pipes and conduits therein 
provided they are concealed within the walls, floor, or ceiling. Owner may, 
during the progress of any work in the demised premises, take all necessary 
materials and equipment into said premises without the same constituting an 
eviction nor shall the Tenant be entitled to any abatement of rent while such 
work is in progress, nor to any damages by reason of loss or interruption of 
business or otherwise. Throughout the term hereof Owner shall have the right 
to enter the demised premises on reasonable notice to Tenant, (except in the 
case of an emergency) at reasonable hours for the purpose of showing the 
<PAGE>
 
same to prospective purchasers or mortgages of the building, and during the last
six months of the term for the purpose of showing the same to prospective 
tenants. Provided the Owner shall, at all times use its reasonable efforts to 
minimize the disruption and interference to Tenant's business from Owner's 
entry. If Tenant is not present to open and permit an entry into the premises, 
Owner or Owner's agents may enter the same whenever such entry may be necessary 
or permissible by master key or forcibly and provided reasonable care is 
exercised to safeguard Tenant's property, such entry shall not render Owner or 
its agents liable therefor, nor in any event shall the obligations of Tenant 
hereunder be affected. If during the last month of the term Tenant shall have 
removed all or substantially all of Tenant's property therefrom Owner may 
immediately enter, alter, renovate or redecorate the demised premises without 
limitation or abatement of rent, or incurring liability to Tenant for any 
compensation and such act shall have no effect on this lease or Tenant's 
obligations hereunder.

Vault,        14. No Vaults, vault space or area, whether or not enclosed or
Vault Space,  covered, not within the property line of the building is leased
Area:         hereunder, anything contained in or indicated on any sketch, blue
              print or plan, or anything contained elsewhere in this lease to
the contrary notwithstanding. Owner makes no representation as to the location
of the property line of the building. All vaults and vault space and all such
areas not within the property line of the building, which Tenant may be
permitted to use and/or occupy, is to be used and/or occupied under a revocable
license, and if any such license be revoked, or if the amount of such space or
area be diminished or required by any federal, state or municipal authority or
public ability, Owner shall not be subject to any liability nor shall Tenant be
entitled to any compensation or diminution or abatement of rent, nor shall such
revocation, diminution or requisition be deemed constructive or actual eviction.
Any tax, fee or charge of municipal authorities for such vault or area shall be
paid by Tenant to the extent such Vault Area is actually used by Tenant.

Occupancy:    15. Tenant will not at any time use or occupy the demised premises
              in violation of the certificate of occupancy issued for the
building of which the demised premises are a part. Tenant has inspected the
premises and accepts them as is, subject to the riders annexed hereto with
respect to Owner's work, if any. In any event, Owner makes no representation as
to the condition of the premises and Tenant agrees to accept the same subject to
violations, whether or not of record.

(b) it is stipulated and agreed that in the event of the termination of this 
lease pursuant to (a) hereof, Owner shall forthwith, notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this lease to the contrary, be entitled to recover from Tenant as 
and for liquidated damages an amount equal to the difference between the rent 
reserved hereunder for the unexpired portion of the term demised and the fair 
and reasonable rental value of the demised premises for the same period. In the 
computation of such damages the difference between any installment of rent 
becoming due hereunder after the date of termination and the fair and reasonable
rental value of the demised premises for the period for which such installment 
was payable shall be discounted to the date of termination at the rate of four 
percent (4%) per annum. If such premises or any part thereof be relet by the 
Owner for the unexpired term of said lease, or any part thereof, before 
presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any court, commission or 
tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall be deemed to be 
the fair and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the premises 
so re-let during the term of the re-letting. Nothing herein contained shall 
limit or prejudice the right of the Owner to prove for and obtain as liquidated 
damages by reason of such termination, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by
any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the 
proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved, whether or not such amount 
be greater, equal to, or less than the amount of the difference referred to 
above.

Default:      17. (1) If Tenant defaults in fulfilling any of the covenants of
              this lease other than the covenants for the payment of rent or
additional rent; or if the demised premises become vacant or deserted; or if any
execution or attachment shall be issued against Tenant or any of Tenant's
property whereupon the demised premises shall be taken or occupied by someone
other than Tenant; or if this lease be rejected under (SS)235 of Title 11 of the
U.S. Code (bankruptcy code); or if Tenant shall fail to move into or take
possession of the premises within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of
the term of this lease, then, in any one or more of such events, upon Owner
serving a written ten (10) days notice upon Tenant specifying the nature of said
default and upon the expiration of said ten (10) days, if Tenant shall have
failed to comply with or remedy such default, or if the said default or omission
complained of shall be of a nature that the same cannot be completely cured or
remedied within said ten (10) day period, and if Tenant shall not have
diligently commenced curing such default within such ten (10) day period, and
shall not thereafter with reasonable diligence and in good faith, proceed to
remedy or cure such default, then Owner may serve a written three (3) days'
notice of cancellation of this lease upon Tenant, and upon the expiration of
said three (3) days this lease and the term thereunder shall end and expire as
fully and completely as if the expiration of such three (3) day period were the
day herein definitely fixed for the end and expiration of this lease and the
term thereof and Tenant shall then quit and surrender the demised premises to
Owner but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided.

(2) If the notice provided for in (1) hereof shall have been given, and the term
shall expire as aforesaid; or if Tenant shall make default in the payment of the
rent reserved herein or any item of additional rent herein mentioned or any part
of either or in making any other payment herein required then and in any of such
events Owner may without notice, re-enter the demised premises either by force 
or otherwise, and dispossess Tenant by summary proceedings or otherwise, and the
legal representative of Tenant or other occupant of demised premises and remove 
their effects and hold the premises as if this lease had not been made, and 
Tenant hereby waives the service of notice of intention to re-enter or to 
institute legal proceedings to that end. If Tenant shall make default hereunder 
prior to the date fixed as the commencement of any renewal or extension of this 
lease, Owner may cancel and terminate such renewal or extension agreement by 
written notice.

Remedies of   18. In case of any such default, re-entry, expiration and/or
Owner and     dispossess by summary proceedings or otherwise, (a) the rent shall
Waiver of     become due thereupon and be paid up to the time of such re-entry,
Redemption:   dispossess and/or expiration, (b) Owner may re-let the premises or
              any part or parts thereof, either in the name of Owner or
otherwise, for a term or terms, which may at Owner's option be less than or
exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term
of this lease and may grant concessions or free rent or charge a higher rental
than that in this lease, and/or (c) Tenant or the legal representatives of
Tenant shall also pay Owner as liquidated damages for the failure of Tenant to
observe and perform said Tenant's convenants herein contained, any deficiency
between the rent hereby reserved and/or covenanted to be paid and the net
amount, if any, of the rents collected on account of the lease or leases of the
demised premises for each month of the period which would otherwise have
constituted the balance of the term of this lease. The failure of Owner to re-
let the premises or any part or parts thereof shall not release or affect
Tenant's liability for damages. In computing such liquidated damages there shall
be added to the said deficiency such expenses as Owner may incur in connection
with re-letting, such as legal expenses, attorneys' fees, brokerage, advertising
and for keeping the demised premises in good order or for preparing the same for
re-letting. Any such liquidated damages shall be paid in monthly installments by
Tenant on the rent day specified in this lease and any suit brought to collect
the amount of the deficiency for any month shall not prejudice in any way the
rights of Owner to collect the dificiency for any subsequent month by a similar
proceeding. Owner, in putting the demised premises in good order or preparing
the same for re-rental may, at Owner's option, make such alterations, repairs,
replacements, and/or decorations in the demised premises as Owner, in Owner's
reasonable judgement, considers advisable and necessary for the purpose of re-
letting the demised premises, and the making of such alterations, repairs,
replacements, and/or decorations shall not operate or be construed to release
Tenant from liability hereunder as aforesaid. Owner shall in no event be liable
in any way whatsoever for failure to re-let the demised premises, or in the
event that the demised premises are re-let, for failure to collect the rent
thereof under such re-letting, and in no event shall Tenant be entitled to
receive any excess, if any, of such net rents collected over the sums payable by
Tenant to Owner hereunder. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Tenant of any of the covenants or provisions hereof, Owner shall have the right
of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as
if re--entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided
for. Mention in this lease of any particular remedy, shall not preclude Owner
from any other remedy, in law or in equity. Tenant hereby expressly waives any
and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in
the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event
of Owner obtaining possession of demised premises, by reason of the violation by
Tenant of any of the covenants and conditions of this lease, or otherwise.

Fees and      19. If Tenant shall default in the observance or performance of
Expenses:     any term or covenant on Tenant's part to be observed or performed
              under or by virtue of any of the terms or provisions in any 
article of this lease, then, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this lease,
Owner may upon five (5) days' written notice to Tenant immediately or at any
time thereafter perform the obligation of Tenant thereunder. If Owner, in
connection with the foregoing or in connection with any default by Tenant in the
covenant to pay rent hereunder, makes any expenditures or incurs any obligations
for the payment of money, including but not limited to attorney's fees, in
instituting, prosecuting or defending any action or proceeding, then Tenant will
reimburse Owner for such sums so paid or obligations incurred with interest and
costs. The foregoing expenses incurred by reason of Tenant's default shall be
deemed to be additional rent hereunder and shall be paid by Tenant to Owner
within five (5) days of rendition of any bill or statement to Tenant therefor.
If Tenant's lease term shall have expired at the time of making of such
expenditures or incurring of such obligations, such sums shall be recoverable by
Owner as damages.

Building      20. Owner shall have the right at any time without the same
Alterations   constituting an eviction and without incurring liability to Tenant
and           therefor to change the arrangement and/or location of public
Management:   entrances, passageways, doors, doorways, corridors, elevators,
              stairs, toilets or other public parts of the building and to 
change the name, number or designation by which the building may be known. 
There shall be no allowance to Tenant for diminution of rental value and no 
liability on the part of Owner by reason of inconvenience, annoyance or injury 
to business arising from Owner or other Tenants making any repairs in the 
building or any such alterations, additions and improvements. Furthermore, 
Tenant shall not have any claim against Owner by reason of Owner's imposition of
such controls of the manner of access to the building by Tenant's social or 
business visitors as the Owner may deem necessary for the security of the 
building and its occupants.

No Repre-     21. Neither Owner nor Owners's agents have made any
sentations    representations or promises with respect to the physical condition
by Owner:     of the building, the land upon which

*Then, and in any of such events, Owner shall in accordance with the appropriate
legal procedures and proceedings, pursue its legal and equitable remedies 
against Tenant.

it is erected or the demised premises, the rents, leases, expenses of operation 
or any other matter or thing affecting or related to the premises except as 
herein expressly set forth and no rights, easements or licenses are acquired by 
Tenant by implication or otherwise except as expressly set forth in the 
provisions of this lease. Tenant has inspected the building and the demised 
premises and is thoroughly acquainted with their condition and agrees to take 
the same "as is" and acknowledges that the taking of possesion of the demised 
premises by Tenant shall be conclusive evidence that the said premises and the 
building of which the same form a part were in good and satisfactory condition 
at the time such possession was so taken, except as to latent defects. All 
understandings and agreements heretofore made between the parties hereto are 
merged in this contract, which alone fully and completely expresses the 
agreement between Owner and Tenant and any executory agreement hereafter made 
shall be ineffective to change, modify, discharge or effect an abandonment of it
in whole or in part, unless such executory agreement is in writing and signed by
the party against whom enforcement of the change, modification, discharge or 
abandonment is sought.

End of        22. Upon the expiration or other termination of the term of this
Term:         lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender to Owner the demised 
              premises, broom clean, in good order and condition, ordinary wear 
and and damages which Tenant is not required to repair 
as provided elsewhere in this lease excepted, and Tenant shall remove all its 
property. Tenant's obligation to observe or perform this covenant shall survive 
the expiration or other termination of this lease. If the last day of the term 
of this Lease or any renewal thereof, falls on Sunday, this lease shall expire 
at noon on the preceding Saturday unless it be a legal holiday in which case it
shall expire at noon on the preceding business day.

Quiet         23. Owner covenants and agrees with Tenant that upon Tenant paying
Enjoyment:    the rent and additional rent and observing and performing all the 
              terms, covenants and conditions, on Tenant's part to be observed 
and performed, Tenant may peaceably and quietly enjoy the premises hereby 
demised, subject, nevertheless, to the terms and conditions of this lease 
including, but not limited to, Article 31 hereof and to the ground leases, 
underlying leases and mortgages hereinbefore mentioned.

Failure       24. If Owner is unable to give possession of the demised premises
to Give       on the date of the commencement of the term hereof, because of the
Possession:   holding-over or retention of possession of any tenant, undertenant
              or occupants or if the demised premises are located in a building 
being constructed, because such building has not been sufficiently completed to 
make the premises ready for occupancy or because of the fact that a certificate 
of occupancy has not been procured or for any other reason, Owner shall not be 
subject to any liability for failure to give possession on said date and the 
validity of the lease shall not be impaired under such circumstances, nor shall 
the same be construed in any wise to extend the term of this lease, but the rent
payable hereunder shall be abated (provided Tenant is not responsible for 
Owner's inability to obtain possession) until after Owner shall have given 
Tenant written notice that the premises are substantially ready for Tenant's 
occupancy. if permission is given to Tenant to enter into the possession of the 
demised premises or to occupy premises other than the demised premises prior to 
the date specified as the commencement of the term of this lease, Tenant 
covenants and agrees that such occupancy shall be deemed to be under all the 
terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this lease, except as to the 
covenant to pay rent. The provisions of this article are intended to constitute 
"an express provision to the contrary" within the meaning of Section 223-a of 
the New York Real Property Law.

No Waiver:    25. The failure of Owner to seek redress for violation of, or to 
              insist upon the strict performance of any covenant or condition of
this lease or of any of the Rules or Regulations, set forth or hereafter adopted
by Owner, shall not prevent a subsequent act which would have originally 
constituted a violation from having all the force and effect of an original 
violation. The receipt by Owner of rent with knowledge of the breach of any 
covenant of this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach and no 
provision of this lease shall be deemed to have been waived by Owner or Tenant
unless such waiver be in writing signed by Owner or Tenant. No payment by Tenant
or receipt by Owner of a lesser amount than the monthly rent herein stipulated 
shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated rent, 
nor shall any endorsement or statement of any check or any letter accompanying 
any check or payment as rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Owner may
accept such check or payment without prejudice to Owner's right to recover the 
balance of such rent or pursue any other remedy in this lease provided. No act 
or thing done by Owner or Owner's agents during the term hereby demised
shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of said premises, and no agreement 
to accept such surrender shall be valid unless in writing signed by Owner. No 
employee of Owner or Owner's agent shall have any power to accept the keys of 
said premises prior to the termination of the lease and the delivery of keys to 
any such agent or employee shall not operate as a termination of the lease or a 
surrender of the premises.

Waiver of     26. It is mutually agreed by and between Owner and Tenant that the
Trial by      respective parties hereto shall and they hereby do waive trial by
Jury:         in any action, proceeding or counter-claim brought by either of
              the parties hereto against the other (except for personal injury 
or property damage) on any matters whatsoever arising out of or in any way
connected with this lease, the relationship of Owner and Tenant, Tenant's use of
or occupancy of said premises, and any emergency statutory or any other
statutory remedy. It is further mutually agreed that in the event Owner
commences any summary proceeding for possession of the premises, Tenant will not
interpose any counterclaim of whatever nature or description in any such
proceeding including a counterclaim under Article 4.

Inability to  27. This Lease and the obligation of Tenant to pay rent hereunder
Perform:      and perform all of the other covenants and agreements hereunder on
              part of Tenant to be performed shall in no wise be affected, 
impaired or excused because Owner is unable to fulfill any of its obligations 
under this lease or to supply or is delayed in supplying any service expressly 
or impliedly to be supplied or is unable to make, or is delayed in making any 
repair, additions, alterations or decorations or is unable to supply or is 
delayed in supplying any equipment or fixtures if Owner is prevented or delayed 
from so doing by reason of strike or labor troubles or any cause whatsoever 
including, but not limited to, government preemption in connection with a 
National Emergency or by reason of any rule, order or regulation of any 
department or subdivision thereof of any government agency or by reason of the 
conditions of supply and demand which have been or are affected by war or other 
emergency.

Bills and     28. Except as otherwise in this lease provided, a bill, statement,
Notices:      notice or communication which Owner may desire or be required to 
              give to Tenant, shall be deemed sufficiently given or rendered if,
in writing, delivered to Tenant personally or sent by registered or certified 
mail addressed to Tenant at the building of which the demised premises form a 
part or at the last known residence address or business address of Tenant or 
left at any of the aforesaid premises addressed to Tenant, and the time of the 
rendition of such bill or statement and of the giving of such notice or 
communication shall be deemed to be the time when the same is delivered to 
Tenant, mailed, or left at the premises as herein provided. Any notice by Tenant
to Owner must be served by registered or certified mail addressed to Owner at 
the address first hereinabove given or at such other address as Owner shall 
designate by written notice.

Provided by   of this lease. Owner shall provide: (a) necessary elevator
Owners        facilities on business days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have one 
              elevator subject to call at all other times; (b) heat to the 
demised premises when and as required by law, on business days from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; (c) water for ordinary lavatory purposes, but if Tenant uses or consumes
water for any other purposes or in unusual quantities (of which fact Owner shall
be the sole judge), Owner may install a water meter at Tenant's expense which 
Tenant shall thereafter maintain at Tenant's expense in good working order and 
repair to register such water consumption and Tenant shall pay for water 
consumed as shown on said meter as additional rent as and when bills are 
rendered; Tenant shall pay Owner the cost of removal of any of Tenant's refuse 
and rubbish from the building; (f) Owner reserves the right to stop services of 
the heating, elevators, plumbing, air-conditioning, power systems or cleaning or
other services, if any, when necessary by reason of accident or for repairs, 
alterations, replacements or improvements necessary or desirable in the judgment
of Owner for as long as may be reasonably required by reason thereof. If the 
building of which the demised premises are a part supplies manually-operated 
elevator service, Owner at any time may substitute automatic-control elevator 
service and upon ten days' written notice to Tenant, proceed with alterations 
necessary therefor without in any wise affecting this lease or the obligation of
Tenant hereunder. The same shall be done with a minimum of inconvenience to 
Tenant and Owner shall pursue the alteration with due diligence.

37.       RIDER PROVISIONS PREVAIL:
          -------------------------

          If and to the extent that any of the provisions of this Rider conflict
or are otherwise inconsistent with any of the preceding printed provisions of
this lease, or of the Rules and Regulations attached to this lease, whether or
not such inconsistency is expressly noted in this Rider, the provisions of this
Rider shall prevail, and in case of inconsistency with said Rules and
Regulations, shall be deemed a waiver of such Rules and Regulations with respect
to Tenant to the extent of such inconsistency.

38.       ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS:
          -----------------------

          For the purposes of this lease and all agreements supplemental to this
lease, and all communications with respect thereto, unless the context otherwise
requires:

          1.   The term "fixed rent" shall mean rent at the annual rental
rate or rates provided for in the granting clause appearing at the beginning of
this lease.

          2.   The term "additional rent" shall mean all sums of money, other
than fixed rent, and which becomes due and payable from Tenant to Landlord
hereunder, and Landlord shall have the same remedies therefor as for a default
in payment of fixed rent.

          3.   The term "rent" and "rents" shall mean and include fixed rent
and/or additional rent hereunder.

          4.   The terms "Commencement Date" and "Expiration Date" shall mean
the dates fixed in this lease, or to be determined pursuant to the provisions of
this lease, respectively, as the beginning and the end of the term for which the
demised premises are hereby leased.

39.       ESCALATION FOR INCREASE IN REAL ESTATE TAX:
          --------------------------------------------

          A.   As used herein:

          1.   "Real Property" shall mean the land and buildings presently
designated as Section 4, Block 994, Lot 54 of the Tax Map of the County of New
York.

          2.   "Taxes" shall mean the real estate taxes and assessments
imposed upon the Real Property. Penalties and interest on Taxes and income,
franchise, transfer, inheritance and capital stock taxes shall be deemed
excluded from the term Taxes for the purposes hereof. However, if and to the
extent that, due to a change in the method of assessment of taxation, any
franchise, capital stock, capital, rents, income, profits or other tax or charge
shall be substituted in whole or in part for the Taxes now or hereafter imposed
upon the Real Property, such franchise, capital stock, capital, rents, income,
profits or other tax or charge, computed as if Landlord owned or operated no
property other than the Real Property, shall be deemed included in the term
"Taxes" for the purposes hereof.

          3.   "Tax Year" shall mean each period of twelve (12) months
commencing on the first day of July of each such period, in which occurs any
part of the term of this lease or such other period of twelve (12) months
occurring during the term of this lease as hereafter may be duly adopted as the
fiscal year for real estate tax purposes of the City of New York.

          4.   "Base Tax" shall mean the Taxes for the Calendar 1995 (the "Base
Tax Year").

                                     - 1 -
<PAGE>
 
          B.   If the Taxes for any Tax Year shall be greater than the Base Tax,
Tenant shall pay as additional rent for such Tax Year a sum equal to 2.5    % of
                                                                            --  
the amount by which the Taxes for such Tax Year are greater than the Base Tax
(which amount is hereinafter called the "Tax Payment"). Should this lease
commence or terminate prior to the expiration of a Tax Year, such Tax Payment
shall be prorated to, and shall be payable on, or as and when ascertained after,
the Commencement Date or the Expiration Date as the case may be. Tenant's
obligation to pay such additional rent and Landlord's obligation to refund
pursuant to Paragraph C below, as the case may be, shall survive the termination
of this lease. If the Taxes for any Tax Year subsequent to the Base Tax Year, or
an installment thereof, shall be reduced before such Taxes, or such installment,
shall be paid, the amount of Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses of
obtaining such reduction (but not exceeding the amount of such reduction) shall
be added to and be deemed part of the Taxes for such Tax Year. Payment of
additional rent for any Tax Payment due from Tenant shall be made as and subject
to the conditions hereinafter provided in this Article.

          C.   Landlord shall be under no obligation to contest the Taxes of
the assessed valuation of the Real Property for any Tax Year or to refrain from
contesting the same, and may settle any such contest on such terms as Landlord
in its sole judgement considers proper. If Landlord shall receive a refund for
any Tax Year for which a Tax Payment shall have been made by Tenant pursuant to
Paragraph B above, Landlord shall repay to Tenant, with reasonable promptness,
2.5     % of such refund after deducting from such refund the reasonable costs
- --------
and expenses (including experts' and attorneys' fees) of obtaining such refund.
If the assessment for the Base Tax Year shall be reduced from the amount
originally imposed after Landlord shall have rendered a comparative statement
(as provided in Paragraph D below) to Tenant with respect to a Tax Year, the
amount of the Tax Payment shall be adjusted in accordance with such change and
Tenant, on Landlord's demand, shall pay any increase in additional rent
resulting from such adjustment.

          D.   At any time during a Tax Year after the Taxes for such Tax
Year become known Landlord may, or else with reasonable promptness after the end
of each Tax Year, Landlord shall render to Tenant a comparative statement
showing the amount of the Base Tax, the amount of the Taxes for such Tax Year
and the Tax Payment, if any, due from Tenant for such Tax Year, indicating
thereon in reasonable detail the computation of such Tax Payment. The Tax
Payment shown on such comparative statement may, at Landlord's option, be
payable in full or in such installments (not more frequent than monthly) as
Landlord may determine. Tenant shall pay the amount of the Tax Payment shown on
such comparative statement (or the balance of a proportionate installment
thereof, if only an installment is involved) concurrently with the installment
of fixed rent then or next due, or if such statement shall be rendered at or
after the termination of this lease within thirty (30) days of such rendition,
whenever so requested, but not more than once a year, Landlord will furnish
Tenant with a reproduced copy of the bill (or receipted bill) for the Taxes for
the current or next preceding Tax Year.

          E.   Landlord's failure during the lease term to prepare and
deliver any notice, statement or bill, or Landlord's failure to make a demand,
shall not in any way cause Landlord to forfeit or surrender Landlord's right to
collect any additional rent which may have become due during the term of this
lease under this Article and Tenant's liability for amounts due under this
Article shall survive the termination of this lease.

40.       As used in this Article, the words and terms which follow mean and
include the following:

          A.   "Calendar Year" shall mean each calendar year, subsequent to
               ---------------                                            
the base year in which occurs any part of the term of this Lease.

<PAGE>
 
          B.   "Base Year" shall mean the year January 1, 1995 to December
               ------------                                 --

          C.   "Area of the Premises" shall mean the rentable square foot
               -----------------------                                   
area of the Demised Premises (which the parties have agreed shall be  4,315
                                                                      -----
square feet for the purposes of this Article.)

          D.   "Hourly Wage Rate" as respects any Operation Year shall mean
               -------------------                                         
the minimum hourly wage prescribed to be paid to the workers described below,
appropriately adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in fringe benefits
required by law or applicable labor agreements and computed on an hourly basis,
in major office buildings (hereinafter called "Class A Office Building") and in
effect as of January 1 in such Operation Year (or if such rate and/or benefits
shall be subject to change during an Operation Year then the average thereof for
such Operation Year as reasonably estimated or calculated by Landlord) pursuant
to an agreement between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations,
Incorporated (or any successor thereto) and Local 32B of the Service Employees
International Union, AFL-CIO (or any successor thereto) covering the wage rates
of those workers classified as "Others" (or any successor or equivalent
designation) in Class A Office Buildings which said minimum hourly wage rates
shall be computed on the basis of the total weekly amount required to be paid to
said workers in the building for regular work weeks (exclusive of any overtime
or premium pay work in such regular work weeks). Such total weekly amounts shall
be inclusive of all payments and benefits of every nature and kind (including
those required to be paid by the employer directly to the taxing authorities or
others on account of the employment) such as, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, social security, unemployment and all other similar taxes,
holiday and vacation pay, incentive pay, accident, health and welfare, insurance
programs, pension plans, guarantee pay plans and supplemental unemployment
benefit programs, and fringe benefits, payments, plans or programs or a similar
or dissimilar nature, irrespective of whether they may be required or provided
for in any applicable law or regulation or otherwise. If there is no such
agreement in effect as of any such January 1 by which the Hourly Wage Rate is
determinable, computations and payments shall thereupon be made upon the basis
of the Hourly Wage Rate being paid by the Landlord or by the contractor
performing the cleaning services for Landlord on such January 1 for the porters
or cleaners, as the case may be, and appropriate retroactive adjustment shall
thereafter be made when the Hourly Wage Rate paid on such January 1 pursuant to
such agreement for said workers is finally determined and provided further that
if as of the last day of such Operation Year no such agreement covering the
January 1 occurring in such Operation Year shall have been in effect, the Hourly
Wage Rate paid by the Landlord or by the contractor performing the cleaning
services for Landlord on such January 1 for porters and cleaners shall be for
all purposes hereof deemed to be such Hourly Wage Rate prescribed by such
agreement between said Board (or any successor thereto) and said Union (or any
successor thereto) for such Operation Year.

          E.   "Labor Rate" for any Operation Year shall mean the Hourly Wage
               -------------                                                 
Rate for workers classified as "Others".

          F.   "Base Labor Rate" shall mean the Labor Rate for Base Year.
               ------------------                                  

          G.   "Escalation Statement" shall mean statement in writing signed
               -----------------------                                      
by Landlord, setting forth the amount payable by Tenant for a specified
Operation Year pursuant to this Article.

          H.   "Operation Year" shall mean each calendar year or portion of
               -----------------                                           
year subsequent to the Base Year in which occurs any part of the term of this
lease.

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>
 
          1.   If the Labor Rate for any Operation Year shall be greater than
the Base Labor Rate, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent for the
Demised Premises for such Operation Year an amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying the Area of the Premises by one (1) times the number of cents
(including any fraction of a cent) by which the Labor Rate for such Operation
Year exceeds the Base Labor Rate.

          2.   Any such adjustment payable shall commence as of the first day
of the relevant Operation Year and, after Landlord shall furnish Tenant with an
Escalation Statement relating to such Operation Year, all monthly installments
of rental shall reflect one-twelfth of the annual amount of such adjustment
until a new adjustment becomes effective pursuant to the provisions of this
Article, provided however, that if said Escalation Statement is furnished to
Tenant after the commencement of such Operation Year, there shall be promptly
paid by Tenant to Landlord, an amount equal to the portion of such adjustment
allocable to the part of such Operation Year which shall elapse prior to the
first day of the calendar month next succeeding the calendar month in which said
Escalation Statement is furnished to Tenant.

          3.   In the event (F) that the date of the expiration or other
termination of this lease shall be a day other than the last day of an Operation
Year, or (F) of any increase or decrease in the Area of the Demised Premises (as
may be provided herein), then in each such event in applying the provisions of
this Article with respect to any Operation Year in which such event shall have
occurred, appropriate adjustments shall be made to reflect the occurrence of
such event on a basis consistent with the principles underlying the provision of
this Article taking into consideration: (a) the portion of such Operation Year
which shall have elapsed prior to the date of such expiration or termination;
or, (b) in the case of any such increase or decrease, the portion of the Demised
Premises to which the same relate. Similarly, if the term of this lease shall
begin or end on a date which is not the first (with respect to term
commencement) or the last (with respect to expiration or termination) day of a
calendar month, appropriate adjustment shall be made to Basic Rent and
additional rent for the first or last month of the term, as the case may be, to
reflect the portion of a month falling within the term of this lease.

          4.   Payments shall be made pursuant to this Article
notwithstanding the fact that an Escalation Statement is furnished to Tenant
after the expiration of the term of this lease.

41.       CLEANING
          --------

          Tenant, at its expense, and in a manner satisfactory to Landlord,
shall cause the Demised Premises, including the exterior and interior of the
windows thereof, to be kept clean, Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense, remove all
Tenant's rubbish and trash to such area of the building as Landlord shall
designate. The Tenant agrees to employ such office cleaning and maintenance
contractor as the Landlord may from time to time designate for all cleaning,
waxing, polishing and maintenance work in the Demised Premises provided that the
charges therefor are reasonably comparable to the charges of other contractors
for such services. Tenant shall regularly, at Tenant's expense, but using such
contractor as Landlord may from time to time designate, clean the interior and
exterior of the windows in the Demised Premises. In no event shall the Tenant
employ any other such contractor or individual for any of the aforementioned
services without the Landlord's prior written consent.

42.       MAINTENANCE OF FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT:
          --------------------------------------

          Tenant, at Tenant's own cost and expense, shall maintain and keep in
good order and repair, all air conditioning equipment situated in the Demised
Premises and all other fixtures, including but not limited to ranges and
refrigerators, situated in the Demised Premises. Tenant shall be responsible for
any damage to said equipment and shall promptly repair same and/or replace same
with comparable equipment.

43.       AMENDING ARTICLE 11:
          --------------------

          Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 11, and in modification and
amplification thereof:

          A.   If Tenant's interest in this lease is assigned, whether or not in
violation of the provisions of this lease, Landlord may collect rent from the
assignee; if the demised premises or any part thereof are sublet to, or occupied
by, or used by, any person other than Tenant, whether or not in violation of
this lease, Landlord, after default by Tenant under this lease and expiration of
Tenant's time, if any, to cure such default, may collect rent from the
subtenant, user or occupant. In either case, Landlord shall apply the net amount
collected to the rents reserved in this lease, but neither any such assignment,
subletting, occupancy, nor use, nor any such collection or application shall be
deemed a waiver of any terms, covenants or conditions of this lease or the
acceptance by Landlord of such assignee, subtenant, occupant or user as tenant.
The consent by Landlord to any assignment, subletting, occupancy or use shall
not relieve Tenant from its obligation to obtain the express prior written
consent of Landlord to any further assignment, subletting, occupancy or use.
The listing of any name other than Tenant's on any door of the Demised Premises,
or on any directory, or on any elevator in the building, or otherwise, shall not
operate to vest in the party so named, any right or interest in this lease or in
the Demised Premises, or be deemed to constitute, or serve as a substitute for,
any prior written consent of Landlord required under this Article, and it is
understood that any such listing shall constitute a privilege extended by
Landlord which shall be revocable at Landlord's will by notice to Tenant. Tenant
agrees to pay to Landlord any reasonable counsel fees incurred by Landlord in
connection with any proposed assignment of Tenant's interest in this lease or
any proposed subletting of the Demised Premises or any part thereof. Neither any
assignment of Tenant's interest in this lease nor any subletting, occupancy or
use of the Demised Premises or any part thereof by any person other than Tenant,
nor any collection of rent by Landlord from any person other than Tenant as
provided in this Paragraph A, nor any application of any such rent as
aforementioned as provided in this Paragraph A, shall in any circumstances
relieve Tenant of Tenant's obligations fully to observe and perform the terms,
covenants and conditions of this lease on Tenant, part to be observed and
performed.

          B.   If Tenant shall desire to assign this lease or to sublet the
Demised Premises, Tenant shall submit to Landlord a written request for
Landlord's consent to such assignment or subletting, which request shall contain
or be accompanied by the following information: (i) the name and address of the
proposed assignee or subtenant; (ii) the terms and conditions of the proposed
assignment or subletting; (iii) the nature and character of the business of the
proposed assignee or subtenant and its proposed use of the Demised Premsies; and
(iv) banking, financial and other credit information with respect to the
proposed assignee or subtenant reasonably sufficient to enable Landlord to
determine the financial responsibility of the proposed assignee or subtenant.
Landlord shall then have the following options to be exercised by notice

          3.   The proposed sublease or assignment shall not be at a lower
rental rate than that being charged by Landlord at the time for similar space in
the building;

          4.   The proposed sublessee or assignee shall not be a tenant,
subtenant or assignee of any premises in the building; and

          5.   The proposed sublessee or assignee is a reputable party whose
financial net worth and financial responsibility is, considering the obligations

the obligations of Tenant under this lease and the further condition and
restriction that the sublease shall not be assigned, encumbered or otherwise

sublease shall permit only such use and occupancy as is permitted under this
lease.

          Further, Tenant may assign this lease in its entirety without the
consent of Landlord to any successor corporation (by consolidation or merger or
sale of substantially all of its assets) provided the assets and consolidated
net worth of such successor corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a pro
forma basis from the then most recent audited (by independent certified public
accountants) balance sheets of all corporations which shall have been merged or
consolidated with or into such successor corporation, shall not be less than the
assets and consolidated net worth of Tenant and its consolidated subsidiaries as
shown by Tenant's most recent audited (by independent certified

                                      - 6 -

the assignment or a counterpart or reproduced copy of the sublease shall have
been first delivered to the Landlord, and, in the event of an assignment, the
Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a written agreement executed and acknowledged
by the Tenant and such assignee in recordable form wherein such assignee shall
assume jointly and severally with Tenant the due performance of this lease on
Tenant's part to be performed to the full end of the term of this lease
notwithstanding any other or further assignment.

          F.   Any transfer by operation of law or otherwise, of Tenant's
interest in this lease or of a fifty (50%) percent or greater interest in Tenant
(whether stock, partnership interest or otherwise) shall be deemed an assignment

44.       SUPPLEMENTING ARTICLE 3:
          ------------------------

          Landlord's consent shall not be required for minor changes to the
Demised Premises such as painting and installation of cabinets and shelves. All
other renovations, decorations, additions, installations, improvements and/or
alterations of any kind or nature in the Demised Premises (herein "Tenant's
Changes") shall require the prior written consent of Landlord thereto, which, in
the case of non-structural interior Tenant's Changes, Landlord agrees not to
unreasonably withhold or delay. In granting its consent to any Tenant's Changes,
Landlord may impose such conditions (as to guarantee of completion, payment
restoration, and otherwise) as Landlord may reasonably require. In no event
shall Landlord be required to consent to any Tenant's Changes which would
physically affect any part of the building outside of the Demised Premises or
would adversely affect the proper functioning of the mechanical, electrical,
sanitary or other service systems of the building. At the time Tenant requests
Landlord's written consent to any Tenant's Changes, Tenant shall deliver to
Landlord detailed plans and specifications therefor. Tenant shall pay to
Landlord any reasonable fees or expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with
Landlord's submitting such plans and specifications, if it so chooses, to an
architect or engineer selected by Landlord for review or examination. Landlord's
approval of any plans or specifications does not relieve Tenant from the
responsibility for the legal sufficiency and technical competency thereof.

all federal, state and/or municipal authorities having jurisdiction over such

Insurance covering Landlord in limit of not less than ONE MILLION & 00/100

company approved by Landlord. Such policy shall be maintained at all times
during the progress of Tenant's Changes and until completion thereof, and shall
provide that no cancellation shall be effective unless ten (10) days prior
written notice has been given to Landlord.

and claims whatsoever in connection with Tenant's Changes. The cost of Tenant's
Changes shall be paid for in cash or its equivalent, so that the Demised
Premises and the Real Property shall at all times be free of liens for labor and
materials supplied or claimed to have been supplied.

          Tenant, at its expense, shall cause any Tenant's Changes consented to
by Landlord to be performed in compliance with all applicable requirements of
insurance bodies having jurisdiction and in such manner as not to interfere
with, delay or impose any additional expense upon the Landlord in the
maintenance or operation of the building and so as to maintain harmonious labor
relations in the building.

          Notwithstanding the provisions of Article #3, Tenant shall not be
required to restore the Demised Premises to its condition prior to the making of
any Tenant Changes except if and to the extent that such restoration is made
an express condition of Landlord's consent to such Tenant's Change.

          If the performance of Tenant's Changes shall interfere with the
comfort and/or convenience of other tenants in the building or shall cause
damage to or otherwise interfere with the occupancy of adjacent buildings,
Tenant shall, upon Landlord's demand, remedy or remove the condition or
conditions complained of. Tenant further covenants and agrees to indemnify and
save Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages,
costs, expenses, suits and demands whatsoever made or asserted against Landlord
by reason of the foregoing.

45.       CERTIFICATES BY TENANT:
          -----------------------

and the lessor under any ground lease or underlying lease or the holder of any
leasehold mortgage affecting any ground lease or underlying lease, or of any fee
mortgage covering the land or the land and building, on at lease five (5) days

have been paid, and whether or not, to the best knowledge of the signer of such
statement, there are any then existing defaults on the part of either Landlord
or Tenant in the performance of the terms, covenants and conditions of this
lease, and if so, specifying the default of which the signer of such statement
has knowledge.

46.       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:
          ------------------------

          Tenant agrees that the liability of Landlord under this lease and all
matters pertaining to or arising out of the tenancy and the use and occupancy of
the Demised Premises, shall be limited to Landlord's interest in the Real
Property and in no event shall Tenant make any claim against or seek to impose
any personal liability upon any general or limited partner of Landlord, or any
principal of any firm or corporation that may hereafter be or become the
Landlord.

47.       INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE:
          ------------------------------

          Tenant will indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against all
damages, liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, arising out of the use of the Demised Premises or any work or
thing done, or any condition created by Tenants or its employees, agents or

($1,000,000.00) DOLLARS in respect of personal

                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>
 
injury or death and damage to property in respect of any one occurrence. The
Certificate of Insurance shall specifically have the indemnity clause referred
to in the first paragraph of this Article typed on the certificate evidencing
that the "hold harmless" clause has been insured. Tenant shall furnish to
Landlord certificates of such policies and provide for the insurance carrier's
endorsements and such policies shall not be terminated without ten (10) days'
prior notice to Landlord as well as Tenant.

48.       ELECTRICITY:
          ------------

          If the Landlord elects to supply electric current to the Demised
Premises, the Tenant agrees that electric current will be supplied by the
Landlord and the Tenant will pay the Landlord or the Landlord's designated
agent, as additional rent for the supplying of electric current, an amount or
amounts set by the Landlord computed at rates not exceeding those in the Service
Classification No. 4 of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. in effect
during August 1970. The Landlord, at its option, may, however, increase the
additional rent charges for supplying electricity to the Demised Premises based
upon changes, occurring subsequent to the aforementioned date, in the method,
rates or manner by which the Landlord thereafter purchases electricity for the
building of which the Demised Premises are a part. Such increases in the
additional rent charges for electricity shall be determined by a comparison to
the nearest full percentage of the average cost per kilowatt hour to the
Landlord at the rate in effect at which Landlord purchased electricity prior to
such change and the rate under which the Landlord will purchase electricity
after such change. The periods to be used for the aforesaid computation shall be
the bill periods ended in February and August immediately preceding such change.
Average cost per kilowatt hour is defined as including energy charges, demand
charges, fuel adjustment charges, rate adjustment charges, sales taxes where
applicable, and/or any other factors used by the public utility in computing its
charges to the Landlord, applied to the kilowatt hours purchased by Landlord
during a given bill period. Where more than one meter measures the service of
Tenant, the service rendered through each meter may be computed and billed
separately in accordance with the rates herein. Bills therefor shall be rendered
at such times as Landlord may elect and the amount shall be deemed to be, and be
paid as, additional rent. In the event that such bills are not paid within five
(5) days after the same are rendered, Landlord may, without further notice,
discontinue the service of electric current to the Demised Premises without
releasing Tenant from any liability under this lease and without Landlord or
Landlord's agent incurring any liability for any damage or loss sustained by
Tenant by such discontinuance of service. At the option of Landlord, Tenant also
agrees to purchase from Landlord or its agent all lamps or bulbs used in the
Demised Premises and to pay for cost of installation thereof. Landlord shall not
in any way be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss or damage or expense
which Tenant may sustain or incur if either the quantity or character of
electric service is changed or is no longer available or suitable for Tenant's
requirements. All additional feeders or risers or other electrical conductors or
equipment required to provide any increase in electric service to the Demised
Premises shall be provided by Landlord, and the cost thereof shall be paid by
Tenant on Landlord's demand, provided that, in Landlord's judgement, such
additional feeders or risers will not cause permanent damage or injury to the
building or the Demised Premises or cause or create a dangerous or hazardous
condition or entail excessive or unreasonable alterations or repairs or
interfere with or disturb other tenants or occupants of the building. Rigid
conduit only will be allowed. Tenant agrees that its use of electric current in
the Demised Premises shall not at anytime exceed the capacity of any of the
electrical conductors and equipment in otherwise serving the Demised Premises.
It is further agreed by Tenant that all of the aforesaid costs and expenses are
chargeable and collectible as additional rent and shall be paid by Tenant to
Landlord within five (5) days after condition of any bill or statement to Tenant
therefor. Landlord may discontinue any of the aforesaid services upon thirty
(30) days notice to Tenant without being liable to Tenant therefor or without in
any way affecting this lease or the liability of Tenant hereunder or causing a
diminution of rent and the same shall not be deemed to be a lessening or
diminution of services within the meaning of any law, rule or regulation now or
hereafter enacted, promulgated or issued. In the event Landlord gives

                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>
 
such notice of discontinuance Landlord shall permit Tenant to receive such 
service direct from the public utility corporation upon condition that the 
Tenant shall, at its sole expense entirely, segregate the Tenant's electrical 
system so that the same is in no way dependent upon or connected to the circuits
or distribution facilities of the Landlord or any other tenant and that upon 
vacating the Demised Premises Tenant will restore, at its sole expense, same to 
the condition existing prior to such segregation. Tenant shall make no 
electrical installations, alterations, additions or changes to electrical 
equipment or appliances without the prior written consent of the Landlord in 
each instance, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant will 
comply with the General Rules, Regulations, Terms and Conditions applicable to 
Service, Equipment, Wiring and Changes in Requirements in accordance with the 
requirements of the public utility supplying electricity to the building in the 
same manner as if the Tenant was serviced directly by such utility. If any tax 
is imposed upon Landlord's receipt from the sale or resale of electrical energy 
or gas or telephone service to Tenant by any Federal, State or Municipal 
Authority, Tenant agrees that, where permitted by law, Tenant's pro-rata share 
of such taxes shall be passed on to, and included in the bill of, and paid by, 
Tenant to Landlord.

      Landlord shall furnish and install Tenant's electrical meter in accordance
with the above provision. If there shall be any delay in the installation of 
such electrical meter, then Tenant shall be charged on a pro-rata adjustment 
basis for such period that meter has not been installed and operable, and such 
pro-rata adjustments shall be based on the average charge for electricity per 
day in the Demised Premises, after Tenant's first meter reading, multiplied by 
the number of days that the meter has not been installed and operable.

49.  BROKER:
     ------
     Tenant represents and warrants that if neither consulted nor negotiated 
with any broker or finder with regard to the rental of the Demised Premises from
Landlord other than Helmsley-Noyes Company, Inc., Tenant agrees to indemnify and

such act shall not, in any way, bind Landlord or its agents until such time as 
this lease shall have been approved and executed by Landlord and delivered to 
Tenant.

51.  MISCELLANEOUS:
     -------------

to the Demised Premises and open the same, whether or not Tenant shall be 
present, upon demand of any receiver, trustee, assignee for the benefit of 
creditors, sheriff, marshall or court officer entitled to, or reasonably 
purporting to be entitled to, such access for the purpose of taking possession 
of or removing, Tenant's property or for any other lawful purpose (but this 
provision and any action by Landlord hereunder shall not be deemed a recognition
by Landlord that the person or official making such demand has any right or 
interest in or to this lease, or in or to the premises), or upon demand of any 
representative of the fire, police, building, sanitation or other department of 
the city, state or federal government.

                                    - 10 -
<PAGE>
 
to terminate this lease, or after the commencement of any action, proceeding or
other remedy, Landlord may demand, receive and collect any monies due, and apply
them on account of Tenant's obligations under this lease but without in any
respect affecting such notice, action, proceeding or remedy, except that if a
money judgement is being sought in any such action or proceeding, the amount of
such judgement shall be reduced by such payment.

          D.   If Tenant is in arrears in the payment of fixed rent or
additional rent, Tenant waives it right, if any, to designate the items in
arrears against which any payments made by Tenant are to be credited and
Landlord may apply any of such payments to any such items in arrears as
Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall determine, irrespective of any
designation or request by Tenant as to the items against which any such
payments shall be credited.

          E.   No payments by Tenant nor receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount
that may be required to be paid hereunder shall be deemed to be other than on
account of any such payment, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check
or any letter accompanying any check tendered as payment be deemed an accord and
satisfaction and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to
Landlord's right to recover the balance of such payment due or pursue any other
remedy in this lease provided.

          F.   If in this lease it is provided that Landlord's consent or
approval as to any matter will not be unreasonably withheld, and it is
established by a court or body having final jurisdiction thereover that Landlord
has been unreasonable, the only effect of such finding shall be that Landlord
shall be deemed to have given its consent or approval; but Landlord shall not be
liable to Tenant in any respect for money damages by reason of withholding its
consent.

          G.   At Landlord's option, Tenant shall pay a "late charge" of one
(1%) percent per month from the due date of any installment of rent (fixed rent
and additional rent) if said rent payment is made more than ten (10) days

or recovery which Landlord may have under this lease, at law or in equity.

any mortgage foreclosed, this lease shall not terminate or be terminable by
Tenant unless Tenant was specifically named in any termination or foreclosure
judgement or final order. In the event any ground or underlying lease is
terminated as aforesaid, Tenant agrees to enter a new lease at the Demised
Premises for the remaining term of this lease and otherwise on the same terms,
conditions and rentals as herein provided with, and at the option of the holder
of any superior lease, or if there is no superior lease in existence, then with

Landlord, deposit with Landlord the sum of $9,349.16 which sum shall be held by

additional rent when due.

          Tenant shall be entitled to a rent credit in the amount of SIXTY-FIVE

          The foregoing rent credit shall be conditioned on Tenant not being in
default, beyond any applicable notice and/or grace period, under any of the
material terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. Upon the occurrence of
any such default by Tenant, the application of any rent credit which Tenant is
then receiving hereunder shall be deemed suspended unless and until Tenant fully
cures such default, at which time the application of such rent credit shall
resume and continue until Tenant has received the full amount thereof, (or
Tenant again so defaults).

at any time during the term of this Lease after Tenant has been granted all or a
portion of the rent credit described above or there reimbursement obligation,
breaches any covenant, condition or provision of this Lease and fails to cure
such breach within any applicable grace period, and provided that this Lease is
terminated by Landlord because of such default, then, in addition to all other
damages and remedies herein provided and to which Landlord may otherwise be
entitled, Landlord shall also be entitled to the repayment of the unamortized
portion of any such rent credit or reimbursement obligation theretofore enjoyed
by Tenant, which sum shall be deemed additional rent hereunder and shall be due
upon demand by Landlord. The obligation of Tenant to pay such additional rent,
(or damages), to Landlord shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of
the term of this Lease; provided, however, that such obligation shall be reduced

additionnl rent due under this Lease through the date originally fixed for the
expiration of the term hereof, whether in the form of damages or as rent from
the relettimg of the demised premises by Landlord, plus any other amounts due to
Landlord under Article #18 hereof.

63.       RIGHT OF PRIOR CONSIDERATION:
          -----------------------------
          If, at any time during the term of this Lease, Tenant notifies
Landlord that Tenant needs and wants additional expansion space, and such space
on the fifteenth (15th) floor of the Building is then vacant and available for
leasing by Landlord, (ie: not currently under offer to a proposed tenant or
                      ---
subject to the option of another tenant; and subject to the right of any
existing tenant to renew and extend its occupancy of such space), then, provided
Tenant is not then in default under this Lease beyond any applicable grace
period, Landlord shall so advise Tenant, and, at Tenant's written request, will
negotiate with Tenant on rent and other terms for the leasing of said space by
Tenant. If for any reason Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on such rental and
other terms within thirty (30) days after such negotiations begin, then Landlord
thereafter shall be free to rent such space to whomever Landlord wishes and for
such term of years and at whatever rental and other terms Landlord desires.

deliver to LICENSOR at least one (1) finished Licensed Good of each style.  If

materials, color, workmanship, designs, dimensions, styling detail and quality
approved by LICENSOR, LICENSOR shall notify LICENSEE in writing within ten (10)
days.  LICENSEE shall promptly correct any problem.  The judgment of LICENSOR,
exercised in good faith, will be binding and conclusive as to whether or not any
Licensed Good meets design or quality standards of the original sample.

not meet such standards or quality standards and, upon receipt of notification
that certain Licensed Goods do not meet such standards, LICENSEE must refrain
from distributing such non-conforming Licensed Goods, placing the Marks on any

is in no way identified as a Licensed Good.

     e.   All advertising or packaging or other business materials relating to
any Licensed Goods or bearing the Marks shall be submitted to LICENSOR for prior

revise or disapprove any items submitted.  Approval shall be effective until
revoked by LICENSOR.  LICENSEE shall, at the option of LICENSOR, include on its
business materials an indication

                                      -4-

of the relationship of the parties in a form approved by LICENSOR.  All uses of
the Marks by LICENSEE, including without limitation, use on any business
documents, invoices, stationery, advertising, promotions, labels, packaging and
otherwise, shall require LICENSOR's prior written consent.

     f.   LICENSEE shall sell Licensed Goods only to those specialty shops,
department stores and other retail outlets which deal in products similar in
quality and prestige to Licensed Goods and whose operations are consistent with
the quality and prestige of the Marks.  Prior to first shipment, LICENSEE shall
submit to LICENSOR for approval the names of all its intended customers.  Any
additions to this initial customer list shall be submitted on the "Customer
Profile Form" (Exhibit F) prior to sale to any new customer.  Each January 1,
LICENSEE shall send a list of all current customers.

fees, caused by or arising out of or in connection with the use by LICENSEE of

            The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision

closely as possible, but all other provisions shall continue in full force and
effect

     10.7   NO WAIVER
            ---------

            10.10.1  Arbitration shall be before three arbitrators, at least one
of whom shall be an attorney with experience in trademark matters and at least
one of whom shall be a certified public accountant.  The Arbitrators shall be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall have no power, in
rendering their award, to alter or depart from any express provision of this

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
            10.10.2  The Arbitrators shall have the power to award specific
performance or permanent injunctive relief and other rights or monies in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  All provisional remedies
shall be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts.  LICENSEE acknowledges and
admits that the Marks possess a special, unique and extraordinary character,
which makes difficult the assessment of monetary damages which LICENSOR might
sustain by any use which is inconsistent with this Agreement, and that
irreparable injury would be caused to LICENSOR thereby, such that injunctive and
similar relief would be appropriate in the event of any such uses.  Without
prejudice to any other right and/or remedy either party may have under this
Agreement or the law, if, after notice, the other party fails to take any action
which it is obligated to take under this Agreement, including without
limitation, providing any information and submitting required reports, products
or uses of the Marks, then the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an award
of specific performance to compel such action.

            10.10.3  The parties preserve all of their respective rights to
provisional remedies which they would have at law or equity, including
injunctive or similar relief.  LICENSOR reserves the right to obtain injunctions
and other declaratory relief to protect its trademarks and goodwill.

            10.10.4 Any award of the Arbitrators shall be final and binding upon
the parties and judgment may be entered in the courts of the State of California
or any United States court in California. LICENSEE waives any objection to (a)
personal jurisdiction; (b) venue; and (c) service of process of any United
States Federal court or California state court in Los Angeles County,
California, United States of America.

            10.10.5 Any claim is barred and waived unless the claimant
institutes arbitration proceedings prior to the date when any action in court
would be barred by the statute of limitations. The failure to institute
arbitration proceedings prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations constitutes an absolute bar to the institution of any arbitration or
other proceeding by either party. All issues relating to the statute of
limitations barring or preventing the commencement of proceedings shall be
determined in court proceedings, and the Arbitrators shall not have power or
jurisdiction to determine such issues.

Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to the Factoring Agreement between us dated May 15, 1994
(the "Factoring Agreement").

     This will confirm that the Factoring Agreement is amended as follows,
effective March 1, 1995:

     1.    CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF COLLECTION DAYS. The words "5 business
           ---------------------------------------------                     
days" contained in the third sentence of Section 4.B. are amended to read: "3
business days".

     2.    CHANGE IN FACTORING COMMISSION. The first sentence of Section 6.A. is
           --------------------------------                                     
amended to read as follows: "As compensation for your services as factor
hereunder, we agree to pay to you a factoring commission equal to 0.60% of the
amount of each bill or invoice less discounts granted to the customer."

     3.     GUARANTEED MINIMUM VOLUME AND ADDITION OF SURCHARGE TO FACTORING
           ------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMISSION. The following sentence shall be added to the end of Section 6.A.:
- ------------                                                                 

     If at the end of any Contract Year (as defined below) the total invoices
     factored with you during such Contract Year were less than $30,000,000,
     then the commission shall be retroactively adjusted for such Contract Year
     from 0.60% to 0.75% of the amount of each bill or invoice for such Contract
     Year, and the difference shall be charged to our account as of the end of
     such Contract Year.

     4.    CLARIFICATION OF CONTRACT YEAR. The definition of the term "Contract
           --------------------------------                                    
Year" in the fifth sentence of Section 6.B. is amended to mean the twelve month
period from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996 and each subsequent twelve month
period.

     5.    EXTENSION OF TERM. The first two sentences of Section 13.A. are
           -------------------                                            
amended to read as follows:

     This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until March 31,
     1996, and from year to year thereafter unless terminated by you (Republic)
     or unless we (Client) notify you of our desire to terminate this Agreement
     effective on March 31 of 1996 or March 31 of any subsequent year by

the Factoring Agreement signed by you and us, and the other written documents

June 17, 1995


Mr. Jeffrey Busse
Chief Financial Officer
YES Clothing Co.
1380 West Washington Boulevard
Los Angeles, CA  90007

Dear Mr. Busse:

       This letter, when properly signed, will constitute a retainer agreement
("Agreement" hereinafter) between Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, Inc.
("Houlihan Lokey" hereinafter) and YES Clothing Co. ("YES" or the "Company"
hereinafter) upon the terms and conditions set forth below.

       1.   Background.  We understand that the Company has entered into an
            ----------                                                     
agreement with its largest shareholder, Georges Marciano ("Marciano"), whereby
Marciano has agreed to:

       a)   become Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman of the Board
            ("CoB") of the Company;
       b)   provide additional capital for the Company; and
       c)   license to YES certain trademarks controlled by Marciano affiliates.

With respect to Marciano becoming Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board, we understand that Marciano will receive:

       a)   $1 per year in salary; and

Mr. Jeffrey Busse
YES Clothing Co.
June 17, 1995                                                                -2-


       b)   options to acquire 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock per
            year at $1.25 per share, vesting monthly during continued employment
            for up to four additional years, (the "Executive Options").

With respect to Marciano providing additional capital to the Company, we
understand that Marciano agreed to:

       a)   contribute $3,300,000 in new capital in exchange for 2,640,000
            shares of YES' common stock; and
       b)   convert approximately $700,000 owed by the Company to Marciano into
            additional shares of YES' common stock valued at $1.25 per share.

With respect to Marciano licensing to YES certain trademarks controlled by
Marciano affiliates, we understand that the Company has entered into five year
trademark license agreement for Marciano's "GM Surf" and "Misfits" lines of
clothing at royalties of 7 percent of gross sales, plus an additional 2 percent
for advertising.

Marciano becoming CEO and CoB of YES, Marciano providing additional capital to
YES, and Marciano entering into licensing agreements with YES is collectively
referred to herein as the "Restructuring".  In connection with the
Restructuring, we understand that the Company has granted Marciano a two year
option to acquire an additional 2,000,000 shares of YES' common stock at $1.25
per share, (the "Additional Options").

Finally, we understand that the Company is publicly traded on the NASD National
Market System (the "NASD NMS"), and has received a notice of potential delisting
from the NASD NMS because its net worth has fallen below minimum listing
standards.  However, we understand that the capital infusion associated with the
Restructuring may provide YES with sufficient capital to avoid such action by
the NASD NMS.  Moreover, we understand that Moss-Adams, the Company's outside
auditors, has indicated that it would issue a qualified opinion for the
Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1995 without the completion of at least a
portion of the Restructuring.  The Restructuring and the Company's granting of
the Additional Options are collectively referred to herein as the Transaction.

       2.   Opinion.  We understand that the Company's Board of Directors
            -------                                                      
("Board") has requested that Houlihan Lokey render an opinion (the "Opinion") as
to:

       a)   whether the fair market value of the Company's common stock prior to
            and without giving effect to the Transaction is not more than $1.25
            per share; and
       b)   the fairness of the Transaction to the Company from a financial
            point of view.

June 17, 1995                                                                -3-


The Opinion will be delivered in writing at the request of the Board.  The
Opinion shall not address the Company's underlying business decision to effect
the Transaction, nor have we been engaged to initiate any discussions with third
parties with respect to a possible acquisition of the Company.

       It is contemplated that the Opinion will include, in addition to any
other matters that Houlihan Lokey in its sole discretion deems appropriate, a
description of the principal materials that Houlihan Lokey has reviewed and upon
which Houlihan Lokey is relying, and the principal assumptions and
qualifications upon which Houlihan Lokey has relied.  The Opinion will be signed
and delivered as contemplated below.  Houlihan Lokey shall be responsible only
for conclusions or opinions set forth in its written Opinion, subject to the
limitations set forth herein.  We understand that shareholder approval will be
sought for the Executive Options and the Additional Options and that the Opinion
will be used in connection with seeking such shareholder approval.

       Houlihan Lokey consents to a description of and the inclusion of the text
of its written Opinion in any filing required to be made by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities
Dealers in connection with the Transaction and in materials delivered to the
Company's stockholders that are a part of such filings, provided that any such
description or inclusion shall be subject to Houlihan Lokey's prior review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Any summary of, or
reference to, the Opinion, any verbal presentation with respect thereto, or
other references to Houlihan Lokey in connection with the Transaction, will in
each instance be subject to Houlihan Lokey's prior review and written approval
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld).  Other than as set forth above, the
Opinion will not be included in, summarized or referred to in any manner in any
materials distributed to the public or the securityholders of the Company, or
filed with or submitted to any governmental agency, without Houlihan Lokey's
express, prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Neither Houlihan Lokey's verbal conclusions nor the Opinion will be used for any
purpose other than in connection with the Transaction.

       The Opinion will contain language substantially as follows:

       "This Opinion is furnished solely for your benefit and may not
       be relied upon by any other person without our express, prior
       written consent. This Opinion is delivered to each recipient
       subject to the conditions, scope of engagement, limitations and
       understandings set forth in this Opinion and our engagement
       letter, and subject to the understanding that the obligations
       of Houlihan Lokey in the Transaction are solely corporate
       obligations, and no officer, director, employee, agent,
       shareholder or controlling person of Houlihan Lokey shall be
       subjected to any personal liability whatsoever to any person,
       nor will any such claim be asserted by or on behalf of you or
       your affiliates."

       In connection with the Opinion, Houlihan Lokey shall, subject to the
limitations expressed herein or in the Opinion, make such reviews, analyses and
inquiries as we deem necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.  Among
other things, Houlihan Lokey will meet with certain senior management of the
Company, visit certain facilities and business offices of the Company, review
certain of the Company's historical financial statements, review certain other
documents pertaining to the Transaction, review forecasts and projections
prepared by Company management and/or the Company's advisors, and review
publicly available data about certain companies it deems comparable to the
Company and certain transactions it deems relevant.

       3.   Securities Position.  In the course of trading activities of
            -------------------

short positions in and buy or sell debt or equity securities or options on
securities of the Company and other companies that are or may be the subject of
the engagement contemplated by this Agreement.  To the extent Houlihan Lokey has
any such position in the securities of the Company or such other companies as of
the date of this Agreement, it has been disclosed to the Company.

       4.   Information.  The Company, each signatory hereto, and all recipients
            -----------                                                         
of the Opinion recognize and confirm that in rendering services hereunder,
Houlihan Lokey has been, prior to the date hereof, and hereafter will be, using

data, material and other information (including without limitation, the

Houlihan Lokey by or on behalf of the Company and its agents, counsel, employees
and representatives (the "Information").  Houlihan Lokey does not assume
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the Information, including,
but not limited to, any disclosure materials related to the Transaction, and
Houlihan Lokey shall not be obligated to conduct any independent study or
investigation as to the accuracy or completeness of the Information.  The
Company represents that the disclosure materials will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not false or misleading.  In addition, the Company represents and warrants
that the Information will be true, complete and correct in all material
respects.  The foregoing shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Houlihan Lokey or any
Indemnified Person (as defined elsewhere in this agreement) or any person
controlling any of them.

       The Company will furnish to Houlihan Lokey complete copies of all
relevant documents with respect to the Transaction filed with or submitted to
any regulatory agency prior to the consummation of the Transaction, and all such
other data, material and other information as Houlihan Lokey may reasonably

Houlihan Lokey apprised of changes in the terms of the Transaction on a timely
basis as they are decided upon.

       5.   Fees; Expenses.  The Company will pay Houlihan Lokey a fee of
            --------------                                               
$75,000 for its services in connection with this Agreement, plus reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses that may be incurred by Houlihan Lokey in connection
herewith.  Payment to Houlihan Lokey will be made in the amount of $37,500 upon
signing of this Agreement, and the remainder promptly upon receipt of periodic
billings.  The full fees set forth above shall become due and payable upon
Houlihan Lokey's delivery of the Opinion, but Houlihan Lokey will be entitled to
full payment on July 31, 1995, even if it has not delivered the Opinion, as long
as Houlihan Lokey has notified the Company in writing that it has completed its
investigation and review with respect to the Opinion and that it is prepared
(subject to its review of final documents) to deliver the Opinion.  If for any
reason the Transaction is terminated prior to its consummation and Houlihan
Lokey is requested to terminate work prior to its having given notification to
the Company, as set forth above, then Houlihan Lokey's fee shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Houlihan Lokey, but shall not be less than the
greater of $37,500, or Houlihan Lokey's total time costs at its normal rates for
such projects, plus, in either case, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  No
portion of the fee is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction or the
conclusions reached in the Opinion.

       Out-of-pocket expenses shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable
travel, lodging and meal expenses, duplicating charges, long-distance telephone
calls, and computer charges that have been or may be incurred by Houlihan Lokey
in connection with the Transaction.  Houlihan Lokey shall, in addition, be
reimbursed for reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel in connection
with this Agreement and Opinion.

       If Houlihan Lokey is requested to expand its Opinion to cover any areas
other than that set forth in Section 2, or beyond the scope listed in said
Section, such expanded scope of engagement and the fee to be paid to Houlihan
Lokey shall be negotiated and agreed upon prior to Houlihan Lokey's undertaking
such expanded engagement.

       6.   Indemnification; Contribution; and Standard of Care. The Company
            ---------------------------------------------------             
agrees to provide indemnification to Houlihan Lokey and certain other parties,
in accordance with Schedule 1, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein
by this reference.  In no event, regardless of the legal theory advanced, shall
Houlihan Lokey be responsible to any person other than for its gross negligence,
bad faith, willful misfeasance, or reckless disregard of its obligations or
duties.  In no event, regardless of the legal theory advanced, shall Houlihan
Lokey's aggregate liability to all parties in connection with the Transaction or
its services in connection therewith exceed the aggregate fees actually received
by Houlihan Lokey hereunder.

controlling person shall be subjected to any personal liability whatsoever to
any person, nor will any such claim be asserted by or on behalf of any other
party to this Agreement or any person relying on the Opinion.

       9.   Attorney Fees; Choice of Law.  If any party to this Agreement brings
            ----------------------------                                        
an action directly or indirectly based upon this Agreement or the matters
contemplated hereby, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in
addition to any other appropriate amounts, its reasonable costs and expenses in
connection with such proceeding, including, but not limited to reasonable

acknowledge that, upon consummation of the Transaction, Houlihan Lokey is
authorized at its sole discretion to place the customary "tombstone"
advertisement or similar announcement in such form and in such media as it deems
appropriate.

       Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer or
does confer on any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns and, to the extent expressly set forth herein,
the Indemnified Persons, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement or as a result of the services to be rendered by Houlihan Lokey
hereunder.

       The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement

            --------------------                                              
the Opinion acknowledges that Houlihan Lokey may be requested to render certain
services to other participants in the Transaction in the form of an opinion or
advice, and that services rendered in the past or to be rendered by Houlihan
Lokey hereunder or in the future do not represent any actual or potential
conflict of interest on the part of Houlihan Lokey.  If during the course of
this Transaction any party hereto in good faith determines that a conflict of
interest has arisen herefrom, each signatory hereto hereby waives such conflict
of interest.  Each signatory hereto consents to Houlihan Lokey's use of any
information obtained and to be obtained in the course of the activities
contemplated by said other engagement, and to the sharing of any information,

                                  SCHEDULE 1
                                  ----------

                       INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION
                       --------------------------------

This Schedule 1 is a part of and incorporated into that certain letter agreement
(together, the "Agreement"), dated June 17, 1995.

          (a) If Houlihan Lokey or any employee, agent, officer, director,
attorney, shareholder or any person who controls Houlihan Lokey (any or all of
the foregoing, hereinafter an "Indemnified Person") becomes involved in any
capacity in any legal or administrative action, suit, proceeding, investigation
or inquiry, regardless of the legal theory or the allegations made in connection
therewith, directly or indirectly in connection with, arising out of, based
upon, or in any way related to (i) this Agreement; (ii) the services that are
the subject of this Agreement; (iii) any document or information, whether verbal
or written, referred to herein or supplied to Houlihan Lokey; (iv) the breach of
the representations, warranties or covenants by the Company given pursuant
hereto; (v) Houlihan Lokey's involvement in the Transaction or any part thereof;
(vi) any filings made by or on behalf of any party with any governmental agency
in connection with the Transaction; (vii) the Transaction; or (viii) proceedings
by or on behalf of any recipients of the Opinion, the Company will on demand,
advance or pay promptly, on behalf of each Indemnified Person, reasonable
attorneys' fees and other expenses and disbursements (including, but not limited
to, the cost of any investigation and related preparation) as they are incurred
by the Indemnified Person, (subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below).
The Company also indemnifies and holds harmless each Indemnified Person against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including,
but not limited to, attorneys' fees, disbursements and court costs, and costs of
investigation and preparation) ("Losses") to which such Indemnified Person may
become subject in connection with any such matter.

          (b)  If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is determined to
be unavailable to any Indemnified Person or insufficient fully to indemnify any
such person, then the Company will contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such person as a result of any such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect (i) the relationship between Houlihan Lokey's fee on the one hand and
the aggregate value of the Transaction on the other hand or (ii) if the
allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only
such relative benefit but also the relative fault of the other participants in
the Transaction, on the one hand, and Houlihan Lokey and the Indemnified Persons
on the other hand, and any other relevant equitable considerations in connection
with the matters as to which such Losses relate; provided, however, that in no
event shall the amount to be contributed by all Indemnified Persons in the
aggregate exceed the amount of the fees actually received by Houlihan Lokey
hereunder.

          (c) The Company shall be notified in writing by any Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification if any action is commenced against such Indemnified
Person, within a reasonable time after such Indemnified Person shall have been
served with a summons or other first legal process, but failure so to notify the
Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have
hereunder or otherwise, except to the extent that such failure so to notify the
Company materially prejudices the rights of the Company. The Company shall
assume, at its
<PAGE>
 
Schedule 1
Idemnification and Contribution                                              -2-



own expense, the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim, and such
defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by the Company and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, (which counsel may be Company counsel);
provided, however, that (i) if the Company shall fail to assume or actively and
diligently conduct such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
employ such person's own separate counsel in any such action, at the Company's
expense, and such counsel shall have the right to have charge of such matters
for such person; and (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both an
Indemnified Person and the Company and such Indemnified Person shall have been
advised in writing by its counsel that there are conflicts between the legal
defenses available to such Indemnified Person and those available to the
Company, which in the reasonable opinion of such counsel are sufficient to make
it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Company and such
Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ its
own counsel in such action, and in such event the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be borne by the Company.

          (d)  The indemnification obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
Losses that are finally judicially determined on the merits to have been
material and caused primarily by the gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misfeasance, or reckless disregard of its obligations or duties on the part of
Houlihan Lokey or such Indemnified Person. In the event of such final judicial
determination, the Company shall, subject to Houlihan Lokey's rights of
contribution, be entitled to recover from the Indemnified Person or Houlihan
Lokey the costs and expenses paid on behalf of such Indemnified Person pursuant
to this indemnification obligation.

          (e)  The Company agrees that it will not settle, compromise or
discharge any suit, claim, litigation, threatened litigation or threatened claim
arising out of, based upon, or in any way related to the Transaction and to
which Houlihan Lokey is or may reasonably be expected to be a party, unless and
until the Company has obtained a written agreement, approved by Houlihan Lokey
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and executed by each party to such
proposed settlement, compromise or discharge, releasing Houlihan Lokey and each
Indemnified Person from any and all liability. Houlihan Lokey agrees that it
will not settle, compromise or discharge any such suit, claim, litigation or
threatened claim without the prior written consent of the Company, which will
not be unreasonably withheld.

          (f)  The Company's obligations under this Section shall be in addition
to any liability that the Company or any other person may otherwise have to
Houlihan Lokey or any Indemnified Person. The foregoing provisions shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person and such person's heirs, representatives
and successors, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the
completion of services hereunder.

                            DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement"), is effective as of June 17,
1995, and is made by and between YES CLOTHING CO., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and GEORGES MARCIANO (the "Indemnitee").

     WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company serving at
the Company's request;

     WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's services on behalf of the
Company, the Company wishes to provide for the continuing indemnification of the
Indemnitee, and to provide for the continued coverage of the Indemnitee under
the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance policies for the
period and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's service to the
Company, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

          1.   Definitions.
               ----------- 

               1.1  Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Expenses" mean
                    --------                                                 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, accounting and witness fees,
travel and deposition costs, expenses of investigations, expenses of Proceedings
and related appeals, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including reasonable
compensation for time spent by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense or appeal of a Proceeding (as defined in Section 1.2 below) or action
for indemnification for which he is not otherwise compensated by the Company or
any third party.  The term "Expenses" does not include the amount of judgments,
fines or penalties actually levied against Indemnitee.

               1.2  Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proceeding"
                    ----------          
means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or other proceeding,
whether brought in the name of the Company or otherwise and whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or any other type whatsoever.

          2.   Additional Indemnification.  The Company and the Indemnitee agree
               --------------------------                                       
that this Agreement does not replace or supersede prior Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and the Indemnitee to the extent that such
prior Agreement provides additional or broader indemnification coverage.

          3.   Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
               ---------------                                          
Sections 7 and 8, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the following
indemnification by the Company:
<PAGE>
 
               3.1  Third Party Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    -------------------
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that the Indemnitee was or is a director of the Company, or by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, the Company
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding, to the fullest permitted by
the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law, public policy or other
applicable law, including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or
other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency, as the same exists or
may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment).

               3.2  Derivative Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    ------------------
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the
Company to procure a judgment in the Company's favor by reason of the fact that
the Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that
Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of anything done
or not done in any such capacity, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law,
public policy, or other applicable law, including binding regulations and orders
of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or
agency, as the same exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment).

               3.3  Expenses Paid by Insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    --------------------------
the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement which have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by directors' and officers' insurance, if any.

               3.4  Duty to Obtain Insurance Coverage.  The Company currently
                    ---------------------------------
has and will keep in force a policy of insurance for directors and officers with
a minimum aggregate limit of liability of $10,000,000. The Company shall pay all
premiums, commissions and other costs or charges incurred in obtaining the
endorsement and shall promptly deliver to Indemnitee a certificate of
confirmation of insurance with respect to such policy.

          4.   Partial Indemnification.  If the Indemnitee is entitled to
               -----------------------                                   
indemnification on some claims, issues or matters, but not on others, involved
in a Proceeding, the Company

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Indemnitee concerning those matters
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

          5.   Advancement of Expenses.  The Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
               -----------------------                                         
investigating, defending, or appealing any Proceeding covered hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in advance (unless, in the opinion of regular outside
counsel to the Company, the provisions of applicable law precludes such advance
payment), with the understanding, agreement and undertaking by Indemnitee that
in the event it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee was not entitled
to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, that Indemnitee
shall repay to the Company such amount, or the appropriate portion thereof, so
paid or advanced.

          6.   Notice and Other Indemnification Procedures.
               ------------------------------------------- 

               6.1  Notice to Company.  Promptly after becoming aware of or
                    -----------------
receiving notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any
Proceeding, the indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that
indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Company under this
Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement or threat of
commencement thereof. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such
information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
Indemnitee's power. The omission to so notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee other than under this
Agreement.

               6.2  Notice to Insurer.  At the time of the receipt of a notice
                    -----------------
of the commencement of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to
cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a
result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies, unless
the Company has already paid such amounts directly to the Indemnitee.

               6.3  Choice of Counsel.  If the Company shall be obligated to pay
                    -----------------
the Expenses of any Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which
approval the Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold), upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After
delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of any counsel other than the
counsel approved by the Indemnitee and retained by the Company which may be
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding;
provided that (a) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in any such Proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; and (b) if (1) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the
Company in writing, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Company and the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (3) the Company shall not, in
fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the
Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee shall be payable by the Company.

          7.   Determination of Right to Indemnification.
               ----------------------------------------- 

               7.1  Presumption of Right to Indemnification.  To the extent the
                    ---------------------------------------                    
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement or in the defense
of any claim, issue or matter involved in any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee
shall be presumed to have met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, for
indemnification under this Agreement.

               7.2  Burden of Proof.  If Section 7.1 is inapplicable, the
                    ---------------
Company shall not withhold indemnification pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 of
this Agreement unless (a) the board of directors of the Company shall determine
that California law or other applicable law prohibits the indemnification of
Indemnitee under the terms of this Agreement, or (b) the Company shall receive a
written opinion from independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
the Company to that effect. The Company shall have the burden of proving to such
counsel that indemnification is not available to the Indemnitee as set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any failure between the Indemnitee and the Company to
agree in the selection of the independent legal counsel shall be resolved
pursuant to Sections 7.3 through 7.6 below.

               7.3  Selection of Counsel.  If the Indemnitee and the Company are
                    --------------------                                        
unable to agree on the selection of the independent counsel, such independent
counsel shall be selected by lot from among the ten (10) law firms having the
most lawyers practicing in Los Angeles, California (excluding any firms that
have acted as counsel for the Company).  Regular counsel to the Company shall
contact such counsel in order of their selection by lot, requesting each such
firm to accept engagement to make the determination required hereunder until one
of such firms accepts such engagement.  The fees for such counsel shall be paid
by the Company.

               7.4  Response of Company.  As soon as practicable, and in no
                    -------------------
event later than 20 days after the selection of independent legal counsel
pursuant to Section 7.3 above, the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to
the independent legal counsel, in such manner as the independent legal counsel
may reasonably request, its claim, if any, that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               7.5  Appeal. Notwithstanding a determination by an independent
                    ------
legal counsel appointed pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the court in which that Proceeding
is or was pending, or such other court of competent jurisdiction, for the
purpose of enforcing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that a determination by the independent legal
counsel that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct required for

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
indemnification shall not create a presumption, in any subsequent court
proceeding, that the Indemnitee has failed to meet the applicable standard of
conduct.

               7.6  Actions Under Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify the
                    -----------------------                                  
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 7
involving the Indemnitee and against all Expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the
Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that each of the claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in
any such Proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.

          8.   Exceptions.  Any other provision herein to the contrary
               ----------                                             
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement:

               8.1  Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.  To indemnify the Indemnitee
                    ------------------------------
with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee
and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any
other statute or law or otherwise;

               8.2  Lack of Good Faith.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any
                    ------------------
Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by
the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the
Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;

               8.3  SEC Limitation.  To indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent
                    --------------
such indemnification would cause the Company to violate any undertaking the
Company makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with respect to
indemnification;

               8.4  Excluded Acts.  To indemnify the Indemnitee as to
                    -------------
circumstances in which indemnification is prohibited pursuant to California law;
or

               8.5  Settlements.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any amount
                    -----------
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          9.   Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this Agreement, the
               -----------                                                    
Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall do all things that may be necessary to
secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to
enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          10.  Non-exclusivity and Continuation of Rights.  The provisions for
               ------------------------------------------                     
indemnification and advancement of Expenses set forth in this Agreement shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which the Indemnitee may have
pursuant to the Articles

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
of Incorporation or Bylaws, any agreement, vote of the Company's stockholders or
disinterested directors, provisions of California law or otherwise.  The
Indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the Indemnitee has ceased
acting as a director of the Company.

          11.  Severability.  If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
               ------------                                                   
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever,
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

          12.  Modification and Waiver.  No supplement, modification or
               -----------------------                                 
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both
of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof

                            DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement"), is effective as of May 3,
1995, and is made by and between YES CLOTHING CO., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and IRVING KROLL (the "Indemnitee").

     WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company serving at
the Company's request;

     WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's services on behalf of the
Company, the Company wishes to provide for the continuing indemnification of the
Indemnitee, and to provide for the continued coverage of the Indemnitee under
the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance policies for the
period and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's service to the
Company, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

          1.   Definitions.
               ----------- 

               1.1  Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Expenses" mean
                    --------                                                 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, accounting and witness fees,
travel and deposition costs, expenses of investigations, expenses of Proceedings
and related appeals, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including reasonable
compensation for time spent by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense or appeal of a Proceeding (as defined in Section 1.2 below) or action
for indemnification for which he is not otherwise compensated by the Company or
any third party.  The term "Expenses" does not include the amount of judgments,
fines or penalties actually levied against Indemnitee.

               1.2  Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proceeding"
                    ----------                                        
means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or other proceeding,
whether brought in the name of the Company or otherwise and whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or any other type whatsoever.

          2.   Additional Indemnification.  The Company and the Indemnitee agree
               --------------------------                                       
that this Agreement does not replace or supersede prior Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and the Indemnitee to the extent that such
prior Agreement provides additional or broader indemnification coverage.

          3.   Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
               ---------------                                          
Sections 7 and 8, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the following
indemnification by the Company:
<PAGE>
 
               3.1  Third Party Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    -------------------                              
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that the Indemnitee was or is a director of the Company, or by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, the Company
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding, to the fullest permitted by
the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law, public policy or other
applicable law, including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or
other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency, as the same exists or
may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment).

               3.2  Derivative Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    ------------------                                         
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the
Company to procure a judgment in the Company's favor by reason of the fact that
the Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that
Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of anything done
or not done in any such capacity, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law,
public policy, or other applicable law, including binding regulations and orders
of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or
agency, as the same exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment).

               3.3  Expenses Paid by Insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    --------------------------   
the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement which have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by directors' and officers' insurance, if any.

               3.4  Duty to Obtain Insurance Coverage.  The Company currently
                    ---------------------------------                     
has and will keep in force a policy of insurance for directors and officers with
a minimum aggregate limit of liability of $10,000,000. The Company shall pay all
premiums, commissions and other costs or charges incurred in obtaining the
endorsement and shall promptly deliver to Indemnitee a certificate of
confirmation of insurance with respect to such policy.

          4.   Partial Indemnification.  If the Indemnitee is entitled to
               -----------------------                                   
indemnification on some claims, issues or matters, but not on others, involved
in a Proceeding, the Company

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Indemnitee concerning those matters
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

          5.   Advancement of Expenses.  The Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
               -----------------------                                         
investigating, defending, or appealing any Proceeding covered hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in advance (unless, in the opinion of regular outside
counsel to the Company, the provisions of applicable law precludes such advance
payment), with the understanding, agreement and undertaking by Indemnitee that
in the event it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee was not entitled
to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, that Indemnitee
shall repay to the Company such amount, or the appropriate portion thereof, so
paid or advanced.

          6.   Notice and Other Indemnification Procedures.
               ------------------------------------------- 

               6.1  Notice to Company.  Promptly after becoming aware of or
                    -----------------                                          
receiving notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any
Proceeding, the indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that
indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Company under this
Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement or threat of
commencement thereof. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such
information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
Indemnitee's power. The omission to so notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee other than under this
Agreement.

               6.2  Notice to Insurer.  At the time of the receipt of a notice
                    -----------------                                 
of the commencement of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to
cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a
result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies, unless
the Company has already paid such amounts directly to the Indemnitee.

               6.3  Choice of Counsel.  If the Company shall be obligated to pay
                    -----------------                                
the Expenses of any Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which
approval the Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold), upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After
delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of any counsel other than the
counsel approved by the Indemnitee and retained by the Company which may be
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding;
provided that (a) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in any such Proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; and (b) if (1) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the
Company in writing, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Company and the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (3) the Company shall not, in
fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the
Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee shall be payable by the Company.

          7.   Determination of Right to Indemnification.
               ----------------------------------------- 

               7.1  Presumption of Right to Indemnification.  To the extent the
                    ---------------------------------------                    
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement or in the defense
of any claim, issue or matter involved in any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee
shall be presumed to have met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, for
indemnification under this Agreement.

               7.2  Burden of Proof.  If Section 7.1 is inapplicable, the
                    ---------------                                         
Company shall not withhold indemnification pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 of
this Agreement unless (a) the board of directors of the Company shall determine
that California law or other applicable law prohibits the indemnification of
Indemnitee under the terms of this Agreement, or (b) the Company shall receive a
written opinion from independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
the Company to that effect. The Company shall have the burden of proving to such
counsel that indemnification is not available to the Indemnitee as set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any failure between the Indemnitee and the Company to
agree in the selection of the independent legal counsel shall be resolved
pursuant to Sections 7.3 through 7.6 below.

               7.3  Selection of Counsel.  If the Indemnitee and the Company are
                    --------------------                                        
unable to agree on the selection of the independent counsel, such independent
counsel shall be selected by lot from among the ten (10) law firms having the
most lawyers practicing in Los Angeles, California (excluding any firms that
have acted as counsel for the Company).  Regular counsel to the Company shall
contact such counsel in order of their selection by lot, requesting each such
firm to accept engagement to make the determination required hereunder until one
of such firms accepts such engagement.  The fees for such counsel shall be paid
by the Company.

               7.4  Response of Company.  As soon as practicable, and in no
                    -------------------                          
event later than 20 days after the selection of independent legal counsel
pursuant to Section 7.3 above, the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to
the independent legal counsel, in such manner as the independent legal counsel
may reasonably request, its claim, if any, that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               7.5  Appeal.  Notwithstanding a determination by an independent
                    ------
legal counsel appointed pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the court in which that Proceeding
is or was pending, or such other court of competent jurisdiction, for the
purpose of enforcing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that a determination by the independent legal
counsel that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct required for

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
indemnification shall not create a presumption, in any subsequent court
proceeding, that the Indemnitee has failed to meet the applicable standard of
conduct.

               7.6  Actions Under Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify the
                    -----------------------                                  
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 7
involving the Indemnitee and against all Expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the
Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that each of the claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in
any such Proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.

          8.   Exceptions.  Any other provision herein to the contrary
               ----------                                             
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement:

               8.1  Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.  To indemnify the Indemnitee
                    ------------------------------                            
with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee
and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any
other statute or law or otherwise;

               8.2  Lack of Good Faith.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any
                    ------------------                                        
Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by
the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the
Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;

               8.3  SEC Limitation.  To indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent
                    --------------                                         
such indemnification would cause the Company to violate any undertaking the
Company makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with respect to
indemnification;

               8.4  Excluded Acts.  To indemnify the Indemnitee as to
                    -------------                                          
circumstances in which indemnification is prohibited pursuant to California law;
or

               8.5  Settlements.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any amount
                    -----------                                            
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          9.   Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this Agreement, the
               -----------                                                    
Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall do all things that may be necessary to
secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to
enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          10.  Non-exclusivity and Continuation of Rights.  The provisions for
               ------------------------------------------                     
indemnification and advancement of Expenses set forth in this Agreement shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which the Indemnitee may have
pursuant to the Articles

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
of Incorporation or Bylaws, any agreement, vote of the Company's stockholders or
disinterested directors, provisions of California law or otherwise.  The
Indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the Indemnitee has ceased
acting as a director of the Company.

          11.  Severability.  If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
               ------------                                                   
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever,
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

          12.  Modification and Waiver.  No supplement, modification or
               -----------------------                                 
amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both
of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof
(whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

          13.  Effectiveness of Agreement.  This Agreement shall be effective as
               --------------------------                                       
of the date set forth on the first page (the "Effective Date") and shall apply
to acts or omissions of Indemnitee which occurred prior to such date if
Indemnitee was an officer or director of the Company, or was serving at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, agent or employee of another
enterprise, at the time such act or omission occurred.

          14.  Successors and Assigns.  The terms of this Agreement shall bind,
               ----------------------                                          
and shall inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties

                            DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement"), is effective as of May 3,
1995, and is made by and between YES CLOTHING CO., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and MAURICE SCHOENHOLZ (the "Indemnitee").

     WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company serving at
the Company's request;

     WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's services on behalf of the
Company, the Company wishes to provide for the continuing indemnification of the
Indemnitee, and to provide for the continued coverage of the Indemnitee under
the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance policies for the
period and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's service to the
Company, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

          1.   Definitions.
               ----------- 

               1.1  Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Expenses" mean
                    --------                                                 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, accounting and witness fees,
travel and deposition costs, expenses of investigations, expenses of Proceedings
and related appeals, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including reasonable
compensation for time spent by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense or appeal of a Proceeding (as defined in Section 1.2 below) or action
for indemnification for which he is not otherwise compensated by the Company or
any third party. The term "Expenses" does not include the amount of judgments,
fines or penalties actually levied against Indemnitee.

               1.2  Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proceeding"
                    ----------                                             
means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or other proceeding,
whether brought in the name of the Company or otherwise and whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or any other type whatsoever.

          2.   Additional Indemnification.  The Company and the Indemnitee agree
               --------------------------                                       
that this Agreement does not replace or supersede prior Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and the Indemnitee to the extent that such
prior Agreement provides additional or broader indemnification coverage.

          3.   Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
               ---------------                                          
Sections 7 and 8, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the following
indemnification by the Company:
<PAGE>
 
               3.1  Third Party Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    -------------------                                    
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that the Indemnitee was or is a director of the Company, or by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, the Company
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding, to the fullest permitted by
the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law, public policy or other
applicable law, including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or
other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency, as the same exists or
may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment).

               3.2  Derivative Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    ------------------                                   
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the
Company to procure a judgment in the Company's favor by reason of the fact that
the Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that
Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of anything done
or not done in any such capacity, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law,
public policy, or other applicable law, including binding regulations and orders
of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or
agency, as the same exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment).

               3.3  Expenses Paid by Insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    --------------------------                               
the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement which have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by directors' and officers' insurance, if any.

               3.4  Duty to Obtain Insurance Coverage.  The Company currently
                    ---------------------------------                         
has and will keep in force a policy of insurance for directors and officers with
a minimum aggregate limit of liability of $10,000,000. The Company shall pay all
premiums, commissions and other costs or charges incurred in obtaining the
endorsement and shall promptly deliver to Indemnitee a certificate of
confirmation of insurance with respect to such policy.

          4.   Partial Indemnification.  If the Indemnitee is entitled to
               -----------------------                                   
indemnification on some claims, issues or matters, but not on others, involved
in a Proceeding, the Company

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Indemnitee concerning those matters
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

          5.   Advancement of Expenses.  The Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
               -----------------------                                         
investigating, defending, or appealing any Proceeding covered hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in advance (unless, in the opinion of regular outside
counsel to the Company, the provisions of applicable law precludes such advance
payment), with the understanding, agreement and undertaking by Indemnitee that
in the event it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee was not entitled
to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, that Indemnitee
shall repay to the Company such amount, or the appropriate portion thereof, so
paid or advanced.

          6.   Notice and Other Indemnification Procedures.
               ------------------------------------------- 

               6.1  Notice to Company.  Promptly after becoming aware of or
                    -----------------                                          
receiving notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any
Proceeding, the indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that
indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Company under this
Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement or threat of
commencement thereof. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such
information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
Indemnitee's power. The omission to so notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee other than under this
Agreement.

               6.2  Notice to Insurer.  At the time of the receipt of a notice
                    -----------------                                      
of the commencement of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to
cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a
result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies, unless
the Company has already paid such amounts directly to the Indemnitee.

               6.3  Choice of Counsel.  If the Company shall be obligated to pay
                    -----------------                                    
the Expenses of any Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which
approval the Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold), upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After
delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of any counsel other than the
counsel approved by the Indemnitee and retained by the Company which may be
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding;
provided that (a) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in any such Proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; and (b) if (1) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the
Company in writing, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Company and the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (3) the Company shall not, in
fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the
Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee shall be payable by the Company.

          7.   Determination of Right to Indemnification.
               ----------------------------------------- 

               7.1  Presumption of Right to Indemnification.  To the extent the
                    ---------------------------------------                    
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement or in the defense
of any claim, issue or matter involved in any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee
shall be presumed to have met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, for
indemnification under this Agreement.

               7.2  Burden of Proof.  If Section 7.1 is inapplicable, the
                    ---------------                                      
Company shall not withhold indemnification pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 of
this Agreement unless (a) the board of directors of the Company shall determine
that California law or other applicable law prohibits the indemnification of
Indemnitee under the terms of this Agreement, or (b) the Company shall receive a
written opinion from independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
the Company to that effect. The Company shall have the burden of proving to such
counsel that indemnification is not available to the Indemnitee as set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any failure between the Indemnitee and the Company to
agree in the selection of the independent legal counsel shall be resolved
pursuant to Sections 7.3 through 7.6 below.

               7.3  Selection of Counsel.  If the Indemnitee and the Company are
                    --------------------                                        
unable to agree on the selection of the independent counsel, such independent
counsel shall be selected by lot from among the ten (10) law firms having the
most lawyers practicing in Los Angeles, California (excluding any firms that
have acted as counsel for the Company). Regular counsel to the Company shall
contact such counsel in order of their selection by lot, requesting each such
firm to accept engagement to make the determination required hereunder until one
of such firms accepts such engagement. The fees for such counsel shall be paid
by the Company.

               7.4  Response of Company.  As soon as practicable, and in no
                    -------------------                                   
event later than 20 days after the selection of independent legal counsel
pursuant to Section 7.3 above, the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to
the independent legal counsel, in such manner as the independent legal counsel
may reasonably request, its claim, if any, that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               7.5  Appeal.  Notwithstanding a determination by an independent
                    ------
legal counsel appointed pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the court in which that Proceeding
is or was pending, or such other court of competent jurisdiction, for the
purpose of enforcing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that a determination by the independent legal
counsel that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct required for

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
indemnification shall not create a presumption, in any subsequent court
proceeding, that the Indemnitee has failed to meet the applicable standard of
conduct.

               7.6  Actions Under Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify the
                    -----------------------                                  
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 7
involving the Indemnitee and against all Expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the
Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that each of the claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in
any such Proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.

          8.   Exceptions.  Any other provision herein to the contrary
               ----------                                             
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement:

               8.1  Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.  To indemnify the Indemnitee
                    ------------------------------                          
with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee
and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any
other statute or law or otherwise;

               8.2  Lack of Good Faith.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any
                    ------------------                                     
Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by
the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the
Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;

               8.3  SEC Limitation.  To indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent
                    --------------                                        
such indemnification would cause the Company to violate any undertaking the
Company makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with respect to
indemnification;

               8.4  Excluded Acts.  To indemnify the Indemnitee as to
                    -------------                                           
circumstances in which indemnification is prohibited pursuant to California law;
or

               8.5  Settlements.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any amount
                    -----------                                            
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          9.   Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this Agreement, the
               -----------                                                    
Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall do all things that may be necessary to
secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to
enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          10.  Non-exclusivity and Continuation of Rights.  The provisions for
               ------------------------------------------                     
indemnification and advancement of Expenses set forth in this Agreement shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which the Indemnitee may have
pursuant to the Articles

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
of Incorporation or Bylaws, any agreement, vote of the Company's stockholders or
disinterested directors, provisions of California law or otherwise.  The
Indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the Indemnitee has ceased
acting as a director of the Company.

          11.  Severability.  If any provision or provisions of this Agreement
               ------------                                                   
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever,
(a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation, all portions of any paragraphs of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
portions of any paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid,

                            DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement"), is effective as of May 18,
1995, and is made by and between YES CLOTHING CO., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and GUY ANTHOME (the "Indemnitee").

     WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company serving at
the Company's request;

     WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's services on behalf of the
Company, the Company wishes to provide for the continuing indemnification of the
Indemnitee, and to provide for the continued coverage of the Indemnitee under
the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance policies for the
period and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's service to the
Company, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

          1.   Definitions.
               ----------- 

               1.1  Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Expenses" mean
                    --------                                                 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, accounting and witness fees,
travel and deposition costs, expenses of investigations, expenses of Proceedings
and related appeals, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including reasonable
compensation for time spent by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense or appeal of a Proceeding (as defined in Section 1.2 below) or action
for indemnification for which he is not otherwise compensated by the Company or
any third party. The term "Expenses" does not include the amount of judgments,
fines or penalties actually levied against Indemnitee.

               1.2  Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proceeding"
                    ----------                                             
means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or other proceeding,
whether brought in the name of the Company or otherwise and whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or any other type whatsoever.

          2.   Additional Indemnification.  The Company and the Indemnitee agree
               --------------------------                                       
that this Agreement does not replace or supersede prior Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and the Indemnitee to the extent that such
prior Agreement provides additional or broader indemnification coverage.

          3.   Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
               ---------------                                          
Sections 7 and 8, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the following
indemnification by the Company:
<PAGE>
 
               3.1  Third Party Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    -------------------                                    
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that the Indemnitee was or is a director of the Company, or by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, the Company
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding, to the fullest permitted by
the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law, public policy or other
applicable law, including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or
other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency, as the same exists or
may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment).

               3.2  Derivative Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    ------------------                                   
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the
Company to procure a judgment in the Company's favor by reason of the fact that
the Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that
Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of anything done
or not done in any such capacity, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law,
public policy, or other applicable law, including binding regulations and orders
of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or
agency, as the same exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment).

               3.3  Expenses Paid by Insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    --------------------------                           
the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement which have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by directors' and officers' insurance, if any.

               3.4  Duty to Obtain Insurance Coverage.  The Company currently
                    ---------------------------------                        
has and will keep in force a policy of insurance for directors and officers with
a minimum aggregate limit of liability of $10,000,000. The Company shall pay all
premiums, commissions and other costs or charges incurred in obtaining the
endorsement and shall promptly deliver to Indemnitee a certificate of
confirmation of insurance with respect to such policy.

          4.   Partial Indemnification.  If the Indemnitee is entitled to
               -----------------------                                   
indemnification on some claims, issues or matters, but not on others, involved
in a Proceeding, the Company

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Indemnitee concerning those matters
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

          5.   Advancement of Expenses.  The Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
               -----------------------                                         
investigating, defending, or appealing any Proceeding covered hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in advance (unless, in the opinion of regular outside
counsel to the Company, the provisions of applicable law precludes such advance
payment), with the understanding, agreement and undertaking by Indemnitee that
in the event it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee was not entitled
to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, that Indemnitee
shall repay to the Company such amount, or the appropriate portion thereof, so
paid or advanced.

          6.   Notice and Other Indemnification Procedures.
               ------------------------------------------- 

               6.1  Notice to Company.  Promptly after becoming aware of or
                    -----------------                                     
receiving notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any
Proceeding, the indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that
indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Company under this
Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement or threat of
commencement thereof. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such
information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
Indemnitee's power. The omission to so notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee other than under this
Agreement.

               6.2  Notice to Insurer.  At the time of the receipt of a notice
                    -----------------                                     
of the commencement of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to
cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a
result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies, unless
the Company has already paid such amounts directly to the Indemnitee.

               6.3  Choice of Counsel.  If the Company shall be obligated to pay
                    -----------------                                    
the Expenses of any Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which
approval the Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold), upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After
delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of any counsel other than the
counsel approved by the Indemnitee and retained by the Company which may be
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding;
provided that (a) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in any such Proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; and (b) if (1) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the
Company in writing, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Company and the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (3) the Company shall not, in
fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the
Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee shall be payable by the Company.

          7.   Determination of Right to Indemnification.
               ----------------------------------------- 

               7.1  Presumption of Right to Indemnification.  To the extent the
                    ---------------------------------------                    
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement or in the defense
of any claim, issue or matter involved in any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee
shall be presumed to have met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, for
indemnification under this Agreement.

               7.2  Burden of Proof.  If Section 7.1 is inapplicable, the
                    ---------------                                      
Company shall not withhold indemnification pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 of
this Agreement unless (a) the board of directors of the Company shall determine
that California law or other applicable law prohibits the indemnification of
Indemnitee under the terms of this Agreement, or (b) the Company shall receive a
written opinion from independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
the Company to that effect. The Company shall have the burden of proving to such
counsel that indemnification is not available to the Indemnitee as set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any failure between the Indemnitee and the Company to
agree in the selection of the independent legal counsel shall be resolved
pursuant to Sections 7.3 through 7.6 below.

               7.3  Selection of Counsel.  If the Indemnitee and the Company are
                    --------------------                                        
unable to agree on the selection of the independent counsel, such independent
counsel shall be selected by lot from among the ten (10) law firms having the
most lawyers practicing in Los Angeles, California (excluding any firms that
have acted as counsel for the Company). Regular counsel to the Company shall
contact such counsel in order of their selection by lot, requesting each such
firm to accept engagement to make the determination required hereunder until one
of such firms accepts such engagement. The fees for such counsel shall be paid
by the Company.

               7.4  Response of Company.  As soon as practicable, and in no
                    -------------------                                        
event later than 20 days after the selection of independent legal counsel
pursuant to Section 7.3 above, the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to
the independent legal counsel, in such manner as the independent legal counsel
may reasonably request, its claim, if any, that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               7.5  Appeal. Notwithstanding a determination by an independent
                    ------                                                 
legal counsel appointed pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the court in which that Proceeding
is or was pending, or such other court of competent jurisdiction, for the
purpose of enforcing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that a determination by the independent legal
counsel that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct required for

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
indemnification shall not create a presumption, in any subsequent court
proceeding, that the Indemnitee has failed to meet the applicable standard of
conduct.

               7.6  Actions Under Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify the
                    -----------------------                                  
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 7
involving the Indemnitee and against all Expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the
Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that each of the claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in
any such Proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.

          8.   Exceptions.  Any other provision herein to the contrary
               ----------                                             
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement:

               8.1  Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.  To indemnify the Indemnitee
                    ------------------------------                         
with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee
and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any
other statute or law or otherwise;

               8.2  Lack of Good Faith.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any
                    ------------------                                       
Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by
the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the
Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;

               8.3  SEC Limitation.  To indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent
                    --------------                                          
such indemnification would cause the Company to violate any undertaking the
Company makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with respect to
indemnification;

               8.4  Excluded Acts.  To indemnify the Indemnitee as to
                    -------------                                           
circumstances in which indemnification is prohibited pursuant to California law;
or

               8.5  Settlements.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any amount
                    -----------                                              
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the

               ------------

                            DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This Indemnification Agreement ("Agreement"), is effective as of May 18,
1995, and is made by and between YES CLOTHING CO., a California corporation (the
"Company"), and JEFFREY BUSSE (the "Indemnitee").

     WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company serving at
the Company's request;

     WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's services on behalf of the
Company, the Company wishes to provide for the continuing indemnification of the
Indemnitee, and to provide for the continued coverage of the Indemnitee under
the Company's directors and officers' liability insurance policies for the
period and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's service to the
Company, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

          1.   Definitions.
               ----------- 

               1.1  Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, "Expenses" mean
                    --------                                                 
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, accounting and witness fees,
travel and deposition costs, expenses of investigations, expenses of Proceedings
and related appeals, and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, including reasonable
compensation for time spent by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense or appeal of a Proceeding (as defined in Section 1.2 below) or action
for indemnification for which he is not otherwise compensated by the Company or
any third party.  The term "Expenses" does not include the amount of judgments,
fines or penalties actually levied against Indemnitee.

               1.2  Proceeding. For purposes of this Agreement, "Proceeding"
                    ----------
means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or other proceeding,
whether brought in the name of the Company or otherwise and whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or any other type whatsoever.

          2.   Additional Indemnification.  The Company and the Indemnitee agree
               --------------------------                                       
that this Agreement does not replace or supersede prior Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and the Indemnitee to the extent that such
prior Agreement provides additional or broader indemnification coverage.

          3.   Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
               ---------------                                          
Sections 7 and 8, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the following
indemnification by the Company:
<PAGE>
 
               3.1  Third Party Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    -------------------
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that the Indemnitee was or is a director of the Company, or by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of
anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity, the Company
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation,
defense, settlement or appeal of such Proceeding, to the fullest permitted by
the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law, public policy or other
applicable law, including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or
other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency, as the same exists or
may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment).

               3.2  Derivative Actions.  If the Indemnitee was or is a party or
                    ------------------
is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding by or in the right of the
Company to procure a judgment in the Company's favor by reason of the fact that
the Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that
Indemnitee was or is serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another enterprise, or by reason of anything done
or not done in any such capacity, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation, California law,
public policy, or other applicable law, including binding regulations and orders
of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or
agency, as the same exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment).

               3.3  Expenses Paid by Insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    --------------------------
the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement which have been paid
directly to Indemnitee by directors' and officers' insurance, if any.

               3.4  Duty to Obtain Insurance Coverage.  The Company currently
                    ---------------------------------
has and will keep in force a policy of insurance for directors and officers with
a minimum aggregate limit of liability of $10,000,000. The Company shall pay all
premiums, commissions and other costs or charges incurred in obtaining the
endorsement and shall promptly deliver to Indemnitee a certificate of
confirmation of insurance with respect to such policy.

          4.   Partial Indemnification.  If the Indemnitee is entitled to
               -----------------------                                   
indemnification on some claims, issues or matters, but not on others, involved
in a Proceeding, the Company

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Indemnitee concerning those matters
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

          5.   Advancement of Expenses.  The Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in
               -----------------------                                         
investigating, defending, or appealing any Proceeding covered hereunder shall be
paid by the Company in advance (unless, in the opinion of regular outside
counsel to the Company, the provisions of applicable law precludes such advance
payment), with the understanding, agreement and undertaking by Indemnitee that
in the event it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee was not entitled
to be indemnified, or was not entitled to be fully indemnified, that Indemnitee
shall repay to the Company such amount, or the appropriate portion thereof, so
paid or advanced.

          6.   Notice and Other Indemnification Procedures.
               ------------------------------------------- 

               6.1  Notice to Company.  Promptly after becoming aware of or
                    -----------------
receiving notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any
Proceeding, the indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that
indemnification with respect thereto may be sought from the Company under this
Agreement, notify the Company in writing of the commencement or threat of
commencement thereof. In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such
information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within
Indemnitee's power. The omission to so notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee other than under this
Agreement.

               6.2  Notice to Insurer.  At the time of the receipt of a notice
                    -----------------
of the commencement of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, the Company
shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurer
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all reasonably necessary and desirable action to
cause such insurer to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a
result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies, unless
the Company has already paid such amounts directly to the Indemnitee.

               6.3  Choice of Counsel.  If the Company shall be obligated to pay
                    -----------------
the Expenses of any Proceeding, the Company shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which
approval the Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold), upon the delivery to
the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After
delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the
retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the
Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of any counsel other than the
counsel approved by the Indemnitee and retained by the Company which may be
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding;
provided that (a) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel
in any such Proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; and (b) if (1) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the
Company in writing, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there is an actual conflict of interest between the Company and the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (3) the Company shall not, in
fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the
Expenses of Indemnitee's counsel reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee shall be payable by the Company.

          7.   Determination of Right to Indemnification.
               ----------------------------------------- 

               7.1  Presumption of Right to Indemnification.  To the extent the
                    ---------------------------------------                    
Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
Proceeding referred to in Section 3.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement or in the defense
of any claim, issue or matter involved in any such Proceeding, the Indemnitee
shall be presumed to have met the applicable standard of conduct, if any, for
indemnification under this Agreement.

               7.2  Burden of Proof.  If Section 7.1 is inapplicable, the
                    ---------------
Company shall not withhold indemnification pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 of
this Agreement unless (a) the board of directors of the Company shall determine
that California law or other applicable law prohibits the indemnification of
Indemnitee under the terms of this Agreement, or (b) the Company shall receive a
written opinion from independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
the Company to that effect. The Company shall have the burden of proving to such
counsel that indemnification is not available to the Indemnitee as set forth in
the preceding sentence. Any failure between the Indemnitee and the Company to
agree in the selection of the independent legal counsel shall be resolved
pursuant to Sections 7.3 through 7.6 below.

               7.3  Selection of Counsel.  If the Indemnitee and the Company are
                    --------------------                                        
unable to agree on the selection of the independent counsel, such independent
counsel shall be selected by lot from among the ten (10) law firms having the
most lawyers practicing in Los Angeles, California (excluding any firms that
have acted as counsel for the Company).  Regular counsel to the Company shall
contact such counsel in order of their selection by lot, requesting each such
firm to accept engagement to make the determination required hereunder until one
of such firms accepts such engagement.  The fees for such counsel shall be paid
by the Company.

               7.4  Response of Company.  As soon as practicable, and in no
                    -------------------
event later than 20 days after the selection of independent legal counsel
pursuant to Section 7.3 above, the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to
the independent legal counsel, in such manner as the independent legal counsel
may reasonably request, its claim, if any, that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               7.5  Appeal. Notwithstanding a determination by an independent
                    ------
legal counsel appointed pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the court in which that Proceeding
is or was pending, or such other court of competent jurisdiction, for the
purpose of enforcing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company agrees that a determination by the independent legal
counsel that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct required for

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
indemnification shall not create a presumption, in any subsequent court
proceeding, that the Indemnitee has failed to meet the applicable standard of
conduct.

               7.6  Actions Under Agreement.  The Company shall indemnify the
                    -----------------------                                  
Indemnitee against all Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 7
involving the Indemnitee and against all Expenses reasonably and actually
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the
Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless a court of competent
jurisdiction finds that each of the claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in
any such Proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.

          8.   Exceptions.  Any other provision herein to the contrary
               ----------                                             
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement:

               8.1  Claims Initiated by Indemnitee.  To indemnify the Indemnitee
                    ------------------------------
with respect to Proceedings initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee
and not by way of defense, except with respect to Proceedings brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any
other statute or law or otherwise;

               8.2  Lack of Good Faith.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any
                    ------------------     
Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding instituted by
the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the
Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;

               8.3  SEC Limitation.  To indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent
                    --------------
such indemnification would cause the Company to violate any undertaking the
Company makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with respect to
indemnification;

               8.4  Excluded Acts.  To indemnify the Indemnitee as to
                    -------------
circumstances in which indemnification is prohibited pursuant to California law;
or

               8.5  Settlements.  To indemnify the Indemnitee for any amount
                    -----------
paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the

                       EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT



     This Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement") dated as of June 17, 1995, is
entered into between YES Clothing Co., a California corporation ("Company"), and
Georges Marciano ("Optionee").  Reference is made to that certain Employment
Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and Optionee (the
"Employment Agreement").

     1.    GRANT OF OPTION.  The Company hereby grants to Optionee the option
("Option") to purchase upon, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth
herein, all or any part of Two Million (2,000,000) shares of Company's common
stock ("Common Stock") at a price of $1.25 per share.  The Option granted
hereunder is not intended to qualify as an "Incentive Stock Option" within the
meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     2.    TERM AND EXERCISABILITY.  The term of the Option granted hereunder
shall commence as of the date hereof and shall terminate on the tenth
anniversary hereof, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions
set forth herein. Subject to Section 7, the Option shall vest and be exercisable
as follows:

           (a)   41,667 Options will vest on the first day of each month from
                 July 1995 through May 1999;

           (b)   an additional 41,651 Options will vest on June 1, 1999.

     3.    EXERCISE OF OPTION.

           3.1   NOTICE.  The Option shall be exercised by written notice
delivered to the Company stating the number of shares with respect to which the
Option is being exercised, together with the full purchase price of the
applicable shares (i) in cash or by certified or cashier's check payable to the
order of the Company, (ii) by cancellation of indebtedness owed by the Company
to the Optionee, (iii) by delivery of Common Stock of the Company already owned
by, and in the possession of the Optionee, (iv) if authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company, by a promissory note made by the Optionee in favor of
the Company, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Board of
Directors of the Company, secured by the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Option, and in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, (v) by
any combination thereof, or (vi) in such other manner as the Board of Directors
of Company may specify. If the Option is being exercised by any person(s) other
than Optionee, notice shall be accompanied by proof, satisfactory to counsel for
the Company, of the right of the applicable person(s) to exercise the Option.
Not less than one thousand (1000) shares may be purchased at any one time unless
the number purchased is the total number which may be purchased under the Option
and in no event may the Option be exercised with respect to fractional shares.
<PAGE>
 
           3.2   WITHHOLDING TAX.  Optionee may not exercise all or any portion
of the Option granted hereunder unless and until Optionee shall have made all
arrangements which the Company and its counsel shall deem necessary to satisfy
the Company's federal and state income tax withholding obligations, including
paying to the Company the amount of any taxes which the Company may be required
to withhold with respect thereto.

     4.    NONTRANSFERABILITY; DISABILITY OR DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  The Option
shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution and shall be exercisable only by Optionee during his lifetime.
After death, the persons to whom Optionee's rights under the Option shall have
passed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, by will or by the
applicable laws of descent and distribution or the executor or administrator of
Optionee's estate, shall have the right to exercise the Option, pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

     5.    PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP.  Optionee shall have no rights as a
stockholder with respect to the Common Stock until the date of issuance of stock
certificates to Optionee.  No adjustment will be made for dividends or other
rights for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificates are
issued.

     6.    HOLDING OF STOCK AFTER EXERCISE OF OPTION.  At the discretion of the
Company, the Company may at any time require that Optionee, or any person
acquiring shares upon exercise of the Option, by accepting this Option,
represents and agrees that none of the shares acquired upon exercise of this
Option will be acquired with a view to any sale, transfer or distribution of
said shares in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and Optionee, or the person
entitled to exercise the same, shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the
Company (including a written and signed representation) to that effect in form
and substance satisfactory to the Company and its counsel, including an
indemnification of the Company in the event of any violation of the Securities
Act of 1933 by such person.  A legend to the foregoing effect shall be placed
upon any shares received upon exercise of this Option.

     7.    TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT/VESTING.  Any portion of this Option not
then vested shall be cancelled at such time as Optionee is neither an employee
of the Company nor a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. In the
event of termination, any Options previously vested may be exercised for a
period of 90 days thereafter.

     8.    ADJUSTMENTS.

           8.1   If the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company
are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities of the Company through a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar transaction, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made in the maximum number and kind of shares as to which all or any
portion of this Option may be exercised hereunder. Any such adjustment in the
outstanding shares under this Option shall be made without change to the
aggregate

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
purchase price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Option but with a
corresponding adjustment in the purchase price for each share covered by the
Option.

           8.2   This Agreement shall terminate and any portion of the Option
granted hereunder not then vested (or not vested due to the events set forth
below) shall be cancelled upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or
upon a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company with one or more
corporations as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation,
or upon the sale of substantially all the property or more than eighty percent
of the then outstanding stock of the Company to another corporation.

           8.3   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the
Company may provide in writing in connection with such transaction for any or
all of the following alternatives (separately or in combination): (i) for the
Option to become immediately exercisable; (ii) for the assumption by the
successor corporation of the Option or the substitution by such corporation for
the Option or new stock options covering the stock of the successor corporation,
or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number
and kind of shares and prices; or (iii) for the continuance of the Option by
such successor corporation in which event the Option granted hereunder shall
continue in the manner and under the terms so provided.

           8.4   Adjustments under this Section 8 shall be made by the Board of
Directors of the Company, whose determination as to what adjustments shall be
made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive.  No
fractional shares of stock shall be issued hereunder on any such adjustment.

     9.    NOTICES.  Any notice to the Company provided for in this Agreement
shall be addressed to it in care of its President at its main office, and any
notice to Optionee shall be addressed to Optionee's address on file with the

                         COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT
<PAGE>
 
     WARRANT AGREEMENT dated as of June 17, 1995, between YES Clothing Co., a
California corporation (the "Company"), the Company as Warrant Agent, and
Georges Marciano (the "Warrant Holder" or "Holder").

     The Company proposes to issue the Common Stock Purchase Warrant as
hereinafter described (the "Warrant") to purchase an aggregate of up to
2,000,000 shares of its Common Stock (the "Common Stock"), no par value per
share (the shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrant being
referred to herein as the "Warrant Shares"), in favor of Warrant Holder.

     In consideration of the benefits and services provided to the Company by
the Warrant Holder, and for the purpose of defining the terms and provisions of
the Warrant and the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Company
and the Holder, the Company and the Warrant Holder hereby agree as follows:

     SECTION 1.     TRANSFERABILITY AND FORM OF THE WARRANT.

             1.1    REGISTRATION.  The Warrant shall be numbered and shall be
registered on the books of the Company maintained at the principal office of the
Company in Los Angeles, California ("the Warrant Register").  The Company shall
be entitled to treat the Holder of the Warrant as the owner in fact thereof for
all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to
or interest in such Warrant on the part of any other person, and shall not be
liable for any Company registration or transfer of Warrant which is registered
or to be registered in the name of a fiduciary or the nominee of a fiduciary
unless made with the actual knowledge that a fiduciary or nominee is committing
a breach of trust in requesting such registration or transfer, or with such
knowledge of such facts that its participation therein amounts to bad faith.

             1.2    TRANSFER--GENERAL.  Subject to the terms hereof, the Warrant
shall be transferable only on the books of the Company maintained at its
principal office upon delivery thereof duly endorsed by the Holder or by his
duly authorized attorney or representative, or accompanied by proper evidence of
succession, assignment or authority to transfer.  In all cases of transfer by an
attorney, the original power of attorney, duly approved, or a copy thereof, duly
certified, shall be deposited and remain with the Company.  In case of transfer
by executors, administrators, guardians or other legal representatives, duly
authenticated evidence of their authority shall be produced, and may be required
to be deposited and to remain with the Company in its discretion.  Upon any
registration of transfer, the Company shall countersign and deliver a new
Warrant to the persons entitled thereto.  The Company or the Warrant Agent may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with any such transfer.

             1.3    TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.  The Holder may provide for the
transfer of the Warrant only as may be permitted under applicable federal and
state securities laws.
<PAGE>
 
             1.4    FORM OF THE WARRANT.  The text of the Warrant and of the
form of election to purchase Warrant Shares (the "Purchase Form") shall be
substantially as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. The price per Warrant
Share and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant
are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, all as
hereinafter provided. The Warrant shall be executed on behalf of the Company by
its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced
thereon, and attested by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

                    The Warrant shall be dated as of the date of
countersignature thereof by the Company either upon initial issuance or upon
transfer.

     SECTION 2.     TERM OF THE WARRANT; EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT; WARRANT PRICE,
                    ETC.

             2.1    TERM OF THE WARRANT. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
the Holder shall have the right, which may be exercised from time to time, until
a date two years from the date hereof, to purchase from the Company the number
of fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares which the Holder may at the time
be entitled to purchase on exercise of such Warrant. If the last day for the
exercise of the Warrant shall not be a business day, then the Warrant may be
exercised on the next succeeding business day.

             2.2    EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT.  The Warrant may be exercised upon
surrender to the Company, at its principal office, of the certificate evidencing
the Warrant to be exercised, together with the Purchase Form on the reverse
thereof duly filled in and signed, and upon payment to the Company, of the
Warrant Price (as defined in and determined in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 2 and 6 hereof), for the number of Warrant Shares in respect of which
such Warrant is then exercised.   Upon partial exercise, a Warrant Certificate
for the unexercised portion shall be delivered to the Holder.  Payment of the
aggregate Warrant Price shall be made in cash, by certified or official bank
check.

                    Subject to Section 3 hereof, upon such surrender of the
Warrant and payment of the Warrant Price as aforesaid, the Company shall issue
and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written
order of the Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate, a
certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares so purchased
upon the exercise of such Warrant, together with cash, as provided in Section 7
hereof, in respect of any fractional Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon such
surrender. Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued
and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become
a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date of the surrender of
such Warrant and payment of the Warrant Price, as aforesaid; provided, however,
                                                             --------  -------
that if, at the date of surrender of such Warrant and payment of such Warrant
Price, the transfer books for the Warrant Shares or other class of stock
purchasable upon the exercise of such Warrant shall be closed, the certificates
for the Warrant Shares in respect of which such Warrant are then exercised shall
be issuable as of the date on which such books shall next be opened (whether
before or after the Expiration Date) and until such date the Company shall be
under no duty to deliver any

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
certificate for such Warrant Shares; provided, further, that the transfer books
                                     --------  -------                         
of record, unless otherwise required by law, shall not be closed at any one time
for a period longer than 20 calendar days.

             2.3    COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.  Holder acknowledges
that none of the Warrant or Warrant Shares has been registered under the
Securities Act, and may be sold or disposed of in the absence of such
registration only pursuant to an exemption from such registration and in
accordance with this Agreement.  The Warrant and the Warrant Shares will bear a
legend to the following effect:

     "THE SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAS NOT BEEN
     REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
     "ACT"). NO SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OR PLEDGE OF THESE
     SECURITIES OR THE SECURITIES UNDERLYING THESE SECURITIES CAN BE
     EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING
     THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY OR A
     NO ACTION LETTER OR INTERPRETIVE OPINION OF THE STAFF OF THE
     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
     REQUIRED UNDER THE ACT."

             2.4    WARRANT PRICE.  The price per share at which Warrant Shares
shall be purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant (the "Warrant Price") shall be
$1.25, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 6 hereof.

             2.5    SHAREHOLDERS APPROVAL.  This Warrant may only be exercised
after the grant hereof has been approved by a vote of the Company's
shareholders.  The Company covenants to seek shareholder approval as soon as
possible.

     SECTION 3.     PAYMENT OF TAXES.  The Company will pay all documentary
stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant and Warrant
Shares upon the exercise of Warrant; provided, however, that the Company shall
                                     --------  -------
not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue or delivery of the Warrant or certificates for
Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the Holder of such Warrant.

     SECTION 4.     MUTILATED OR MISSING WARRANT.  In case the Warrant shall be
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue and deliver in
exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant, or
in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant lost, stolen or destroyed, a new
Warrant certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent right or
interest; but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of such loss, theft or destruction of such Warrant certificate and
indemnity or bond, if requested, also reasonably satisfactory to them.  An
applicant for such substitute Warrant certificate shall also comply with such
other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the
Company may prescribe.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
     SECTION 5.     RESERVATION OF WARRANT SHARES.

             5.1    RESERVATION OF WARRANT SHARES.  There have been reserved,
and the Company shall at all times keep reserved, out of its authorized shares
of Common Stock, a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to provide for
the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the outstanding Warrant.
The transfer agent for the Common Stock ("Transfer Agent"), and every subsequent
transfer agent for any shares of the Company's capital stock issuable upon the
exercise of any of the rights of purchase aforesaid will be and are hereby
irrevocably authorized and directed at all times until the Expiration Date to
reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be requisite for such purpose.
The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the Transfer Agent
and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Company's capital
stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase represented by the
Warrant. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon
exercise of Warrant will, upon issue, be fully paid, nonassessable, free of
preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests
with respect to the issue thereof. The Company will supply such Transfer Agent
and any subsequent transfer agent with duly executed stock certificates for such
purpose and will itself provide or otherwise make available any cash which may
be payable as provided in Section 7 of this Agreement. The Company will furnish
to such Transfer Agent a copy of all notices of adjustments, and certificates
related thereto, transmitted to each Holder. The Warrant surrendered in the
exercise of the rights thereby evidenced shall be cancelled by the Company.

             5.2    CANCELLATION OF THE WARRANT.  In the event the Company shall
purchase or otherwise acquire the Warrant, the same shall be cancelled and
retired.

     SECTION 6.     ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE AND NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES.
The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant
and the Warrant Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the
happening of certain events, as hereinafter defined.

             6.1    MECHANICAL ADJUSTMENTS.  The number of Warrant Shares
purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant and the Warrant Price shall be
subject to adjustment as follows:

                    (a)     In case the Company shall at any time after the date
     of this Agreement (i) declare or pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock
     or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide its
     outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of
     Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock or (iv) issue
     any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock
     (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or
     merger in which the Company is the continuing entity), the number of
     Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant immediately prior
     thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder of the Warrant shall be
     entitled to receive the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other
     securities of the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
     Company which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive after
     the happening of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been
     exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record
     date with respect thereto.  An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph
     (a) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such
     event retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event.

                    (b)     In case the Company shall issue rights, options or
     warrants to holders of its outstanding Common Stock entitling them (for a
     period within 45 days after the record date mentioned below) to subscribe
     for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share which is lower
     at the record date mentioned below than the then current market price per
     share of Common Stock (as defined in paragraph (e) below), the number of
     Warrant Shares thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant
     shall be determined by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares theretofore
     purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant by a fraction, of which the
     numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
     date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants plus the number of
     additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and
     of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
     outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants
     plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total
     number of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at the current
     market price per share of Common Stock at such record date. Such
     adjustments shall be made whenever such rights, options or warrants are
     issued, and shall become effective immediately after the record date for
     the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options
     or warrants.

                    (c)     In case the Company shall distribute to holders of
     its shares of Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets
     (excluding cash dividends or distributions payable out of consolidated
     earnings or earned surplus legally available for payment of dividends at
     the time of any such payment or distribution, but excluding dividends or
     distributions referred to in paragraph (a) above or in the paragraph
     immediately following this paragraph) or rights, options or warrants, or
     convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe
     for or purchase shares of Common Stock (excluding those referred to in
     paragraph (b) above), then in each case the number of Warrant Shares
     thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be determined
     by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares theretofore purchasable upon
     the exercise of the Warrant by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be
     the then current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in
     paragraph (e) below) on the date of such distribution, and of which the
     denominator shall be the then current market price per share of Common
     Stock, less the then fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors of
     the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the
     assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription
     rights, options or warrants, or of such convertible or exchangeable
     securities applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall
     be made whenever any such distribution is

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
     made, and shall become effective on the date of distribution retroactive to
     the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive
     such distribution.

                    In the event of a distribution by the Company to holders of
     its shares of Common Stock of stock of a subsidiary or securities
     convertible into or exercisable for such stock, then in lieu of an
     adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of
     the Warrant, the Holder of the Warrant, upon the exercise thereof at any
     time after such distribution, shall be entitled to receive from the
     Company, such subsidiary or both, as the Company shall determine, the stock
     or other securities to which such Holder would have been entitled if such
     Holder had exercised such Warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to
     further adjustment as provided in this Section 6.1; provided, however, that
                                                                   ------- 
     no adjustment in respect of dividends or interest on such stock or other
     securities shall be made during the term of a Warrant or upon the exercise
     of a Warrant other than adjustments required by this Section 6.

                    (d)     In case the Company shall issue shares of Common
     Stock or rights, options or warrants containing the right to subscribe for
     or purchase shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common
     Stock (excluding (i) shares, rights, options, warrants or convertible
     securities issued in any of the transactions described in paragraphs (a),
     (b) or (c) above, or (ii) Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of the
     Warrant), for a price per share of Common Stock, in the case of the
     issuance of Common Stock, or for a price per share of Common Stock
     initially deliverable upon conversion or exchange of such securities less
     than the then current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined in
     paragraph (e) below) on the date the Company fixed the offering, conversion
     or exchange price of such additional shares, the number of Warrant Shares
     thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant shall be determined
     by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares theretofore purchasable upon
     exercise of the Warrant by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the
     number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date plus the number
     of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase,
     and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
     outstanding on such date plus the number of shares which the aggregate
     offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered
     would purchase at the current market price per share of Common Stock at
     such record date. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares,
     rights, options or warranties are issued, and shall become effective
     immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to the
     record date, if any, for such event.

                    (e)     For the purpose of any computation under paragraphs
     (b), (c) and (d) of this Section, the current market price per share of
     Common Stock at any date shall be the average of the daily closing prices
     for 10 consecutive trading days commencing 12 trading days before the date
     of such computation. The closing price for each day shall be the last such
     reported sales price regular way or, in case no such reported sale takes
     place on such day, the average of the closing bid and

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
     asked prices regular way for such day, in each case on the principal
     national securities exchange or in the NASDAQ National Market System to
     which the shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if
     not listed or admitted to trading, the average of the closing bid and asked
     prices of the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by
     NASDAQ or any comparable system, or if the Common Stock is not listed on
     NASDAQ or a comparable system, the average of the closing bid and asked
     prices as furnished by two members of the National Association of
     Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by the Board of
     Directors of the Company for that purpose.  In the absence of one or more
     such quotations, the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine the
     current market price on the basis of such quotations as it considers
     appropriate or in the case of securities which are not quoted, the Board of
     Directors of the Company shall determine the current market price based
     upon such information and advice as it considers appropriate.  In the case
     of rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, the
     price per share of Common Stock shall be determined by dividing (x) the
     total amount received or receivable by the Company in consideration of the
     sale and issuance of such rights, options, warrants or convertible or
     exchangeable securities, plus the total consideration payable to the
     Company upon exercise or conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total
     number of shares of Common Stock covered by such rights, options, warrants
     or convertible or exchangeable securities.

                    (f)     Whenever the number of Warrant Shares purchasable
     upon the exercise of the Warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the
     Warrant Price payable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted by
     multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a
     fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of Warrant Shares
     purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such
     adjustment, and of which the denominator shall be the number of Warrant
     Shares purchasable immediately thereafter.

                    (g)     In case the Company shall sell or issue shares of
     Common Stock or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable
     securities containing the right to subscribe or purchase shares of Common
     Stock in the following situations:

                         (i)    to officers, directors, consultants or employees
                   of the Company pursuant to an employee stock option plan
                   approved by the Company's shareholders either at a price not
                   less than 90% of the current market price of the Company's
                   Common Stock or in an amount (taking into account all prior
                   sales or issuances excluded pursuant to this clause (i)) not
                   greater than 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock
                   outstanding on a fully diluted basis; or

                         (ii)   to sellers of assets or interests in other
                   enterprises in exchange for such assets or interests,

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
     there shall be no adjustment in the Warrant Price or the number of Warrant
     Shares either upon the initial issuance of such securities or upon the
     exercise or conversion thereof.

                    (h)     No adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares
     purchasable hereunder shall be required unless such adjustment would result
     in an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Warrant
     Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this
            --------  -------              
     paragraph (h) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and
     taken into account in any subsequent adjustment or upon exercise of the
     Warrant. All calculations shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
     nearest one-thousandth of a share, as the case may be.

                    (i)     No adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares
     purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant need be made under paragraphs
     (b), (c), or (d) if the Company issues or distributes to the Holder of the
     Warrant the shares, rights, options, warrants, or convertible or
     exchangeable securities, or evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to
     in those paragraphs which the Holder of the Warrant would have been
     entitled to receive had the Warrant been exercised prior to the happening
     of such event or the record date with respect thereto. No adjustment in the
     number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant need
     be made for sales of Warrant Shares pursuant to a Company plan for
     reinvestment of dividends or interest. No adjustment need be made for a
     change in the par value of the Warrant Shares.

                    (j)     For the purpose of this Section 6.1, the term
     "shares of Common Stock" shall mean (i) the class of stock designated as
     the Common Stock of the Company at the date of this Agreement, or (ii) any
     other class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications
     of such shares consisting solely of changes from no par value to par value,
     changes in par value, or changes from par value to no par value. In the
     event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to
     paragraph (a) above, the Holder shall become entitled to purchase any
     securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, thereafter the
     number of such other shares so purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant and
     the Warrant Price of such shares shall be subject to adjustment from time
     to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the
     provisions with respect to the Warrant Shares contained in paragraphs (a)
     through (h), inclusive, above, and the provisions of Section 2 and Sections
     6.2 through 6.3, inclusive, with respect to the Warrant Shares, shall apply
     on like terms to any such other securities; provided, however, that the
                                                 --------  -------
     Warrant Price shall at no time be less than the par value of the Common
     Stock of the Company; provided, further, that the Company shall reduce the
                           --------  -------
     par value of its Common Stock from time to time as necessary so that such
     par value shall not be more than the Warrant Price then in effect.

                    (k)     Upon the expiration of any rights, options, warrants
     or conversion or exchange privileges, the issuance of which required an
     adjustment in

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
     the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the
     Warrant, if any thereof shall not have been exercised, the Warrant Price
     and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of
     the Warrant shall, upon such expiration, be readjusted and shall thereafter
     be such as it would have been had it been originally adjusted (or had the
     original adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if (A) the
     only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock, if
     any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights, options,
     warrants or conversion or exchange rights and (B) such shares of Common
     Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received
     by the Company upon such exercise plus the aggregate consideration, if any,
     actually received by the Company for the issuance, sale or grant of all
     such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange rights whether or
     not exercised; provided, however, that no such readjustment shall have the
                    --------  -------                                          
     effect of increasing the Warrant Price or decreasing the number of shares
     of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant by an amount
     in excess of the amount of the adjustment initially made in respect to the
     issuance, sale or grant of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or
     exchange rights, and provided further that the issuance of shares of Common
     Stock pursuant to rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange
     rights shall not be cause for additional adjustments beyond the adjustments
     provided in respect of the initial issuance of the rights, options,
     warrants or conversion or exchange rights.

             6.2    NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENT.  Whenever the number of Warrant Shares
purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant or the Warrant Price of such
Warrant Shares is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall mail by first
class, postage prepaid, to each Holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments
and shall deliver to the Holder a copy of a certificate of either the Board of
Directors of the Company or of a firm of independent public accountants selected
by the Board of Directors of the Company (who may be the regular accountants
employed by the Company) setting forth the number of Warrant Shares purchasable
upon the exercise of the Warrant and the Warrant Price of such Warrant Shares
after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring
such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was
made.  Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such
adjustment in the absence of manifest error.

             6.3    NO ADJUSTMENT FOR DIVIDENDS.  Except as provided in Section
6.1, no adjustment in respect of any dividends shall be made during the term of
a Warrant or upon the exercise or conversion of a Warrant.

             6.4    PRESERVATION OF PURCHASE RIGHTS UPON MERGER, CONSOLIDATION,
ETC.  In case of any consolidation of the Company with or merger of the Company
into another corporation or in case of any sale, transfer or lease to another
corporation of all or substantially all the property of the Company, the Company
or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute
an amendment to this Agreement that each Holder shall have the right thereafter
upon payment of the Warrant Price in effect

                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
immediately prior to such action to purchase upon exercise of the Warrant the
kind and amount of shares and other securities and property which he would have
owned or have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or lease had such Warrant been exercised immediately
prior to such action; provided, however, that no adjustment in respect of
                      --------  -------                                  
dividends, interest or other income on or from such shares or other securities
and property shall be made during the term of a Warrant or upon the exercise of
a Warrant.  Such agreement shall provide for adjustments, which shall be as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this
Section 6.  The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall similarly apply to
successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or leases.

             6.5    STATEMENT ON THE WARRANT.  Irrespective of any adjustments
in the Warrant Price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon the
exercise of the Warrant, the Warrant theretofore or thereafter issued may
continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated
in the Warrant initially issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.     FRACTIONAL INTERESTS.  The Company shall not be required to
issue fractional Warrant Shares on the exercise of the Warrant.  If any fraction
of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 7, be
issuable on the exercise of the Warrant (or specified portion thereof), the
Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the closing price for one share of
the Common Stock, as defined in paragraph (e) of Section 6.1, on the trading day
immediately preceding the date the Warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied
by such fraction.

     SECTION 8.     NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER; NOTICES TO HOLDER.  Nothing
contained in this Agreement or in the Warrant shall be construed as conferring
upon the Holder or his permitted transferees the right to vote or to receive
dividends or to consent to or receive notice as a stockholder in respect of any
meeting of stockholders for the election of directors of the Company or any
other matter, or any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company.

copies of this Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available
for inspection by the Holder during normal business hours at its principal
office.

     SECTION 10.    IDENTITY OF TRANSFER AND WARRANT AGENT.  Forthwith upon the
appointment of any subsequent transfer agent for the Common Stock or Warrant
Agent, or any other shares of the Company's capital stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Warrant, the Company will notify the Holder of the name and
address of such subsequent transfer agent.

     SECTION 11.    NOTICES.  Any notice pursuant to this Agreement by any
Holder to the Company, shall be in writing and shall be mailed first class,
postage prepaid, or delivered to

Warrant remains outstanding, the Company will not merge or consolidate with or
into, or sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property to,

case may be (if not the Company), shall expressly assume, by supplemental
agreement, the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every
covenant and condition of this Agreement to be performed and observed by the
Company.

"overadvances") in excess of amounts to which YES is entitled under the terms of
the Factoring Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, MARCIANO and his affiliates are shareholders of YES; and

     WHEREAS, MARCIANO is willing to provide a letter of credit in favor of

monies to YES, the repayment of which advances is secured by a security interest
in certain assets of YES granted by YES to REPUBLIC; and

     WHEREAS, YES has requested REPUBLIC to advance certain sums (the
"Overadvances") in excess of amounts, in REPUBLIC's discretion, otherwise
available to YES under the terms of the Factoring Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, REPUBLIC is willing to provide YES with the overadvances, in its
discretion and in accordance with the Factoring Agreement, if YES or a third
party provides a letter of credit in favor of REPUBLIC to support additional
extensions of credit; and

     WHEREAS, MARCIANO and his affiliates are shareholders of YES;

     WHEREAS, MARCIANO has previously established a letter of credit in favor of
REPUBLIC pursuant to the terms of a Three Party Agreement, dated as of June 12,
1995 (the "June 12 Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, MARCIANO is willing to provide a second letter of credit in favor
of REPUBLIC to support further Overadvances to YES, provided that YES and
REPUBLIC agree that any sums drawn under such letter of credit benefit from and
succeed to the security supporting the Factoring Agreement, subject only to the

contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as
follows:

Letter of Credit, MARCIANO shall be subrogated to and shall benefit from any and
all security held by REPUBLIC for the repayment of indebtedness of YES and,
subject to the prior right of repayment of REPUBLIC, MARCIANO shall stand in the
place of REPUBLIC with respect to such security (such rights, when taken
together with MARCIANO's rights in the security arising under the June 12
Agreement, referred to hereinafter collectively as the "Subrogation Rights";
provided, that MARCIANO's Subrogation Rights with respect to security held by
- --------
REPUBLIC for the repayment of indebtedness shall only be enforceable after, and

To The Board of Directors
YES Clothing Co.
1380 West Washington Boulevard
Los Angeles, CA  90007

Gentlemen:

We understand that YES Clothing Co. (the "Company" or "YES") has entered into an
agreement with its largest shareholder, Georges Marciano ("Marciano"), whereby
Marciano has agreed to:

     a)   become Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman of the Board
          ("CoB") of the Company;
     b)   provide additional capital for the Company; and
     c)   license to YES certain trademarks controlled by Marciano affiliates.

With respect to Marciano becoming Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board, we understand that Marciano will receive:

     a)   $1 per year in salary; and

     b)   options to acquire 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock per
          year at $1.25 per share, vesting monthly during continued employment
          for up to four additional years, (the "Executive Options").

With respect to Marciano providing additional capital to the Company, we
understand that Marciano agreed to:

     a)   contribute $3,300,000 in new capital in exchange for 2,640,000 shares
          of YES' common stock; and
     b)   convert approximately $700,000 owed by the Company to Marciano into
          additional shares of YES' common stock valued at $1.25 per share.

With respect to Marciano licensing to YES certain trademarks controlled by
Marciano affiliates, we understand that the Company has entered into five year
trademark license agreement for Marciano's "GM Surf" and "Misfits" lines of
clothing at royalties of 7 percent of gross sales, plus an additional 2 percent
for advertising.

To the Board of Directors
YES Clothing Co.
July 10, 1995                                                                -2-


Marciano becoming CEO and CoB of YES, Marciano providing additional capital to
YES, the Company's granting of the Executive Options, and Marciano entering into
licensing agreements with YES is collectively referred to herein as the
"Restructuring".  In connection with the Restructuring, we understand that the
Company has granted Marciano a two year option to acquire an additional
2,000,000 shares of YES' common stock at $1.25 per share, (the "Additional
Options").

Finally, we understand that the Company is publicly traded on the NASD National
Market System (the "NASD NMS"), and has received a notice of potential delisting
from the NASD NMS because its net worth has fallen below minimum listing
standards.  However, we understand that the capital infusion associated with the
Restructuring may provide YES with sufficient capital to avoid such action by
the NASD NMS.  Moreover, we understand that Moss-Adams, the Company's outside
auditors, has indicated that it would issue a qualified opinion for the
Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1995 without the completion of at least a
portion of the Restructuring.  The Restructuring and the Company's granting of
the Additional Options are collectively referred to herein as the Transaction.

You have requested our opinion (the "Opinion") as to the matters set forth
below.  This Opinion does not address the Company's underlying business decision
to effect the Transaction.  We have not been requested to, and did not, solicit
third party indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of the Company.
Furthermore, at your request, we have not negotiated the Transaction or advised
you with respect to alternatives to it.  We understand that shareholder approval
will be sought for the Executive Options and the Additional Options and that
this Opinion will be used in connection with seeking such shareholder approval.

In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and
inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
Among other things, we have:

     a)   met with senior management and toured the Company's warehouse;

     b)   toured Georges Marciano's Beverly Hills store, which sells YES
          merchandise;

     c)   reviewed the Company's 10K and annual report for the five fiscal years
          ended March 31, 1994;

     d)   reviewed a draft of the Company's 10K for the fiscal year ended March
          31, 1995;

     e)   reviewed the Company's internal projections for the year ended March
          31, 1996;

     f)   reviewed the Company's weekly cash flow projections for May 1995
          through July 1995;

     g)   reviewed Republic Factors', (the Company's factor), cash availability
          schedule for February 1995 through June 1995;

     h)   reviewed copies of the following agreements:

               the Employment Agreement between YES and Marciano,

               the Executive Stock Option Agreement for 2,000,000 shares vesting
               monthly over a four year term, at $1.25 per share,

               the Warrant Agreement for 2,000,000 shares at $1.25 per share for
               a two year term, and

               the License Agreement between Marble Sportswear and YES for the
               license of the GM Surf and Misfits trademarks at 7 percent
               royalty plus 2 percent advertising;

     i)   reviewed analyst reports, financial information, trading information,
          and market pricing for the Company, for companies we consider
          comparable to the Company, and for other participants in the apparel
          industry; and

     j)   conducted other studies that we deemed appropriate.

We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the
financial forecasts and projections provided to us have been reasonably prepared
and reflect the best currently available estimates of the future financial
results and condition of the Company, and that there has been no material change
in the assets, financial condition, business or prospects of the Company since
the date of the most recent financial statements made available to us.

We have not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of the
information supplied to us with respect to the Company and do not assume any
responsibility with respect to it.  We have not made any physical inspection or
independent appraisal of any of the properties or assets of the Company.  Our
opinion is necessarily based on business, economic, market and other conditions
as they exist and can be evaluated by us at the date of this letter.

Based upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, it is our opinion that:

     a)   the fair market value of the Company's common stock prior to and
          without giving effect to the Transaction is not more than $1.25 per
          share; and
     b)   the Transaction is fair to the Company and the Company's shareholders,
          other than Marciano and Marciano's affiliates, from a financial point
          of view.
