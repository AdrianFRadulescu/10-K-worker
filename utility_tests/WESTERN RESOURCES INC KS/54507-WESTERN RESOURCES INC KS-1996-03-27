ITEM 1.  BUSINESS


ACQUISITION AND MERGER
     On March 31, 1992, Western Resources, Inc. (formerly the Kansas Power
and Light Company) (the Company) through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA) acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KGE) (the Merger). Simultaneously, KCA and
Kansas Gas and Electric Company merged and adopted the name Kansas Gas and
Electric Company (KGE).

     Additional information relating to the Merger can be found in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

GENERAL

   The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, include KPL, a rate
regulated electric and gas division of the Company, KGE, a rate regulated
electric utility and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Westar
companies, non-utility subsidiaries, and Mid Continent Market Center, Inc.
(Market Center), a regulated gas transmission service provider.  KGE owns 47%
of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC), the operating Company for
Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  Corporate headquarters of the
Company are located at 818  Kansas Avenue, Topeka, Kansas 66612.  At December
31, 1995, the Company had 4,047 employees.

   The Company is an investor-owned holding Company.  The Company is engaged
principally in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale
of electricity and the delivery and sale of natural gas.  The Company serves
approximately 601,000 electric customers in eastern and central Kansas and
approximately 648,000 natural gas customers in Kansas and northeastern
Oklahoma. The Company's non-utility subsidiaries market natural gas primarily
to large commercial and industrial customers, provide electronic security
services, and provide other energy-related products and services.  The Company
has acquired 30.8 million shares of common stock of ADT Limited, representing
approximately 24% of ADT's outstanding common shares.  ADT's principal
business is providing electronic security services.

    In January 1996, the KCC initiated an order for a generic investigation
to analyze matters related to the potential restructuring of the electric
industry and the overall implications to both utilities and public interests
within the State of Kansas.  This order was initiated given recent
developments at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), other state
regulatory agencies and increased competition among utilities related to large
industrial electric customers.  The order was established as a means to define
the KCC's role within the electric generation industry as it may become more
competitive, and address any developments as they may occur.  Currently, there
are no proceedings or actions at the KCC which would open the Company's
current electric markets to greater competition, nor establish guidelines as
to a change in the degree of regulatory oversight that the KCC has on the
Company's operations.

<PAGE 4>
   For discussion regarding competition in the electric utility industry and
the potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Other Information,
Competition.

   To capitalize on opportunities in the non-regulated natural gas industry,
the Company established Market Center.  Market Center, which began operations
on July 1, 1995, provides natural gas transportation, storage, and gathering
services, as well as balancing and title transfer capability.  The Company
transferred certain natural gas transmission assets having a net book value of
approximately $50 million to the Market Center.  Market Center will provide no
notice natural gas transportation and storage services to the Company under a
long-term contract. 

   On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to
United Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The
properties sold to Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as
the "Missouri Properties."  With the sales, the Company is no longer operating
as a utility in the State of Missouri.

   The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was
sold for $404 million.  United Cities purchased the Company's natural gas
distribution system in and around the City of Palmyra, Missouri for $665,000.  
                 
   As a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties, as described in Note
2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognized a
gain of approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, ($0.31 per share) and ceased
recording the results of operations for the Missouri Properties during the
first quarter of 1994.  Consequently, the Company's results of operations for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1994 are not comparable to the results of
operations for the same period ending December 31, 1993.                       
   
   The following table reflects, through the dates of the sales of the
Missouri Properties, the approximate operating revenues and operating income
for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, and net utility plant at
December 31, 1993, related to the Missouri Properties (See Notes 2 and 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein):

   Separate audited financial information was not kept by the Company for the
Missouri Properties.  This unaudited financial information is based on
assumptions and allocations of expenses of the Company as a whole.

   The following information includes the operations of KGE since March 31,
1992 and excludes the activities related to the Missouri Properties following
the sales of those properties in the first quarter of 1994.

<PAGE 5>
   The percentages of Total Operating Revenues and Operating Income Before
Income Taxes attributable to the Company's electric and natural gas operations
for the past five years were as follows:

                           Total                       Operating Income
                     Operating Revenues               Before Income Taxes

      1994           69%          31%                  97%           3%  
      1993           58%          42%                  85%          15%
      1992           57%          43%                  89%          11%
      1991           41%          59%                  84%          16%

   The difference between the percentage of electric operating revenues to
total operating revenues and the percentage of electric operating income to
total operating income as compared to the same percentages for natural gas
operations is due to the Company's level of investment in plant and its fuel
costs in each of these segments.  The reduction in the percentages for the
natural gas operations in 1994 is due to the sales of the Missouri Properties. 
The increase in the percentages for the electric operations in 1992 is due to
the Merger. 

   The amount of the Company's plant in service (net of accumulated
depreciation) at December 31, for each of the past five years was as follows:

     recognition.  The cumulative effect of this change increased electric
     sales by 256,000 MWH for 1991.

   The Company's electric revenues for the last five years were as follows
(includes KGE since March 31, 1992):

                  1995         1994         1993        1992        1991

Capacity

   The aggregate net generating capacity of the Company's system is presently
5,240 megawatts (MW).  The system comprises interests in 22 fossil fueled
steam generating units, one nuclear generating unit (47% interest), seven
combustion peaking turbines and one diesel generator located at eleven
generating stations.  Two units of the 22 fossil fueled units (aggregating 100
MW of capacity) have been "mothballed" for future use (See Item 2.
Properties).

   The Company's 1995 peak system net load occurred August 28, 1995 and
amounted to 3,979 MW.  The Company's net generating capacity together with
power available from firm interchange and purchase contracts, provided a
capacity margin of approximately 19% above system peak responsibility at the
time of the peak.
   
   The Company and ten companies in Kansas and western Missouri have agreed
to provide capacity (including margin), emergency and economy services for
each other.  This arrangement is called the MOKAN Power Pool.  The pool
participants also coordinate the planning of electric generating and
transmission facilities.
<PAGE 7>
   The Company is one of 47 members of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).  SPP's
responsibility is to maintain system reliability on a regional basis.  The
region encompasses areas within the eight states of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.    
   
   In 1994, the Company joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP).  Under
this arrangement, over 103 electric utilities and marketers throughout the
western United States have agreed to market energy and to provide transmission
services.  WSPP's intent is to increase the efficiency of the interconnected
power systems operations over and above existing operations.  Services
available include short-term and long-term economy energy transactions, unit
commitment service, firm capacity and energy sales, energy exchanges, and
transmission service by intermediate systems.

   In January 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority (OMPA), whereby, the Company received a prepayment
of approximately $41 million for capacity (42 MW) and transmission charges
through the year 2013.

   During 1994, KGE entered into an agreement with Midwest Energy, Inc.
(MWE), whereby KGE will provide MWE with peaking capacity of 61 MW through the
year 2008.  KGE also entered into an agreement with Empire District Electric
Company (Empire), whereby KGE will provide Empire with peaking and base load
capacity (20 MW in 1994 increasing to 80 MW in 2000) through the year 2000. 
In January 1995, the Company entered into another agreement with Empire,
whereby the Company will provide Empire with peaking and base load capacity
(10 MW in 1995 increasing to 162 MW in 2000) through the year 2010.

Future Capacity

   The Company does not contemplate any significant expenditures in
connection with construction of any major generating facilities through the
turn of the century (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis,
Liquidity and Capital Resources).  Although the Company's management believes,
based on current load-growth projections and load management programs, it will
maintain adequate capacity margins through 2000, in view of the lead time
required to construct large operating facilities, the Company may be required
before 2000 to consider whether to reschedule the construction of Jeffrey
Energy Center (JEC) Unit 4 or alternatively either build or acquire other
capacity.

Fuel Mix

   The Company's coal-fired units comprise 3,242 MW of the total 5,240 MW of
generating capacity and the Company's nuclear unit provides 548 MW of
capacity.  Of the remaining 1,450 MW of generating capacity, units that can
burn either natural gas or oil account for 1,369 MW, and the remaining units
which burn only oil or diesel fuel account for 81 MW (See Item 2. Properties).

   During 1995, low sulfur coal was used to produce 74% of the Company's
electricity.  Nuclear produced 21% and the remainder was produced from natural
gas, oil, or diesel fuel.  During 1996, based on the Company's estimate of the
availability of fuel, coal will be used to produce approximately 79% of the
Company's electricity and nuclear will be used to produce approximately 16%.
<PAGE 8>
   The Company's fuel mix fluctuates with the operation of nuclear powered
Wolf Creek which has an 18-month refueling and maintenance schedule.  The
18-month schedule permits uninterrupted operation every third calendar year.
Wolf Creek was taken off-line on February 3, 1996 for its eighth refueling and
maintenance outage.  The outage is expected to last approximately 60 days
during which time electric demand will be met primarily by the Company's
coal-fired operating units.

Nuclear

   The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract 75% of the uranium
required for operation of Wolf Creek through the year 2003.  The balance is
expected to be obtained through spot market and contract purchases.  The
Company has contracts with the following three suppliers for uranium: Cameco,
Geomex Minerals, Inc., and Power Resources, Inc. 

     The Company has three contracts for uranium enrichment performed by
USEC, Urenco and Nuexco Trading Corp.  These contractual arrangements cover
100% of Wolf Creek's uranium enrichment requirements for 1996-1997, 90% for
1998-1999, 95% for 2000-2001, and 100% for 2005-2014.  The balance of the
1998-2005 requirements is expected to be obtained through a combination of
spot market and contract purchases.  The decision not to contract for the full
enrichment requirements is one of cost rather than availability of service. 

   A contractual arrangement is in place with Cameco for the conversion of
uranium to uranium hexafluoride sufficient to meet Wolf Creek's requirements
through the year 2000. 
   
   The Company has entered into all of its uranium, uranium enrichment and
uranium hexaflouride arrangements during the ordinary course of business and
is not substantially dependent upon these agreements.  The Company believes
there are other suppliers and plentiful sources available at reasonable prices
to replace, if necessary, these contracts.  In the event that the Company were
required to replace these contracts, it would not anticipate a substantial
disruption of its business.

   The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established schedules, guidelines and
responsibilities for the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop and construct
repositories for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. 
The DOE has not yet constructed a high-level waste disposal site and has
announced that a permanent storage facility may not be in operation prior to
2010 although an interim storage facility may be available earlier.  Wolf
Creek contains an on-site spent fuel storage facility which, under current
regulatory guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The Company
believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained as necessary.

   Additional information with respect to insurance coverage applicable to
the operations of the Company's nuclear generating facility is set forth in
Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Coal

   The three coal-fired units at JEC have an aggregate capacity of 1,795 MW
(Company's 84% share) (See Item 2. Properties).  The Company has a long-term
coal supply contract with Amax Coal West, Inc. (AMAX), a subsidiary of Cyprus
<PAGE 9>
Amax Coal Company, to supply low sulfur coal to JEC from AMAX's Eagle Butte
Mine or an alternate mine source of AMAX's Belle Ayr Mine, both located in the
Powder River Basin in Campbell County, Wyoming.  The contract expires December
31, 2020.  The contract contains a schedule of minimum annual delivery
quantities based on MMBtu provisions.  The coal to be supplied is surface
mined and has an average Btu content of approximately 8,300 Btu per pound and
an average sulfur content of .43 lbs/MMBtu (See Environmental Matters).  The
average delivered cost of coal for JEC was approximately $1.13 per MMBtu or
$18.54 per ton during 1995.

   Coal is transported from Wyoming under a long-term rail transportation
contract with Burlington Northern (BN) and Union Pacific (UP) to JEC through
December 31, 2013.  Rates are based on net load carrying capabilities of each
rail car.  The Company provides 890 aluminum rail cars, under a 20 year lease,
to transport coal to JEC.

   The two coal-fired units at La Cygne Station have an aggregate generating
capacity of 672 MW (KGE's 50% share) (See Item 2.  Properties).  The operator,
Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCPL), maintains coal contracts summarized
in the following paragraphs.

   La Cygne 1 uses low sulfur Powder River Basin coal which is supplied under
a variety of spot market transactions, discussed below.  Illinois or
Kansas/Missouri coal is blended with the Powder River Basin coal and is
secured from time to time under spot market arrangements.  La Cygne 1 uses a
blend of 85% Powder River Basin coal.

   La Cygne 2 and additional La Cygne 1 Powder River Basin coal is supplied
through several contracts, expiring at various times through 1998.  This low
sulfur coal had an average Btu content of approximately 8,500 Btu per pound
and a maximum sulfur content of .50 lbs/MMBtu (See Environmental Matters). 
For 1996, KCPL has secured Powder River Basin coal from Powder River Coal
Company, a subsidiary of Peabody Coal Company.  Transportation is covered by
KCPL through its Omnibus Rail Transportation Agreement with BN and Kansas City
Southern Railroad (KCS) through December 31, 2000.

   During 1995, the average delivered cost of all local and Powder River
Basin coal procured for La Cygne 1 was approximately $0.88 per MMBtu or $15.31
per ton and the average delivered cost of Powder River Basin coal for La Cygne
2 was approximately $0.75 per MMBtu or $12.56 per ton.

   The coal-fired units located at the Tecumseh and Lawrence Energy Centers
have an aggregate generating capacity of 775 MW (See Item 2. Properties).  The
Company contracted with Cyprus Amax Coal Company's Foidel Creek Mine located
in Routt  County, Colorado for low sulfur coal through December 31, 1998. 
During 1995, the average delivered cost of coal for the Lawrence units was
approximately $1.18 per MMBtu or $26.19 per ton and the average delivered cost
of coal for the Tecumseh units was approximately $1.17 per MMBtu or $26.14 per
ton.  This coal is transported by Southern Pacific Lines and Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Company under a contract expiring December 31, 1998.  The
coal supplied from Cyprus has an average Btu content of approximately 11,200
Btu per pound and an average sulfur content of .38 lbs/MMBtu (See
Environmental Matters).   The Company anticipates that the Cyprus agreement
will supply the minimum requirements of the Tecumseh and Lawrence Energy
Centers and supplemental coal requirements will continue to be supplied from
coal markets in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and/or New Mexico.

<PAGE 10>
   The Company has entered into all of its coal and transportation contracts
during the ordinary course of business and is not substantially dependent upon
these contracts.  The Company believes there are other suppliers for and
plentiful sources of coal available at reasonable prices to replace, if
necessary, fuel to be supplied pursuant to these contracts.  In the event that
the Company were required to replace its coal or transportation agreements, it
would not anticipate a substantial disruption of the Company's business.

Natural Gas

   The Company uses natural gas as a primary fuel in its Gordon Evans, Murray
Gill, Abilene, and Hutchinson Energy Centers and in the gas turbine units at
its Tecumseh generating station.  Natural gas is also used as a supplemental
fuel in the coal-fired units at the Lawrence and Tecumseh generating stations. 
Natural gas for Gordon Evans and Murray Gill Energy Centers is supplied by
readily available gas from the spot market.  Short-term economical spot market
purchases will supply the system with the flexible natural gas supply to meet
operational needs for the Gordon Evans and Murray Gill Energy Centers. 
Natural gas for the Company's Abilene and Hutchinson stations is supplied from
the Company's main system (See Natural Gas Operations).

Oil

   The Company uses oil as an alternate fuel when economical or when
interruptions to natural gas make it necessary.  Oil is also used as a
supplemental fuel at JEC and La Cygne generating stations.  All oil burned by
the Company during the past several years has been obtained by spot market
purchases.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 3 million
gallons of No. 2 and 14 million gallons of No. 6 oil which is believed to be
sufficient to meet emergency requirements and protect against lack of
availability of natural gas and/or the loss of a large generating unit.
   
Other Fuel Matters

   The Company's contracts to supply fuel for its coal and natural gas-fired
generating units, with the exception of JEC, do not provide full fuel
requirements at the various stations.  Supplemental fuel is procured on the
spot market to provide operational flexibility and, when the price is
favorable, to take advantage of economic opportunities.

   Set forth in the table below is information relating to the weighted
average cost of fuel used by the Company.

<PAGE 11>
Environmental Matters

   The Company currently holds all Federal and State environmental approvals
required for the operation of its generating units.  The Company believes it
is presently in substantial compliance with all air quality regulations
(including those pertaining to particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides (NOx)) promulgated by the State of Kansas and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

   The Federal sulfur dioxide standards, applicable to the Company's JEC and 
La Cygne 2 units, prohibit the emission of more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur
dioxide per million Btu of heat input.  Federal particulate matter emission
standards applicable to these units prohibit:  (1) the emission of more than
0.1 pounds of particulate matter per million Btu of heat input and (2) an
opacity greater than 20%.  Federal NOx emission standards applicable to these
units prohibit the emission of more than 0.7 pounds of NOx per million Btu of
heat input.

   The JEC and La Cygne 2 units have met:  (1) the sulfur dioxide standards
through the use of low sulfur coal (See Coal); (2) the particulate matter
standards through the use of electrostatic precipitators; and (3) the NOx
standards through boiler design and operating procedures.  The JEC units are
also equipped with flue gas scrubbers providing additional sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter emission reduction capability.

   The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) regulations,
applicable to the Company's other generating facilities, prohibit the emission
of more than 2.5 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million Btu of heat input at the
Company's Lawrence generating units and 3.0 pounds at all other generating
units.  There is sufficient low sulfur coal under contract (See Coal) to allow
compliance with such limits at Lawrence, Tecumseh and La Cygne 1 for the life
of the contracts.  All facilities burning coal are equipped with flue gas
scrubbers and/or electrostatic precipitators.

   The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a two-phase
reduction in sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions with Phase I effective in 1995
and Phase II effective in 2000 and a probable reduction in toxic emissions by
a future date yet to be determined.  To meet the monitoring and reporting
requirements under the Act's acid rain program, the Company installed
continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately
$10 million.  The Company does not expect additional equipment to reduce
sulfur emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although, the Company
currently has no Phase I affected units, the Company has applied for and has
been accepted for an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne
Generating Station under the Phase I regulations.  
   The NOx and toxic limits, which were not set in the law, were proposed by
the EPA in January 1996.  The Company is currently evaluating the steps it
will need to take in order to comply with the proposed new rules, but is
unable to determine its compliance options or related compliance costs until
the evaluation is finished later this year.  The Company will have three years
to comply with the new rules.

   All of the Company's generating facilities are in substantial compliance
with the Best Practicable Technology and Best Available Technology regulations
issued by EPA  pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1977.  Most EPA regulations
are administered in Kansas by the KDHE.

   Additional information with respect to Environmental Matters is discussed
in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS

General

   At December 31, 1995, the Company supplied natural gas at retail to
approximately 648,000 customers in 362 communities and at wholesale to eight
communities and two utilities in Kansas and Oklahoma.  The natural gas systems
of the Company consist of distribution systems in both states purchasing
natural gas from various suppliers and transported by interstate pipeline
companies and the main system, an integrated storage, gathering, transmission
and distribution system.  The Company also transports gas for its large
commercial and industrial customers which purchase gas on the spot market. 
The Company earns approximately the same margin on the volume of gas
transported as on volumes sold except where  discounting occurs in order to
retain the customer's load.  

   As discussed under General, above, on January 31, 1994, the Company sold
substantially all of its Missouri natural gas distribution properties and
operations to Southern Union and sold the remaining Missouri Properties to
United Cities on February 28, 1994.  Additional information with respect to
the impact of the sales of the Missouri Properties is set forth in Notes 2 and
3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    

   The percentage of total natural gas deliveries, including transportation
and operating revenues for 1995, by state were as follows:

                          Total Natural           Total Natural Gas
                          Gas Deliveries          Operating Revenues

<PAGE 13>
   (3)  Includes cumulative effect to January 1, 1991, of a change in revenue 
          recognition.  The cumulative effect of this change increased natural 
          gas sales by 14,838,000 MCF for 1991.
   
   In compliance with orders of the state commissions applicable to all
natural gas utilities, the Company has established priority categories for
service to its natural gas customers.  The highest priority is for residential
and small commercial customers and the lowest for large industrial customers.  
Natural gas delivered by the Company from its main system for use as fuel for
electric generation is classified in the lowest priority category.

Interstate System

   The Company distributes natural gas at retail to approximately 518,000
customers located in central and eastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma. 
The largest cities served in 1995 were Wichita and Topeka, Kansas and
Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  The Company has transportation agreements for
delivery of this gas which have terms varying in length from one to twenty
years, with the following non-affiliated pipeline transmission companies: 
Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), Kansas Pipeline Company (KPP), Panhandle
Eastern Pipeline Company (Panhandle), and various other intrastate suppliers. 
The volumes transported under these agreements in 1995 and 1994 were as
follows:

                              Transportation Volumes (BCF's)

                                          1995           1994   
                 WNG                      61.8           51.6

                 Others                    8.0            9.3

   The Company purchases this gas from various producers and marketers under
contracts expiring at various times.  The Company purchased approximately 61.7
BCF or 79.3% of its natural gas supply from these sources in 1995 and 52.2 BCF
or 89.3% during 1994.  Approximately 90.5 BCF of natural gas is made available
annually under these contracts which extend beyond the year 2000.

   In October 1994, the Company executed a long-term gas purchase contract
(Base Contract) and a peaking supply contract with Amoco Production Company
for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the customers served from the
Company's interstate system over the WNG pipeline system.  The Company
anticipates that the Base Contract will supply between 35% and 50% of the
Company's demand served by the WNG pipeline system.  Amoco is one of various
suppliers over the WNG pipeline system and if this contract were canceled, the
Company could replace gas supplied by Amoco with gas from other suppliers. 
Gas available under the Amoco contract is also available for sale by the
Company to other parties and sales are recorded as Other Revenue.
   
   The Company also purchases natural gas from KPP under contracts expiring
at various times.  These purchases were approximately 5.3 BCF or 6.7% of its
natural gas supply in 1995 and 4.4 BCF or 5.6% during 1994.  The Company
purchases natural gas for the interstate system from intrastate pipelines and
from spot market suppliers under short-term contracts.  These sources totaled
3.6 BCF and  3.8 BCF for 1995 and 1994 representing 4.6% and 6.5% of the
system requirements, respectively.
<PAGE 14>
   During 1995 and 1994, approximately 7.3 BCF and 8.0 BCF, respectively,
were transferred from the Company's main system to serve a portion of the
demand for Wichita, Kansas.  These system transfers represent 9.4% and 13.7%,
respectively, of the interstate system supply.

   The average wholesale cost per thousand cubic feet (MCF) purchased for the
distribution systems for the past five years was as follows:

Main System

   The Company serves approximately 130,000 customers in central and north
central Kansas with natural gas supplied through the main system.  The
principal market areas include Salina, Manhattan, Junction City, Great Bend,
McPherson and Hutchinson, Kansas.

   Natural gas for the Company's main system is purchased from a combination
of direct wellhead production, from the outlet of natural gas processing
plants, and from interstate pipeline interconnects all within the State of
Kansas.  Such purchases are transported entirely through Company owned
transmission lines in Kansas. 

   Natural gas purchased for the Company's main system customer requirements
is transported and/or stored by the Market Center.  The Company retains a
priority right to capacity on the Market Center necessary to serve the main
system customers.  The Company has the opportunity to negotiate for the
purchase of natural gas with producers or marketers utilizing Market Center
services, which  increases the potential supply available to meet main system
customer demands.

   During 1995, the Company purchased approximately 8.7 BCF of natural gas
from Mesa Operating Limited Partnership (Mesa). Approximately 3.2 BCF of
natural gas was purchased through the spot market in 1995 which allowed the
Company to avoid minimum take requirements associated with long-term
contracts.  These purchases represent approximately 39.7% and 14.6%,
respectively, of the Company's main system requirements during such periods. 
   
   Spivey-Grabs field in south-central Kansas supplied approximately 4.8 BCF
of natural gas in both 1995 and 1994, constituting 20.2% and 17.6%,
respectively, of the main system's requirements during such periods.  Such
natural gas is supplied pursuant to contracts with producers in the
Spivey-Grabs field, most of which are for the life of the field, and under
which the Company expects to receive approximately 4.4 BCF or 23.6% of natural
gas in 1996.  Based on a reserve study performed by an independent petroleum
engineering firm in 1995, significant quantities of gas will be available from
the Spivey-Grabs field for at least twenty years.

   Other sources of gas for the main system of 3.4 BCF or 15.6% of the system
requirements were purchased from or transported through interstate pipelines
<PAGE 15>
during 1995.  The remainder of the supply for the main system during 1995 and
1994 of 2.2 BCF and 2.5 BCF representing 9.9% and 9.2%, respectively, was
purchased directly from producers or gathering systems.

   During 1995 and 1994, approximately 7.3 BCF and 8.0 BCF, respectively, of
the total main system supply was transferred to the Company's interstate
system (See Interstate System).

   The Company believes there is adequate natural gas available under
contract or otherwise available to meet the currently anticipated needs of the
main system customers.

   The main system's average wholesale cost per MCF purchased for the past
five years was as follows:
                         Natural Gas Supply - Main System
                              (Average Cost per MCF)

   The load characteristics of the Company's natural gas customers creates
relatively high volume demand on the main system during cold winter days.  To
assure peak day service to high priority customers the Company owns and
operates
and has under contract natural gas storage facilities (See Item 2.
Properties).  

SEGMENT INFORMATION

   Financial information with respect to business segments is set forth in
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.


FINANCING

   The Company's ability to issue additional debt and equity securities is 
restricted under limitations imposed by the charter and the Mortgage and Deed 
of Trust of Western Resources and KGE.

   Western Resources' mortgage prohibits additional Western Resources first
mortgage bonds from being issued (except in connection with certain
refundings) unless the Company's net earnings available for interest,
depreciation and property retirement for a period of 12 consecutive months
within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than the greater of twice
the annual interest charges on, or 10% of the principal amount of, all first
mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. 
Based on the Company's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1995,
approximately $487 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds
could be issued (7.25% interest rate assumed).

<PAGE 16>
   Western Resources bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the
preceding paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an
unfunded prior lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of
December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately $485 million of net bondable
property additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling the Company
to issue up to $291 million principal amount of additional bonds.  As of
December 31, 1995, no additional bonds could be issued on the basis of retired
bonds.

   KGE's mortgage prohibits additional KGE first mortgage bonds from being
issued (except in connection with certain refundings) unless KGE's net
earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and
depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15
months preceding the issuance are not less than two and one-half times the
annual interest charges on, or 10% of the principal amount of, all KGE first
mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. 
Based on KGE's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1995,
approximately $937 million principal amount of additional KGE first mortgage
bonds could be issued (7.25% interest rate assumed).

   KGE bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the preceding
paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an unfunded prior
lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of December 31,
1995, KGE had approximately $1.3 billion of net bondable property additions
not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling KGE to issue up to $922
million principal amount of additional KGE bonds.  As of December 31, 1995, $1
million in additional bonds could be issued on the basis of retired bonds.

   The most restrictive provision of the Company's charter permits the
issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without certain specified
preferred stockholder approval only if, for a period of 12 consecutive months
within 15 months preceding the issuance, net earnings available for payment of
interest exceed one and one-half times the sum of annual interest requirements
plus dividend requirements on preferred stock after giving effect to the
proposed issuance.  After giving effect to the annual interest and dividend
requirements on all debt and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 1995,
such ratio was 2.18 for the 12 months ended December 31, 1995.


REGULATION AND RATES

   The Company is subject as an operating electric utility to the
jurisdiction of the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) and as a natural gas
utility to the jurisdiction of the KCC and the Corporation Commission of the
State of Oklahoma (OCC), which have general regulatory authority over the
Company's rates, extensions and abandonments of service and facilities,
valuation of property, the classification of accounts and various other
matters.

   The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and KCC with
respect to the issuance of securities.  There is no state regulatory body in
Oklahoma having jurisdiction over the issuance of the Company's securities.

   The Company is exempt as a public utility holding company pursuant to
Section 3(a)(1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 from all
provisions of that Act, except Section 9(a)(2).  Additionally, the Company
<PAGE 17>
is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, including jurisdiction as to rates
with respect to sales of electricity for resale.  The Company is not engaged
in the interstate transmission or sale of natural gas which would subject it
to the regulatory provisions of the Natural Gas Act.  KGE is also subject to
the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as to nuclear plant
operations and safety.

   Additional information with respect to Rate Matters and Regulation as set
forth in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is included
herein.

   The Company has contracted with the Market Center for underground storage
of working storage capacity of 2.08 BCF.  This contract enables the Company to
supply customers up to 85 million cubic feet per day of gas supply to meet
winter peaking requirements.

   The Company has contracted with WNG for additional underground storage in
the Alden field in Kansas.  The contract, expiring March 31, 1998, enables the
Company to supply customers with up to 75 million cubic feet per day of gas
supply during winter peak periods.  See Item I.  Business, Gas Operations for
proven recoverable gas reserve information.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   On August 15, 1994, the Bishop entities filed an answer and claims against
Southern Union and the Company alleging, among other things, breach of those
certain gas supply contracts.  The Bishop entities claimed damages up to $270
million against the Company and Southern Union.  On March 1, 1995 this
litigation between the Company and the Bishop entities was jointly dismissed
with prejudice and the parties exchanged mutual releases of any and all
claims.  The gas supply contracts at issue in the above litigations were
canceled.  The agreements between the Company and the Bishop entities resolved
disputes between them in regulatory proceedings before the KCC, the Missouri
Public Service Commission, and the FERC. 

   Additional information on legal proceedings involving the Company is set
forth in Notes 3, 4, and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein.  See also Item 1. Business, Environmental Matters, and
Regulation and Rates.  


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

   No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
covered by this report to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation
of proxies or otherwise.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS


Stock Trading

   Western Resources common stock, which is traded under the ticker symbol
WR, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  As of March 1, 1996, there were
40,831 common shareholders of record.  For information regarding quarterly
common stock price ranges for 1995 and 1994, see Note 15 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

<PAGE 22>
Dividends

   Western Resources common stock is entitled to dividends when and as
declared by the Board of Directors.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's
retained earnings were restricted by $857,600 against the payment of dividends
on common stock.  However, prior to the payment of common dividends, dividends
must be first paid to the holders of preferred stock and second to the holders
of preference stock based on the fixed dividend rate for each series.

   Dividends have been paid on the Company's common stock throughout the
Company's history.  Quarterly dividends on common stock normally are paid on
or about the first of January, April, July, and October to shareholders of
record as of about the third day of the preceding month.  Dividends increased
four cents per common share in 1995 to $2.02 per share.  In January 1996, the
Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 51 1/2 cents per common
share, an increase of one cent over the previous quarter.  Future dividends
depend upon future earnings, the financial condition of the Company and other
factors.  For information regarding quarterly dividend declarations for 1995
and 1994, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FINANCIAL CONDITION

   GENERAL:  Earnings were $2.71 per share of common stock based on
62,157,125 average common shares for 1995, a decrease from $2.82 in 1994 on
61,617,873 average common shares.  Net income for 1995 decreased to $181.7
million compared to $187.4 million in 1994.  The decrease in net income and
earnings per share is primarily due to the inclusion of the gain on the sales
of, and operating income from, the Company's natural gas distribution
properties and operations in the State of Missouri prior to the sales in the
first quarter of 1994.

   Dividends for 1995 increased four cents per common share to $2.02 per
share. In January 1996, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
of 51 1/2 cents per common share, an increase of one cent over the previous
quarter. 
   
   The book value per share was $24.71 at December 31, 1995, compared to
$23.93 at December 31, 1994.  The 1995 closing stock price of $33.38 was 135%
of book value.  There were 62,855,961 common shares outstanding at December
31, 1995.

   On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to
United Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The
properties sold to Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as
the "Missouri Properties."

   The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was
sold for $404 million.  United Cities purchased the Company's natural gas
distribution system in and around the City of Palmyra, Missouri, for $665,000. 

   During the first quarter of 1994, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, on the sales of the Missouri
Properties.  As of the respective dates of the sales of the Missouri
Properties, the Company ceased recording the results of operations, and
removed the assets and liabilities related to the Missouri Properties from the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The gain is reflected in Other Income and
Deductions, on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

   The following table reflects, through the dates of the sales of the
Missouri Properties, the approximate operating revenues and operating income
for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, and net utility plant at
December 31, 1993, related to the Missouri Properties (See Note 2):

Missouri Properties.  This unaudited financial information is based on
assumptions and allocations of expenses of the Company as a whole.
<PAGE 25>
   For additional information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties
and the pending litigation see Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:  The Company's liquidity is a function of
its ongoing construction and maintenance program designed to improve
facilities which provide electric and natural gas service and meet future
customer service requirements.  Acquisitions and subsidiary investments also
affect the Company's liquidity.

   During 1995, construction expenditures for the Company's electric system
were approximately $154 million and nuclear fuel expenditures were
approximately $28 million.  It is projected that adequate capacity margins
will be maintained without the addition of any major generating facilities
through the turn of the century.  The construction expenditures for
improvements on the natural gas system, including the Company's service line
replacement program, were approximately $55 million during 1995.   

   Capital expenditures for 1996 through 1998 are anticipated to be as
follows:

                          Electric       Nuclear Fuel      Natural Gas
                                    (Dollars in Thousands)
            1996. . . . . $117,600         $ 3,300           $56,300 
            1997. . . . .  126,500          22,300            43,800 
            1998. . . . .  119,100          20,800            42,100  

   These expenditures are estimates prepared for planning purposes and are
subject to revisions (See Note 5).

   The Company's net cash flows to capital expenditures was 83% for 1995 and
during the last five years has averaged 97%.  This ratio indicates the extent
to which the Company is able to fund its capital expenditures with cash flow
from operating activities.  This ratio is calculated from the Company's
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as net cash flow from operating
activities, less changes in working capital, less dividends on preferred,
preference and common stock, divided by additions to utility plant.  The
Company anticipates all of its cash requirements for capital expenditures
through 1998 will be provided from net operating cash flows.

   The Company's capital needs through 2000 for bond maturities and cash
sinking fund requirements for bonds and preference stock are approximately
$236 million.  This capital will be provided from internal and external
sources available under then existing financial conditions.

   The embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.7% at December 31, 1995, an
increase from 7.6% at December 31, 1994.  Higher interest rates on
variable-rate long-term debt contributed to the slight increase in the cost of
debt in 1995 compared to 1994.

   On December 14, 1995 Western Resources Capital I, a wholly-owned trust, 
of which the sole asset is subordinated debentures of the Company, sold in a
public offering four million preferred securities of 7 7/8% Cumulative
Quarterly Income Preferred Securities, Series A, for $100 million.   The
securities are shown as Western Resources Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable
Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust holding solely Subordinated
Debentures (Other Mandatorily Redeemable Securities) on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capitalization (See Note 7).
<PAGE 26>
   In January 1996, the Company acquired from Laidlaw Transportation Inc.
15.4 million shares of ADT Limited common stock for $215.6 million, as well as
an option to acquire an additional 15.4 million shares of ADT Limited common
stock.  In March 1996, the Company exercised the option and acquired the
additional 15.4 million shares of ADT Limited common stock from Laidlaw
Transportation Inc. for approximately $228 million or $14.80 per share.  The
Company's total investment in ADT common stock, representing approximately 24%
of ADT's shares currently outstanding, approximates $444 million.  The
purchases were financed with short-term borrowings (See Note 5). 

   The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied, as needed,
through the sale of commercial paper, short-term bank loans and borrowings
under lines of credit maintained with banks.  At December 31, 1995, short-term
borrowings amounted to $203 million, of which $26 million was commercial paper
(See Notes 10 and 12).  At December 31, 1995, the Company had bank credit
arrangements available of $121 million.

   The Company's short-term debt balance at December 31, 1995, decreased
approximately $105 million from December 31, 1994.  The decrease is primarily
a result of the proceeds from the sale of the Other Mandatorily Redeemable
Securities being used to pay off short-term debt.

   The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). 
Shares issued under the DRIP may be either original issue shares or shares
purchased on the open market.

   The Company's capital structure at December 31, 1995, was 48 percent
common stock equity, 6 percent preferred and preference stock, 3 percent Other
Mandatorily Redeemable Securities, and 43 percent long-term debt.  The capital
structure at December 31, 1995, including short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt, was 45 percent common stock equity, 5 percent
preferred and preference stock, 3 percent Other Mandatorily Redeemable
Securities, and 47 percent debt.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   The following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year
results in revenues, operating expenses, other income and deductions, interest
charges, and preferred and preference dividend requirements.  The results of
operations of the Company exclude the activities related to the Missouri
Properties following the sales of those properties in the first quarter of
1994.

   For additional information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties
and the pending litigation, see Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.  Additional information relating to changes between
years is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   REVENUES  
   
   The operating revenues of the Company are based on sales volumes and rates
authorized by certain state regulatory commissions and the FERC.  Future
natural gas and electric sales will be affected by weather conditions,
competition from other sources of energy, competing fuel sources, customer
conservation efforts, and the overall economy of the Company's service area.
<PAGE 27>
   In March 1992, in connection with the Company's acquisition of KGE, the
KCC approved the elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause (ECA) for
most retail customers of the Company effective April 1, 1992.  The fuel costs
are now included in base rates and were established at a level intended by the
KCC to equal the projected average cost of fuel through August 1995. 
Therefore, if the Company wished to recover an increase in fuel cost above the
projected average cost it would have to file a request for recovery in a rate
filing with the KCC which request could be denied in whole or in part.  The
Company's fuel costs represented 19% of its total operating expenses for the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Any increase in fuel
costs from the projected average which the Company did not recover through
rates would impact the Company's earnings.  The degree of any such impact
would be affected by a variety of factors, however, and thus cannot now be
predicted.

   Natural gas revenues were reduced as a result of the sales of the Missouri
Properties.  The Consolidated Statements of Income include revenues of $77
million for the portion of the first quarter of 1994 prior to the sales of the
Missouri Properties and revenues of $350 million from the Missouri Properties
for 1993.  Following the sales of the Missouri Properties, no revenues related
to the Missouri Properties are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income (See Note 2).

   1995 Compared to 1994:  Electric revenues increased two percent in 1995 as
a result of increased sales in all customer classes.  The increase is
primarily attributable to a higher demand for air conditioning load during the
summer months of 1995 compared to 1994.  The Company's service territory
experienced normal temperatures during the summer of 1995, but were more than
20% warmer, based on cooling degree days, compared to the summer of 1994.  The
Company has filed an electric rate reduction request with the KCC (See Note
4). 

   Natural gas revenues decreased in 1995 primarily as a result of the sales
of Missouri Properties in the first quarter of 1994 (See Note 2).  The Company
has filed a $36 million rate increase request for its Kansas natural gas
properties with the KCC (See Note 4). 

   Excluding natural gas sales related to the Missouri Properties, prior to
the sales of those properties in the first quarter of 1994, total natural gas
revenues remained virtually unchanged in 1995.  Natural gas revenues increased
from increased transportation sales and as-available sales, but these
increases were offset by decreased commercial and industrial sales and a lower
unit cost of natural gas which is passed on to customers through the purchased
gas adjustment (PGA).

   As-available gas is excess natural gas under contract that the Company did
not require for customer sales or storage that is typically sold to gas
marketers.  According to the Company's tariff, the nominal margin made on
as-available gas sales, is returned 50% to customers through the PGA and 50%
is reflected in wholesale sales of the Company.

   1994 Compared to 1993:  Electric revenues increased two percent during
1994 primarily as a result of a four percent increase in commercial and
industrial electric sales.  Residential electric sales increased one percent
despite four percent cooler temperatures during the primary air conditioning
load months of June, July, and August.  Partially offsetting these increases
in electric revenues was a 14% decrease in wholesale and interchange sales as
a result of higher than normal sales in 1993 to other utilities while their
generating units were down due to the flooding of 1993.
<PAGE 28>
   Natural gas revenues and sales decreased significantly in 1994 as a result
of the sales of the Missouri Properties as previously mentioned above.  Also
contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenues were reduced natural gas
sales for space heating as a result of much warmer temperatures during the
winter season of 1994 compared to 1993.   

   OPERATING EXPENSES 

   1995 Compared to 1994:  Total operating expenses decreased four percent in
1995 compared to 1994.  The decrease is largely due to the sales of Missouri
Properties, lower natural gas purchases resulting from lower sales, and lower
fuel expense resulting from a lower unit cost of fuel used for generation.

   Partially offsetting this decrease were expenses related to an early
retirement program.  In the second quarter of 1995, $7.6 million related to
early retirement programs was recorded as an expense.

   The Company has filed a request with the KCC to increase the annual
depreciation expense for Wolf Creek Generating Station  (See Note 4).
   
   The Company anticipates its operating expenses (including fuel expenses)
will increase in 1996 as a result of Wolf Creek being taken out of service for
refueling and maintenance as discussed under "Fuel Mix" above.  

   1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating expenses decreased 17% during 1994
primarily as a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties (See Note 2). 
Also contributing to the decrease were lower fuel costs for electric
generation and reduced natural gas purchases as a result of lower sales caused
by milder winter temperatures in 1994 compared to 1993. 

   Partially offsetting the decreases in operating expenses was higher income
tax expense.  As of December 31, 1993, Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KGE)
had fully amortized its deferred income tax reserves related to the allowance
for borrowed funds used during construction capitalized for Wolf Creek
Generating Station.  The completion of the amortization of these deferred
income tax reserves increased income tax expense and reduced net income by
approximately $12 million in 1994.

   OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS:  Other income and deductions, net of taxes,
decreased for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994 as a
result of the gain on the sales of Missouri Properties recorded in the first
quarter of 1994 and additional interest expense on increased corporate-owned
life insurance (COLI) borrowings.  Partially offsetting this decrease was the
recognition of income from death benefit proceeds under COLI contracts during
the fourth quarter of 1995  (See Notes 1 and 6 for discussion of current
legislation affecting COLI).

   Other income and deductions, net of taxes, was higher for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1994 compared to 1993 due to the recognition of the
gain on the sales of the Missouri Properties of approximately $19.3 million,
net of tax (See Note 2).  Partially offsetting this increase was increased
interest expense on COLI borrowings.  Also partially offsetting the increase
was the recognition of income in 1993 from death benefit proceeds from COLI
policies.
   
   INTEREST CHARGES AND PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS: Total 
interest charges increased three percent for the twelve months ended December
31, 1995, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates on
short-term borrowings and variable long-term debt.
<PAGE 29>
   The Company's embedded cost of long-term debt increased to 7.7% at
December 31, 1995, compared to 7.6% and 8.1% at December 31, 1994 and 1993. 
Higher interest rates on variable-rate long-term debt contributed to the
slight increase in the cost of debt in 1995 compared to 1994.

   Total interest charges decreased 17% in 1994 compared to 1993 as a result
of lower debt balances and the refinancing of higher cost debt, as well as
increased COLI borrowings, the interest on which is reflected in Other Income
and Deductions, on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Partially
offsetting these decreases in interest expense were higher interest rates on
short-term borrowings.
 
   MERGER IMPLEMENTATION:  In accordance with the KCC Merger order,
amortization of the acquisition adjustment commenced August 1995.  The
amortization will amount to approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per year for
40 years.  The Company can recover the amortization of the acquisition
adjustment through cost savings under a sharing mechanism approved by the KCC.

   Based on the order issued by the KCC, with regard to the recovery of the
acquisition premium, the Company must achieve a level of savings on an annual
basis (considering sharing provisions) of approximately $27 million in order
to recover the entire acquisition premium.  To the extent that the Company's
actual operations and maintenance expense is lower than the KCC-stipulated 
index, the Company will realize merger savings.  The Company has calculated,
in conformance with the KCC order, annual savings associated with the
acquisition to be in excess of $27 million for 1995.  As management presently
expects to continue this level of savings, the amount is expected to be
sufficient to allow for the full recovery of the acquisition premium.


OTHER INFORMATION

   INFLATION:  Under the ratemaking procedures prescribed by the regulatory
commissions to which the Company is subject, only the original cost of plant
is recoverable in rates charged to customers.  Therefore, because of
inflation, present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for
purposes of maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareholders
and the related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property.  The impact
of this ratemaking process on common shareholders is mitigated to the extent
depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of
less purchasing power.  While the Company has experienced relatively low
inflation in the recent past, the cumulative effect of inflation on operating
costs may require the Company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these
higher costs.

   ENVIRONMENTAL:  The Company has taken a proactive position with respect to
the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas
sites and has an agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment to systematically evaluate these sites in Kansas (See Note 5).  

   Although the Company currently has no Phase I affected units under the
Clean Air Act of 1990, the Company has applied for and has been accepted for
an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under the
Phase I guidelines.  The oxides of nitrogen and toxic limits, which were not
set in the law, were proposed by the EPA in January 1996.  The Company is
currently evaluating the steps it will need to take in order to comply with
the proposed new rules, but is unable to determine its compliance options or
related compliance costs until the evaluation is finished later this year. 
The Company will have three years to comply with the new rules.  (See Note 5).
<PAGE 30>
   COMPETITION:  As a regulated utility, the Company currently has limited
direct competition for retail electric service in its certified service area. 
However, there is competition, based largely on price, from the generation, or
potential generation, of electricity by large commercial and industrial
customers, and independent power producers.

   The 1992 Energy Policy Act (Act) requires increased efficiency of energy
usage and has affected the way electricity is marketed.  The Act also provides
for increased competition in the wholesale electric market by permitting the
FERC to order third party access to utilities' transmission systems and by
liberalizing the rules for ownership of generating facilities.  As part of the
Merger, the Company agreed to open access of its transmission system for
wholesale transactions.  During 1995, wholesale electric revenues represented
approximately nine percent of the Company's total electric revenues.

   Operating in this competitive environment could place pressure on utility
profit margins and credit quality.  Wholesale and industrial customers may
threaten to pursue cogeneration, self-generation, retail wheeling,
municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to
obtain reduced energy costs.  Increasing competition has resulted in credit
rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit
rating determinations (See Note 1 for the effects of competition on Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71).

   The Company is providing competitive electric rates for industrial
expansion projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain
and increase electric load.  During 1996, the Company will lose a major
industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in a reduction to pre-tax
earnings of approximately $7 to $8 million annually.  This customer's decision
to develop its own cogeneration project was based largely on factors other
than energy cost.

   To capitalize on opportunities in the non-regulated natural gas industry,
the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mid Continent Market Center,
Inc. (Market Center), has established a natural gas market center in Kansas. 
The Market Center, which began operations on July 1, 1995, provides natural
gas transportation, storage, and gathering services, as well as balancing, and
title transfer capability.  The Company transferred certain natural gas
transmission assets having a net book value of approximately $50 million to
the Market Center.  The Market Center will provide no notice natural gas
transportation and storage services to the Company under a long-term contract.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
  of Western Resources, Inc.: 

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
statements of capitalization of Western Resources, Inc., and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows, taxes and common stock equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Western
Resources, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.          

    As explained in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits and effective January 1, 1994, the Company changed its
method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

                     WESTERN RESOURCES, INC.
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      General:  The Consolidated Financial Statements of Western Resources, Inc.
(the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, include KPL, a rate-regulated
electric and gas division of the Company, Kansas Gas and Electric Company
(KGE), a rate-regulated electric utility and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, the Westar companies, non-utility subsidiaries, and Mid Continent
Market Center, Inc. (Market Center), a regulated gas transmission service
provider.  KGE owns 47% of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC),
the operating Company for Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  The
Company records its proportionate share of all transactions of WCNOC as it
does other jointly-owned facilities.  All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.  The operations of non-utility subsidiaries
were not material to the Company's overall results of operations.

      The Company is an investor-owned holding Company.  The Company is engaged
principally in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale
of electricity and the delivery and sale of natural gas.  The Company serves
approximately 601,000 electric customers in eastern and central Kansas and
approximately 648,000 natural gas customers in Kansas and northeastern
Oklahoma. The Company's non-utility subsidiaries which market natural gas
primarily to large commercial and industrial customers, provide other energy
related products and services and provide electronic security services.  

      The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated public utilities.  The
accounting and rates of the Company are subject to requirements of the Kansas
Corporation Commission (KCC), the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  The financial statements
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, to disclose contingent assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date, and to report amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
      The Company follows the accounting for regulated enterprises prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulations" (SFAS 71).  This pronouncement requires
deferral of certain costs and obligations based upon approvals received from
regulators to permit recovery or require refund of these costs and revenues in
future periods.  Consequently, the recorded net book value of certain assets
and liabilities may be different than that which would otherwise be recorded
by unregulated enterprises.  On a continuing basis, the Company reviews the
continued applicability of SFAS 71 based on the current regulatory and
competitive environment.  Although recent developments suggest the electric
generation industry may become more competitive, the degree to which
regulatory oversight of the Company will be lifted and competition will be
permitted is uncertain.  Currently, there are no proceedings or actions at the
KCC to open the Company's electric markets to greater competition.  As a
result, the Company continues to believe that accounting under SFAS 71 is
appropriate.  If the Company were to determine that the use of SFAS 71 were no
longer appropriate, it would be required to write-off the deferred costs and
obligations that represent regulatory assets and liabilities referred to
<PAGE 40>
above.  It may also be necessary for the Company to reduce the carrying value
of a portion of its plant and equipment to the extent that it is expected to
become impaired.  At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of
the Company's plant and equipment, if any, that would be considered
unrecoverable in such circumstances, as the effect of any future competition
on the Company's rates is not clear at this time.                     

      Utility Plant:  Utility plant is stated at cost.  For constructed plant,
cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect
charges for engineering, supervision, general and administrative costs, and an
allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  The AFUDC rate was
6.31% in 1995, 4.08% in 1994, and 4.10% in 1993.  The cost of additions to
utility plant and replacement units of property are capitalized. Maintenance
costs and replacement of minor items of property are charged to expense as
incurred.  When units of depreciable property are retired, they are removed
from the plant accounts and the original cost plus removal charges less
salvage are charged to accumulated depreciation.

      In accordance with regulatory decisions made by the KCC, amortization of
the acquisition premium of approximately $801 million resulting from the KGE
purchase began in August of 1995.  The premium is being amortized over 40
years and has been classified as electric plant in service.  Accumulated
amortization through December 31, 1995 totaled $6.7 million.

      In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"
(SFAS 121).  This Statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by
requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance
sheet date.  The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 1996 and does
not expect that adoption will have a material impact on the financial position
or results of operations based on the Company's current regulatory structure. 
This conclusion may change in the future if increases in competition influence
regulation and wholesale and retail pricing in the electric industry.

      Depreciation:  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based
on estimated useful lives of property.  Composite provisions for book
depreciation approximated 2.84% during 1995, 2.87% during 1994, and 3.02%
during 1993 of the average original cost of depreciable property.  The methods
and rates of depreciation used by the Company have not varied materially from
the methods and rates which would have been used if the Company were not
regulated and not subject to the provisions prescribed by SFAS 71.  In the
past, the methods and rates have been determined by depreciation studies and
approved by the various regulatory bodies.  The Company periodically evaluates
its depreciation rates considering the past and expected future experience in
the operation of its facilities.  The Company has proposed to more rapidly
recover the Company's investment in nuclear generating assets of Wolf Creek to
reduce the capital costs to a level more closely paralleling that of
non-nuclear generating facilities (For information regarding such proposal,
see Note 4).
<PAGE 41>
      Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid collateralized
debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

      Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting
for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).  Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences in amounts recorded
for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases (See Note 9).

      Investment tax credits previously deferred are being amortized to income
over the life of the property which gave rise to the credits.

      Revenues: Operating revenues for both electric and natural gas services
include estimated amounts for services rendered but unbilled at the end of
each year.  Unbilled revenues of $66 million and $61 million are recorded as a
component of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues (net) on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  

      The Company's recorded reserves for doubtful accounts receivable totaled
$4.9 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

      Investments: The Company records its investment and ownership percentage
of earnings or losses utilizing the equity method of accounting when the
Company's ownership interest allows it to exert significant influence over the
operations of an investee.

      In December 1995, a non-regulated subsidiary's net assets were exchanged
for  a 20% equity interest in a corporation supplying gas compression units to
natural gas producers.  This investment is valued at approximately $56
million, and is included in net non-utility investments on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 1995.

      Debt Issuance and Reacquisition Expense: Debt premium, discount, and
issuance expenses are amortized over the life of each issue.  Under regulatory
procedures, debt reacquisition expenses are amortized over the remaining life
of the reacquired debt or, if refinanced, the life of the new debt.

      Risk Management: The Company is exposed to price risk from fluctuating
natural gas prices resulting from gas marketing activities of a non-regulated
subsidiary.  This subsidiary utilizes various financial instruments to
mitigate much of its exposure to fluctuating market prices of commodities. 
These financial instruments are designated as hedges and as such, gains or
losses associated with these financial instruments are deferred until the
commodity being hedged is delivered.

      At December 31, 1995, this subsidiary had entered into natural gas
financial instruments with a contractual volume of 11.05 billion cubic feet
expiring through 2000.  The market value of these instruments as of December
31, 1995, was $2.7 million more than the contract value.

      Fuel Costs:  The cost of nuclear fuel in process of refinement,
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication is recorded as an asset at original
cost and is amortized to expense based upon the quantity of heat produced for
the generation of electricity.  The accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel
in the reactor at December 31, 1995 and 1994, was $28.5 million and $13.6
million, respectively.
<PAGE 42>
      Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Contracts:  The following amounts
related to corporate-owned life insurance contracts (COLI) are recorded in
Corporate-owned Life Insurance (net) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

                                                   1995          1994  
                                                 (Dollars in Millions)
         Cash surrender value of contracts. . .  $ 479.9       $ 408.9
         Borrowings against contracts . . . . .   (435.8)       (391.9) 
                  COLI (net). . . . . . . . . .  $  44.1       $  17.0  
                                                                               
         Income is recorded for increases in cash surrender value and net death
proceeds.  Interest expense is recognized for COLI borrowings except for
certain contracts entered into in 1993 and 1992.  The net income generated
from COLI contracts purchased prior to 1992 including the tax benefit of the
interest deduction and premium expenses are recorded as Corporate-owned Life
Insurance (net) on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The income from
increases in cash surrender value and net death proceeds was $22.7 million in
1995, $15.6 million in 1994, and $19.7 million in 1993.  The interest expense
deduction taken was $25.4 million for 1995, $21.0 million for 1994, and $11.9
million for 1993.

      The COLI contracts entered into in 1993 and 1992 were established to
mitigate the cost of postretirement and postemployment benefits.  As approved
by the KCC, the Company is using the net income stream generated by these COLI
policies to offset the costs of postretirement and postemployment benefits.  A
significant portion of this income stream relates to the tax deduction
currently taken for interest incurred on contract borrowings under these COLI
policies.  The amount of the interest deduction used to offset these benefits
costs was $7.0 million for 1995, $5.8 million for 1994, and $4.5 million for
1993.
      
      Federal legislation is pending, which, if enacted, may substantially
reduce or eliminate the tax deduction for interest on COLI borrowings, and
thus reduce  a significant portion of the net income stream generated by the
COLI contracts (See Note 6).
      
      Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified
to conform with classifications used in the current year presentation.


2.  SALES OF MISSOURI NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION PROPERTIES

      On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to
United Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The
properties sold to Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as
the "Missouri Properties."
<PAGE 43>
      The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was
sold for $404 million.  For information regarding litigation in connection
with the sale of the Missouri Properties to Southern Union, see Note 3. 
United Cities purchased the Company's natural gas distribution system in and
around the City of Palmyra, Missouri for $665,000.
      
      During the first quarter of 1994, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, on the sales of the Missouri
Properties.  As of the respective dates of the sales of the Missouri
Properties, the Company ceased recording the results of operations, and
removed the assets and liabilities from the Consolidated Balance Sheet related
to the Missouri Properties.  The gain is reflected in Other Income and
Deductions, on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

      The following table reflects the approximate operating revenues and
operating income included in the Company's consolidated results for the years
ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, and net utility plant at December 31, 1993,
related to the Missouri Properties:

      Separate audited financial information was not kept by the Company for the
Missouri Properties.  This unaudited financial information is based on
assumptions and allocations of expenses of the Company as a whole.


3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      On June 1, 1994, Southern Union filed an action against the Company, The
Bishop Group, Ltd., and other entities affiliated with The Bishop Group,
alleging, among other things, breach of the Missouri Properties sale agreement
relating to certain gas supply contracts between the Company and various
Bishop entities.  Southern Union assumed these contracts upon the sale of the
Missouri Properties and requested unspecified monetary damages as well as
declaratory relief.  On August 1, 1994, the Company filed its answer and
counterclaim denying all claims asserted against it by Southern Union
including claims related to the purchase price of the Missouri Properties. 
The disputed purchase price adjustments were submitted to an arbitrator in
February 1995.  Based on the decision of the arbitrator rendered in April
1995, Southern Union paid the Company $3.6 million including interest.  For
additional information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties, see
Note 2.

         In May, 1995, Southern Union filed its amended complaint against the
Company, alleging a variety of new theories in support of its revised damage
claims.  Southern Union now claims that it has overpaid the Company from
<PAGE 44>
between $38 to $53 million dollars for the Missouri Properties.  The Company
has filed its amended answer denying each and every claim made by Southern
Union in its amended complaint.  The Company has filed motions for summary
judgment against the amended complaint.  The resolution of this matter is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company.

         Subject to the approval of the KCC, the Company has entered into five
new gas supply contracts with certain Bishop entities which are currently
regulated by the KCC.  A contested hearing was held for the approval of those
contracts.  While the case was under consideration by the KCC, the FERC issued
an order under which it extended jurisdiction over the Bishop entities.  On
November 3, 1995, the KCC stayed its consideration of the contracts between
the Company and the Bishop entities until the FERC takes final appealable
action on its assertion of jurisdiction over the Bishop entities. 

      The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other legal,  
environmental, and regulatory proceedings.  Management believes that adequate
provision has been made within the Consolidated Financial Statements for these
other matters and accordingly believes their ultimate dispositions will not
have a material adverse effect upon the Company's overall financial position
or results of operations.


4.  RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION

      The Company, under rate orders from the KCC, OCC, and FERC, recovers
increases in fuel and natural gas costs through fuel adjustment clauses for
wholesale and certain retail electric customers and various purchased gas
adjustment clauses (PGA) for natural gas customers.  The KCC and the OCC
require the annual difference between actual gas cost incurred and cost
recovered through the application of the PGA be deferred and amortized through
rates in subsequent periods.  

      KCC Rate Proceedings:  On August 17, 1995, the Company filed with the KCC
a request to more rapidly recover its investment in its assets of Wolf Creek
over the next seven years.  If the request is granted, depreciation expense
for Wolf Creek will increase by approximately $50 million for each of the next
seven years. As a result of this proposal, the Company will also seek to
reduce electric rates for KGE customers by approximately $9 million annually
for the same seven year period.

      The request also reduces the annual depreciation expense by approximately
$11 million for electric transmission, distribution and certain generating
plant assets to reflect the effect of increasing useful lives of these
properties.  Hearings before the KCC on the depreciation changes and voluntary
rate reductions are expected to occur in May 1996.
         
      In addition, the Company filed a $36 million annual rate increase request
for its Kansas natural gas properties.  The increase is being sought to
recover costs associated with its service line replacement program as well as
other increased operating costs (See discussion below regarding KCC order
issued on January 24, 1992). In February 1996, the KCC staff submitted
testimony related to this  rate increase supporting the Company's increase of
current gas rates of $36 million annually.  The ultimate decision related to
the Company's request resides with the KCC.  Hearings before the KCC on the
gas rate increase proposal began February 19, 1996, with an order expected by
April 1996.
<PAGE 45>
         On June 30, 1995, the KCC granted a certificate authorizing the
business operations of the Market Center.  The Market Center, which began
operations on July 1, 1995, provides natural gas transportation, storage, and
gathering services, as well as balancing, and title transfer capability.  The
Company transferred certain natural gas transmission assets having a net book
value of approximately $50 million to the Market Center. 
      
      On January 24, 1992, the KCC issued an order allowing the Company to
continue the deferral of service line replacement program costs incurred since
January 1, 1992, including depreciation, property taxes, and carrying costs
for recovery in the next general rate case.  At December 31, 1995,
approximately $14.2 million of these deferrals have been included in Deferred
Charges and Other Assets, Other, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

      Tight Sands:  In December 1991, the KCC and the OCC approved agreements
authorizing the Company to refund to customers approximately $40 million of
the proceeds of the Tight Sands antitrust litigation settlement to be
collected on behalf of Western Resources' natural gas customers.  To secure
the refund of settlement proceeds, the Commissions authorized the
establishment of an independently administered trust to collect and maintain
cash receipts received under Tight Sands settlement agreements and provide for
the refunds made.  The trust has a term of ten years.

      Rate Stabilization Plan:  In 1988, the KCC ordered the accrual of phase-in
revenues to be discontinued by KGE effective December 31, 1988.  KGE began
amortizing the phase-in revenue asset on a straight-line basis over 9 1/2
years beginning January 1, 1989.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $44
million of deferred phase-in revenues remain to be recovered.

      Coal Contract Settlements:  In March 1990, the KCC issued an order
allowing  KGE to defer its share of a 1989 coal contract settlement with the
Pittsburg  and Midway Coal Mining Company amounting to $22.5 million.  This
amount was recorded as a deferred charge and is included in Deferred Charges
and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The settlement resulted
in the termination of a long-term coal contract.  The KCC permitted KGE to
recover this settlement as follows: 76% of the settlement plus a return over
the remaining term of the terminated contract (through 2002) and 24% to be
amortized to expense with a deferred return equivalent to the carrying cost of
the asset.

      In February 1991, KGE paid $8.5 million to settle a coal contract lawsuit
with AMAX Coal Company and recorded the payment as a deferred charge in
Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The KCC
approved the recovery of the settlement plus a return, equivalent to the
carrying cost of the asset, over the remaining term of the terminated contract
(through 1996).


5.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

      As part of its ongoing operations and construction program, the Company
has commitments under purchase orders and contracts which have an unexpended
balance of approximately $92 million at December 31, 1995.  Approximately $20
million is attributable to modifications to upgrade the three turbines at
Jeffrey Energy Center to be completed by December 31, 1998.
<PAGE 46>
      In January 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority (OMPA).  Under the agreement, the Company received a
prepayment of approximately $41 million for which the Company will provide
capacity and transmission services to OMPA through the year 2013.

      Investment:  On December 21, 1995 the Company entered into Stock Purchase
and Equity Agreements with Laidlaw Transportation Inc. to acquire up to 30.8
million common shares of ADT Limited (ADT).  ADT's principal business is
providing electronic security services.  On January 26, 1996, the Company
purchased 15.4 million of such ADT common shares for $215.6 million ($14 per
share).  The Company purchased the remaining 15.4 million common shares held
by Laidlaw Transportation Inc. on March 18, 1996 for approximately $228
million or $14.80 per share.
      
      The shares purchased represent approximately 24% of ADT's common equity. 
The Company intends to account for its investment in ADT using the equity
method of accounting.  

      Manufactured Gas Sites: The Company has been associated with 15 former
manufactured gas sites located in Kansas which may contain coal tar and other
potentially harmful materials.  The Company and the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment (KDHE) entered into a consent agreement governing all
future work at the 15 sites.  The terms of the consent agreement will allow
the Company to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based
upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis.  The prioritized
sites will be investigated over a 10 year period.  The agreement will allow
the Company to set mutual objectives with the KDHE in order to expedite
effective response activities and to control costs and environmental impact. 
The costs incurred for site investigation and risk assessment in 1995 and 1994
were minimal.  The Company is aware of other Midwestern utilities which have
incurred remediation costs ranging between $500,000 and $10 million per site. 
The KCC has permitted another Kansas utility to recover its remediation costs
through rates.  To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered
through rates, the costs could be material to the Company's financial position
or results of operations depending on the degree of remediation required and
number of years over which the remediation must be completed.

      Superfund Sites:  The Company is one of numerous potentially responsible
parties at a groundwater contamination site in Wichita, Kansas (Wichita site)
which is listed by the EPA as a Superfund site.  The Company has previously
been associated with other Superfund sites of which the Company's liability
has been classified as de minimis and any potential obligations have been
settled at minimal cost.  In 1994, the Company settled Superfund obligations
at three sites for a total of $57,500.  The Company's obligation at the
Wichita site appears to be limited based on this experience.  In the opinion
of the Company's management, the resolution of this matter is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

      Clean Air Act:  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a
two-phase reduction in certain emissions.  To meet the monitoring and
reporting requirements under the acid rain program, the Company installed
continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately
$10 million from 1993 through 1995.  The Company does not expect additional
equipment acquisitions or other material expenditures to be needed to meet
Phase II sulfur dioxide requirements.  
<PAGE 47>
      Other Environmental Matters:  As part of the sale of the Company's
Missouri Properties to Southern Union, Southern Union assumed responsibility
for any environmental matters related to the Missouri Properties. The Company
may be liable for up to a maximum of $7.5 million for 15 years after the date
of the sale under a sharing arrangement with Southern Union for environmental
matters pending or discovered within the two year period ended January 31,
1996.

      Decommissioning: The Company accrues decommissioning costs over the
expected life of the Wolf Creek generating facility.  The accrual is based on
estimated unrecovered decommissioning costs which consider inflation over the
remaining estimated life of the generating facility and are net of expected
earnings on amounts recovered from customers and deposited in an external
trust fund.
  
      On June 9, 1994, the KCC issued an order approving the estimated 
decommissioning costs as determined by a 1993 Wolf Creek Decommissioning Cost
Study to be recovered in rates. The cost study estimated the Company's share
of decommissioning costs to be $595 million or approximately $174 million in
1993 dollars.  The decommissioning costs are currently expected to be incurred
during the period 2025 through 2033.  These costs were calculated using an
assumed inflation rate of 3.45% and an average after tax expected return on
trust fund assets of 5.9%. Decommissioning costs are being charged to
operating expenses in accordance with the KCC order.  Amounts expensed
approximated $3.6 million in 1995 and will increase annually to $5.5 million
in 2024.

         The Company's investment in the decommissioning fund, including
reinvested earnings approximated $25.0 million and $16.9 million at December
31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.  Trust fund earnings accumulate
in the fund balance and increase the recorded decommissioning liability. 
These amounts are reflected in Decommissioning Trust, and the related
liability is included in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities, Other, on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

      The staff of the SEC has questioned certain current accounting practices
used by nuclear electric generating station owners regarding the recognition,
measurement, and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear electric
generating stations. In response to these questions, the FASB is expected to
issue new accounting standards for removal costs, including decommissioning in
1996.  If current electric utility industry accounting practices for such
decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual decommissioning expenses could
increase, (2) the estimated present value of decommissioning costs could be
recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation, and (3) trust
fund income from the external decommissioning trusts could be reported as
investment income rather than as a reduction to decommissioning expense.  
When revised accounting guidance is issued, the Company will also have to
evaluate its effect on accounting for removal costs of other long-lived
assets.  At this time, the Company is not able to predict what effect such
changes would have on results of operations, financial position, or related
regulatory practices until the final issuance of revised accounting guidance.
      
      The Company carries premature decommissioning insurance which has several
restrictions.  One of these is that it can only be used if Wolf Creek incurs
an accident exceeding $500 million in expenses to safely stabilize the
<PAGE 48>
reactor, to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site in accordance
with a plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to pay
for on-site property damages.  This decommissioning insurance will only be
available if the insurance funds are not needed to implement the NRC-approved
plan for stabilization and decontamination.

      
      Nuclear Insurance:  The Price-Anderson Act limits the combined public
liability of the owners of nuclear power plants to $8.9 billion for a single
nuclear incident.  If this liability limitation is insufficient, the U.S.
Congress will consider taking whatever action is necessary to compensate the
public for valid claims.  The Wolf Creek owners (Owners) have purchased the
maximum available private insurance of $200 million and the balance is
provided by an assessment plan mandated by the NRC.  Under this plan, the
Owners are jointly and severally subject to a retrospective assessment of up
to $79.3 million ($37.3 million, Company's share) in the event there is a
major nuclear incident involving any of the nation's licensed reactors.  This
assessment is subject to an inflation adjustment based on the Consumer Price
Index and applicable premium taxes.  There is a limitation of $10 million
($4.7 million, Company's share) in retrospective assessments per incident, per
year.

      The Owners carry decontamination liability, premature decommissioning
liability, and property damage insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately
$2.8 billion ($1.3 billion, Company's share).  This insurance is provided by a
combination of "nuclear insurance pools" ($500 million) and Nuclear Electric
Insurance Limited (NEIL) ($2.3 billion).  In the event of an accident,
insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site
decontamination.  The Company's share of any remaining proceeds can be used
for property damage or premature decommissioning costs up to $1.3 billion
(Company's share).  Premature decommissioning insurance cost recovery is
excess of funds previously collected for decommissioning (as discussed under
"Decommissioning").

      The Owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to cover costs of
replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage
resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If losses incurred
at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL policies exceed premiums,
reserves, and other NEIL resources, the Company may be subject to
retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $11
million per year.

         Although the Company maintains various insurance policies to provide
coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an
extended outage, the Company's insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover
the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at
Wolf Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent
not recoverable through rates, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.  

      Fuel Commitments:  To supply a portion of the fuel requirements for its
generating plants, the Company has entered into various commitments to obtain
nuclear fuel and coal. Some of these contracts contain provisions for price
escalation and minimum purchase commitments.  At December 31, 1995, WCNOC's
nuclear fuel commitments (Company's share) were approximately $15.3 million
<PAGE 49>
for uranium concentrates expiring at various times through 2001, $120.8
million for enrichment expiring at various times through 2014, and $72.7
million for fabrication through 2025.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's
coal contract commitments in 1995 dollars under the remaining terms of the
contracts were approximately $2.5 billion.  The largest coal contract expires
in 2020, with the remaining coal contracts expiring at various times through
2013. 

      Energy Act:  As part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, a special assessment
is being collected from utilities for a uranium enrichment, decontamination,
and decommissioning fund.  The Company's portion of the assessment for Wolf
Creek is approximately $7 million, payable over 15 years.  Management expects
such costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process.


6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

      Pension:  The Company maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans covering substantially all employees.  Pension benefits are
based on years of service and the employee's compensation during the five
highest paid consecutive years out of ten before retirement.  The Company's
policy is to fund pension costs accrued, subject to limitations set by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code.

      Salary Continuation: The Company maintains a non-qualified Executive
Salary Continuation Program for the benefit of certain management employees,
including executive officers.

      The following tables provide information on the components of pension and
salary continuation costs under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

      Postretirement:  The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) in the first quarter
of 1993.  This statement requires the accrual of postretirement benefits other
than pensions, primarily medical benefit costs, during the years an employee
provides service.

      Based on actuarial projections and adoption of the transition method of
implementation which allows a 20-year amortization of the accumulated benefit
obligation, postretirement benefits expenses approximated $15.0 million and
$12.4 million for 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The Company's total
postretirement benefit obligation approximated $123.2  million and $114.6
million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  In addition, the Company
received an order from the KCC permitting the initial deferral of SFAS 106
expense in excess of amounts previously recognized.  To mitigate the impact
incremental SFAS 106 expense will have on rate increases, the Company will
include in the future computation of cost of service the actual postretirement
benefits expenses and an income stream generated from COLI contracts purchased
in 1993 and 1992.  To the extent postretirement benefits expenses exceed
income from the COLI program, this excess is being deferred (in accordance
with the provisions of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 92-12)
and will be offset by income generated through the deferral period by the COLI
program.  Because these expenses were deferred, there was no effect on the
results of continuing operations in 1995.  At December 31, 1995, approximately
$25.3 million of postretirement expenses had been deferred pursuant to the KCC
order.  Pending federal legislation may substantially reduce or eliminate tax
benefits associated with COLI contracts.  If this legislation is enacted or
should the income stream generated by the COLI program not be sufficient to
offset postretirement benefit costs on an accrual basis, the KCC order allows
the Company to seek recovery of a deficiency through the ratemaking process. 
Regulatory precedents established by the KCC generally permit the accrual
costs of postretirement benefits to be recovered in rates.

benefit plans for financial statement purposes and the related amounts

      For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost growth rate of 11%
was assumed for 1995, decreasing one percent per year to five percent in 2001
and thereafter.  The health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on
the projected benefit obligation.  Increasing the trend rate by one percent
each year would increase the present value of the accumulated projected
benefit obligation by $4.3 million and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components by $0.4 million.

      Postemployment:  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS
112) in the first quarter of 1994, which established accounting and reporting
standards for postemployment benefits.  The statement requires the Company to
recognize the liability to provide postemployment benefits when the liability
has been incurred.  The Company received an order from the KCC permitting the
initial deferral of SFAS 112 expense.  To mitigate the impact SFAS 112 expense
will have on rate increases, the Company will include in the future
computation of cost of service the actual SFAS 112 transition costs and
expenses and an income stream generated from COLI contracts purchased in 1993
and 1992.  At December 31, 1995 approximately $8.3 million of postemployment
expenses had been deferred pursuant to the KCC order.  Pending federal
legislation may substantially reduce or eliminate tax benefits associated with
COLI contracts.  If this legislation is enacted or should the income stream
generated by the COLI program not be sufficient to offset postemployment
benefit costs on an accrual basis, the KCC order allows the Company to seek
recovery of such deficit through the ratemaking process.  The 1995 and 1994
expense under SFAS 112 was approximately $3.6 million and $2.7 million,
respectively.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company's SFAS 112 liability
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately $8.7 million and
$8.4 million, respectively.
<PAGE 52>
      Savings:  The Company maintains savings plans in which substantially all
employees participate.  The Company matches employees' contributions up to
specified maximum limits.  The funds of the plans are deposited with a trustee
and invested at each employee's option in one or more investment funds,
including a Company stock fund.  The Company's contributions were $5.1
million, $5.1 million, and $5.8 million for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.
         

7.  COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, PREFERENCE STOCK,
     AND OTHER MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES

      The Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, provides for
85,000,000 authorized shares of common stock.  At December 31, 1995,
62,855,961 shares were outstanding.

      The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP). 
Shares issued under the DRIP may be either original issue shares or shares
purchased on the open market.  At December 31, 1995, 3,017,627 shares were
available under the DRIP registration statement.

      Not subject to mandatory redemption:  The cumulative preferred stock is
redeemable in whole or in part on 30 to 60 days notice at the option of the
Company.

      Subject to mandatory redemption:  The mandatory sinking fund provisions of
the 8.50% Series preference stock require the Company to redeem 50,000 shares
annually beginning on July 1, 1997, at $100 per share.  The Company may, at
its option, redeem up to an additional 50,000 shares on each July 1, at $100
per share.  The 8.50% Series also is redeemable in whole or in part, at the
option of the Company, subject to certain restrictions on refunding, at a
redemption price of $106.23, $105.67, and $105.10 per share beginning July 1,
1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

      The mandatory sinking fund provisions of the 7.58% Series preference stock
require the Company to redeem 25,000 shares annually beginning on April 1,
2002, and each April 1 through 2006 and the remaining shares on April 1, 2007,
all at $100 per share.  The Company may, at its option, redeem up to an
additional 25,000 shares on each April 1 at $100 per share.  The 7.58% Series
also is redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, subject
to certain restrictions on refunding, at a redemption price of $105.31,
$104.55, and $103.79 per share beginning April 1, 1995, 1996, and 1997,
respectively.

      Other Mandatorily Redeemable Securities:  On December 14, 1995, Western
Resources Capital I, a wholly-owned trust, issued four million preferred
securities of 7 7/8% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities, Series
A, for $100 million.  The trust interests represented by the preferred
securities are redeemable at the option of Western Resources Capital I, on or
after December 11, 2000, at $25 per  preferred security plus accrued interest
and unpaid dividends.  Holders of the securities are entitled to receive
distributions at an annual rate of 7 7/8% of the liquidation preference value
of $25.  Distributions are payable quarterly, and in substance are tax
deductible by the Company.  The sole asset of the trust is $103 million
principal amount of 7 7/8% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures, Series
A due December 11, 2025 (the Subordinated Debentures).

      In addition to the Company's obligations under the Subordinated
Debentures, the Company has agreed, pursuant to a guarantee issued to the
trust, the provisions of the trust agreement establishing the trust and a
related expense agreement to guarantee on a subordinated basis payment of
distributions on the preferred securities (but not if the trust does not have
sufficient funds to pay such distributions) and to pay all of the expenses of
the trust (collectively, the "Back-up Undertakings").

      Considered together, the Back-up Undertakings constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by the Company of the trust obligations under the
preferred securities.  The securities are shown as Western Resources Obligated
Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust holding solely
Subordinated Debentures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
Statements of Capitalization.

9.  INCOME TAXES

      Under SFAS 109, temporary differences gave rise to deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, as
follows:

                                                   1995             1994
                                                   (Dollars in Thousands)
Deferred Tax Assets:

      Accumulated Deferred
         Income Taxes, Net                          $1,167,470       $1,152,425


     In accordance with various rate orders received from the KCC and the OCC,
the Company has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a
significant portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities.  As management
believes it is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable
will be recovered from customers, it has recorded a deferred asset for these
amounts.  These assets are also a temporary difference for which deferred
income tax liabilities have been provided. 

      At December 31, 1995, the Company has alternative minimum tax credits
generated prior to April 1, 1992, which carry forward without expiration, of
$18.7 million which may be used to offset future regular tax to the extent the
regular tax exceeds the alternative minimum tax.  These credits have been
applied in determining the Company's net deferred income tax liability and
corresponding deferred future income taxes at December 31, 1995.


10.  LONG-TERM DEBT

      The amount of Western Resources' first mortgage bonds authorized by the
Western Resources Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as
supplemented, is unlimited.  The amount of KGE's first mortgage bonds
authorized by the KGE Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as
supplemented, is limited to a maximum of $2 billion.  Amounts of additional
bonds which may be issued are subject to property, earnings, and certain
restrictive provisions of each Mortgage.

      Debt discount and expenses are being amortized over the remaining lives of
each issue.  The Western Resources and KGE improvement and maintenance fund
requirements for certain first mortgage bond series can be met by bonding
additional property.  With the retirement of certain Western Resources and KGE
pollution control series bonds, there are no longer any bond sinking fund
requirements.  During 1996, $16 million of bonds will mature.  $125 million of
bonds will mature in 1999 and $75 million of bonds will mature in 2000.

<PAGE 55>
      In January 1993, the Company renegotiated its $600 million bank term loan
and revolving credit facility used to finance the Merger into a $350 million
revolving credit facility, secured by KGE common stock.  On October 5, 1994,
the Company extended the term of this facility to expire on October 5, 1999. 
The unused portion of the revolving credit facility may be used to provide
support for outstanding short-term debt.  At December 31, 1995, there was $50
million  outstanding under the facility.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1995 and 1994, was as follows:

                                                     1995           1994

forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for
Leases", for classification as capital leases.  Capital lease payments were
$3.0 million and $3.3 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively. At December 31,
1995, the Company had no capital leases.

      In 1987, KGE sold and leased back its 50% undivided interest in the La
Cygne 2 generating unit.  The La Cygne 2 lease has an initial term of 29
years, with various options to renew the lease or repurchase the 50% undivided
interest.  KGE remains responsible for its share of operation and maintenance
costs and other related operating costs of La Cygne 2.  The lease is an
operating lease for financial reporting purposes.

      As permitted under the La Cygne 2 lease agreement, the Company in 1992
requested the Trustee Lessor to refinance $341.1 million of secured facility
bonds of the Trustee and owner of La Cygne 2.  The transaction was requested
to reduce recurring future net lease expense.  In connection with the
refinancing on September 29, 1992, a one-time payment of approximately $27
million was made by the Company which has been deferred and is being amortized
over the remaining life of the lease and included in operating expense as part
of the future lease expense.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $23.7
million of this deferral remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

      Future minimum annual lease payments, included in the table above,
required under the La Cygne 2 lease agreement are approximately $34.6 million
for each year through 2000 and $646 million over the remainder of the lease.

      The gain of approximately $322 million realized at the date of the sale of
La Cygne 2 has been deferred for financial reporting purposes, and is being
amortized ($9.6 million per year) over the initial lease term in proportion to
the related lease expense.  KGE's lease expense, net of amortization of the
deferred gain and a one-time payment, was approximately $22.5 million for
1995, 1994, and 1993.

14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

      The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments":

      Cash and Cash Equivalents-
         The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the
     short-term maturity of these investments.
      Decommissioning Trust-
         The carrying amount is recorded at the fair value of the
         decommissioning trust and is based on quoted market prices at 
         December 31, 1995 and 1994.
      Variable-rate Debt-
         The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the 
     short-term variable rates of these debt instruments.
      Fixed-rate Debt-
         The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is based on the sum of
         the estimated value of each issue taking into consideration the
         interest rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.
      Redeemable Preference Stock-
         The fair value of the redeemable preference stock is based on the
         sum of the estimated value of each issue taking into consideration
         the dividend rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.
      Other Mandatorily Redeemable Securities-
         The fair value of the other mandatorily redeemable securities is based
         on the sum of the estimated value of each issue taking into 
         consideration the dividend rate, maturity, and redemption provisions
         of each issue.

The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company's financial
instruments are as follows:

      The fair value estimates presented herein are based on information

not been comprehensively revalued for the purpose of these financial
statements since that date, and current estimates of fair value may differ

      Certain subsidiaries of the Company use financial instruments to hedge
price fluctuations in their portfolios of commodity transactions.  The
financial instruments used include futures and options traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter
market.  These subsidiaries are subject to credit risk on its over-the-counter
transactions and monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties, which
consist primarily of large financial institutions.

15.  QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

      The amounts in the table are unaudited but, in the opinion of management,
contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods.  The
business of the Company is seasonal in nature and, in the opinion of
management, comparisons between the quarters of a year do not give a true
indication of overall trends and changes in operations.

                    WESTERN RESOURCES, INC.
                            BY-LAWS

                    (as amended May 5, 1992)

                           ARTICLE I

                          STOCKHOLDERS


          Section 1.     The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company
beginning with the year 1980, shall be held on the first Tuesday of May in
each year (or if said day be a legal holiday, then on the next succeeding day
not a holiday), at 11:00 A.M., at the principal office of the Company in the
City of Topeka, Kansas, or such other place in the State of Kansas as the
Board of Directors may designate for the purpose of electing Directors and
transacting such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

          Section 2.     Special meetings of the stockholders may be held upon
call of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board or the President,
at such time and at such place within or without the State of Kansas as may be
stated in the call and notice.

          Section 3.     Notice stating the place, day and hour of every
meeting of the stockholders, and in the case of a special meeting further
stating the purpose for which such meeting is called, shall be mailed at least
ten days before the meeting to each stockholder of record who shall be
entitled to vote thereat, at the last known post office address of each such
stockholder as it appears upon the books of the Company.  Such further notice
shall be given by mail, publication or otherwise, as may be required by law. 
Any meeting may be held without notice if all of the stockholders entitled to
vote are present or represented at the meeting, or all of the stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting sign a waiver thereof in writing.

          Section 4.     The holders of record of a majority of the shares of
the capital stock of the Company issued and outstanding, entitled to vote
thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum
at all meetings of the stockholders, and the vote of a majority of such quorum
shall be necessary for the transaction of any business, unless otherwise
provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or by the By-laws.  If at
any meeting there shall be no quorum, the holders of record, entitled to vote,
of a majority of such shares of stock so present or represented may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall have been obtained, when any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as first convened
had there been a quorum.
          Section 5.     Meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board or, if he is not present, by the President or, in
his absence, by a Vice President.  In the event that none of such officers be
present, then the meeting shall be presided over by a chairman to be chosen at
the meeting.  The Secretary of the Company or, if he is not present, an
Assistant Secretary of the Company or, if neither the Secretary nor an
Assistant Secretary is present, a secretary to be chosen at the meeting shall
act as secretary of the meeting.

          Section 6.     At all meetings of the stockholders every holder of
record of the shares of the capital stock of the Company, entitled to vote
thereat, may vote thereat either in person or by proxy.

          Section 7.     At all elections of directors the voting shall be by
written ballot and stockholders may cumulate their votes.

          Section 8.     The Board of Directors shall have power to close the
stock transfer books of the Company for a period not exceeding fifty days
preceding the date of 

     (a)  Any meeting of the stockholders;
     (b)  Any payment of any dividends;
     (c)  Any allotment of rights;
     (d)  Any effective date of change or conversion or exchange
of capital stock; or, in lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board
of Directors may fix in advance a date not exceeding fifty days preceding the
effective date of any of the above enumerated transactions, and in such case
only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed
shall be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at such meeting, or to
receive payment of such dividend, or to receive allotment of rights, or to
exercise rights of change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, as the
case may be, or to participate in any of the above transactions,
notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the Company after
such record date fixed as aforesaid.


                           ARTICLE II

                           DIRECTORS

          Section 1.     Subject to the provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation, the Directors shall be elected at the regular annual meeting of
stockholders, but if such election of Directors is not held on the day of the
annual meeting, the Directors shall cause the election to be held as soon
thereafter as conveniently may be.  Also, subject to the provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation, the Directors shall be divided into three classes,
which shall be as nearly equal in number as possible, and no class shall
include fewer than two Directors.  Directors shall hold office for a term of
three years and until their successors are elected and qualified, except that
in 1990, the first class of Directors shall be elected for a term of one year
and the second class of Directors shall be elected for a term of two years. 
Each class of Directors shall be designated by the year in which its term
ends.  The Board shall fill vacancies in any class in the manner prescribed in
this Article II, provided that any such newly elected Director shall serve for
the remainder of the term applicable to the vacancy being filled. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of the preferred stock or
preference stock issued by the Company shall have the right, voting separately
by class, to elect Directors at an annual or special meeting of the
stockholders, the election, term of office, and filling of vacancies of such
Directors shall be governed by the terms of the Articles of Incorporation
applicable thereto, and such Directors so elected shall not be divided into
classes pursuant to this paragraph.  Directors elected by a vote of the
holders of preferred stock or preference stock as provided in the Articles of
Incorporation shall hold office only so long as is required by the Articles of
Incorporation.  Except as otherwise provided in the By-laws and Articles of
Incorporation, no Director shall be removed except for cause.  This paragraph
shall not be amended or repealed, and no provision inconsistent herewith shall
be adopted, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote in any election.

     Each director who is not a salaried full time officer or employee of the
Company shall be conclusively deemed to have resigned from the Board of
Directors of the Company if he retires, resigns, or is removed from the
primary business position which he held at the time of his election to the
Board.

     No director who is not a salaried full time officer or employee of the
Company shall be designated by the Board of Directors of the Company as a
nominee for re-election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of
stockholders if he shall have attained the age of seventy (70) at year-end
prior to such annual meeting.

     No director who is a salaried full time officer or employee of the
Company shall be designated by the Board of Directors of the Company as a
nominee for re-election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of
stockholders, if he shall have attained the age of sixty-five (65) at year-end
prior to such annual meeting, or if he is no longer a full time officer or
employee of the Company, or if he has been removed, during the 12 month period
prior to Board action on nominees, from the position he previously held with
the Company, except that any chief executive officer serving on the Board may
be re-nominated for a maximum of five (5) years after his retirement as chief
executive officer, on a year to year basis.

     Each Director before entering upon his duties shall file with the
corporation written acceptance of his office.  A majority of the members of
the Board shall constitute a quorum for the filling of vacancies of the Board
of Directors and the transaction of business, but if at any meeting of the
Board there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of the Directors
present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice, other than
announcement of the meeting, until a quorum shall have been obtained, when any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
first convened had there been a quorum.  The acts of a majority of the
Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall, except as
otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws, be
the acts of the Board.

     Section 2.     Vacancies in the Board of Directors, caused by death,
resignation or otherwise, may be filled at any meeting of the Board of
Directors and the directors so elected shall hold office until the next annual
meeting of the stockholders and until their successors are elected and
qualified.

     Section 3.     Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such
place within or without the State of Kansas as may from time to time be fixed
by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the call of any meeting. 
Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such time as may from time to
time be fixed by resolution of the Board, and notice of such meetings need not
be given.  Special meetings of the Board may be held at any time upon call of
the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President, by oral,
telegraphic or written notice, duly served on or sent or mailed to each
director not less than two days before any such meeting.  Members of the Board
may participate in any meeting of such Board by means of conference telephone
or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in such
meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.  A meeting of the
Board may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of the
stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held.  Any meeting may
be held without notice if all of the directors are present at the meeting, or
if all of the directors sign a waiver thereof in writing.  Any action required
or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors may be taken
without a meeting if all members of the board consent thereto in writing, and
the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
board.

          Section 4.     Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided
over by the Chairman of the Board, or, if he is not present, by the President
or, if he is absent, by a Vice President.  In the event none of such officers
are present, then the meeting shall be presided over by a chairman to be
chosen at the meeting.  The Secretary of the Company or, if he is not present,
an Assistant Secretary of the Company or, if neither the Secretary nor an
Assistant Secretary is present, a secretary to be chosen at the meeting shall
act as secretary of the meeting.

          Section 5.     Each director of the Company who is not a salaried
officer or salaried employee of the Company shall be entitled to receive such
remuneration for serving as a director and as a member of any committee of the
Board as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.


                          ARTICLE III

                            OFFICERS

          Section 1.     The Board of Directors, as soon as may be after its
election held in each year, shall choose one of its number President of the
Company and shall appoint one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary and a
Treasurer of the Company and from time to time may appoint such Assistant
Secretaries, Assistant Treasurers, and other officers and agents of the
Company as it may deem proper.  The offices of Secretary and Treasurer may be
held by the same person, and a Vice President of the Company may also be
either the Secretary or the Treasurer.

          Section 2.     The term of office of all officers shall be one year
or until the respective successors are chosen or appointed, but any officer or
agent may be removed, with or without cause, at any time by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office.  No agreement
for the employment of any officer or agent for a period longer than one year
shall be authorized.

          Section 3.     Subject to such limitations as the Board of Directors
may from time to time prescribe, the officers of the Company shall each have
such powers and duties as generally pertain to their respective offices, as
well as such powers and duties as from time to time may be conferred by the
Board of Directors.  The Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurers and any other
officers or employees of the Company may be required to give bond for the
faithful discharge of their duties, in such sum and of such character as the
Board may from time to time prescribe.

          Section 4.     The salaries of all officers and agents of the Company
shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, or pursuant to such authority as the
Board may from time to time prescribe.


                           ARTICLE IV

                     CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

          Section 1.     The interest of each shareholder in the Company shall
be evidenced by a certificate or certificates for shares of stock of the
Company in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe.  Certificates for shares of stock of the Company shall be signed by
the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President and the
Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of this corporation and sealed with its
corporate seal, or when the same bear the facsimile signature of the Chairman
of the Board or the President or any Vice President and of the Treasurer or
any Assistant Treasurer of the corporation and its facsimile seal and shall be
countersigned and registered in such manner, if any, as the Board may by
resolution, prescribe.

          Section 2.     The shares of stock of the Company shall be
transferable only on the books of the Company by the holders thereof in person
or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of
certificates for a like number of shares of the same class of stock, with duly
executed assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto
and such proof of the authenticity of the signatures as the Company or its
agents may reasonably require.

          Section 3.     No certificate for shares of stock of the Company
shall be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, except upon production of such evidence of the loss, theft, or
destruction, and upon indemnification of the Company and its agents to such
extent and in such manner as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe.


                           ARTICLE V

                      CHECKS, NOTES, ETC.

     All checks and drafts on the Company's bank accounts and all bills of
exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other
instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed by such officer or
officers or agent or agents as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors; provided that checks drawn on the Company's
dividend, general and special accounts may bear the facsimile signature,
affixed thereto by a mechanical device, of such officer or agent as the Board
of Directors shall authorize.

                           ARTICLE VI
                                
                          FISCAL YEAR

     The Fiscal year of the Company shall begin on the first day of
January in each year and shall end on the thirty-first day of December

the Committee may require the spouse's consent. A Participant shall have the
right to change the Beneficiary by submitting to the Committee a Change of
Beneficiary in the form attached as Appendix III hereof; provided, however,
that no change of Beneficiary shall be effective until acknowledged in writing
by the Committee. If the Company has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary to
receive payments hereunder, the Company shall have the right to withhold such
payments until the matter is finally adjudicated. Any payment made or caused
to be made by the Company in good faith and in accordance with the provisions
of this Program and a Participant's Plan Agreement shall fully discharge the
Company from all further obligations with respect to such payment.






                           ARTICLE VI
                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                                
  If a Participant is authorized by the Company for any reason, including
military, medical, or other, to take a leave of absence from employment, such
Participant's Plan Agreement shall remain in effect.


                          ARTICLE VII
                       SOURCE OF BENEFITS
                                
  7.1  Benefits Payable.  Amounts payable hereunder shall be paid
exclusively from the general assets of the Company or the Rabbi Trust to be
established pursuant to Section 7.4, and no person entitled to payment
hereunder shall have any claim, right, security interest, or other interest in
any fund, trust, account, insurance contract, or asset of the Company which
may be looked to for such payment. The Company's liability for the payment of
benefits hereunder shall be evidenced only by this Program and each Plan
Agreement entered into between the Company and a Participant.

  7.2  Investments to Facilitate Payment of Benefits.  Although the
Company is not obligated to invest in any specific asset or fund, or purchase
any insurance contract, in order to provide the means for the payment of any
liabilities under this Program, the Company may elect to do so, and, in such
event, no Participant shall have any interest whatever in such asset, fund, or
insurance contract. In the event the Company elects to purchase or causes to
be purchased insurance contracts on the life of a Participant as a means for
making, offsetting, or contributing to any payment, in full or in part, which
may become due and payable by the Company under this Program or a
Participant's Plan Agreement, such Participant agrees to cooperate in the
securing of life insurance on such Participant's life by furnishing such
information as the Company and the insurance carrier may require, including
the results and reports of previous Company and other insurance carrier
physical examinations as may be requested, and taking any other action which
may be requested by the Company and the insurance carrier to obtain such
insurance coverage. If a Participant does not cooperate in the securing of
such life insurance, the Company shall have no further obligation to such
Participant under this Program, and such Participant's Plan Agreement shall
terminate.

  7.3  Ownership of Insurance Contracts.  The Company shall be the sole
owner of any insurance contracts acquired on the life of a Participant with
all incidents of ownership therein, including, but not limited to, the right
to cash and loan values, dividends, if any, death benefits, and the right to
termination thereof, and a Participant shall have no interest whatsoever in
such contracts, if any, and shall exercise none of the incidents of ownership
thereof.  Provided however, the Company may assign any such insurance
contracts to the trustee of the Rabbi Trust.

  7.4  Trust for Payment of Retirement Benefits.  The Company shall create
a Rabbi Trust for the purpose of facilitating any retirement benefits payable
hereunder.  Such trust will be funded upon the occurrence of any of the
following events:

       a) At the Retirement of, and commencement of payment to, a Plan
          Participant;
        
  b) Upon a decision by the Board of Directors ; 
        
  c) If the shareholders of the Company approve the merger or
       consolidation of the Company with or into any other
       corporation (other than a corporation wholly-owned by the
       Company immediately prior to such event) or the acquisition
       of substantially all of the business or assets of the
       Company by any other person or entity (other than a
       corporation wholly-owned by the Company immediately prior to
       such event);
        
  d) If a change occurs in the Board of Directors of the Company
       whereby Directors comprising a majority of the Board of
       Directors immediately prior to such change do not continue
       to comprise such a majority immediately after such change,
       provided that incremental and/or related changes (including
       but not limited to resignations from the Board of Directors)
       which occur within an 18 month period of time shall be
       considered to be but a single change for purposes of this
       subparagraph; or
        
  e) If, as a result of any tender offer or otherwise, any person
       or entity or affiliated group becomes the beneficial or
       record owner (directly or indirectly) of more than 10% of
       the outstanding voting securities of the Company.
  
     Such funding will be in the form of Single Premium Annuities, or an
amount sufficient for the trustee to purchase Single Premium Annuities, from
qualified and financially sound insurance companies to provide the applicable
vested retirement benefits payable under this Program and Plan Agreements.
Such funding and the purchase of insurance, if any, will not relieve the
Company of its obligations to pay or cause to be paid the benefits hereunder.

     In lieu of such funding of the trust with respect to a Participant, the
Participant may elect prior to such funding by the Company to receive the
present value thereof in a lump sum payment, less 6% of the amount thereof as
a substantial penalty, which penalty will be forfeited by the Participant. 
Upon such lump sum payment the Company shall have no further obligation to the
Participant.

                   TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

  Neither this Program nor a Participant's Plan Agreement, either singly
or collectively, in any way obligate the Company, or any subsidiary of the
Company, to continue the employment of a Participant with the Company, or any
subsidiary of the Company, nor does either limit the right of the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company at any time and for any reason to terminate the
Participant's employment. Termination of a Participant's employment with the
Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, for any reason, whether by action
of the Company, subsidiary, or Participant, shall immediately terminate the
Participant's participation in this Program and such Participant's Plan
Agreement, and all further obligations of either party thereunder, except as
may be provided in Article X and the Participant's Plan Agreement.  In no
event shall this Program or a Plan Agreement, either singly or collectively,
by their terms or implications constitute an employment contract of any nature
whatsoever between the Company, or any subsidiary, and a Participant.


                           ARTICLE IX
                  TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

  A Participant reserves the right to terminate participation in this
Program and such Participant's Plan Agreement at any time by giving the
Company written notice of such termination not less than 30 days (i) prior to
the anniversary date of any contract or contracts of insurance on the life of
such Participant which may be in force and utilized by the Company in
connection with this Program, or (ii) prior to the date a Participant selects
for termination if no insurance contract is in effect.



                           ARTICLE X
             TERMINATIONS, AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION,
                     OR SUPPLEMENT OF PLAN
                                
  10.1  Termination.  The Company reserves the right to terminate, amend,
modify, or supplement this Program, wholly or partially, from time to time,
and at any time. The Company likewise reserves the right to amend, modify, or
supplement any Plan Agreement, wholly or partially, from time to time. Such
right to terminate, amend, modify, or supplement this Program or any Plan
Agreement shall be exercised for the Company by the Committee; provided,
however, that the Committee shall take no action to terminate this Program or
a Plan Agreement or to reduce benefits, with respect to any person who is a
Participant (or a Beneficiary) at the time of the termination or reduction.
This prohibition against the reduction of Participants' benefits shall apply
as well to benefits Participants may earn (under this Program and their Plan
Agreement) by their future service and future increases in compensation. Any
termination of this Program shall be limited to Employees who at the time of
such termination are not Participants. Provided however, in the event of a
change of control of the Company, the surviving corporation, if other than the
Company, may terminate this Program and the Plan Agreements upon substitution
by such corporation of a plan or program providing benefits no less favorable
to the Participants. 

  10.2  Rights and Obligations Upon Termination.  Upon the termination of
this Program by the Committee, or the termination of any Plan Agreement by a
Participant, in accordance with the provisions for such termination, neither
this Program nor the Plan Agreement shall be of any further force or effect,
and no party shall have any further obligation under either this Program or
any Plan Agreement so terminated, except as provided in Sections 4.3, 10.1 or
as elsewhere provided in this Program.


                           ARTICLE XI
                 OTHER BENEFITS AND AGREEMENTS

  The benefits provided for a Participant and such Participant's
Beneficiary hereunder and under such Participant's Plan Agreement are in
addition to any other benefits available to such Participant under any other
program, plan or agreement of the Company for its Employees and the
Participants, and, except as may be otherwise expressly provided for, this
Program and Plan Agreements entered into hereunder shall supplement and shall
not supersede, modify, or amend any other program, plan or agreement of the
Company or a Participant. Moreover, benefits under this Program and Plan
Agreements entered into hereunder shall not be considered compensation for the
purpose of computing contributions or benefits under any plan maintained by
the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, which is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


                          ARTICLE XII
             RESTRICTIONS ON ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

  No right or benefit under this Program or a Plan Agreement shall be
subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or
charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge,
encumber, or charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit hereunder or
under any Plan Agreement shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the
debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the person entitled to such
benefit. If any Participant or Beneficiary under this Program or a Plan
Agreement should become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell,
assign, pledge, encumber, or charge any right to a benefit hereunder or under
any Plan Agreement, then such right or benefit shall, in the discretion of the
Committee, cease, and in such event, the Committee may hold or apply the same
or any part thereof for the benefit of such Participant or Beneficiary, his or
her spouse, children, or other dependents, or any of them, in such portion as
the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may deem proper.

I acknowledge that, as an Employee of Western Resources, Inc., I have been
offered an opportunity to participate in the Western Resources, Inc. Executive
Salary Continuation Program (Program) described in the attached document
(which is incorporated herein by reference), and that I have elected one of
the alternatives set forth as indicated by the space which I have checked:

________  To participate in the Program

________  Not to participate in the Program

My Retirement Benefit, disability benefits, death benefits, and commencement
of such payments, and designated Beneficiary(ies) are agreed to be as follows:

   1.A Retirement Benefit (Article IV of Program).  Subject to the vesting
schedule in Section 4.3 of the Program, an amount which, when combined with
existing pension benefits under the Western Resources, Inc. Retirement Plan,
will provide the percentage of the final 36 months average Compensation, for
life (15 years minimum) as illustrated below:

Retirement Benefit Payments will be based on the following table depending
upon the Participant's age when Benefit Payments are to commence:

                    Age At        Payout Percentage Factor
           Commencement of     Of Retirement Benefit

  2. IRC Sections 401(a)(17) and 415(b) Limitations.  Notwithstanding
Paragraphs 1A and 1B above, the Program and this Plan Agreement shall provide
a Retirement Benefit attributable to the Participant's annual base
compensation that is in excess of IRC Sections 401(a)(17) and 415(b)
limitations. This benefit will be computed by applying the same benefit
formula, vesting provisions, and early retirement provisions as are in the
Western Resources, Inc. Pension Plan. Any benefit provided under this
provision will offset the benefit provided under Paragraphs 1A and 1B above.

  3. Disability Benefit (Article IV of Program).  If Total and Permanent
Disability should occur prior to Retirement, an amount which, when combined
with then existing pension benefits under the Western Resources, Inc.
Retirement Plan, will provide 61.7% of the final 36 months average 
Compensation for life (15 years minimum).

  4. Death Benefit. (Article III of Program). If death occurs before
Retirement, an amount which, when combined with then existing pension benefits
under the Western Resources, Inc. Retirement Plan, will provide 50% (or the
vested Retirement Benefit, whichever is greater) of the previous 36 months
average Compensation, payable to the Beneficiary for 180 months following
death.

  5. Participant hereby designates as Primary Beneficiary under the Program
and this Plan Agreement:



and, Participant hereby designates as Secondary Beneficiary under the Program
and this Plan Agreement: 



The term "Beneficiary" as used herein shall mean the Primary Beneficiary if
such Primary Beneficiary shall survive Participant by at least 30 days, and
shall mean the Secondary Beneficiary if Primary Beneficiary does not survive
Participant by at least 30 days, and shall mean the Estate of the Participant,
if neither Primary nor Secondary Beneficiary survives Participant by at least
30 days. Participant shall have the right to change Participant's designation
of Primary and/or Secondary Beneficiary from time to time, in such manner as
shall be required by the Company, it being agreed that no change in
beneficiary shall be effective until acknowledged in writing by the Committee.
(If Beneficiary is to be irrevocable, strike and initial previous sentence.)

I further acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries,
affiliated companies, officers, employees, or agents has any responsibility
whatsoever for the changes which I may make in other personal plans or
programs as a result of my decision regarding the Program and they are fully
released to such extent. The Company agrees that although the Program may be
terminated or modified at any time, in the sole discretion of the Company, a
Participant shall have those rights provided for in Article X of said Program
to the extent such may be applicable to such Participant's at the time of such
termination.

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Western Resources, Inc. and Plan Participant have

VII.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

the one hand) or the Purchaser (on the other hand) (the
"Indemnifying Party"), shall indemnify respectively the Purchaser
(on the one hand) or the Seller and the Guarantor (on the other
hand), respectively (the "Indemnified Party"), as the case may be,
and their respective directors, officers, agents, and affiliates,
against and in respect of any liabilities, damages, losses, costs
and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and
litigation and reasonable attorneys', accountants' and other
professionals' fees and costs incurred in the investigation or
defense thereof or the enforcement of rights hereunder) incurred by

          7.3  Method of Asserting Claims, etc.  All claims for
indemnification by any Indemnified Party hereunder shall be
asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section 7.3.

               (a)  The Indemnified Party shall give prompt written
notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party of any
assertion of liability which might give rise to a claim for
indemnification based on the provisions of Section 7.2 hereof,
which notice shall state the nature and basis of the assertion  and
the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which
amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount), provided,
however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
giving any such Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any indemnification obligation hereunder.

               (b)  If any claim is made or any action, suit or

against an Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party may have liability under the provisions of Section 7.2
hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such
Third Party Claim provided that it gives written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days after its receipt of the related
Claim Notice that such Third Party Claim  is covered by the
provisions of Section 7.2 hereof.

               (c)  Notwithstanding the provision of the previous
subsection, until the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
retain the right to handle the defense thereof.  Furthermore, if
(i) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
there are likely to be defenses available to the Indemnified Party
that are different from or in addition to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (ii) the Third Party Claim involves other
than money damages and seeks injunctive or other equitable relief,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of such third Party Claim and the defense of the Third Party Claim
shall be handled by the Indemnified Party.  If under any
circumstances the defense of the Third Party Claim is handled by
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay all legal
and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in
conducting such defense in accordance with Section 7.2 hereof.

               (d)  In any Third Party Claim initiated by a third
party and defended by the Indemnifying Party (i) the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to be represented by advisory counsel
and accountants, at its own expense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall keep the Indemnified Party fully informed as to the status of
such Third Party Claim, at all stages thereof, whether or not the
Indemnified Party is represented by its own counsel, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall make available
to the other, and its counsel, accountants and other
representatives, all of such party's books and records relating to
such Third Party Claim and (iv) the parties shall render to each
other such  assistance as may be reasonably required in order to
ensure the proper and adequate defense of such Third Party Claim.

               (e) In any Third Party Claim initiated by a third
party and defended by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying

Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party.

herein; and

          WHEREAS, the Seller, Guarantor and the Purchaser also
desire to set forth their agreements with respect to certain rights
which exist between them with respect to the Shares and the Option
Shares.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:


I.   OPTION

          1.1  Grant of Option to Purchase Option Shares.  The
Seller hereby irrevocably grants to the Purchaser an option to 
purchase at any time on or after the Closing Date (as defined in
the Stock Purchase Agreement) and prior to May 15, 1997, the Option
Shares at a price per share of Common Stock of the greater of
(i) $14.00 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as
provided herein (the "Floor Price"), and (ii) the Market Price per
share of Common Stock at the time the Purchaser delivers a notice
of exercise pursuant to Section 1.2, subject to adjustment as
provided herein (the "Exercise Price") (such option is referred to
herein as the "Option").

          1.2  Exercise of the Option.  The Option may be exercised
by the Purchaser by delivering to the Seller at least 5 Business
Days in advance of the exercise date specified in the notice (the
"Exercise Date") written notice of such exercise, signed by the
Purchaser.

          1.3  Exercise Price; Payment.

               (a)  The Exercise Price shall consist of (i) cash,
or (ii) at Purchaser's option, (A) a 6% promissory note due
January 10, 1999 substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
"Note") of the Purchaser in an aggregate principal amount, at the
Purchaser's option, of up to $150,000,000 and (B) an amount of cash
equal to the balance of the Exercise Price.  Purchaser may not
issue the Note in satisfaction of a portion of the Exercise Price
if, at the date of delivery of notice of the Exercise Date,
Purchaser's First Mortgage Notes are rated less than investment
grade by either Standard & Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors
Service, Inc.

               (b)  On the Exercise Date at the Closing (as defined
in Section 6.1), the Purchaser shall, as required by
Section 1.3(a), (i) deliver to the Seller a duly executed Note and
(ii) pay to the Seller any cash consideration by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank account as the Seller
shall specify in writing to Purchaser not later than three Business
Days prior to the Exercise Date, against evidence that the
Purchaser has been entered in the register of members of the
Company and delivery to the Purchaser by the transfer agent of the
Company of a certificate or certificates representing the Option
Shares (subject to adjustment as provided herein), free and clear
of all liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances whatsoever
(including, without limitation, any voting trust or similar
agreement affecting the right to vote the Options Shares), and, if
required, bearing a  customary legend reflecting that the Option
Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, such
legend, if any, and certificate in form and substance satisfactory
to the Purchaser and in such name or names designated by the
Purchaser.

               (c)  Following the Exercise Date, and for a period
equal to the shorter of (a) twenty days after the Exercise Date and
(b) the time of a public announcement by a third party unaffiliated
with the Purchaser that it intends to acquire the entire share
capital of the Company, Purchaser and its affiliates will not
publicly announce that they intend to acquire the entire share
capital of the Company at a fixed price per share of common stock
unless they pay to Seller in cash the difference between such price
and the Exercise Price; provided, however, that such additional
payment shall only be made if Purchaser and its affiliates
consummate such transaction at a price equal to or greater than the
announced price.

          1.4  Adjustments Generally.  The Floor Price and the
number of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property)
deliverable upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events,
as provided in Sections 1.5 to 1.10 hereof.

          1.5  Common Stock Reorganization.  If the Company shall
after the date hereof subdivide its outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a greater number of shares or consolidate its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
(any such event being called a "Common Stock Reorganization"), then
(a) the Floor Price shall be adjusted, effective immediately after
the record date at which the holders of shares of Common Stock are
determined for purposes of such Common Stock Reorganization, to a
price determined by multiplying the Floor Price in effect
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
on such record date before giving effect to such Common Stock
Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to such
Common Stock Reorganization, and (b) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to purchase upon exercise of the Option shall be
adjusted, effective at such time, to a number determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
purchase immediately before such Common Stock Reorganization by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of  shares
outstanding after giving effect to such Common Stock Reorganization
and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Common Stock
Reorganization.

          1.6  Common Stock Distribution.  If the Company shall
after the date hereof issue or otherwise sell any shares of Common
Stock (otherwise than pursuant to a Common Stock Reorganization),
or any right to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or a
security convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or
issue any securities convertible into or exercisable for Common
Stock, such that the price per share of Common Stock so issued or
sold, or the price per share of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise, conversion or exchange, is less than the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock on the date of any such issuance or the
date of announcement of any such issuance, the Purchaser and Seller
shall in good faith determine an adjustment to the Floor Price that
reflects the dilutive effect of any such issuance.  In the event
that the Purchaser and Seller cannot agree to an adjustment,
Purchaser and Seller shall reduce their respective proposals to
writing and shall mutually designate a nationally recognized
investment bank to select one of the two proposals, as submitted,
as the final determination of the dispute.  The fees and expenses
of the investment bank so selected shall be for the account of the
party whose proposal is not adopted by the investment bank.

          1.7  Dividends.  If the Company shall after the date
hereof issue or distribute to all or substantially all holders of
shares of Common Stock evidences of indebtedness, any other
securities of the Company or any cash, property or other assets,
and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute a Common
Stock Reorganization or a Common Stock Distribution (any such
nonexcluded event being herein called a "Dividend"), such Dividend
shall be held by the Seller in trust for the Purchaser.  At the
time of the exercise of the Option, Purchaser shall have the option
to either (A) elect to receive any such Dividend in which event the
Market Price shall be increased by the Fair Market Value of the
Dividend at the time of its distribution or (B) elect not to
receive any such Dividend, in which event the Floor Price shall be
reduced by the Fair Market Value of the Dividend at the time of its
distribution.

          1.8  Capital Reorganization.  If after the date hereof
there shall be any consolidation or merger to which the Company is
a party, other than a consolidation or a merger in  which the
Company is a continuing corporation and which does not result in
any reclassification of, or change (other than a Common Stock
Reorganization or a change in par value), in, outstanding shares of
Common Stock, or any sale or conveyance of the property of the
Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (any such
event being called a "Capital Reorganization"), then, effective
upon the effective date of such Capital Reorganization, the
Purchaser shall have the right to purchase, upon exercise of the
Option, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
and property (including cash) which the Purchaser would have owned
or have been entitled to receive after such Capital Reorganization
if the Option had been exercised immediately prior to such Capital
Reorganization.

          1.9  Certain Other Events.  If any event occurs after the
date hereof as to which the foregoing Sections 1.5 to 1.8 of this
Article I are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable,
would not, in the good faith judgment of the Purchaser, fairly
protect the purchase right of the Option in accordance with the
essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall make such adjustments in the
application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential
intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary to protect
such purchase rights as aforesaid, but in no event shall any such
adjustment have the effect of increasing the Floor Price or
decreasing the number of shares of Common Stock subject to purchase
upon exercise of the Option, or otherwise adversely affect the
holder of the Option.

          1.10  Adjustment Rules.  (a)  Any adjustments pursuant to
Sections 1.5 to 1.9 of this Article I shall be made successively
whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.

               (b)  If the Company shall set a record date to
determine the holders of shares of Common Stock for purposes of a
Common Stock Reorganization, Common Stock Distribution, Dividend or
Capital Reorganization, and shall legally abandon such action prior
to effecting such Action, then no adjustment shall be made pursuant
to this Article I in respect of such action.

          1.11  Reservation of Shares.  The Seller will keep
available at all times the number of Option Shares deliverable from
time to time upon exercise of the Option, free and clear  of all
liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances whatsoever.


II.  VOTING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OPTION SHARES

          2.1  Proxy.  The Seller hereby grants the Purchaser or a
corporate representative of the Purchaser an irrevocable proxy
deemed coupled with an interest, with full power of substitution,
effective as of the Closing Date (as defined in the Stock Purchase
Agreement) with the full right, power and authority to exercise all
voting and other rights of the Seller with respect to the Option
Shares at any annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of
the Company's shareholders, by written consent or otherwise;
provided that such proxy shall terminate with respect to all Option
Shares upon the expiration of the Option or the termination of this
Agreement.  The Seller agrees to execute such additional forms of
proxy consistent with the terms of this Section 2.1 as the
Purchaser may request in order to more effectively vest in the
Purchaser the right to vote the Option Shares in accordance with
the Section 2.1.  If at any time the holder of this proxy votes the
Option Shares in accordance with the Seller's written request, such
action shall not serve to revoke the proxy or to require the
Purchaser to vote in accordance with the Seller's request in future
votes.  The Seller agrees that during the term of the proxy granted
pursuant to this Section 2.1 that the Seller will not directly or
indirectly deposit any Option Shares in a voting trust or subject
them to a voting agreement, grant any other proxy with respect
thereto or enter into any other arrangement of similar effect.


III. TAG ALONG RIGHTS

          3.1  Sales by the Purchaser Subject to Tag-Along Rights. 
(a)  In the event that the Purchaser proposes at any time on or
before May 15, 1997 to effect a sale of more than 2,000,000 Shares
prior to the Exercise Date, then the Purchaser shall promptly give
written notice (the "Tag-Along Notice") to the Seller at least
thirty days prior to the closing of such sale.  The Tag-Along
Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed sale
including, without limitation, the name of, and the number of
Shares to be purchased by, the transferee, the purchase price of
each Share to be sold, any other significant terms of such sale and
the date such proposed sale is expected to be consummated.

               (b)  The Seller shall have the right, exercisable
upon irrevocable written notice to the Purchaser within five
Business Days after receipt of the Tag-Along Notice, to participate
in such sale of Shares on the same terms and conditions as set
forth in the Tag-Along Notice, including, without limitation, the
making of all representations, warranties, indemnifications and
similar agreements, and to sell any portion of the number of the
Option Shares but not more than the Seller's pro rata portion of
the Shares proposed to be sold.  The Seller shall also pay its pro
rata portion of the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by the Purchaser in connection with any such
sale.  The Seller shall indicate in its notice of election to the
Purchaser the number of Option Shares it desires to sell in such
sale, which number may not be in excess of one-half the number of
Shares proposed to be sold in the Tag-Along Notice.  To the extent
the Seller exercises such right of participation in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.1, the number
of Shares that the Purchaser may sell in the transaction shall be
correspondingly reduced.  Not later than two Business Days prior to
the date scheduled for such sale, the Purchaser shall confirm to
the Seller the number of Option Shares to be sold by the Seller in
such sale.

               (c)  The Seller shall effect its participation in
the sale by delivering on the date scheduled for such sale to the
Purchaser for delivery to the prospective transferee one or more
certificates, in proper form for transfer, which represent the
number of Option Shares which the Seller is entitled to sell in
accordance with this Section 3.1.  In addition, the Seller shall
deliver such other documents and certificates as are required in
connection with such sale.  Such stock certificate or certificates
that the Seller delivers to the Purchaser shall be delivered on
such date to such transferee in consummation of the sale of the
Option Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the
Tag-Along Notice, and the Purchaser shall concurrently therewith
remit to the Seller that portion of the sale proceeds to which the
Seller is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale. 
The Purchaser's sale of Shares in any sale proposed in a Tag-Along
Notice shall be effected on the terms and conditions set forth in
such Tag-Along Notice.

               (d)  The exercise or non-exercise of the rights of
the Seller to participate in one or more sales of Shares made by
the Purchaser shall not adversely affect its rights to  participate
in subsequent sales of Shares subject to this Section 3.1

following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

               (a)  "Business Day" shall mean any day on which
banks are not required or authorized to close in New York City.

               (b)  "Closing Price" with respect to any security on

the principal national securities exchange on which such class of
security is listed or admitted to trading, or (b) if such security
is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities
exchange, the last quoted sales price, or, if not so quoted, the

               (c)  "Fair Market Value" means the fair market value
of the business or property in question, as determined in good
faith by Purchaser and Seller, provided, however, that the Fair

shall from time to time be traded) on each of the twenty (20)
trading days immediately preceding the delivery of notice of the
Exercise Date; provided, however, that if, within twenty (20)
trading days immediately preceding delivery of notice of the
Exercise Date, a third party unaffiliated with the Purchaser makes
a public announcement that it intends to acquire the entire share
capital of the Company at a fixed price per share of Common Stock,
Market Price shall mean the amount equal to the average per share 
closing price (regular way) for a round lot of shares of Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or, if not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other principal exchange or system in the
United States on which the Common Stock shall from time to time be
traded) on each trading day ended after such announcement, but in
no event more than the fixed price so announced.

during a period following the announcement by the Company of (A) a
dividend or distribution of Common Stock, or (B) any subdivision,
combination or reclassification of Common Stock and prior to the
expiration of 20 Business Days after the ex-dividend date for such
dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision,
combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the
Trading Market Price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
current market price per share equivalent of Common Stock.

          9.8  Applicable Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

          9.9  Section and Other Headings.  The section and other
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.  

          9.10  Submission to Jurisdiction.  (a)  Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents that any action or proceeding
brought by the other party hereto in respect of the  transaction
contemplated hereby may be brought in the courts of the State of
New York in the Borough of Manhattan or of the United States of
America for the Southern District of New York and, by execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waive any objection, including, without limitation, any objection
to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non
conveniens, which any of them may now or hereafter have to the

          9.11  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the

pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any
order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental

     such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding
     commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for

     reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts
     under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or

          6.   Miscellaneous.  THIS NOTE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A
CONTRACT UNDER THE LAWS OF NEW YORK, AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF SAID STATE WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.  The parties hereto hereby

or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding
brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding
brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                                   April 27, 1995




Mr. David C. Wittig
1030 Fifth Avenue, Apt. 8W
New York, NY 10028

Dear David:

     We have had discussions over the last few months about our mutual
interest in your taking a position on Western Resources' senior management
team.  Based on those discussions, and subject to the approval of the Western
Resources Board of Directors, I am pleased to offer you the position of
Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy for Western Resources.  In that
position, you would report to me and be primarily responsible for leading our
effort to grow our business.  In addition, as a member of Western Resources'
President's Council, you would participate with other senior officers in the
formation and implementation of corporate policy regarding all aspects of the
Company's operations.

     Your annual base compensation would be set at $425,000.  The Board's
current practice is to review officer compensation annually at its January
meeting.  In addition to base compensation, you would be eligible to
participate in the Company's standard short and long term incentive plans for
officers.  Those plans, while subject to change, currently provide an
opportunity for additional cash compensation of up to 36% of base and, on a
rolling three year basis, a common stock grant equivalent in value of up to
10% of base.  (Since you would be joining the Company at mid-year, we would
establish partial year goals for you for the balance of 1995 and would pro
rate your eligibility for 1995 incentive awards.)  In addition, you will be
enrolled in Western Resources, Inc.'s Executive Salary Continuation Plan
(revised March 15, 1995).

     As an inducement to cause you to favorably consider accepting a combined
level of base and incentive compensation, which is significantly below the
level you have regularly earned in your present position, and as a means to
encourage your long term commitment to Western Resources, we offer you the
following non-standard benefit.  Upon four years employment with Western
Resources, you will vest in a supplemental benefit in a form agreeable to you
and the Company, which is equivalent in value to an annual cash outlay by the
Company of $25,000, beginning in 1995 and continuing through 2020.







Mr. David C. Wittig

April 27, 1995


     In addition to the above, you will receive all benefits which are
customarily offered to officers who serve on Western Resources' President's
Council.  These include a deferred compensation plan, a 401(K) savings plan, a
qualified retirement plan, medical/dental insurance, life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short and long term disability
protection, sick leave, vacation and holiday leave, up to $5,000 annually to
cover financial planning and tax preparation, a car allowance, personal use of
a cellular phone, a club membership, an employment agreement, and relocation
benefits, as we have discussed.

     David, I believe this is an outstanding opportunity for you and for
Western Resources.  I look forward to your early reply and to welcoming you to
the Western Resources team.  Please call me if you want to discuss any of
this.

                                   Sincerely,





Accepted:

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    
ACQUISITION AND MERGER

    On March 31, 1992, Western Resources, Inc. (formerly The Kansas Power and
Light Company) (Western Resources) through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA), acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KGE) (the Merger).  Simultaneously, KCA
and Kansas Gas and Electric Company merged and adopted the name Kansas Gas and
Electric Company (the Company, KGE).

    Additional information relating to the Merger can be found in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

GENERAL

    The Company is an electric public utility engaged in the generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in the southeastern
quarter of Kansas including the Wichita metropolitan area.  The Company owns
47% of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, the operating company for
Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  Corporate headquarters of the
Company is located in Wichita, Kansas.  The Company has no gas properties.  At
December 31, 1995, the Company had no employees.  All employees are provided
by the Company's parent, Western Resources, Inc. (Western Resources).

    In January 1996, the KCC initiated an order for a generic investigation to
analyze matters related to the potential restructuring of the electric
industry and the overall implications to both utilities and public interests
within the state of Kansas.  This order was initiated given recent
developments at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), other state
regulatory agencies and increased competition among utilities related to large
industrial electric customers.  The order was established as a means to define
the KCC's role within the electric generation industry as it may become more
competitive, and address any developments as they may occur.  Currently, there
are no proceedings or actions at the KCC which would open the Company's
current electric markets to greater competition, nor establish guidelines at
to a change in the degree of regulatory oversight that the KCC has on the
Company's operations.

    For discussion regarding competition in the electric utility industry and
the potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Other Information,
Competition included herein.  

    Discussion of other factors affecting the Company are set forth in the
Notes to Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis
included herein.

Capacity

    The aggregate net generating capacity of the Company's system is presently
2,501 megawatts (MW).  The system comprises interests in twelve fossil fueled
steam generating units, one nuclear generating unit (47% interest) and one
diesel generator, located at seven generating stations.  One of the twelve
fossil fueled units (70 MW capacity) has been "mothballed" for future use (See
Item 2. Properties).

    The Company's 1995 peak system net load occurred on July 11, 1995 and
amounted to 1,855 MW.  The Company's net generating capacity together with
power available from firm interchange and purchase contracts, provided a
capacity margin of approximately 17% above system peak responsibility at the
time of the peak.

    The Company and ten companies in Kansas and western Missouri have agreed
to provide capacity (including margin), emergency and economy services for
each other.  This arrangement is called the MOKAN Power Pool.  The pool
participants also coordinate the planning of electric generating and
transmission facilities.
<PAGE 5>
    The Company is one of 47 members of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).  SPP's
responsibility is to maintain system reliability on a regional basis.  The
region encompasses areas within the eight states of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.

    In 1994, the Company joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP).  Under
this arrangement, over 103 electric utilities and marketers throughout the
western United States have agreed to market energy and to provide transmission
services.  WSPP's intent is to increase the efficiency of the interconnected
power systems operations over and above existing operations.  Services
available include short-term and long-term economy energy transactions, unit
commitment service, firm capacity and energy sales, energy exchanges, and
transmission service by intermediate systems.

    During 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Midwest Energy,
Inc. (MWE), whereby the Company will provide MWE with peaking capacity of 61
megawatts through the year 2008.  The Company also entered into an agreement
with Empire District Electric Company (Empire), whereby the Company will
provide Empire with peaking and base load capacity (20 megawatts in 1994
increasing to 80 megawatts in 2000) through the year 2000.

Future Capacity

    The Company does not contemplate any significant expenditures in
connection with construction of any major generating facilities through the
turn of the century (See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis,
Liquidity and Capital Resources).  The Company has capacity available which
may not be fully utilized by growth in customer demand for at least 4 years. 
The Company continues to market this capacity and energy to other utilities.

Fuel Mix

    The Company's coal-fired units comprise 1,100 MW of the total 2,501 MW of
generating capacity and the Company's nuclear unit provides 548 MW of
capacity.  Of the remaining 853 MW of generating capacity, units that can burn
either natural gas or oil account for 850 MW, and the remaining unit which
burns only diesel fuel accounts for 3 MW (See Item 2. Properties).

    During 1995, low sulfur coal was used to produce 52% of the Company's
electricity.  Nuclear produced 40% and the remainder was produced from natural
gas, oil, or diesel fuel.  During 1996, based on the Company's estimate of the
availability of fuel, coal will to be used to produce approximately 61% of the
Company's electricity and nuclear will be used to produce 31%.

    The Company's fuel mix fluctuates with the operation of nuclear powered
Wolf Creek which has an 18-month refueling and maintenance schedule.  The
18-month schedule permits uninterrupted operation every third calendar year. 
Wolf Creek was taken off-line on February 3, 1996 for its eighth refueling and
maintenance outage.  The outage is expected to last approximately 60 days
during which time electric demand will be met primarily by the Company's
coal-fired operating units.

<PAGE 6>




Nuclear

    The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract 75% of the uranium
required for operation of Wolf Creek through the year 2003.  The balance is
expected to be obtained through spot market and contract purchases.  The
Company has four contracts with the following three suppliers for uranium:
Cameco, Geomex Minerals, Inc., and Power Resources, Inc.  

    The Company has three contracts for uranium enrichment performed by USEC,
Urenco and Nuexco Trading Corp.  These contractual arrangements cover 100% of
Wolf Creek's uranium enrichment requirements for 1996-1997, 90% for 1998-1999,
95% for 2000-2001 and 100% for 2005-2014.  The balance of the 1998-2005
requirements is expected to be obtained through a combination of spot market
and contract purchases.  The decision not to contract for the full enrichment
requirements is one of cost rather than availability of service. 

    A contractual arrangement is in place with Cameco for the conversion of
uranium to uranium hexafluoride sufficient to meet Wolf Creek's requirements
through the year 2000. 

    The Company has entered into all of its uranium, uranium enrichment and
uranium hexaflouride arrangements during the ordinary course of business and
is not substantially dependent upon these agreements.  The Company believes
there are other suppliers and plentiful sources available at reasonable prices
to replace, if necessary, these contracts.  In the event that the Company were
required to replace these contracts, it would not anticipate a substantial
disruption of its business.

    The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established schedules, guidelines and
responsibilities for the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop and construct
repositories for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. 
The DOE has not yet constructed a high-level waste disposal site and has
announced that a permanent storage facility may not be in operation prior to
2010 although an interim storage facility may be available earlier.  Wolf
Creek contains an on-site spent fuel storage facility  which, under  current 
regulatory  guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The Company
believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained as necessary.

    Additional information with respect to insurance coverage applicable to
the operations of the Company's nuclear operating facility is set forth in
Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements.

Coal

    The three coal-fired units at Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) have an
aggregate capacity of 428 MW (KGE's 20% share) (See Item 2. Properties). 
Western Resources, the operator of JEC, and KGE, have a long-term coal supply
contract with Amax Coal West, Inc. (AMAX), a subsidiary of Cyprus Amax Coal
Company, to supply low sulfur coal to JEC from AMAX's Eagle Butte Mine or an
alternate mine source of AMAX's Belle Ayr Mine, both located in the Powder
River Basin in Campbell County, Wyoming.  The contract expires December 31,
2020.  The contract contains a schedule of minimum annual delivery quantities
based on MMBtu provisions.  The coal to be supplied is surface mined and has
an average Btu content of approximately 8,300 Btu per pound and an average
<PAGE 7>
sulfur content of .43 lbs/MMBtu (See Environmental Matters).  The average
delivered cost of coal for JEC was approximately $1.13 per MMBtu or $18.71 per
ton during 1995.

    Coal is transported by Western Resources from Wyoming under a long-term
rail transportation contract with Burlington Northern (BN) and Union Pacific
(UP) to JEC through December 31, 2013.  Rates are based on net load carrying
capabilities of each rail car.  Western Resources provides 890 aluminum rail
cars, under a 20 year lease, to transport coal to JEC.

    The two coal-fired units at La Cygne Station have an aggregate generating
capacity of 672 MW (KGE's 50% share) (See Item 2.  Properties).  The operator,
Kansas City Power & Light  Company (KCPL), maintains coal contracts as
discussed in the following paragraphs.

    La Cygne 1 uses low sulfur Powder River Basin coal which is supplied under
a variety of spot market transactions, discussed below.  Illinois or
Kansas/Missouri coal is blended with the Powder River Basin coal and is
secured from time to time under spot market arrangements.  La Cygne 1 uses a
blend of 85% Powder River Basin coal.

    La Cygne 2 and additional La Cygne 1 Powder River Basin coal is supplied
through several contracts expiring at various times through 1998.  This low
sulfur coal had an average Btu content of approximately 8,500 Btu per pound
and a maximum sulfur content of .50 lbs/MMBtu (See Environmental Matters). 
For 1996, KCPL has secured Powder River Basin coal from Powder River Coal
Company, a subsidiary of Peabody Coal Company.  Transportation is covered by
KCPL through its Omnibus Rail Transportation Agreement with BN and Kansas City
Southern Railroad through December 31, 2000. 
    
    During 1995, the average delivered cost of all local and Powder River
Basin coal procured for La Cygne 1 was approximately $0.88 per MMBtu or $15.31
per ton and the average delivered cost of Powder River Basin coal for La Cygne
2 was approximately $0.75 per MMBtu or $12.56 per ton.

    The Company has entered into all of its coal and transportation contracts
during the ordinary course of business and is not substantially dependent upon
these contracts.  The Company believes there are other supplies for and
plentiful sources of coal available at reasonable prices to replace, if
necessary, fuel to be supplied pursuant to these contracts.  In the event that
the Company were required to replace its coal or transportation agreements, it
would not anticipate a substantial disruption of the Company's business.

Natural Gas

    The Company uses natural gas as a primary fuel in its Gordon Evans and
Murray Gill Energy Centers.  Natural gas for these generating stations is
supplied by readily available gas from the spot market.  Short-term economical
spot market purchases will supply the system with the flexible natural gas
supply to meet operational needs.

Oil

    The Company uses oil as an alternate fuel when economical or when
interruptions to natural gas make it necessary.  Oil is also used as a
supplemental fuel at JEC and La Cygne generating stations.  All oil burned by
<PAGE 8>
the Company during the past several years has been obtained by spot market
purchases.  At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 676 thousand
gallons of No. 2 oil and 11 million gallons of No. 6 oil which is believed to
be sufficient to meet emergency requirements and protect against lack of
availability of natural gas and/or the loss of a large generating unit.

Other Fuel Matters

    The Company's contracts to supply fuel for its coal and natural gas-fired
generating units, with the exception of JEC, do not provide full fuel
requirements at the various stations.  Supplemental fuel is procured on the
spot market to provide operational flexibility and, when the price is
favorable, to take advantage of economic opportunities.

    Set forth in the table below is information relating to the weighted
average cost of fuel used by the Company.
                                  1995     1994     1993     1992     1991

Environmental Matters

    The Company currently holds all Federal and State  environmental approvals
required for the operation of its generating units.  The Company believes it
is presently in substantial compliance with all air quality regulations
(including those pertaining to particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides (NOx)) promulgated by the State of Kansas and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

    The Federal sulfur dioxide  standards  applicable to the Company's JEC and
La Cygne 2 units, prohibit the emission of more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur
dioxide per million Btu of heat input.  Federal particulate matter emission
standards applicable to these units prohibit:  (1) the emission of more than
0.1 pounds of particulate matter per million Btu of heat input and (2) an
opacity greater than 20%.  Federal NOx emission standards applicable to these
units prohibit the emission of more than 0.7 pounds of NOx per million Btu of
heat input.

    The JEC and La Cygne 2 units have met:  (1) the sulfur dioxide standards
through the use of low sulfur coal (See Coal); (2) the particulate matter
standards through the use of electrostatic precipitators; and (3) the NOx
standards through boiler design and operating procedures.  The JEC units are
also equipped with flue gas scrubbers providing additional sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter emission reduction capability.

    The Kansas Department of Health and Environment regulations, applicable to
the Company's other generating facilities, prohibit the emission of more than
3.0 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million Btu of heat input at the Company's
generating units.  The Company has sufficient low sulfur coal under contract
(See Coal) to allow compliance with such limits at La Cygne 1.  All facilities
burning coal are equipped with flue gas scrubbers and/or electrostatic 
<PAGE 9>
precipitators.

    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a two-phase
reduction in sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions with Phase I effective in 1995
and Phase II effective in 2000 and a probable reduction in toxic emissions by
a future date not yet determined.  To meet the monitoring and reporting
requirements under the Act's acid rain program, the Company installed
continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately
$2.3 million.  The Company does not expect additional equipment to reduce
sulfur emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although the Company
currently has no Phase I affected units, the Company has applied for and has
been accepted for an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne
Generating Station under the Phase I regulations.  

    The NOx and toxic limits, which were not set in the law, were proposed by
the EPA in January 1996.  The Company is currently evaluating the steps it
will need to take in order to comply with the proposed new rules, but is
unable to determine its compliance options or related compliance costs until
the evaluation is finished later this year.  The Company will have three years
to comply with the new rules.

    All of the Company's generating facilities are in substantial compliance
with the Best Practicable Technology and Best Available Technology regulations
issued by EPA pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1977.  Most EPA regulations
are administered in Kansas by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

    Additional information with respect to Environmental Matters is discussed
in Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements.


FINANCING

    The Company's ability to issue additional debt is restricted under
limitations imposed by the Mortgage and Deed of Trust of the Company.

    The Company's mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from
being issued (except in connection with certain refundings) unless the
Company's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement
and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15
months preceding the issuance are not less than two and one-half times the
annual interest charges on, or 10% of the principal amount of, all first
mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. 
Based on the Company's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1995,
approximately $937 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds
could be issued (7.25% interest rate assumed).

    KGE bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the preceding
paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an unfunded prior
lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of December 31,
1995, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of net bondable property
additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling the Company to issue
up to $922 million principal amount of additional bonds.  As of December 31,
1995, $1 million in additional bonds could be issued on the basis of retired
bonds.


<PAGE 10>

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FINANCIAL CONDITION

    GENERAL:  The Company had net income of $110.9 million for 1995 compared
to net income of $104.5 million in 1994.  The increase in net income is
primarily due to increased retail sales and the receipt of death benefit
proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies in the fourth quarter of
1995.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:  The Company's liquidity is a function of
its ongoing construction and maintenance program designed to improve
facilities which provide electric service and meet future customer service
requirements.

    During 1995, construction expenditures for the Company's electric system
were approximately $65 million and nuclear fuel expenditures were
approximately $28 million.  It is projected that adequate capacity margins
will be maintained through the turn of the century.  The construction program
is focused on providing service to new customers and improving present
electric facilities.

    Capital expenditures for 1996 through 1998 are anticipated to be as
follows:

                                    Electric       Nuclear Fuel  
                                     (Dollars in Thousands)
            1996. . . . . . . . . .  $51,800         $ 3,300
            1997. . . . . . . . . .   51,900          22,300 
            1998. . . . . . . . . .   49,200          20,800 

    These expenditures are estimates prepared for planning purposes and are
subject to revisions.

    The Company's net cash flows to capital expenditures exceeded 100% for
1995 and during the last five years has also averaged in excess of 100%.  This
ratio  indicates the extent to which the Company is able to fund its capital
expenditures with cash flow from operating activities.  This ratio is
calculated from the Company's Statements of Cash Flows as net cash flow from
operating activities, less changes in working capital, less dividends on
common stock, divided by additions to utility plant.  The Company anticipates
all of its cash requirements for capital expenditures through 1998 will be
provided from net cash flows.  The Company also has $16 million of bonds
maturing through 2000, all in 1996, which will be provided from internal and
external sources available under then existing financial conditions.

    The embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.3% at December 31, 1995 and 
December 31, 1994.

    In 1986, the Company purchased corporate-owned life insurance policies
(COLI) on certain of its employees.  The annual cash outflow for the premiums
on these policies was approximately $30 million for 1995 and $27 million for
1994 and 1993.  In June, 1995, the Company increased its borrowings against
the accumulated cash surrender values of the policies by $45 million.  Total
1995 COLI borrowings amounted to $353 million.  See Note 1 of the Notes to
Financial Statements for additional information on the accumulated cash
<PAGE 14>
surrender value.  The borrowings are expected to produce annual cash inflows,
net of expenses, through the remaining life of the policies.  Borrowings
against the policies will be repaid from death proceeds (See Note 1).

    The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied, as needed,
through short-term bank loans and borrowings under other lines of credit
maintained with banks.  Short-term borrowings amounted to $50 million at
December 31, 1995 and December 31. 1994. 

    The Company's capital structure at December 31, 1995, was 63% common stock
equity and 37% long-term debt. The capital structure at December 31, 1995,
including short-term debt was 61% common stock equity and 39% debt.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    
    The following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year
results in revenues, operating expenses, other income and deductions, and
interest charges.  Additional information relating to changes between years is
provided in the Notes to Financial Statements.

    REVENUES  

    The operating revenues of the Company are based on sales volumes and rates
authorized by the KCC and the FERC.  Rates charged for the sale and delivery
of electricity are designed to recover the cost of service and allow investors
a fair rate of return.  Future electric sales will be affected by weather
conditions, competition from other sources of energy, competing fuel sources,
customer conservation efforts and the overall economy of the Company's service
area.

    In March 1992, in connection with the acquisition of the Company by
Western Resources, the KCC approved the elimination of the Energy Cost
Adjustment Clause (ECA) for most retail customers of the Company effective
April 1, 1992.  The fuel costs are now included in base rates and were
established at a level intended by the KCC to equal the projected average cost
of fuel through August  1995.  Therefore, if the Company wished to recover an
increase in fuel costs above the projected average cost it would have to file
a request for recovery in a rate filing with the KCC which request could be
denied in whole or in part.  The Company's fuel costs represented 22% and 24%
of its total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively.  Any increase in fuel costs from the projected average
which the Company did not recover through rates would impact the Company's
earnings.  The degree of any such impact would be affected by a variety of
factors, however, and thus cannot now be predicted. 
    
    1995 Compared to 1994: Total operating revenues for 1995 of $623.9 million
increased less than one percent from revenues of $619.9 million for 1994 as a
result of increased sales in all retail customer classes.  The increase is
primarily attributable to a higher demand for air conditioning load during the
third quarter of 1995 compared to 1994.  The Company's service territory
experienced a 14% increase in the number of cooling degree days during that
quarter, as compared to the third quarter of 1994.  The Company has filed an
electric rate reduction request with the KCC (See Note 3). 
<PAGE 15>

    1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating revenues for 1994 of $619.9
million increased less than one percent from revenues of $617.0 million for
1993.  The increase can be attributed to higher revenues in all retail
customer classes.  While residential sales remained virtually unchanged,
commercial and industrial sales increased over two percent during 1994. 
Partially offsetting these increases was a 21% decrease in wholesale and
interchange sales as a result of higher than normal sales in 1993 to other
utilities while their generating units were down due to the flooding of 1993.

    OPERATING EXPENSES

    1995 Compared to 1994: Total operating expenses for 1995 were $474.9
million compared to $470.9 million for 1994, an increase of less than one
percent.  The increase is a result of increased depreciation and amortization
expense as a result of the amortization of the acquisition premium
attributable to the Merger which began in August 1995 as discussed in Merger
Implementation below.

    The Company has filed a request with the KCC to increase the annual
depreciation expense for Wolf Creek Generating Station  (See Note 3).  The
Company anticipates its operating expenses (including fuel expenses) will
increase in 1996 as a result of Wolf Creek being taken out of service for
refueling and maintenance as discussed under "Fuel Mix" above.  
 
    1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating expenses for 1994 of $470.9
million increased slightly from total operating expenses of $469.6 million for
1993.  Federal and state income taxes increased $13.5 million and maintenance
expense increased three percent primarily as a result of the major boiler
overhaul of the Company's coal fired La Cygne 1 generating station.

    The increase in income tax expense was due to the completion at December
31, 1993, of the accelerated amortization of deferred income tax reserves
related to the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction
capitalized for Wolf Creek.  The completion of the amortization of these
deferred income tax reserves increased income tax expense and thereby reduced
net income by approximately $12 million in 1994, and in the future will reduce
net income by this same amount each year.

    Partially offsetting the increases in total operating expenses were lower
fuel costs, due to decreased electric generation during 1994, and lower other
operations expense.

    OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS:    Other income and deductions, net of taxes,
increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994 as a
result of the additional interest expense on increased corporate-owned life
insurance (COLI) borrowings.  Partially offsetting this increase was the
recognition of income from death benefit proceeds under COLI contracts during
the fourth quarter of 1995  (See Notes 1 and 7 for discussion of current
legislation affecting COLI).

    Other income and deductions, net of taxes, decreased significantly in 1994
compared to 1993 primarily as a result of increased interest expense on higher
COLI borrowings.  Interest on COLI borrowings increased $9.1 million in 1994
compared to 1993.  Also contributing to the decrease was the receipt of death
benefit proceeds from COLI policies in the third quarter of 1993.
<PAGE 16>
    INTEREST CHARGES:  The Company's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.3%
at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 compared to 7.7% at December 31,
1993.

    Interest charges decreased 12% in 1994 compared to 1993 primarily as a
result of the refinancing of higher cost fixed-rate debt.  Also accounting for
the decrease was the impact of increased COLI borrowings which reduce the need
for other long-term debt and thereby reduced interest expense.  COLI interest
is reflected in Other Income and Deductions on the Income Statement.  

    MERGER IMPLEMENTATION:  In accordance with the KCC Merger order,
amortization of the acquisition adjustment commenced in August 1995.  The
amortization will amount to approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per year for
40 years.  Western Resources and the Company (combined companies) can recover
the amortization of the acquisition adjustment through cost savings under a
sharing mechanism approved by the KCC.

    Based on the order issued by the KCC, with regard to the recovery of the
acquisition premium, the combined companies must achieve a level of savings on
an annual basis (considering sharing provisions) of approximately $27 million
in order to recover the entire acquisition premium.  To the extent that the
combined companies actual operations and maintenance expense is lower than the
KCC-stipulated utility price index, the combined companies will realize merger
savings.  Western Resources has calculated, in conformance with the KCC order, 
annual savings associated with the acquisition to be in excess of $27 million
for 1995.  As Western Resources' management presently expects to continue this
level of savings, the amount is expected to be sufficient to allow for the
full recovery of the acquisition premium.

    
OTHER INFORMATION

    INFLATION:  Under the ratemaking procedures prescribed by the regulatory
commissions to which the Company is subject, only the original cost of plant
is recoverable in rates charged to customers.  Therefore, because of
inflation, present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for
purposes of maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareholders
and the related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property.  The impact
of this ratemaking process on common shareholders is mitigated to the extent
depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of
less purchasing power.  While the Company has experienced relatively low
inflation in the recent past, the cumulative effect of inflation on operating
costs may require the Company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these
higher costs.

    ENVIRONMENTAL:  The Company has taken a proactive position with respect to
the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas
sites and has an agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment to systematically evaluate these sites (See Note 3).

    Although the Company currently has no Phase I affected units under the
Clean Air Act of 1990, the Company has applied for and has been accepted for
an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Generating Station
under the Phase I guidelines.  The NOx and toxic limits, which were not set in
the law, were proposed by the EPA in January 1996.  The Company is currently
<PAGE 17>
evaluating the steps it will need to take in order to comply with the proposed
new rules, but is unable to determine its compliance options or related
compliance costs until the evaluation is finished later this year.  The
Company will have three years to comply with the new rules. (See Note 3).

    COMPETITION:  As a regulated utility, the Company currently has limited
direct competition for retail electric service in its certified service area. 
However, there is competition, based largely on price, from the generation, or
potential generation, of electricity by large commercial and industrial
customers, and independent power producers.

    The 1992 Energy Policy Act (Act) requires increased efficiency of energy
usage and has effected the way electricity is marketed.  The Act also provides
for increased competition in the wholesale electric market by permitting the
FERC to order third party access to utilities' transmission systems and by
liberalizing the rules for ownership of generating facilities.  As part of the
Merger, the Company agreed to open access of its transmission system for
wholesale transactions.  During 1995, wholesale revenues represented less than
five percent of the Company's total revenues.

    Operating in this competitive environment could place pressure on utility
profit margins and credit quality.  Wholesale and industrial customers may
threaten to pursue cogeneration, self-generation, retail wheeling,
municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to
obtain reduced energy costs.  Increasing competition has resulted in credit
rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit
rating determinations (See Note 1 for the effects of competition on Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71).

    The Company is providing competitive electric rates for industrial
expansion projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain
and increase electric load.  During 1996, the Company will lose a major
industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in a reduction to pre-tax
earnings of approximately $7 to $8 million annually.  This customer's decision
to develop its own cogeneration project was based largely on factors other
than energy cost.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors of
Kansas Gas and Electric Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of
capitalization of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Western Resources, Inc.) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of income, cash flows, taxes, and common stock equity for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Kansas Gas and Electric
Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 7 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 1993,
the Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits and
effective January 1, 1994, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postemployment benefits.

                 KANSAS GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY
                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    General: Kansas Gas and Electric Company (the Company, KGE) is a
rate-regulated electric utility and wholly-owned subsidiary of Western
Resources, Inc. (Western Resources).  The Company is engaged principally in
the production, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity. 
The Company serves approximately 275,000 electric customers in southeastern
Kansas. 
    
     The Company owns 47% of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation
(WCNOC), the operating company for Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek). 
The Company records its proportionate share of all transactions of WCNOC as it
does other jointly-owned facilities.

    The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated public
utilities.  The accounting and rates of the Company are subject to
requirements of the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).  The financial statements require management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet date, and to report amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

    The Company follows the accounting for regulated enterprises prescribed
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulations" (SFAS 71).  This pronouncement
requires deferral of certain costs and obligations based upon approvals
received from regulators to permit recovery or require refund of these costs
and revenues in future periods.  Consequently, the recorded net book value of
certain assets and liabilities may be different than that which would
otherwise be recorded by unregulated enterprises.  On a continuing basis, the
Company reviews the continued applicability of SFAS 71 based on the current
regulatory and competitive environment.  Although recent developments suggest
the electric generation industry may become more competitive, the degree to
which regulatory oversight of the Company will be lifted and competition will
be permitted is uncertain.  Currently, there are no proceedings or actions at
the KCC to open the Company's electric markets to greater competition.  As a
result, the Company continues to believe that accounting under SFAS 71 is
appropriate.  If the Company were to determine that the use of SFAS 71 were no
longer appropriate, it would be required to write-off the deferred costs and
obligations that represent regulatory assets and liabilities referred to
above.  It may also be necessary for the Company to reduce the carrying value
of a portion of its plant and equipment to the extent that it is expected to
become impaired.  At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of
the Company's plant and equipment, if any, that would be considered
unrecoverable in such circumstances, as the effect of any future competition
on the Company's rates is not clear at this time.                     
<PAGE 27>

    Utility Plant:  Utility plant (including plant acquisition adjustment) is
stated at cost.  For constructed plant, cost includes contracted services,
direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering, supervision,
general and administrative costs, and an allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC).  The AFUDC rate was 6.39% for 1995, 4.07% for 1994, and
4.41% for 1993.  The cost of additions to utility plant and replacement units
of property is capitalized.  Maintenance costs and replacement of minor items
of property are charged to expense as incurred.  When units of depreciable
property are retired, they are removed from the plant accounts and the
original cost plus removal charges less salvage are charged to accumulated
depreciation.

    In accordance with regulatory decisions made by the KCC, amortization of
the acquisition premium of approximately $801 million resulting from the KGE
purchase began in August of 1995.  The premium is being amortized over 40
years and has been classified as electric plant in service.  Accumulated
amortization through December 31, 1995 totaled $6.7 million.

    In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"
(SFAS 121).  This Statement imposes stricter criteria for regulatory assets by
requiring that such assets be probable of future recovery at each balance
sheet date.  The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 1996 and does
not expect that adoption will have a material impact on the financial position
or results of operations based on the Company's current regulatory structure. 
This conclusion may change in the future if increases in competition influence
regulation and wholesale and retail pricing in the electric industry.

    Depreciation:  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based
on estimated useful lives of property.  Composite provisions for book
depreciation approximated 2.72% during 1995, 2.7% during 1994, and 2.9% during
1993 of the average original cost of depreciable property.  The methods and
rates of depreciation used by the Company have not varied materially from the
methods and rates which would have been used if the Company were not regulated
and not subject to the provisions prescribed by SFAS 71.  In the past, the
methods and rates have been determined by depreciation studies and approved by
the various regulatory bodies.  The Company periodically evaluates its
depreciation rates considering the past and expected future experience in the
operation of its facilities.  The Company has proposed to more rapidly recover
the Company's investment in nuclear generating assets of Wolf Creek to reduce
the capital costs to a level more closely paralleling that of non-nuclear
generating facilities  
(For information regarding such proposal, See Note 3). 

    Cash and Cash Equivalents:  For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows,
the Company considers highly liquid collateralized debt instruments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

    Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).  Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences in amounts
recorded for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases (See
Note 8).

<PAGE 28>
    Investment tax credits previously deferred are being amortized to income
over the life of the property which gave rise to the credits.

    Revenues:  Operating revenues include amounts actually billed for
services rendered and an accrual of estimated unbilled revenues.  Unbilled
revenues represent the estimated amount customers will be billed for service
provided from the time meters were last read to the end of the accounting
period.  Unbilled revenues of $21.8 million and $21.4 million are recorded as
a component of accounts receivable and unbilled revenue (net) on the balance
sheets as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

    The Company's recorded reserves for doubtful accounts receivable totaled
$3.3 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

    Debt Issuance and Reacquisition Expense:  Debt premium, discount and
issuance expenses are amortized over the life of each issue.  Under regulatory
procedures, debt reacquisition expenses are amortized over the remaining life
of the reacquired debt or, if refinanced, the life of the new debt.

    Fuel Costs:  The cost of nuclear fuel in process of refinement,
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication is recorded as an asset at original
cost and is amortized to expense based upon the quantity of heat produced for
the generation of electricity.  The accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel
in the reactor at December 31, 1995 and 1994, was $28.5 and $13.6 million,
respectively.

    Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Contracts:  The following amounts

     Income is recorded for increases in cash surrender value and net death
proceeds.  Interest expense is recognized for COLI borrowings.  The net income
generated from COLI contracts, including the tax benefit of the interest
deductions and premium expenses, are recorded as Corporate-owned Life
Insurance (net) on the Statements of Income.  The income from increases in
cash surrender value and net death proceeds was $22.7 million for 1995, $15.6
million for 1994, and $19.7 million for 1993. The interest expense  deduction
taken was $25.4 million for 1995, $21.0 million for 1994, and $11.9 million
for 1993. 

    Federal legislation is pending, which, if enacted, may substantially
reduce or eliminate the tax deduction for interest on COLI borrowings, and
thus reduce a significant portion of the net income stream generated by the
COLI contracts (see Note 7).

2.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    Manufactured Gas Sites:  The Company has been associated with three
former manufactured gas sites which may contain coal tar and other potentially
harmful materials.  The Company and the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment (KDHE) entered into a consent agreement governing all future work
at the three sites.  The terms of the consent agreement will allow the Company
to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the
results of the investigations and risk analysis.  The prioritized sites will
be investigated over a 10 year period.  The agreement will allow the Company
to set mutual objectives with the KDHE in order to expedite effective response
activities and to control costs and environmental impact.  The costs incurred
for site investigation and risk assessment in 1995 and 1994 were minimal.  The
Company is aware of other Midwestern utilities which have incurred remediation
costs ranging between $500,000 and $10 million per site.  The KCC has
permitted another Kansas utility to recover its remediation costs through
rates.  To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered through
rates, the costs could be material to the Company's financial position or
results of operations depending on the degree of remediation and number of
years over which the remediation must be completed.

    Decommissioning:  The Company accrues decommissioning costs over the
expected life of the Wolf Creek generating facility.  The accrual is based on
estimated unrecovered decommissioning costs which consider inflation over the
remaining estimated life of the generating facility and are net of expected
earnings on amounts recovered from customers and deposited in an external
trust fund.
  
    On June 9, 1994, the KCC issued an order approving the estimated 
decommissioning costs as determined by a 1993 Wolf Creek Decommissioning Cost
Study to be recovered in rates. The cost study estimated the Company's share
of decommissioning costs to be $595 million or approximately $174 million in
1993 dollars.  The decommissioning costs are currently expected to be incurred
during the period 2025 through 2033.  These costs were calculated using an
assumed inflation rate of 3.45% and an average after tax expected return on
trust fund assets of 5.9%. Decommissioning costs are being charged to
operating expenses in accordance with the KCC order.  Amounts expensed
approximated $3.6 million in 1995 and will increase annually to $5.5 million
in 2024.

    The Company's investment in the decommissioning fund, including
reinvested earnings approximated $25.0 million and $16.9 million at December
31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.  Trust fund earnings accumulate
in the fund balance and increase the recorded decommissioning liability. 
These amounts are reflected in Decommissioning Trust, and the related
liability is included in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities, Other, on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    The staff of the SEC has questioned certain current accounting practices
used by nuclear electric generating station owners regarding the recognition,
measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear electric
generating stations. In response to these questions, the FASB is expected to
issue new accounting standards for removal costs, including decommissioning in
1996.  If current electric utility industry accounting practices for such
decommissioning costs are changed: (1) annual decommissioning expenses could
increase, (2) the estimated present value of decommissioning costs could be
<PAGE 30>
recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation, and (3) trust
fund income from the external decommissioning trusts could be reported as
investment income rather than as a reduction to decommissioning expense.  
When revised accounting guidance is issued, the Company will also have to
evaluate its effect on accounting for removal costs of other long-lived
assets.  At this time, the Company is not able to predict what effect such
changes would have on results of operations, financial position, or related
regulatory practices until the final issuance of revised accounting guidance.

    The Company carries premature decommissioning insurance which has several
restrictions.  One of these is that it can only be used if Wolf Creek incurs
an accident exceeding $500 million in expenses to safely stabilize the
reactor, to decontaminate the reactor and reactor station site in accordance
with a plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to pay
for on-site property damages.  This decommissioning insurance will only be
available if the insurance funds are not needed to implement the NRC-approved
plan for stabilization and decontamination.

    Nuclear Insurance:  The Price-Anderson Act limits the combined public
liability of the owners of nuclear power plants to $8.9 billion for a single
nuclear incident.  If this liability limitation is insufficient, the U.S.
Congress will consider taking whatever action is necessary to compensate the
public for valid claims.  The Wolf Creek owners (Owners) have purchased the
maximum available private insurance of $200 million and the balance is
provided by an assessment plan mandated by the NRC.  Under this plan, the
Owners are jointly and severally subject to a retrospective assessment of up
to $79.3 million ($37.3 million, Company's share) in the event there is a
major nuclear incident involving any of the nation's licensed reactors.  This
assessment is subject to an inflation adjustment based on the Consumer Price
Index and applicable premium taxes.  There is a limitation of $10 million
($4.7 million, Company's share) in retrospective assessments per incident, per
year.

    The Owners carry decontamination liability, premature decommissioning
liability, and property damage insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately
$2.8 billion ($1.3 billion, Company's share).  This insurance is provided by a
combination of "nuclear insurance pools" ($500 million) and Nuclear Electric
Insurance Limited (NEIL) ($2.3 billion).  In the event of an accident,
insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site
decontamination.  The Company's share of any remaining proceeds can be used
for property damage or premature decommissioning costs up to $1.3 billion
(Company's share).  Premature decommissioning insurance cost recovery is
excess of funds previously collected for decommissioning (as discussed under
"Decommissioning").

    The Owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to cover costs of
replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage
resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If losses incurred
at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL policies exceed premiums,
reserves, and other NEIL resources, the Company may be subject to
retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $11
million per year.

    Although the Company maintains various insurance policies to provide
coverage for  potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or
an extended outage, the Company's insurance coverage may not be adequate to
cover the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended
outage at Wolf Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the
extent not recoverable through rates, would have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
<PAGE 31>
    Clean Air Act:  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a
two-phase reduction in certain emissions.  To meet the monitoring and
reporting requirements under the acid rain program, the Company installed
continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately
$2.3 million from 1993 through 1995.  The Company does not expect additional
equipment acquisitions or other material expenditures to be needed to meet
Phase II sulfur dioxide requirements.

    Fuel Commitments:  To supply a portion of the fuel requirements for its
generating plants, the Company has entered into various commitments to obtain
nuclear fuel and coal. Some of these contracts contain provisions for price
escalation and minimum purchase commitments.  At December 31, 1995, WCNOC's
nuclear fuel commitments (Company's share) were approximately $15.3 million
for uranium concentrates expiring at various times through 2001, $120.8
million for enrichment expiring at various times through 2014, and $72.7
million for fabrication through 2025.  At December 31, 1995, the Company's
coal contract commitments in 1995 dollars under the remaining terms of the
contracts were approximately $643 million.  The largest coal contract expires
in 2020, with the remaining coal contracts expiring at various times through
2013. 
    
    Energy Act:  As part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, a special assessment
is being collected from utilities for a uranium enrichment decontamination and
decommissioning fund.  The Company's portion of the assessment for Wolf Creek
is approximately $7 million, payable over 15 years.  Management expects such
costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process.


3.  RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION

    KCC Rate Proceedings:  On August 17, 1995, the Company filed with the KCC
a request to more rapidly recover its investment in its assets of Wolf Creek
over the next seven years.  If the request is granted, depreciation expense
for Wolf Creek will increase by approximately $50 million for each of the next
seven years.  As a result of this proposal, the Company will also seek to
reduce electric rates for its customers by approximately $9 million annually
for the same seven year period.
                   
    The request also reduces the annual depreciation by approximately $3
million for electric transmission, distribution and certain generating plant
assets to reflect the effect of increasing useful lives of these properties. 
Hearings before the KCC on the depreciation changes and voluntary rate
reductions are expected to occur in May 1996.

    Rate Stabilization Plan:  In 1988, the KCC ordered the accrual of
phase-in revenues to be discontinued effective December 31, 1988.  The Company
began amortizing the phase-in revenue asset on a straight-line basis over
9-1/2 years beginning January 1, 1989.  At December 31, 1995, approximately
$44 million of deferred phase-in revenues remain to be recovered.

    Coal Contract Settlements:  In March 1990, the KCC issued an order
allowing the Company to defer its share of a 1989 coal contract settlement
with the Pittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Company amounting to $22.5 million. 
This amount was recorded as a deferred charge and is included in Deferred
<PAGE 32>
Charges and Other Assets on the balance sheet.  The settlement resulted in the
termination of a long-term coal contract.  The KCC permitted the Company to
recover this settlement as follows:  76% of the settlement plus a return over
the remaining term of the terminated contract (through 2002) and 24% to be
amortized to expense with a deferred return equivalent to the carrying cost of
the asset.  Approximately $15 million of this deferral remains on the balance
sheet at December 31, 1995.

    In February 1991, the Company paid $8.5 million to settle a coal contract
lawsuit with AMAX Coal Company and recorded the payment as a deferred charge
in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the balance sheet.  The KCC approved
the recovery of the settlement plus a return equivalent to the carrying cost
of the asset, over the remaining term of the terminated contract (through
1996).


4.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

    The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied through
short-term bank loans and uncommitted loan participation agreements.  Maximum
short-term borrowings outstanding during 1995 and 1994 were $75.8 million on
January 17, 1995 and $172.3 million on January 4, 1994.  The weighted average
interest rates, including fees, were 6.1% for 1995, 4.5% for 1994, and 3.5%
for 1993.

  
5.  LONG-TERM DEBT

    The amount of KGE's first mortgage bonds authorized by the KGE Mortgage
and Deed of Trust (Mortgage) dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented, is limited
to a maximum of $2 billion.  Amounts of additional bonds which may be issued
are subject to property, earnings, and certain restrictive provisions of the
Mortgage.  Electric plant is subject to the lien of the Mortgage except for
transportation equipment.  
    Debt discount and expenses are being amortized over the remaining lives
of each issue.  The improvement and maintenance fund requirements for certain
first mortgage bond series can be met by bonding additional property. With the
retirement of certain Company pollution control series bonds, there are no
longer any bond sinking fund requirements.  During 1996, $16 million of bonds
will mature.


6.  SALE-LEASEBACK OF LA CYGNE 2

    In 1987, the Company sold and leased back its 50% undivided interest in
the La Cygne 2 generating unit.  The La Cygne 2 lease has an initial term of
29 years, with various options to renew the lease or repurchase the 50%
undivided interest.  The Company remains responsible for its share of
operation and maintenance costs and other related operating costs of La Cygne
2.  The lease is an operating lease for financial reporting purposes.

    As permitted under the La Cygne 2 lease agreement, the Company in 1992
requested the Trustee Lessor to refinance $341.1 million of secured facility
bonds of the Trustee and owner of La Cygne 2.  The transaction was requested
to reduce recurring future net lease expense.  In connection with the
<PAGE 33>
refinancing on September 29, 1992, a one-time payment of approximately $27
million was made by the Company which has been deferred and is being amortized
over the remaining life of the lease and included in operating expense as part
of the future lease expense.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $23.7
million of this deferral remained on the balance sheet.

    Future minimum annual lease payments required under the La Cygne 2 lease
agreement are approximately $34.6 million for each year through 2000 and $646
million over the remainder of the lease.

    The gain of approximately $322 million realized at the date of the sale
of La Cygne 2 has been deferred for financial reporting purposes, and is being
amortized ($9.6 million per year) over the initial lease term in proportion to
the related lease expense.  The Company's lease expense, net of amortization
of the deferred gain and a one-time payment, was approximately $22.5 million
for 1995, 1994, and 1993.

    
7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
                   
    Pension: In 1995, the Company's qualified noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan was merged into Western Resources, Inc. Retirement Plan (the
Plan).  The Plan covers substantially all employees of the Company.  Pension
benefits under the Plan are based on years of service and the employee's
compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years out of ten before
retirement.  Western Resources' policy is to fund pension costs accrued,
subject to limitations set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 and the Internal Revenue Code.  Pension expense of $1.6 million was
allocated to the Company by Western Resources in 1995.  Also, substantially
all Wolf Creek employees are covered under a plan similar to the Plan.

    The following table provides information on the components of pension
cost  under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 "Employers'
Accounting for Pension Plans" (SFAS 87), funded status and actuarial

(1) 1995 includes only the Company's 47% share of the Wolf Creek Plan.
(2) Graded based on age: 6.5% at age 20 graded to 4.5% at age 60.

    Postretirement:  Western Resources and the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) in the first
quarter of 1993.  This statement requires the accrual of postretirement
benefits other than pensions, primarily medical benefits costs, during the
years an employee provides service.
  
    The Company's total obligation is recorded by Western Resources, and the
related postretirement benefits expenses are allocated to the Company.  The
total postretirement benefits expenses allocated to the Company by Western
Resources under SFAS 106 were approximately $3.7 million in 1995 and $3.8
million in 1994.

    The KCC issued an order permitting Western Resources to defer the initial
SFAS 106 expense.  To mitigate the impact incremental SFAS 106 expense will
have on rate increases, Western Resources will include in future computations
of cost of service the actual postretirement benefits expenses and an income
stream generated from COLI contracts purchased in 1993 and 1992.  To the
extent postretirement benefits expenses exceed income from the COLI program,
this excess is being deferred (in accordance with the provisions of the FASB
Emerging Issues
<PAGE 35>
Task Force Issue No. 92-12) and will be offset by income generated through the
deferral period by the COLI program.  Because these expenses were deferred by
Western Resources, the Company's results of continuing operations are not
affected.

    At December 31, 1995, approximately $7.0 million related to the Company's
portion of postretirement expenses had been deferred by Western Resources
pursuant to the KCC order.  Pending federal legislation may substantially
reduce or eliminate tax benefits associated with COLI contracts.  If this
legislation is enacted or should the income stream generated by the COLI
program not be sufficient to offset postretirement benefit costs on an accrual
basis, the KCC order allows Western Resources and the Company to seek recovery
of a deficiency through the ratemaking process.  Regulatory precedents
established by the KCC generally permit the accrual costs of postretirement
benefits to be recovered in rates.

    The Company also records, based on actuarial projections, the
postretirement benefit expenses related to its 47% ownership in Wolf Creek,
which approximated $0.3 million and $0.4 million for 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

    The following table summarizes the status of the Company's postretirement
plan for financial statement purposes and the related amounts included in the
balance sheet:

    For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost growth rate of 10.5%
was assumed for 1995, decreasing to six percent in 1997.  The health care cost
trend rate has a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. 
Increasing the trend rate by one percent each year would increase the present
value of the accumulated projected benefit obligation by $1.4 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components by $0.2 million.

    Postemployment:  Western Resources and the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 112) in the first quarter of 1994.  This
<PAGE 36>
statement requires the recognition of the liability to provide postemployment
benefits when the liability has been incurred.  Due to the immaterial amounts
and the rate treatment from the Company's regulators, there was no material
impact upon the Company's continuing operations.

    The Company's total obligation is recorded by Western Resources, and the
related postemployment benefits expenses are allocated to the Company.   The
total postemployment benefits expenses allocated to the Company by Western
Resources under SFAS 112 were approximately $0.9 million in 1995 and $0.8
million in 1994, respectively.
    
    The KCC issued an order permitting Western Resources to defer the initial
SFAS 112 expense.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $1.9 million related to
the Company's portion of postemployment expenses had been deferred pursuant to
the KCC order. 
    
    Savings:  Effective January 1, 1995, the Company's 401(k) savings plan
was merged with Western Resources savings plan.  Western Resources maintains a
savings plan in which substantially all employees participate.  Prior to the
merger of the savings plans, funds of the plans were deposited with a trustee
and invested at each employee's option in one or more investment funds,
including a Western Resources common stock fund.  The Company's contributions
were $1.8 million for 1994 and $2.0 million for 1993.  In 1995, 401(k)
contribution expense allocated to the Company was $1.7 million.


8.  INCOME TAXES

    Under SFAS 109, temporary differences gave rise to deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, as
follows:  
Deferred Tax Assets:                                1995             1994
                                                    (Dollars in Thousands)

    Income Taxes, Net                           $  800,934       $  784,043

    In accordance with various rate orders received from the KCC, the Company
has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a significant
portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities.  As management believes it
is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable will be
recovered from customers, it has recorded a deferred asset for these amounts. 
These assets are also a temporary difference for which deferred income tax
liabilities have been provided. 
<PAGE 37>
    At December 31, 1995, the Company has alternative minimum tax credits
generated prior to April 1, 1992, which carry forward without expiration, of
$18.7 million which may be used to offset future regular tax to the extent the
regular tax exceeds the alternative minimum tax.  These credits have been
applied in determining the Company's net deferred income tax liability and
corresponding deferred future income taxes at December 31, 1995.

    
9.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company is involved in various legal and environmental proceedings. 
Management believes that adequate provision has been made within the financial
statements for these matters and accordingly believes their ultimate
dispositions will not have a material adverse effect upon the financial
position or results of operations of the Company.


10.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107 "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments":

    Cash and Cash Equivalents-
         The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the
      short-term maturity of these investments.
    Decommissioning Trust-
         The carrying amount is recorded at the fair value of the
         decommissioning trust and is based on quoted market prices at December
         31, 1995 and 1994.
    Variable-rate Debt-
         The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the
      short-term variable rates of these debt instruments.
    Fixed-rate Debt-
         The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is based on the sum of the
         estimated value of each issue taking into consideration the interest
         rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

                                   Carrying Value              Fair Value     
    December 31,                   1995       1994          1995       1994   
                                            (Dollars in Thousands)

   Amounts and capacity represent the Company's share.  The Company's share
of operating expenses of the plants in service above, as well as such expenses
for a 50% undivided interest in La Cygne 2 (representing 335 MW capacity) sold
and leased back to the Company in 1987, are included in operating expenses on
the Statements of Income.  The Company's share of other transactions
associated with the plants is included in the appropriate classification in
the Company's financial statements.


12.  QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATISTICS (Unaudited)
                           
   The amounts in the table are unaudited but, in the opinion of management,
contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods.  The
business of the Company is seasonal in nature and, in the opinion of
management, comparisons between the quarters of a year do not give a true
indication of overall trends and changes in operations.

13.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

   The cash management function, including cash receipts and disbursements,
for KGE is performed by Western Resources.  An intercompany account is used to
record net receipts and dusbursements handled by Western Resources.  The net
amount advanced by KGE to Western Resources approximated $35 million and $64
million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  These amounts are
recorded as advances to parent company in Current Assets on the balance sheet. 

   Certain operating expenses have been allocated to the Company from
Western Resources.  These expenses are allocated, depending on the nature of
the expense, based on allocation studies, net investment, number of customers,
and/or other appropriate allocators.  Management believes such allocation
procedures are reasonable.  During 1995, the Company declared a dividend to
Western Resources of $150 million.
