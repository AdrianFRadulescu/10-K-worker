ITEM 1.  BUSINESS


GENERAL

     Western Resources, Inc. is a combination electric and natural gas public
utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of
electric energy in Kansas and the purchase, transmission, distribution,
transportation and sale of natural gas in Kansas and Oklahoma.  As used herein,
the terms "Company and Western Resources" include its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Astra Resources, Inc. (Astra Resources), Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KG&E)
since March 31, 1992, KPL Funding Corporation (KFC), and Mid Continent Market
Center, Inc. (Market Center).  KG&E owns 47 percent of Wolf Creek Nuclear
Operating Corporation, the operating company for Wolf Creek Generating Station
(Wolf Creek).  Corporate headquarters of the Company is located at 818 Kansas
Avenue, Topeka, Kansas 66612.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had 4,330
employees.

     The Company conducts its non-regulated business through Astra Resources. 
Astra Resources' non-regulated businesses include natural gas compression,
marketing, processing and gathering services, and investments in energy and
technology related businesses.

    To capitalize on opportunities in the non-regulated natural gas industry,
the Company, through the Market Center, is establishing a natural gas market
center in Kansas.  The Market Center will provide natural gas transportation,
storage, and gathering services, as well as balancing, and title transfer
capability. Upon approval from the
Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), the Company intends
to transfer certain natural gas transmission assets having a value of
approximately $52.1 million to the Market Center.  In addition, the Company
intends to extend credit to the Market Center enabling the Market Center to
borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million on a term basis to
construct new facilities and $5 million on a revolving credit basis for working
capital.  The Market Center will provide no notice natural gas transportation
and storage services to the Company under a long-term contract.
The Company will continue to operate and maintain the Market Center's
assets under a separate contract.        

     On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to United
Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The properties sold to
Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as the "Missouri
Properties."  With the sales the Company is no longer operating as a utility in
the State of Missouri.

     The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was sold
for an estimated sale price of $400 million, in cash, based on a calculation as
of December 31, 1993.  United Cities purchased the Company's natural gas
distribution system in and around the City of Palmyra, Missouri for $665,000 in
cash.                                                                          
<PAGE>3
     As a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties, as described in Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognized a gain
of approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, ($0.31 per share) and ceased
recording the results of operations for the Missouri Properties during the first
quarter of 1994.  Consequently, the Company's results of operations for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1994 are not comparable to the results of
operations for the same periods ending December 31, 1993 and 1992.

     The following table reflects, through the dates of the sales of the
Missouri Properties, the approximate operating revenues and operating income
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and net utility plant
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, related to the Missouri Properties (see Notes 2
and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein):

     Separate audited financial information was not kept by the Company for the
Missouri Properties.  This unaudited financial information is based on
assumptions and allocations of expenses of the Company as a whole.

     On March 31, 1992, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA), acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company for $454 million in cash and 23,479,380
shares of common stock (the Merger).  The Company also paid approximately $20
million in costs to complete the Merger.  Simultaneously, KCA and Kansas Gas
and Electric Company merged and adopted the name of Kansas Gas and Electric
Company (KG&E).
     Additional information relating to the Merger can be found in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The following information includes the operations of KG&E since March 31,
1992 and excludes the activities related to the Missouri Properties following
the sales of those properties in the first quarter of 1994.

     The percentages of Total Operating Revenues and Operating Income Before
Income Taxes attributable to the Company's electric and natural gas operations
for the past five years were as follows:

                           Total                       Operating Income
                     Operating Revenues               Before Income Taxes

      1993           58%          42%                  85%          15%
      1992           57%          43%                  89%          11%
      1991           41%          59%                  84%          16%
      1990           40%          60%                  85%          15%
<PAGE>4
     The difference between the percentage of electric operating revenues to
total operating revenues and the percentage of electric operating income to
total operating income as compared to the same percentages for natural gas
operations is due to the Company's level of investment in plant and its fuel
costs in each of these segments.  The reduction in the percentages for the
natural gas operations in 1994 is due to the sales of the Missouri Properties. 
The increase in the percentages for the electric operations in 1992 is due to
the Merger. 
     The amount of the Company's plant in service (net of accumulated
depreciation) at December 31, for each of the past five years was as follows:

          Year          Electric          Natural Gas          Total

General

     The Company supplies electric energy at retail to approximately 594,000
customers in 462 communities in Kansas.  These include Wichita, Topeka,
Lawrence, Manhattan, Salina, and Hutchinson.  The Company also supplies
electric energy at wholesale to the electric distribution systems of 67
communities and 5 rural electric cooperatives.  The Company has contracts for
the sale, purchase or exchange of electricity with other utilities.  The

Capacity

     The aggregate net generating capacity of the Company's system is presently
5,230 megawatts (MW).  The system comprises interests in 22 fossil fueled
steam generating units, one nuclear generating unit (47 percent interest),
seven combustion peaking turbines and one diesel generator located at eleven
generating stations.  Two units of the 22 fossil fueled units have been
"mothballed" for future use (see Item 2. Properties).

     The Company's 1994 peak system net load occurred August 25, 1994 and
amounted to 3,720 MW.  The Company's net generating capacity together with
power available from firm interchange and purchase contracts, provided a
capacity margin of approximately 25 percent above system peak responsibility
at the time of the peak.

     The Company and ten companies in Kansas and western Missouri have agreed
to provide capacity (including margin), emergency and economy services for
each other.  This arrangement is called the MOKAN Power Pool.  The pool
participants also coordinate the planning of electric generating and
transmission facilities.

     The Company is one of 47 members of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).  SPP's
responsibility is to maintain system reliability on a regional basis.  The
region encompasses areas within the eight states of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.

     In 1994, the Company joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP).  Under
this arrangement, over 50 electric utilities and marketers throughout the
western United States have agreed to market energy and to provide transmission
services.  WSPP's intent is to increase the efficiency of the interconnected
power systems operations over and above existing operations.  Services
available include short-term and long-term economy energy transactions, unit
commitment service, firm capacity and energy sales, energy exchanges, and
transmission service by intermediate systems.

     In January 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority (OMPA), whereby, the Company received a prepayment
of approximately $41 million for capacity (42 MW) and transmission charges
through the year 2013.

     During 1994, KG&E entered into an agreement with Midwest Energy, Inc.
(MWE), whereby KG&E will provide MWE with peaking capacity of 61 MW through
<PAGE>6
the year 2008.  KG&E also entered into an agreement with Empire District
Electric Company (Empire), whereby KG&E will provide Empire with peaking and
base load capacity (20 MW in 1994 increasing to 80 MW in 2000) through the
year 2000.
     
     In January 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with Empire,
whereby the Company will provide Empire with peaking and base load capacity
(10 MW in 1995 increasing to 162 MW in 2000) through the year 2010.  The
agreement is subject to regulatory approval and termination by Empire prior to
January 1, 1996, provided that Empire is required by the KCC or Missouri
Public Service Commission, pursuant to complaints filed by Ahlstrom
Development Corporation (Ahlstrom) before those agencies, to accept Ahlstrom's
offer to sell power to Empire from generating units to be constructed.

Future Capacity

     The Company does not contemplate any significant expenditures in
connection with construction of any major generating facilities through the
turn of the century (see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis,
Liquidity and Capital Resources).  Although the Company's management believes,
based on current load-growth projections and load management programs, it will
maintain adequate capacity margins through 2000, in view of the lead time
required to construct large operating facilities, the Company may be required
before 2000 to consider whether to reschedule the construction of Jeffrey
Energy Center (JEC) Unit 4 or alternatively either build or acquire other
capacity.

Fuel Mix

     The Company's coal-fired units comprise 3,228 MW of the total 5,230 MW of
generating capacity and the Company's nuclear unit provides 545 MW of
capacity.  Of the remaining 1,457 MW of generating capacity, units that can
burn either natural gas or oil account for 1,365 MW, and the remaining units
which burn only oil or diesel fuel account for 92 MW (see Item 2. Properties).

     During 1994, low sulfur coal was used to produce 76 percent of the
Company's electricity.  Nuclear produced 18 percent and the remainder was
produced from natural gas, oil, or diesel fuel.  During 1995, based on the
Company's estimate of the availability of fuel, coal will be used to produce
approximately 78 percent of the Company's electricity and nuclear will be used
to produce approximately 18 percent.

     The Company's fuel mix fluctuates with the operation of nuclear powered
Wolf Creek which has an 18-month refueling and maintenance schedule.  The 18-
month schedule permits uninterrupted operation every third calendar year.  In
mid-September 1994, Wolf Creek was taken off-line for its seventh refueling
and maintenance outage.  The refueling outage took approximately 47 days to 
<PAGE>
complete, during which time electric demand was met primarily by the Company's
coal-fired generating units.  There is no refueling outage scheduled for 1995.

Nuclear

     The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract 63 percent of the
uranium required for operation of Wolf Creek through the year 2001.  The
balance is expected to be obtained through spot market and contract purchases.
<PAGE>7
     Contractual arrangements are in place for 100 percent of Wolf Creek's
uranium enrichment requirements for 1995-1997, 90 percent for 1998-1999, 95
percent for 2000-2001, and 100 percent for 2005-2014.  The balance of the
1998-2004 requirements is expected to be obtained through a combination of
spot market and contract purchases.  The decision not to contract for the full
enrichment requirements is one of cost rather than availability of service.

     Contractual arrangements are in place for the conversion of uranium to
uranium hexafluoride sufficient to meet Wolf Creek's requirements through 1996
as well as the fabrication of fuel assemblies to meet Wolf Creek's
requirements through 2012.

     The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established schedules, guidelines and
responsibilities for the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop and construct
repositories for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. 
The DOE has not yet constructed a high-level waste disposal site and has
announced that a permanent storage facility may not be in operation prior to
2010 although an interim storage facility may be available earlier.  Wolf
Creek contains an on-site spent fuel storage facility which, under current
regulatory guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The Company
believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained, as necessary.

     The Company along with the other co-owners of Wolf Creek are among 14
companies that filed a lawsuit on June 20, 1994, seeking an interpretation of
the DOE's obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal in
1998.  The DOE has filed a motion to have this case dismissed.  The issue to
be decided in this case is whether DOE must begin accepting spent fuel in 1998
or at a future date.
     
Coal

     The three coal-fired units at JEC have an aggregate capacity of 1,775 MW
(Company's 84 percent share) (see Item 2. Properties).  The Company has a
long-term coal supply contract with Amax Coal West, Inc. (AMAX), a subsidiary
of Cyprus Amax Coal Company, to supply low sulfur coal to JEC from AMAX's
Eagle Butte Mine or an alternate mine source of AMAX's Belle Ayr Mine, both
located in the Powder River Basin in Campbell County, Wyoming.  The contract
expires December 31, 2020.  The contract contains a schedule of minimum annual
delivery quantities based on MMBtu provisions.  The coal to be supplied is
surface mined and has an average Btu content of approximately 8,300 Btu per
pound and an average sulfur content of .43 lbs/MMBtu (see Environmental
Matters).  The average delivered cost of coal for JEC was approximately $1.13
per MMBtu or $18.55 per ton during 1994.

     Coal is transported from Wyoming under a long-term rail transportation
contract with Burlington Northern (BN) and Union Pacific (UP) to JEC through
December 31, 2013.  Rates are based on net load carrying capabilities of each
rail car.  The Company provides 890 aluminum rail cars, under a 20 year lease,
to transport coal to JEC.

     The two coal-fired units at La Cygne Station have an aggregate generating
capacity of 678 MW (KG&E's 50 percent share) (see Item 2.  Properties).  The
operator, Kansas City Power & Light Company (KCPL), maintains coal contracts
summarized in the following paragraphs.
<PAGE>8
     La Cygne 1 uses low sulfur Powder River Basin coal which is supplied under
a variety of spot market transactions, discussed below.  Illinois or
Kansas/Missouri coal is blended with the Powder River Basin coal and is
secured from time to time under spot market arrangements.  La Cygne 1 uses a
blend of 85 percent Powder River Basin coal.

     La Cygne 2 and additional La Cygne 1 Powder River Basin coal is supplied
through several contracts, expiring at various times through 1998.  This low
sulfur coal had an average Btu content of approximately 8,500 Btu per pound
and a maximum sulfur content of .50 lbs/MMBtu (see Environmental Matters). 
For 1994, KCPL secured Powder River Basin coal from two primary sources;
Carter Mining Company's Caballo Mine, a subsidiary of Exxon Coal USA; and
Caballo Rojo Inc's Caballo Rojo Mine, a subsidiary of Drummond Inc. 
Transportation is covered by KCPL through its Omnibus Rail Transportation
Agreement with BN and Kansas City Southern Railroad through December 31, 1995. 
An alternative rail transportation agreement with Western Railroad Property,
Inc. (WRPI), a partnership between UP and Chicago Northwestern (CNW), lasts
through December 31, 1995.  A new five-year coal transportation agreement is
being negotiated to provide transportation beyond 1995.

     During 1994, the average delivered cost of all coal procured for La Cygne
1 was approximately $0.78 per MMBtu or $14.11 per ton and the average
delivered cost of Powder River Basin coal for La Cygne 2 was approximately
$0.73 per MMBtu or $12.30 per ton.

     The coal-fired units located at the Tecumseh and Lawrence Energy Centers
have an aggregate generating capacity of 775 MW (see Item 2. Properties).  The
Company contracted with Cyprus Amax Coal Company's Foidel Creek Mine located
in Routt  County, Colorado for low sulfur coal through December 31, 1998. 
During 1994, the average delivered cost of coal for the Lawrence units was
approximately $1.15 per MMBtu or $25.59 per ton and the average delivered cost
of coal for the Tecumseh units was approximately $1.15 per MMBtu or $25.64 per
ton.  This coal is transported by Southern Pacific Lines and Atchison and
Topeka Santa Fe Railway Company.  The coal supplied from Cyprus has an average
Btu content of approximately 11,200 Btu per pound and an average sulfur
content of .38 lbs/MMBtu (see Environmental Matters).   The Company
anticipates that the Cyprus agreement will supply the minimum requirements of
the Tecumseh and Lawrence Energy Centers and supplemental coal requirements
will continue to be supplied from coal markets in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado
and/or New Mexico.

Natural Gas

     The Company uses natural gas as a primary fuel in its Gordon Evans, Murray
Gill, Abilene, and Hutchinson Energy Centers and in the gas turbine units at
its Tecumseh generating station.  Natural gas is also used as a supplemental
fuel in the coal-fired units at the Lawrence and Tecumseh generating stations. 
Natural gas for Gordon Evans and Murray Gill Energy Centers is supplied under
a firm contract that runs through 1995 by Kansas Gas Supply (KGS).  After
1995, the Company expects to use the spot market to purchase most of the
natural gas needed to fuel these generating stations.  Natural gas for the
Company's Abilene and Hutchinson stations is supplied from the Company's main
system (see Natural Gas Operations).  Natural gas for the units at the
Lawrence and Tecumseh stations is supplied through the WNG system under a 
short-term spot market agreement.
<PAGE>9
Oil

     The Company uses oil as an alternate fuel when economical or when
interruptions to natural gas make it necessary.  Oil is also used as a
supplemental fuel at each of the coal plants.  All oil burned by the Company
during the past several years has been obtained by spot market purchases.  At
December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately 3 million gallons of No. 2
and 14 million gallons of No. 6 oil which is believed to be sufficient to meet
emergency requirements and protect against lack of availability of natural gas
and/or the loss of a large generating unit.

Other Fuel Matters

     The Company's contracts to supply fuel for its coal- and natural gas-fired
generating units, with the exception of JEC, do not provide full fuel
requirements at the various stations.  Supplemental fuel is procured on the
spot market to provide operational flexibility and, when the price is
favorable, to take advantage of economic opportunities.

     On March 26, 1992, in connection with the Merger, the KCC approved the
elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause (ECA) for most Kansas retail
electric customers of both the Company and KG&E effective April 1, 1992.  The
provisions for fuel costs included in base rates were established at a level
intended by the KCC to equal the projected average cost of fuel through August
1995 and to include recovery of costs provided by previously issued orders
relating to coal contract settlements.  Any increase or decrease in fuel costs
from the projected average will impact the Company's earnings.

     Set forth in the table below is information relating to the weighted
average cost of fuel used by the Company.

Environmental Matters

     The Company currently holds all Federal and state  environmental approvals
required for the operation of its generating units.  The Company believes it
is presently in substantial compliance with all air quality regulations
(including those pertaining to particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides (NOx)) promulgated by the State of Kansas and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
<PAGE>10

     The Federal sulfur dioxide standards, applicable to the Company's JEC and 
La Cygne 2 units, prohibit the emission of more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur
dioxide per million Btu of heat input.  Federal particulate matter emission
standards applicable to these units prohibit:  (1) the emission of more than
0.1 pounds of particulate matter per million Btu of heat input and (2) an
opacity greater than 20 percent.  Federal NOx emission standards applicable to
these units prohibit the emission of more than 0.7 pounds of NOx per million
Btu of heat input.

     The JEC and La Cygne 2 units have met:  (1) the sulfur dioxide standards
through the use of low sulfur coal (see Coal); (2) the particulate matter
standards through the use of electrostatic precipitators; and (3) the NOx
standards through boiler design and operating procedures.  The JEC units are
also equipped with flue gas scrubbers providing additional sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter emission reduction capability.

     The Kansas Department of Health and Environment regulations, applicable to
the Company's other generating facilities, prohibit the emission of more than
2.5 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million Btu of heat input at the Company's
Lawrence generating units and 3.0 pounds at all other generating units.  There
is sufficient low sulfur coal under contract (see Coal) to allow compliance
with such limits at Lawrence, Tecumseh and La Cygne 1 for the life of the
contracts.  All facilities burning coal are equipped with flue gas scrubbers
and/or electrostatic precipitators.

     The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a two-phase
reduction in sulfur dioxide and oxides of NOx emissions effective in 1995 and
2000 and a probable reduction in toxic emissions.  To meet the monitoring and
reporting requirements under the acid rain program, the Company installed
continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately
$10 million.  The Company does not expect additional equipment to reduce
sulfur emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although, the Company
currently has no Phase I affected units, the owners have applied for an early
substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under the Phase I
regulations.

     The NOx and toxic limits, which were not set in the law, will be specified
in future EPA regulations.  NOx regulations for Phase II units and Phase I
group 2 units are mandated in the Act.  The EPA's proposed NOx regulations
were ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in November, 1994 and until such time as the EPA resubmits new
proposed regulations, the Company will be unable to determine its compliance
options or related compliance costs.

     All of the Company's generating facilities are in substantial compliance
with the Best Practicable Technology and Best Available Technology regulations
issued by EPA  pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1977.  Most EPA regulations
are administered in Kansas by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

     Additional information with respect to Environmental Matters is discussed
in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS

General

     At December 31, 1994, the Company supplied natural gas at retail to
approximately 643,000 customers in 362 communities and at wholesale to eight
communities and two utilities in Kansas and Oklahoma.  The natural gas systems
of the Company consist of distribution systems in both states purchasing
natural gas from various suppliers and transported by interstate pipeline
companies and the main system, an integrated storage, gathering, transmission
and distribution system.  The Company also transports gas for its large
commercial and industrial customers purchasing gas on the spot market.  The
Company earns approximately the same margin on the volume of gas transported
as on volumes sold except where limited discounting occurs in order to retain
the customer's load.

     As discussed previously, on January 31, 1994, the Company sold
substantially all of its Missouri natural gas distribution properties and
operations to Southern Union and sold the remaining Missouri Properties to
United Cities on February 28, 1994.  Additional information with respect to
the impact of the sales of the Missouri Properties is set forth in Notes 2 and
4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The percentage of total natural gas deliveries, including transportation
and operating revenues for 1994, by state were as follows:

                          Total Natural           Total Natural Gas
                        Gas Deliveries(1)       Operating Revenues(1)
          Kansas             84.1%                     80.5%
          Missouri           12.4%                     15.5%
          Oklahoma            3.5%                      4.0%

     The Company's natural gas deliveries for the last five years were as

     (1)  Information reflects the sales of the Missouri Properties effective   
          January 31, and February 28, 1994.

     (2)  Includes cumulative effect to January 1, 1991, of a change in revenue 
          recognition.  The cumulative effect of this change increased natural 
          gas sales by 14,838,000 MCF for 1991.

     In compliance with orders of the state commissions applicable to all
natural gas utilities, the Company has established priority categories for
service to its natural gas customers.  The highest priority is for residential
and small commercial customers and the lowest for large industrial customers.  
Natural gas delivered by the Company from its main system for use as fuel for
electric generation is classified in the lowest priority category.

Interstate System

     The Company distributes natural gas at retail to approximately 513,000
customers located in central and eastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma. 
The largest cities served in 1994 were Wichita and Topeka, Kansas and
Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  The Company purchases all the natural gas it delivers
to these customers direct from producers and marketers of natural gas.  The
Company has transportation agreements with WNG, a non-affiliated pipeline
transmission company, which have terms varying in length from one to twenty
years for delivery of this gas.  WNG transported 51.6 BCF under these
agreements in 1994 and 33.5 BCF in 1993.

     The Company purchases this gas from various suppliers under contracts
expiring at various times.  The Company purchased approximately 52.2 BCF or
89.3% of its natural gas supply from these sources in 1994 and 77.8 BCF or
52.9% during 1993.  Approximately 86.3 BCF of natural gas is made available
annually under these contracts with approximately 76.0 BCF available under
contracts which extend beyond the year 2000.  The Company has limited rights
to substitute spot gas for this gas under contract.  In October 1994, the
Company executed a long-term gas purchase contract (Base Contract) and a
peaking supply contract with Amoco Production Company for the purpose of
meeting the requirements of the customers served from the Company's interstate
pipeline system.  The Company anticipates that the Base Contract will supply
between 45% and 60% of the Company's demand served by the WNG pipeline system.
     
     The Company also purchases natural gas for the interstate system from
intrastate pipelines and spot market suppliers under short-term contracts. 
These sources totalled 3.8 BCF and 5.2 BCF for 1994 and 1993 representing 6.5%
and 3.5% of the system requirements, respectively.  These volumes were
transported by Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company (Panhandle), Northern
Natural Gas Company, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America.
<PAGE>13
     During 1994 and 1993, approximately 8.0 BCF and 7.1 BCF, respectively,
were transferred from the Company's main system to serve a portion of Wichita,
Kansas.  These system transfers represent 13.7% and 4.9%, respectively, of the
interstate system supply.

     The average wholesale cost per thousand cubic feet (MCF) purchased for the
distribution systems for the past five years was as follows:

       Total Average Cost     3.32       3.23       2.88       3.02       3.10

     The increase in the total average cost per MCF in 1994 from 1993 reflects
increased prices in the spot market and increased transportation costs.

Main System

     The Company serves approximately 130,000 customers in central and north
central Kansas with natural gas supplied through the main system.  The
principal market areas include Salina, Manhattan, Junction City, Great Bend,
McPherson and Hutchinson, Kansas.

     Natural gas for the Company's main system is purchased from a combination
of direct wellhead production, from the outlet of natural gas processing
plants, and from interstate pipeline interconnects all within the State of
Kansas.  Such purchases are transported entirely through Company owned
transmission lines in Kansas.

     As discussed under GENERAL, the Company is developing the Market Center
and intends to transfer certain natural gas transmission assets having a value
of approximately $52.1 million to the Market Center.  Natural gas purchased
for the Company's main system customer requirements will be transported and/or
stored by the Market Center upon approval from the KCC.  The Company retains a
priority right to capacity on the Market Center necessary to serve the main
system customers.  The Company will have the opportunity to negotiate for the
purchase of natural gas with producers or marketers utilizing Market Center
services, which will increase the potential supply available to meet main
system customer demands.

     During 1994, the Company purchased approximately 17.1 BCF of natural gas
from Mesa Operating Limited Partnership (Mesa).  This compares with
approximately 15.6 BCF of natural gas (including 2.5 BCF of make-up
deliveries) from Mesa pursuant to a contract expiring May 31, 1995 (the
Hugoton Contract).  These purchases represent approximately 62.7% and 53.7%,
respectively, of the Company's main system requirements during such periods. 
Pursuant to the Hugoton Contract, the Company expects to purchase
approximately 9 BCF of natural gas constituting approximately 37% of the
Company's main system requirements through May 31, 1995.

     The Company has issued a request for proposal for natural gas contracts
ranging from one to five years, to replace the gas previously purchased under
the expiring Mesa contract.  The Company has received interest in serving this
<PAGE>14
supply requirement from multiple producers and marketers and believes it will
be able to replace the requirements previously served by the Mesa contract
with adequate supplies at market based prices.

     Spivey-Grabs field in south-central Kansas supplied approximately 4.8 BCF
of natural gas in both 1994 and 1993, constituting 17.6% and 16.6%,
respectively, of the main system's requirements during such periods.  Such
natural gas is supplied pursuant to contracts with producers in the 
Spivey-Grabs field, most of which are for the life of the field, and under
which the Company expects to receive approximately 5 BCF or 17% of natural gas
in 1995.

     Other sources of gas for the main system of 2.9 BCF or 10.5% of the system
requirements were purchased from or transported through interstate pipelines
during 1994.  The remainder of the supply for the main system during 1994 and
1993 of 2.5 BCF and 4.2 BCF representing 9.2% and 14.5%, respectively, was
purchased directly from producers or gathering systems.

     During 1994 and 1993, approximately 8.0 BCF and 7.1 BCF, respectively, of
the total main system supply was transferred to the Company's interstate
system (see Interstate Pipeline Supply).

     The Company believes there is adequate natural gas available under
contract or otherwise available to meet the currently anticipated needs of the
main system customers.
     The main system's average wholesale cost per MCF purchased for the past
five years was as follows:
                         Natural Gas Supply - Main System
                              (Average Cost per MCF)

     (1)  Includes 2.5 BCF @ $1.31/MCF of make-up deliveries.
     (2)  Includes 2.1 BCF @ $1.31/MCF of make-up deliveries.
     (3)  Includes 1.5 BCF @ $1.31/MCF of make-up deliveries.
     (4)  Includes 1.6 BCF @ $1.12/MCF and 1.8 BCF @ $1.31/MCF of make-up
          deliveries.

     The load characteristics of the Company's natural gas customers creates
relatively high volume demand on the main system during cold winter days.  To
assure peak day service to high priority customers the Company owns and
operates and has under contract natural gas storage facilities (see Item 2.
Properties).

SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Financial information with respect to business segments is set forth in
Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.


FINANCING

     The Company's ability to issue additional debt and equity securities is 
restricted under limitations imposed by the charter and the Mortgage and Deed 
of Trust of Western Resources and KG&E.

     Western Resources' mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from
being issued (except in connection with certain refundings) unless the
Company's net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property
retirement for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding
the issuance are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest
charges on, or  ten percent of the principal amount of, all first mortgage
bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance.  Based on the
Company's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1994, approximately
$356 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be
issued (8.75% interest rate assumed).

     Western Resources bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the
preceding paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an
unfunded prior lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of
December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately $499 million of net bondable
property additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling the Company
to issue up to $299 million principal amount of additional bonds.  As of
December 31, 1994, no additional bonds could be issued on the basis of retired
bonds.

     KG&E's mortgage prohibits additional KG&E first mortgage bonds from being
issued (except in connection with certain refundings) unless KG&E's net
earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and
depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15
months preceding the issuance are not less than two and one-half times the
annual interest charges on, or ten percent of the principal amount of, all
KG&E first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed
issuance.  Based on KG&E's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1994,
approximately $743 million principal amount of additional KG&E first mortgage
bonds could be issued (8.75% interest rate assumed).

     KG&E bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the preceding
paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an unfunded prior
lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of December 31,
1994, KG&E had approximately $1.3 billion of net bondable property additions
not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling KG&E to issue up to $909
million principal amount of additional KG&E bonds.

     The most restrictive provision of the Company's charter permits the
issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without certain specified
preferred stockholder approval only if, for a period of 12 consecutive months
within 15 months preceding the issuance, net earnings available for payment of
interest exceed one and one-half times the sum of annual interest requirements
plus dividend requirements on preferred stock after giving effect to the
proposed issuance.  After giving effect to the annual interest and dividend
<PAGE>16
requirements on all debt and preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 1994,
such ratio was 2.17 for the 12 months ended December 31, 1994.


REGULATION AND RATES

     The Company is subject as an operating electric utility to the
jurisdiction of the KCC and as a natural gas utility to the jurisdiction of
the KCC and the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (OCC), which
have general regulatory authority over the Company's rates, extensions and
abandonments of service and facilities, valuation of property, the
classification of accounts and various other matters.

     The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and KCC with respect to the issuance of
securities.  There is no state regulatory body in Oklahoma having jurisdiction
over the issuance of the Company's securities.

     Additionally, the Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC,
including jurisdiction as to rates with respect to sales of electricity for
resale.  The Company is not engaged in the interstate transmission or sale of
natural gas which would subject it to the regulatory provisions of the Natural
Gas Act.  KG&E is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission as to nuclear plant operations and safety.

     Additional information with respect to Rate Matters and Regulation as set
forth in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is included
herein.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS


Stock Trading

     Western Resources common stock, which is traded under the ticker symbol
WR, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  As of March 1, 1995, there were
43,454 common shareholders of record.  For information regarding quarterly
common stock price ranges for 1994 and 1993, see Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
<PAGE>21
Dividend Policy

     Western Resources common stock is entitled to dividends when and as
declared by the Board of Directors.  At December 31, 1994, the Company's
retained earnings were restricted by $857,600 against the payment of dividends
on common stock.  However, prior to the payment of common dividends, dividends
must be first paid to the holders of preferred stock and second to the holders
of preference stock based on the fixed dividend rate for each series.

     Dividends have been paid on the Company's common stock throughout the
Company's history.  Quarterly dividends on common stock normally are paid on
or about the first of January, April, July, and October to shareholders of
record as of about the third day of the preceding month.  Dividends increased
four cents per common share in 1994 to $1.98 per share.  In January 1995, the
Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 50 1/2 cents per common 
<PAGE>
share, an increase of one cent over the previous quarter.  Based on currently
projected operating results, the Company does not anticipate a material change
in its dividend policy or payout ratio (approximately 70 percent in 1994) in
1995.  Future dividends depend upon future earnings, the financial condition
of the Company and other factors.  For information regarding quarterly
dividend declarations for 1994 and 1993, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FINANCIAL CONDITION

     GENERAL:  Earnings were $2.82 per share of common stock based on
61,617,873 average common shares for 1994, an increase from $2.76 in 1993 on
59,294,091 average common shares.  Net income for 1994 increased to $187.4
million compared to $177.4 million in 1993.  The increase in net income and
earnings per share is a result of the gain on the sale of the Company's
natural gas distribution properties and operations in the State of Missouri,
reduced interest expense, and higher electric sales combined with lower fuel
costs. 

     Dividends increased four cents per common share in 1994 to $1.98 per
share. In January 1995, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
of 50 1/2 cents per common share, an increase of one cent over the previous
quarter.  Based on currently projected operating results, the Company does not
anticipate a material change in its dividend policy or payout ratio
(approximately 70 percent in 1994) in 1995. 

     The book value per share was $23.93 at December 31, 1994, compared to
$23.08 at December 31, 1993.  The 1994 closing stock price of $28 5/8 was 120
percent of book value.  There were 61,617,873 common shares outstanding at
December 31, 1994.

     On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to
United Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The
properties sold to Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as
the "Missouri Properties."  With the sales the Company is no longer operating
as a utility in the State of Missouri.

     The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was
sold for an estimated sale price of $400 million, in cash, based on a
calculation as of December 31, 1993.  United Cities purchased the Company's
natural gas distribution system in and around the City of Palmyra, Missouri,
for $665,000 in cash. 

     As a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties, as described in Note
2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognized a 
gain of approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, ($0.31 per share) and ceased
recording the results of operations for the Missouri Properties during the
first quarter of 1994.  Consequently, the Company's results of operations for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1994 are not comparable to the results of
operations for the same periods ending December 31, 1993 and 1992.
<PAGE>24
     The following table reflects, through the dates of the sales of the
Missouri Properties, the approximate operating revenues and operating income
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and net utility plant

     Separate audited financial information was not kept by the Company for the
Missouri Properties.  This unaudited financial information is based on
assumptions and allocations of expenses of the Company as a whole.

     For additional information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties
and the pending litigation see Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:  The Company's liquidity is a function of
its ongoing construction program, designed to improve facilities which provide
electric and natural gas service and meet future customer service
requirements.

     During 1994, construction expenditures for the Company's electric system
were approximately $152 million and nuclear fuel expenditures were
approximately $21 million.  It is projected that adequate capacity margins
will be maintained without the addition of any major generating facilities
through the turn of the century.  The construction expenditures for
improvements on the natural gas system, including the Company's service line
replacement program, were approximately $65 million during 1994.   

     Capital expenditures for 1995 through 1997 are anticipated to be as
follows:

                          Electric       Nuclear Fuel      Natural Gas
                                    (Dollars in Thousands)
            1995. . . . . $131,300         $ 21,400           $ 45,700
            1996. . . . .  114,500            8,100             58,700
            1997. . . . .  108,500           24,000             58,100 

     These expenditures are estimates prepared for planning purposes and are
subject to revisions from time to time (see Note 7).

     The Company's net cash flows to capital expenditures was 97 percent for
1994 and during the last five years has averaged 98 percent.  The Company
anticipates all of its cash requirements for capital expenditures through 1997
will be provided from net cash flows.
<PAGE>25
     The Company's capital needs through 1999 for bond maturities and cash
sinking fund requirements for bonds and preference stock are approximately
$156 million.  This capital will be provided from internal and external
sources available under then existing financial conditions.

     The embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.6% at December 31, 1994, a
decrease from 8.1% at December 31, 1993.  The decrease was primarily
accomplished through refinancing of higher cost debt.  

     The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied, as needed,
through the sale of commercial paper, short-term bank loans and borrowings
under unsecured lines of credit maintained with banks.  At December 31, 1994,
short-term borrowings amounted to $308.2 million, of which $157.2 million was
commercial paper (see Notes 6 and 11).  At December 31, 1994, the Company had
bank credit arrangements available of $145 million.

     The Company's short-term debt balance at December 31, 1994, decreased
approximately $132.7 million from December 31, 1993.  The decrease is
primarily a result of the use of the proceeds from the sales of the Missouri
Properties and the issuance, on January 20, 1994, of $100 million of Kansas
Gas and Electric Company (KG&E) first mortgage bonds, 6.20% Series due January
15, 2006.

     In January 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority (OMPA).  Under the agreement, the Company received a
prepayment of approximately $41 million for which the Company will provide
capacity and transmission services to OMPA through the year 2013.

     On January 31, 1994, the Company redeemed the remaining $2,466,000
principal amount of Gas Service Company 8 1/2% Series First Mortgage Bonds due
1997.

     On February 17, 1994, KG&E refinanced the City of La Cygne, Kansas, 5 3/4%
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 1973, $13,980,000 principal
amount, with 5.10% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 1994,
$13,982,500 principal amount, due 2023.

     On March 4, 1994, the Company retired the following First Mortgage Bonds:
$19 million of 7 5/8% Series due April 1, 1999, $30 million of 8 1/8% Series
due June 1, 2007, and $50 million of 8 5/8% Series due March 1, 2017.

     On April 28, 1994, two series of Market-Adjusted Tax Exempt Securities
(MATES) totalling $75.5 million were sold on behalf of the Company and three
series of MATES totalling $46.4 million were sold on behalf of KG&E.  The rate
on these bonds was 2.95% for the initial auction period.  The interest rates
are being reset periodically via an auction process.  As of December 31, 1994,
the rates on these bonds ranged from 3.94% to 4.10%.  The net proceeds from
the new issues, together with available cash, were used to refund five series
of pollution control bonds totalling $121.9 million bearing interest rates
between 5 7/8% and 6.8%.

     On October 5, the Company extended the term of its $350 million revolving
credit facility which will now expire on October 5, 1999.

     On November 1, 1994, KG&E terminated a long-term agreement which contained
provisions for the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues, and
phase-in revenues (see Note 11).
<PAGE>26
     The Company has a Customer Stock Purchase Plan (CSPP) and a Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP).  Shares issued under the CSPP and
DRIP may be either original issue shares or shares purchased on the open
market.

     The Company's capital structure at December 31, 1994, was 49 percent
common stock equity, 6 percent preferred and preference stock, and 45 percent
long-term debt. The capital structure at December 31, 1994, including
short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, was 45 percent
common stock equity, 5 percent preferred and preference stock, and 50 percent
debt. As of December 31, 1994, the Company's bonds were rated "A3" by Moody's
Investors Service, "A-" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, and "A-" by Fitch
Investors Service.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year
results in revenues, operating expenses, other income and deductions, interest
charges and preferred and preference dividend requirements.  The results of
operations of the Company include the activities of KG&E since the merger on
March 31, 1992, and exclude the activities related to the Missouri Properties
following the sales of those properties in the first quarter of 1994.

     For additional information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties
and the pending litigation, see Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.  Additional information relating to changes between
years is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


     REVENUES  
     
     The operating revenues of the Company are based on sales volumes and rates
authorized by certain state regulatory commissions and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Rates, charged for the sale and delivery of
natural gas and electricity, are designed to recover the cost of service and
allow investors a fair rate of return.  Future natural gas and electric sales
will be affected by weather conditions, competition from other generating
sources, competing fuel sources, customer conservation efforts, and the
overall economy of the Company's service area.

     The Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) order approving the merger with
KG&E on March 31, 1992 (Merger), provided a moratorium on increases, with
certain exceptions, in the Company's jurisdictional electric and natural gas
rates until August 1995.  The KCC ordered refunds totalling $32 million to the
combined companies' customers to share with customers the Merger-related cost
savings achieved during the moratorium period.  Refunds of $8.5 million were
made in April 1992 and December 1993 and the remaining refund of $15 million
was made in September 1994 (see Note 3).

     On March 26, 1992, in connection with the Merger, the KCC approved the
elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause for most Kansas retail
electric customers of both the Company and KG&E effective April 1, 1992.  The
fuel costs are now included in base rates and were established at a level
intended by the KCC to equal the projected average cost of fuel through August
<PAGE>27
1995.  Any variance in fuel costs from the projected average will impact the
Company's earnings.

     Future natural gas revenues will be reduced as a result of the sales of
the Missouri Properties.  The Consolidated Statements of Income include
revenues of $77 million for the portion of the first quarter of 1994 prior to
the sales of the Missouri Properties, $350 million for 1993 and $299 million
for 1992.  Following the sales of the Missouri Properties and during 1995 and
beyond, there will be no revenues related to the Missouri Properties (see Note
2).

     1994 Compared to 1993:  Electric revenues increased two percent during
1994 primarily as a result of a four percent increase in commercial and
industrial electric sales.  Residential electric sales increased one percent
despite four percent cooler temperatures during the primary air conditioning
load months of June, July, and August.  Partially offsetting these increases
in electric revenues was a fourteen percent decrease in wholesale and
interchange sales as a result of higher than normal sales in 1993 to other
utilities while their generating units were down due to the flooding of 1993.

     Natural gas revenues and sales decreased significantly in 1994 as a result
of the sales of the Missouri Properties in the first quarter of 1994 (see Note
2).  Also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenues were reduced
natural gas sales for space heating as a result of much warmer temperatures
during the winter season of 1994 compared to 1993.   

     1993 Compared to 1992:  Electric revenues increased significantly in 1993
as a result of the Merger.  Also contributing to the increase was increased
electric sales for space heating, resulting from colder winter temperatures in
the first quarter of 1993, and increased sales for cooling load, resulting
from warmer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 1993.  KG&E
electric revenues of $617 million have been included in the Company's 1993
electric revenues.  This compares to KG&E revenues of $424 million, from April
1, 1992, through December 31, 1992, included in the Company's 1992 electric
revenues. Partially offsetting these increases in electric revenues was the
amortization of the Merger-related customer refund.

     Electric revenues for 1993 compared to pro forma revenues for 1992, giving
effect to the Merger as if it had occurred at January 1, 1992, would have
increased as a result of the warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in
1993.  Retail sales of kilowatt hours on a pro forma comparative basis
increased from approximately 14.6 billion for 1992 to approximately 15.5
billion for 1993, or six percent. 

     Natural gas revenues for 1993 increased approximately 20 percent as a
result of increased sales caused by colder winter temperatures, the full
impact of increased retail natural gas rates (see Note 5), and an 11 percent
increase in the unit cost of gas passed on to customers through the purchased
gas adjustment clauses (PGA).  The colder winter temperatures are reflected in
a 17 percent increase in natural gas sales to residential customers.
<PAGE>28

     OPERATING EXPENSES 

     1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating expenses decreased 17 percent
during 1994 primarily as a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties
(Note 2).  Also contributing to the decrease were lower fuel costs for
electric generation and reduced natural gas purchases as a result of lower
sales caused by milder winter temperatures in 1994 compared to 1993. 

     Partially offsetting the decreases in operating expenses was higher income
tax expense.  As of December 31, 1993, KG&E had fully amortized its deferred
income tax reserves related to the allowance for borrowed funds used during
construction capitalized for Wolf Creek Generating Station.  The completion of
the amortization of these deferred income tax reserves increased income tax
expense and thereby reduced net income by approximately $12 million in 1994,
and in the future will reduce net income by this same amount each year.

     1993 Compared to 1992:  Operating expenses increased for 1993 primarily as
a result of the Merger.  KG&E operating expenses of $470 million have been
included in the Company's operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
1993.  This compares to KG&E operating expenses of $316 million, from April 1,
1992, through December 31, 1992, included in the Company's 1992 operating
expenses.

     Other factors, excluding the Merger, contributing to the increase in
operating expenses were higher fuel and purchased power expenses caused by
increased electric sales to meet cooling load and increased natural gas
purchases caused by a 16 percent increase in natural gas sales and an 11
percent higher unit cost of gas which is passed on to customers through the
PGA.

     Also contributing to the increase were higher general taxes due to
increases in plant, the property tax assessment ratio, and higher mill levies.
A constitutional amendment in Kansas changed the assessment on utility
property from 30 to 33 percent.  As a result of this change the Company had an
increased property tax expense of approximately $6.1 million in 1993.

     Partially offsetting the increases were savings as a result of the Merger
and reduced net lease expense for La Cygne 2 resulting from refinancing of
secured facility bonds (see Note 10).

     OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS:  Other income and deductions, net of taxes,
was higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994 compared to 1993 due
to the recognition of the gain on the sales of the Missouri Properties of
approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, (see Note 2).  Partially offsetting
this increase was increased interest expense on corporate-owned life insurance
(COLI) borrowings.  Also partially offsetting the increase was the recognition
of income in 1993 from death proceeds from COLI policies.

     Other income and deductions, net of taxes, increased $1.3 million in 1993
compared to 1992.  KG&E other income and deductions, net of taxes, of $19
million have been included in the Company's total for 1993 compared to $17
million in 1992 from April 1, through December 31, 1992.  Income from KG&E's
COLI totalled $8 million in 1993.
<PAGE>29         
     INTEREST CHARGES AND PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS: 
Total interest charges decreased 17 percent for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1994, as a result of lower debt balances and the refinancing of
higher cost debt, as well as increased COLI borrowings which interest is
reflected in Other Income and Deductions, on the Consolidated Statements of
Income.  The Company's embedded cost of long-term debt decreased to 7.6% at
December 31, 1994, compared to 8.1% and 8.2% at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, primarily as a result of the refinancing of higher cost debt. 

     Partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense were higher
interest rates on short-term borrowings.

     Interest charges for 1993 were higher than 1992 as a result of the Merger. 
KG&E interest charges of $59 million for 1993 were included in the Company's
total interest charges compared to $53 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 1992.  The full twelve month effect of interest on debt to
acquire KG&E also contributed to the increase in total interest charges.  The
increased interest charges were partially offset through lower debt balances
and reduced interest charges from refinancing higher cost long-term debt and
lower interest rates on variable-rate debt.  
 
     MERGER IMPLEMENTATION:  In accordance with the KCC Merger order,
amortization of the acquisition adjustment will commence August 1995.  The
amortization will amount to approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per year for
40 years.  The Company can recover the amortization of the acquisition
adjustment through cost savings under a sharing mechanism approved by the KCC
as described in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
While the Company has achieved savings from the Merger, there is no assurance
that the savings achieved will be sufficient to, or the cost savings sharing
mechanism will operate as to, fully offset the amortization of the acquisition
adjustment.  

OTHER INFORMATION

     INFLATION:  Under the ratemaking procedures prescribed by the regulatory
commissions to which the Company is subject, only the original cost of plant
is recoverable in revenues as depreciation.  Therefore, because of inflation,
present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for purposes of
maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareholders and the
related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property.  The impact of this
ratemaking process on common shareholders is mitigated to the extent
depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of
less purchasing power.  While the Company has experienced relatively low
inflation in the recent past, the cumulative effect of inflation on operating
costs may require the Company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these
higher costs.

     FERC ORDER NO. 636:  In 1992 the FERC issued Order No. 636 (FERC 636)
which the FERC intended to complete the deregulation of natural gas production
and facilitate competition in the gas transportation industry.  FERC 636 has
affected the Company in several ways.  The rules provide greater protection
for pipeline companies by providing for recovery of all fixed costs through
contracts with local distribution companies and other customers choosing to
transport gas on a firm (non-interruptible) basis.  The order also separates
the purchase of natural gas from the transportation and storage of natural 
<PAGE>30
gas, shifting additional responsibility to distribution companies for the 
provision (through purchase and/or storage) of long-term gas supply and
transportation to distribution points.  Under the new rules, distribution
companies elect the amount and type of services taken from pipelines.  The
Company may be liable to one or more of its pipeline suppliers for costs
related to the transition from its traditional natural gas sales service to
the restructured services required by FERC 636.  The Company believes
substantially all of these costs will be recovered from its customers and any
additional transition costs will be immaterial to the Company's financial
position or results of operations.  For additional information regarding FERC
636 costs, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     ENVIRONMENTAL:  The Company has taken a proactive position with respect to
the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas
sites and has an agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment to systematically evaluate these sites in Kansas (see Note 7).  

     Although the Company currently has no Phase I affected units under the
Clean Air Act of 1990, the Company has applied for an early substitution
permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under the Phase I guidelines. 
The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and air toxic limits, which were not set in law,
will be specified in future Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. 
The EPA's proposed NOx regulations were ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November, 1994 and until such
time as the EPA resubmits new proposed regulations, the Company will be unable
to determine its compliance options or related compliance costs (see Note 7). 

     COMPETITION:  As a regulated utility, the Company currently has limited
direct competition for retail electric service in its certified service area. 
However, there is competition, based largely on price, from the generation, or
potential generation, of electricity by large commercial and industrial
customers, and independent power producers.

     The 1992 Energy Policy Act (Act) requires increased efficiency of energy
usage and has affected the way electricity is marketed.  The Act also provides
for increased competition in the wholesale electric market by permitting the
FERC to order third party access to utilities' transmission systems and by
liberalizing the rules for ownership of generating facilities.  As part of the
Merger, the Company agreed to open access of its transmission system for
wholesale transactions.  During 1994, wholesale electric revenues represented
less than ten percent of the Company's total electric revenues.

     Operating in this competitive environment could place pressure on utility
profit margins and credit quality.  Wholesale and industrial customers may
threaten to pursue cogeneration, self-generation, retail wheeling,
municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to
obtain reduced energy costs.  Increasing competition has resulted in credit
rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit
rating determinations.

     The Company is providing reduced electric rates for industrial expansion
projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain and
increase electric load.  In 1994, The Boeing Company announced it would 
<PAGE>31
develop its 777 jetliner in Wichita and Cessna Aircraft Company announced it
would build a production plant in Independence, Kansas along with expanding
its Wichita facilities, with an addition of 2,000 jobs.  

     In order to retain its current electric load, the Company has and will
continue to negotiate with some of its larger industrial customers, who are
able to develop cogeneration facilities, for long-term contracts although some
negotiated rates may result in reduced margins for the Company.  During 1996,
the Company will lose a major industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in
a reduction to pre-tax earnings of approximately $7 to $8 million or 7 to 8
cents per share.  This customer's decision to develop its own cogeneration
project was based partially on factors other than energy cost.

     To capitalize on opportunities in the non-regulated natural gas industry,
the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mid Continent Market Center,
Inc. (Market Center), is establishing a natural gas market center in Kansas. 
The Market Center will provide natural gas transportation, storage, and
gathering services, as well as balancing, and title transfer capability.  Upon
approval from the KCC, the Company intends to transfer certain natural gas
transmission assets having a value of approximately $52.1 million to the
Market Center.  In addition, the Company intends to extend credit to the
Market Center enabling the Market Center to borrow up to an aggregate
principal amount of $25 million on a term basis to construct new facilities
and $5 million on a revolving credit basis for working capital.  The Market
Center will provide no notice natural gas transportation and storage services
to the Company under a long-term contract.  The Company will continue to
operate and maintain the Market Center's assets under a separate contract.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
  of Western Resources, Inc.: 

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
statements of capitalization of Western Resources, Inc., and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows, taxes and common stock equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We did not
audit the financial statements of Kansas Gas and Electric Company, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Western Resources, Inc., as of and for the year ended
December 31, 1992, which statements reflect assets and revenues of 61 percent
and 27 percent, respectively, of the consolidated totals for 1992.  Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to
us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for that
entity, is based solely on the report of other auditors.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Western Resources, Inc., and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.          

     As explained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes.  As explained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits.  As explained in Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 1994, the Company
changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

                                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     General:  The Consolidated Financial Statements of Western Resources, Inc.
(the Company, Western Resources), include the accounts of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Astra Resources, Inc. (Astra), Kansas Gas and Electric Company
(KG&E) since March 31, 1992 (see Note 3), KPL Funding Corporation (KFC), and
Mid Continent Market Center, Inc. (Market Center).  KG&E owns 47 percent of
Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC), the operating company for
Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  The Company records its
proportionate share of all transactions of WCNOC as it does other
jointly-owned facilities.  All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.  The operations of Astra, KFC, and Market Center were not material
to the Company's results of operations.  The Company is conducting its utility
business as KPL, Gas Service, and through its wholly-owned subsidiary, KG&E. 
The Company is conducting its non-utility business through Astra.

     The accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated public utilities.  The
accounting and rates of the Company are subject to requirements of the Kansas
Corporation Commission (KCC), the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

     Utility Plant:  Utility plant is stated at cost.  For constructed plant,
cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect
charges for engineering, supervision, general and administrative costs, and an
allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  The AFUDC rate was
4.08% in 1994, 4.10% in 1993, and 5.99% in 1992.  The cost of additions to
utility plant and replacement units of property is capitalized. Maintenance
costs and replacement of minor items of property are charged to expense as
incurred.  When units of depreciable property are retired, they are removed
from the plant accounts and the original cost plus removal charges less
salvage are charged to accumulated depreciation.

     Depreciation:  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based
on estimated useful lives of property.  Composite provisions for book
depreciation approximated 2.87% during 1994, 3.02% during 1993, and 3.03%
during 1992 of the average original cost of depreciable property.

     Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid collateralized
debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

     Cash paid for interest and income taxes for each of the three years ended
December 31, are as follows:
                                                 1994        1993      1992  
                                                    (Dollars in Thousands)
Interest on financing activities (net of
  amount capitalized). . . . . . . . . . .   $134,785    $171,734    $128,505
Income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     90,229      49,108      24,966
<PAGE>41
     Income Taxes:  Income tax expense includes provisions for income taxes
currently payable and deferred income taxes calculated in conformance with
income tax laws, regulatory orders, and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109) (see Note 13).

     Investment tax credits previously deferred are being amortized to income
over the life of the property which gave rise to the credits.

     Revenues:  The Company accrues estimated unbilled electric and natural gas
revenues.  This method of recognizing revenues best matches revenues with
costs of services provided to customers and also conforms the Company's
accounting treatment of unbilled revenues with the tax treatment of such
revenues.  Unbilled revenues represent the estimated amount customers will be
billed for service provided from the time meters were last read to the end of
the accounting period.  Unbilled revenues of $61 million and $99 million are
recorded as a component of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues (net) on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

     The Company had reserves for doubtful accounts receivable of $3.4 million
and $4.3 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Fuel Costs:  The cost of nuclear fuel in process of refinement,
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication is recorded as an asset at original
cost and is amortized to expense based upon the quantity of heat produced for
the generation of electricity.  The accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel
in the reactor at December 31, 1994 and 1993, was $13.6 million and $17.4
million, respectively.

     Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Contracts:  The following amounts
related to corporate-owned life insurance contracts (COLI), primarily with one
highly rated major insurance company, are recorded in Corporate-owned Life
Insurance (net) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

                                                   1994          1993 
                                                 (Dollars in Millions)
         Cash surrender value of contracts. . .  $ 408.9       $ 326.3
         Borrowings against contracts . . . . .   (391.9)       (321.6)
                                                 -------       -------
                  COLI (net). . . . . . . . . .  $  17.0       $   4.7
                                                 =======       =======
                                                                              

     The COLI borrowings will be repaid upon receipt of proceeds from death
benefits under contracts.  The Company recognizes increases in the cash
surrender value of contracts, resulting from premiums and investment earnings
on a tax free basis, and the tax deductible interest on the COLI borrowings in
Corporate-owned Life Insurance (net) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Interest expense related to KG&E's COLI for 1994, 1993, and the nine months
ended December 31, 1992, was $21.0 million, $11.9 million, and $5.3 million,
respectively.

     As approved by the KCC, the Company is using a portion of the net income
stream generated by COLI policies purchased in 1993 and 1992 by the Company
(see Note 8) to offset Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
(SFAS 106) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112)
expenses.

     Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified
to conform with classifications used in the current year presentation.

2.  SALES OF MISSOURI NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION PROPERTIES

     On January 31, 1994, the Company sold substantially all of its Missouri
natural gas distribution properties and operations to Southern Union Company
(Southern Union).  The Company sold the remaining Missouri properties to
United Cities Gas Company (United Cities) on February 28, 1994.  The
properties sold to Southern Union and United Cities are referred to herein as
the "Missouri Properties."  With the sales the Company is no longer operating
as a utility in the State of Missouri.

     The portion of the Missouri Properties purchased by Southern Union was
sold for an estimated sale price of $400 million, in cash, based on a
calculation as of December 31, 1993.   The sale agreement provided for
estimated amounts in the sale price calculation to be adjusted to actual as of
January 31, 1994, within 120 days of closing.  Disputes with respect to
proposed adjustments based upon differences between estimates and actuals were
to be resolved within 60 days of submission of the disputes by Southern Union
or submitted to arbitration by an accounting firm to be agreed to by both
parties.  Southern Union proposed a number of adjustments to the purchase
price, some of which the Company has disputed.  The Company maintains the
disputed adjustments are not permitted under the sale agreement.  In the
opinion of the Company's management, the resolution of these purchase price
adjustments will not have a material impact on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.  For information regarding litigation in
connection with the sale of the Missouri Properties to Southern Union, see
Note 4.

     United Cities purchased the Company's natural gas distribution system in
and around the City of Palmyra, Missouri for $665,000 in cash.

     During the first quarter of 1994, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $19.3 million, net of tax, on the sales of the Missouri
Properties.  As of the respective dates of the sales of the Missouri
Properties, the Company ceased recording the results of operations, and
removed the assets and liabilities from the Consolidated Balance Sheet related
to the Missouri Properties.  The gain is reflected in Other Income and
Deductions, on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

     The following table reflects the approximate operating revenues and
operating income for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and
net utility plant at December 31, 1993 and 1992, related to the Missouri
Properties:

3.  ACQUISITION AND MERGER

     On March 31, 1992, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA), acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company for $454 million in cash and 23,479,380
shares of common stock (the Merger).  The Company also paid $20 million in
costs to complete the Merger.  Simultaneously, KCA and Kansas Gas and Electric
Company merged and adopted the name of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KG&E). 
The Merger was accounted for as a purchase.  For income tax purposes the tax
basis of the KG&E assets was not changed by the Merger.

     As the Company acquired 100 percent of the common and preferred stock of
KG&E, the Company recorded an acquisition premium of $490 million on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet for the difference in purchase price and book
value.  This acquisition premium and related income tax requirement of $311
million under SFAS 109 have been classified as plant acquisition adjustment in
Electric Plant in Service on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Under the
provisions of orders of the KCC, the acquisition premium is recorded as an
acquisition adjustment and not allocated to the other assets and liabilities
of KG&E.

     In the November 1991 KCC order approving the Merger, a mechanism was
approved to share equally between the shareholders and ratepayers the cost
savings generated by the Merger in excess of the revenue requirement needed to
allow recovery of the amortization of a portion of the acquisition adjustment,
including income tax, calculated on the basis of a purchase price of KG&E's
common stock at $29.50 per share.  The order provides an amortization period
for the acquisition adjustment of 40 years commencing in August 1995, at which
time the full amount of cost savings is expected to have been implemented. 
Merger savings will be measured by application of an inflation index to
certain pre-merger operating and maintenance costs at the time of the next
Kansas rate case.  While the Company has achieved savings from the Merger,
there is no assurance that the savings achieved will be sufficient to, or the
cost savings sharing mechanism will operate as to, fully offset the
amortization of the acquisition adjustment.  The order further provides a
moratorium on increases, with certain exceptions, in the Company's Kansas
electric and natural gas rates until August 1995.  The KCC ordered refunds
totalling $32 million to the combined companies' customers to share with
customers the Merger-related cost savings achieved during the moratorium
period.  Refunds of $8.5 million were made in April 1992 and December 1993 and
the remaining refund of $15 million was made in September 1994.

     The KCC order approving the Merger required the legal reorganization of
KG&E so that it was no longer held as a separate subsidiary after January 1,
1995, unless good cause was shown why such separate existence should be
maintained.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order relating to
the Merger granted the Company an exemption under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUHCA) until January 1, 1995.  The Company has been granted
regulatory approval from the KCC which eliminates the requirement for a
combination.  As a result of the sales of the Missouri Properties, the Company
is now exempt from regulation as a holding company under Section 3(a)(1) of
the PUHCA.

     As the Merger did not occur until March 31, 1992, the twelve months ended
December 31, 1992, results of operations for the Company reported in its
statements of income, cash flows, and common stock equity reflect KG&E's
results of operations for only the nine months ended December 31, 1992.  Pro
<PAGE>44
forma revenues of $1.7 billion, operating income of $269 million, net income
of $132 million and earnings per share of $2.03 for the year ended December
31, 1992 give effect to the Merger as if it had occurred at January 1, 1992. 
This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations that would have occurred had the Merger been consummated on January
1, 1992, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results.


4.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On June 1, 1994, Southern Union filed an action against the Company, The
Bishop Group, Ltd., and other entities affiliated with The Bishop Group, in
the Federal District Court for the Western District of Missouri (the Court)
(Southern Union Company v. Western Resources, Inc. et al., Case No. 94-509-CV-
W-1) alleging, among other things, breach of the Missouri Properties sale
agreement relating to certain gas supply contracts between the Company and
various Bishop entities that Southern Union assumed, and requesting
unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory relief.  On August 1,
1994, the Company filed its answer and counterclaim denying all claims
asserted against it by Southern Union and requesting declaratory judgment with
respect to certain adjustments in the purchase price for the Missouri
Properties proposed by Southern Union and disputed by the Company.  On August
24, 1994, Southern Union filed claims against the Company for alleged purchase
price adjustments totalling $19 million.  The Company subsequently agreed that
approximately $4 million of the purchase price adjustments were subject to
arbitration.  On January 18, 1995, the Court held the remaining $15 million of
proposed adjustments to the purchase price were subject to arbitration under
the sale agreement.  In the opinion of the Company's management, the disputed
adjustments are not proper adjustments to the purchase price.  For additional
information regarding the sales of the Missouri Properties see Note 2.

     On August 15, 1994, the Bishop entities filed an answer and claims against
Southern Union and the Company alleging, among other things, breach of those
certain gas supply contracts.  The Bishop entities claimed damages up to $270
million against the Company and Southern Union.  The Company's management
believes that through the sale agreement, Southern Union assumed all
liabilities arising out of or related to gas supply contracts associated with
the Missouri Properties.  The Company's management also believes it is not
liable for any claims asserted against it by the Bishop entities and will
vigorously defend such claims.

     The Company received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department
of Justice seeking certain information in connection with the department's
investigation "to determine whether there is, has been, or may be a violation
of the Sherman Act Sec. 1-2" with respect to the natural gas business in
Kansas and Missouri.  The Company is cooperating with the Department of
Justice, but is not aware of any violation of the antitrust laws in connection
with its business operations.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other legal and
environmental proceedings.  Management believes that adequate provision has
been made within the Consolidated Financial Statements for these other matters
and accordingly believes their ultimate dispositions will not have a material
adverse effect upon the business, financial position, or results of operations
of the Company.
<PAGE>45
5.  RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION

     The Company, under rate orders from the KCC, OCC and the FERC, recovers
increases in fuel and natural gas costs through fuel adjustment clauses for
wholesale and certain retail electric customers and various purchased gas
adjustment clauses (PGA) for natural gas customers.  The KCC and the OCC
require the annual difference between actual gas cost incurred and cost
recovered through the application of the PGA be deferred and amortized through
rates in subsequent periods.

     Elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause (ECA):  On March 26,
1992, in connection with the Merger, the KCC approved the elimination of the
ECA for most Kansas retail electric customers of both the Company and KG&E
effective April 1, 1992.  The provisions for fuel costs included in base rates
were established at a level intended by the KCC to equal the projected average
cost of fuel through August 1995, and to include recovery of costs provided by
previously issued orders relating to coal contract settlements.  Any variance
in fuel costs from the projected average will impact the Company's earnings.

     FERC Proceedings:  On August 19, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG)
filed a revised application with the FERC to direct bill approximately $14.7
million of FERC Order No. 636 (FERC 636) transition costs to the Company
related to natural gas sales service in Kansas and Oklahoma.  These costs are
currently being recovered from the Company's current Kansas and Oklahoma
customers.  The Company believes any future transition costs ultimately will
be recovered through charges to its customers, and any unrecovered transition
costs will not be material to the Company's financial position or results of
operations.  For additional information with respect to FERC 636 see
Management's Discussion and Analysis.

     On October 5, 1994, WNG filed an application with the FERC to direct bill
to the Company up to $30.4 million of settlement costs paid to Amoco related
to litigation between WNG and Amoco regarding the proper price to be paid for
gas purchased by WNG from Amoco.  The proposed direct bill is related to
natural gas service rendered by the Company in Kansas and Oklahoma.  At
December 31, 1994, $14.2 million of these costs have been billed to the
Company.  The Company believes substantially all of these costs and any future
settlement costs ultimately will be recovered through charges to its Kansas
and Oklahoma customers, and any unrecovered settlement costs will not be
material to the Company's financial position or results of operations.

     KCC Proceedings:  On December 22, 1994, the Company, in conjunction with
the Market Center, filed an application with the KCC to form a natural gas
market center in Kansas.  The Market Center will provide natural gas
transportation, storage, and gathering services, as well as balancing, and
title transfer capability.  Upon approval from the KCC, the Company intends to
transfer certain natural gas transmission assets having a value of
approximately $52.1 million to the Market Center.  In addition, the Company
intends to extend credit to the Market Center enabling the Market Center to
borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million on a term basis to
construct new facilities and $5 million on a revolving credit basis for
working capital.  The Market Center will provide no notice natural gas
transportation and storage services to the Company under a long-term contract. 
The Company will continue to operate and maintain the Market Center's assets
under a separate contract.
<PAGE>46
     On January 24, 1992, the KCC issued an order allowing the Company to
continue the deferral of service line replacement program costs incurred since
January 1, 1992, including depreciation, property taxes, and carrying costs
for recovery in the next general rate case.  At December 31, 1994,
approximately $7.2 million of these deferrals have been included in Deferred
Charges and Other Assets, Other, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

     On December 30, 1991, the KCC approved a permanent natural gas rate
increase of $39 million annually and the Company discontinued the deferral of
accelerated line survey costs on January 1, 1992.  Approximately $3.1 million
of these deferred costs remain in Deferred Charges and Other Assets, Other, on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1994, with the balance being
included in rates and amortized to expense during a 43-month period,
commencing January 1, 1992.

     Tight Sands:  In December 1991 the KCC, and the OCC approved agreements
authorizing the Company to refund to customers approximately $40 million of
the proceeds of the Tight Sands antitrust litigation settlement to be
collected on behalf of Western Resources' natural gas customers.  To secure
the refund of settlement proceeds, the Commissions authorized the
establishment of an independently administered trust to collect and maintain
cash receipts received under Tight Sands settlement agreements and provide for
the refunds made.  The trust has a term of ten years.

     Rate Stabilization Plan:  In 1988, the KCC issued an order requiring the
accrual of phase-in revenues be discontinued by KG&E effective December 31,
1988. Effective January 1, 1989, KG&E began amortizing the phase-in revenue
asset on a straight-line basis over 9 1/2 years.  At December 31, 1994,
approximately $61 million of deferred phase-in revenues remained on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

     Coal Contract Settlements:  In March 1990, the KCC issued an order
allowing KG&E to defer its share of a 1989 coal contract settlement with the
Pittsburg  and Midway Coal Mining Company amounting to $22.5 million.  This
amount was recorded as a deferred charge and is included in Deferred Charges
and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The settlement resulted
in the termination of a long-term coal contract.  The KCC permitted KG&E to
recover this settlement as follows: 76 percent of the settlement plus a return
over the remaining term of the terminated contract (through 2002) and 24
percent to be amortized to expense with a deferred return equivalent to the
carrying cost of the asset.

     In February 1991, KG&E paid $8.5 million to settle a coal contract lawsuit
with AMAX Coal Company and recorded the payment as a deferred charge in
Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The KCC
approved the recovery of the settlement plus a return, equivalent to the
carrying cost of the asset, over the remaining term of the terminated contract
(through 1996).

     FERC Order No. 528:  In 1990, the FERC issued Order No. 528 which
authorized new methods for the allocation and recovery of take-or-pay
settlement costs by natural gas pipelines from their customers.  Settlements
were reached between the Company's two largest gas pipelines and their
customers in FERC proceedings related to take-or-pay issues.  The settlements
address the allocation of take-or-pay settlement costs between the pipelines
and their customers.  However, the amount which one of the pipelines will be
<PAGE>47
allowed to recover is yet to be determined.  Litigation continues between the
Company and a former upstream pipeline supplier to one of the Company's
pipeline suppliers concerning the amount of such costs which may ultimately be
allocated to the Company's pipeline supplier.  The Company's share of any
costs allocated to the Company's pipeline supplier will be charged to the
Company.  Due to the uncertainty concerning the amount to be recovered by the
Company's current suppliers and of the outcome of the litigation between the
Company and its current pipeline's upstream supplier, the Company is unable to
estimate its future liability for take-or-pay settlement costs.  However, the
KCC has approved mechanisms which are designed to allow the Company to recover
these take-or-pay costs from its customers.


6.  SHORT-TERM DEBT

     The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied, through the
sale of commercial paper, short-term bank loans and borrowings under unsecured
lines of credit maintained with banks.  Information concerning these
arrangements for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, is set
forth below:

     In connection with the commitments, the Company has agreed to pay certain
fees to the banks.  Available lines of credit and the unused portion of the
revolving credit facility are utilized to support the Company's outstanding
short-term debt.


7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     As part of its ongoing operations and construction program, the Company
has commitments under purchase orders and contracts which have an unexpended
balance of approximately $77 million at December 31, 1994.  Approximately $32
million is attributable to modifications to upgrade the three turbines at
Jeffrey Energy Center to be completed by December 31, 1998.  Plans for future
construction of utility plant are discussed in the Management's Discussion and
Analysis section.
<PAGE>48

     In January 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Oklahoma
Municipal Power Authority (OMPA).  Under the agreement, the Company received a
prepayment of approximately $41 million for which the Company will provide
capacity and transmission services to OMPA through the year 2013.

     Manufactured Gas Sites:  The Company was previously associated with 20
former manufactured gas sites located in Kansas which may contain coal tar and
other potentially harmful materials.  These sites were operated decades ago by
predecessor companies, and were owned by the Company for a period of time
after operations had ceased.  The Company and the Kansas Department of Health
and Environment (KDHE) conducted preliminary assessments of the sites at a
cost of approximately $500,000.  The results of the preliminary investigations
determined the Company does not have a connection to four of the sites.  Of
the remaining 16 sites, the site investigation and risk assessment field work
of the highest priority site was completed in 1994 at a total cost of
approximately $450,000.  The Company has not received the final report so as
to determine the extent of contamination and the amount of any possible
remediation.

     The Company and KDHE entered into a consent agreement governing all future
work at these sites.  The terms of the consent agreement will allow the
Company to investigate the 16 sites and set remediation priorities based upon
the results of the investigations and risk analysis.  The prioritized sites
will be investigated over a 10 year period.  The agreement will allow the
Company to set mutual objectives with the KDHE in order to expedite effective
response activities and to control costs and environmental impact.  The
Company is aware of other utilities in Region VII of the EPA (Kansas,
Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa) which have incurred remediation costs for
manufactured gas sites ranging between $500,000 and $10 million, depending on
the site, and that the KCC has issued an accounting order which will permit
another Kansas utility to recover its remediation costs through rates.  To the
extent that such remediation costs are not recovered through rates, the costs
could be material to the Company's financial position or results of operations
depending on the degree of remediation required and number of years over which
the remediation must be completed.

     Superfund Sites:  The Company has been identified as one of numerous
potentially responsible parties in four hazardous waste sites listed by the
EPA as Superfund sites.  One site is a groundwater contamination site in
Wichita, Kansas (Wichita site), two are soil contamination sites in Missouri
(Missouri sites), and one site is a solid waste land-fill located in
Edwardsville, Kansas (Edwardsville site).  Settlement agreements releasing the
Company from liability for future response or costs have been entered into at
the Edwardsville site and one of the Missouri sites.  The Company's obligation
at the remaining Missouri site and the Wichita site appears to be limited
based on the Company's experience at similar sites given its limited exposure
and settlement costs.  In the opinion of the Company's management, the
resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

     Clean Air Act:  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a
two-phase reduction in sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions
effective in 1995 and 2000 and a probable reduction in toxic emissions.  To
meet the monitoring and reporting requirements under the acid rain program,
the Company installed continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total
cost of approximately $10 million.  The Company does not expect additional
<PAGE>49
equipment to reduce sulfur emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although
the Company currently has no Phase I affected units, the owners have applied
for an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under
the Phase I regulations.

     The NOx and air toxic limits, which were not set in the law, will be
specified in future EPA regulations.  The EPA's proposed NOx regulations were
ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit and until such time as the EPA resubmits new proposed regulations, the
Company will be unable to determine its compliance options or related
compliance costs.

     Other Environmental Matters:  As part of the sale of the Company's
Missouri Properties to Southern Union, Southern Union assumed responsibility
under an agreement for any environmental matters related to the Missouri
Properties purchased by Southern Union pending at the date of the sale or that
may arise after closing.  For any environmental matters pending or discovered
within two years of the date of the agreement, and after pursuing several
other potential recovery options, the Company may be liable for up to a
maximum of $7.5 million under a sharing arrangement with Southern Union
provided for in the agreement.

     Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal:  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the ultimate storage
and disposal of spent nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors.  Under a
contract with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the Company pays a
quarterly fee to DOE of one mill per kilowatthour on net nuclear generation.
These fees are included as part of nuclear fuel expense and amounted to $3.8
million for 1994, $3.5 million for 1993, and $1.6 million for 1992.

       The Company along with the other co-owners of Wolf Creek are among 14
companies that filed a lawsuit on June 20, 1994, seeking an interpretation of
the DOE's obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal in
1998.  The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires DOE ultimately to accept
and dispose of nuclear utilities' spent fuel.  The DOE has filed a motion to
have this case dismissed.  The issue to be decided in this case is whether DOE
must begin accepting spent fuel in 1998 or at a future date.  Wolf Creek
contains an on-site spent fuel storage facility which, under current
regulatory guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
the year 2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The
Company believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained as
necessary.

     Decommissioning:  On June 9, 1994, the KCC issued an order approving the
decommissioning costs of the 1993 Wolf Creek Decommissioning Cost Study which
estimates the Company's share of Wolf Creek decommissioning costs, under the
immediate dismantlement method, to be approximately $595 million primarily
during the period 2025 through 2033, or approximately $174 million in 1993
dollars.  These costs were calculated using an assumed inflation rate of 3.45%
over the remaining service life, in 1993, of 32 years.

       Decommissioning costs are being charged to operating expenses in
accordance with the KCC order.  Electric rates charged to customers provide
for recovery of these decommissioning costs over the life of Wolf Creek. 
Amounts so expensed ($3.5 million in 1994 increasing annually to $5.5 million
in 2024) and earnings on trust fund assets are deposited in an external trust
fund.  The assumed return on trust assets is 5.9%.
<PAGE>50
       The Company's investment in the decommissioning fund, including
reinvested earnings was $16.9 million and $13.2 million at December 31, 1994
and December 31, 1993, respectively.  These amounts are reflected in
Decommissioning Trust, and the related liability is included in Deferred
Credits and Other Liabilities, Other, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
     
       The Company carries $118 million in premature decommissioning insurance. 
The insurance coverage has several restrictions.  One of these is that it can
only be used if Wolf Creek incurs an accident exceeding $500 million in
expenses to safely stabilize the reactor, to decontaminate the reactor and
reactor station site in accordance with a plan approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to pay for on-site property damages.  If the
amount designated as decommissioning insurance is needed to implement the NRC-
approved plan for stabilization and decontamination, it would not be available
for decommissioning purposes.

     Nuclear Insurance:  The Price-Anderson Act limits the combined public
liability of the owners of nuclear power plants to $8.9 billion for a single
nuclear incident.  The Wolf Creek owners (Owners) have purchased the maximum
available private insurance of $200 million and the balance is provided by an
assessment plan mandated by the NRC.  Under this plan, the Owners are jointly
and severally subject to a retrospective assessment of up to $79.3 million
($37.3 million, Company's share) in the event there is a major nuclear
incident involving any of the nation's licensed reactors.  This assessment is
subject to an inflation adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and
applicable premium taxes.  There is a limitation of $10 million ($4.7 million,
Company's share) in retrospective assessments per incident, per year.

     The Owners carry decontamination liability, premature decommissioning
liability, and property damage insurance for Wolf Creek totalling
approximately $2.8 billion ($1.3 billion, Company's share).  This insurance is
provided by a combination of "nuclear insurance pools" ($500 million) and
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) ($2.3 billion).  In the event of an
accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and
site decontamination.  The Company's share of any remaining proceeds can be
used for property damage up to $1.2 billion (Company's share) and premature
decommissioning costs up to $118 million (Company's share) in excess of funds
previously collected for decommissioning (as discussed under
"Decommissioning").

     The Owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to cover costs of
replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage
resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If losses incurred
at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL policies exceed premiums,
reserves, and other NEIL resources, the Company may be subject to
retrospective assessments of approximately $13 million per year.

       Although the Company maintains various insurance policies to provide
coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an
extended outage, the Company's insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover
the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at
Wolf Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent
not recoverable through rates, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.
<PAGE>51
     Federal Income Taxes:  During 1991, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
completed an examination of KG&E's federal income tax returns for the years
1984 through 1988.  In April 1992, KG&E received the examination report and
upon review filed a written protest in August 1992.  In October 1993, KG&E
received another examination report for the years 1989 and 1990 covering the
same issues identified in the previous examination report.  Upon review of
this report, KG&E filed a written protest in November 1993.  The most
significant proposed adjustments reduce the depreciable basis of certain
assets and investment tax credits generated.  Management believes there are
significant questions regarding the theory, computations, and sampling
techniques used by the IRS to arrive at its proposed adjustments, and also
believes any additional tax expense incurred or loss of investment tax credits
will not be material to the Company's financial position and results of
operations.  Additional income tax payments, if any, are expected to be offset
by investment tax credit carryforwards, alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards, or deferred tax provisions.

     Fuel Commitments:  To supply a portion of the fuel requirements for its
generating plants, the Company has entered into various commitments to obtain
nuclear fuel, coal, and natural gas. Some of these contracts contain
provisions for price escalation and minimum purchase commitments.  At December
31, 1994, WCNOC's nuclear fuel commitments (Company's share) were
approximately $12.6 million for uranium concentrates expiring at various times
through 1997, $122.9 million for enrichment expiring at various times through
2014, and $56.5 million for fabrication through 2012.  At December 31, 1994,
the Company's coal and natural gas contract commitments in 1994 dollars under
the remaining terms of the contracts were approximately $3 billion and $9
million, respectively.  The largest coal contract expires in 2020, with the
remaining coal contracts expiring at various times through 2013.  The majority
of natural gas contracts continue through 1995 with automatic one-year
extension provisions.  In the normal course of business, additional
commitments and spot market purchases will be made to obtain adequate fuel
supplies.

     Energy Act:  As part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, a special assessment
is being collected from utilities for a uranium enrichment, decontamination,
and decommissioning fund.  The Company's portion of the assessment for Wolf
Creek is approximately $7 million, payable over 15 years.  Management expects
such costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process.


8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     Pension:  The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension
plans covering substantially all employees.  Pension benefits are based on
years of service and the employee's compensation during the five highest paid
consecutive years out of ten before retirement.  The Company's policy is to
fund pension costs accrued, subject to limitations set by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code.

     Retirement and Voluntary Separation Plans:  In January 1992, the Board of
Directors approved early retirement plans and voluntary separation programs. 
The voluntary early retirement plans were offered to all vested participants
in the Company's defined pension plan who reached the age of 55 with 10 or
more years of service on or before May 1, 1992.  Certain pension plan
improvements were made, including a waiver of the actuarial reduction factors
for early retirement and a cash incentive payable as a monthly supplement up
to 60 months or as a lump sum payment.  Of the 738 employees eligible for the
early retirement option, 531, representing ten percent of the combined
Company's work force, elected to retire on or before the May 1, 1992,
deadline.  Seventy-one of those electing to retire were employees of KG&E
acquired March 31, 1992 (see Note 3).  Another 67 employees, with 10 or more
years of service, elected to participate in the voluntary separation program. 
Of those, 29 were employees of KG&E.  In addition, 68 employees received
<PAGE>53
Merger-related severance benefits, including 61 employees of KG&E.  The
actuarial cost, based on plan provisions for early retirement and voluntary
separation programs, and Merger-related severance benefits for the KG&E
employees were considered in purchase accounting for the Merger.  The
actuarial cost of the former Kansas Power and Light Company employees, of
approximately $11 million, was expensed in 1992.

     Postretirement:  The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106) in the first quarter of
1993.  This statement requires the accrual of postretirement benefits other
than pensions, primarily medical benefit costs, during the years an employee
provides service.

     Based on actuarial projections and adoption of the transition method of
implementation which allows a 20-year amortization of the accumulated benefit
obligation, SFAS 106 expense was approximately $12.4 million and $26.5 million
for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company's total SFAS 106 obligation was
approximately $114.6 million  and $166.5 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993
respectively.  The reduction in both the 1994 obligation and expense is
primarily the result of the sales of the Missouri Properties.  To mitigate the
impact of SFAS 106 expense, the Company has implemented programs to reduce
health care costs.  In addition, the Company received an order from the KCC
permitting the initial deferral of SFAS 106 expense.  To mitigate the impact
SFAS 106 expense will have on rate increases, the Company will include in the
future computation of cost of service the actual SFAS 106 expense and an
income stream generated from COLI.  To the extent SFAS 106 expense exceeds
income from the COLI program, this excess is being deferred (in accordance
with the provisions of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 92-12)
and will be offset by income generated through the deferral period by the COLI
program.  Should the income stream generated by the COLI program not be
sufficient to offset the deferred SFAS 106 expense, the KCC order allows
recovery of such deficit through the ratemaking process.

     Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106, the Company's policy was to recognize
the cost of retiree health care and life insurance benefits as expense when
claims and premiums for life insurance policies were paid.  The cost of
providing health care and life insurance benefits to 2,928 retirees was $8.1
million in 1992.

     The following table summarizes the status of the Company's postretirement
plans for financial statement purposes and the related amounts included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets:

     For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost growth rate of 12%
was assumed for 1994, decreasing 1% per year to 5% in 2001 and thereafter. 
The health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the projected
benefit obligation.  Increasing the trend rate by 1% each year would increase
the present value of the accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4.7
million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components by $0.3
million.

     Postemployment:   The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112) in the first quarter of 1994, which established
accounting and reporting standards for postemployment benefits.  The statement
requires the Company to recognize the liability to provide postemployment
benefits when the liability has been incurred.  The Company received an order
from the KCC permitting the initial deferral of SFAS 112 expense.  To mitigate
the impact SFAS 112 expense will have on rate increases, the Company will
include in the future computation of cost of service the actual SFAS 112
transition costs and expenses and an income stream generated from COLI.  The
1994 expense under SFAS 112 was approximately $2.7 million.  At December 31,
1994, the Company's SFAS 112 liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet was approximately $8.4 million.

     Savings:  The Company maintains savings plans in which substantially all
employees participate.  The Company matches employees' contributions up to
specified maximum limits.  The funds of the plans are deposited with a trustee
and invested at each employee's option in one or more investment funds,
including a Company stock fund.  The Company's contributions were $5.1
million, $5.8 million, and $5.4 million for 1994, 1993, and 1992,
respectively.

     Missouri Property Sale:  Effective January 31, 1994, the Company
transferred a portion of the assets and liabilities of the Company's pension
plan to a pension plan established by Southern Union.  The amount of assets
transferred equal the projected benefit obligation for employees and retirees
associated with Southern Union's portion of the Missouri Properties plus an
additional $9 million.

     Amounts and capacity represent the Company's share.  The Company's share
of operating expenses of the plants in service above, as well as such expenses
for a 50 percent undivided interest in La Cygne 2 (representing 335 MW
capacity) sold and leased back to the Company in 1987, are included in
operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company's
share of other transactions associated with the plants is included in the
appropriate classification in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.


10.  LEASES

     At December 31, 1994, the Company had leases covering various property and
equipment.  Certain lease agreements meet the criteria, as set forth in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, for classification as
capital leases.

     Rental payments for capital and operating leases and estimated rental
commitments are as follows:

     In 1987, KG&E sold and leased back its 50 percent undivided interest in
the La Cygne 2 generating unit.  The La Cygne 2 lease has an initial term of
29 years, with various options to renew the lease or repurchase the 50 percent
undivided interest.  KG&E remains responsible for its share of operation and
<PAGE>56
maintenance costs and other related operating costs of La Cygne 2.  The lease
is an operating lease for financial reporting purposes.

     As permitted under the La Cygne 2 lease agreement, the Company in 1992
requested the Trustee Lessor to refinance $341.1 million of secured facility
bonds of the Trustee and owner of La Cygne 2.  The transaction was requested
to reduce recurring future net lease expense.  In connection with the
refinancing on September 29, 1992, a one-time payment of approximately $27
million was made by the Company which has been deferred and is being amortized
over the remaining life of the lease and included in operating expense as part
of the future lease expense.  At December 31, 1994, approximately $24.8
million of this deferral remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

     Future minimum annual lease payments, included in the table above,
required under the La Cygne 2 lease agreement are approximately $34.6 million
for each year through 1999 and $680 million over the remainder of the lease.

     The gain of approximately $322 million realized at the date of the sale of
La Cygne 2 has been deferred for financial reporting purposes, and is being
amortized ($9.6 million per year) over the initial lease term in proportion to
the related lease expense.  KG&E's lease expense, net of amortization of the
deferred gain and a one-time payment, was approximately $22.5 million for 1994
and 1993, and $20.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 1992.


11.  LONG-TERM DEBT

     The amount of first mortgage bonds authorized by the Western Resources
Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as supplemented, is unlimited. 
The amount of first mortgage bonds authorized by the KG&E Mortgage and Deed of
Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented, is limited to a maximum of $2
billion.  Amounts of additional bonds which may be issued are subject to
property, earnings, and certain restrictive provisions of each Mortgage.

     On January 20, 1994, KG&E issued $100 million of First Mortgage Bonds,
6.20% Series due January 15, 2006.

     On January 31, 1994, the Company redeemed the remaining $2,466,000
principal amount of Gas Service Company (GSC) 8 1/2% Series First Mortgage
Bonds due 1997.  In addition, the Company had the GSC Mortgage and Deed of
Trust discharged.

     Debt discount and expenses are being amortized over the remaining lives of
each issue.  The Western Resources and KG&E improvement and maintenance fund
requirements for certain first mortgage bond series can be met by bonding
additional property.  With the retirement of certain Western Resources and
KG&E pollution control series bonds, there are no longer any bond sinking fund
requirements.  During 1995, $80 thousand of bonds will be redeemed, during
1996,  $16 million of bonds will mature and $125 million of bonds will mature
in 1999.

     On November 1, 1994, the Company terminated a long-term agreement which
contained provisions for the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues
(receivables) and phase-in revenues up to a total of $180 million.  Amounts
related to receivables were accounted for as sales while those related to
phase-in revenues were accounted for as collateralized borrowings.  At
December 31, 1993, outstanding receivables amounting to $56.8 million were
<PAGE>57
considered sold under the agreement.  The weighted average interest rate,
including fees, on this agreement was 4.6% for 1994, 3.7% for 1993, and 6.6%
for the nine months ended December 31, 1992.

     In January 1993, the Company renegotiated its $600 million bank term loan
and revolving credit facility used to finance the Merger into a $350 million
revolving credit facility, secured by KG&E common stock.  On October 5, 1994,
the Company extended the term of this facility to expire on October 5, 1999. 
The unused portion of the revolving credit facility may be used to provide
support for outstanding short-term debt.  At December 31, 1994, there was no
outstanding balance under the facility.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993, was as follows:

12.  COMMON STOCK AND CUMULATIVE PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK

     The Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, provides for
85,000,000 authorized shares of common stock.  At December 31, 1994,
61,617,873 shares were outstanding.

     The Company has a Customer Stock Purchase Plan (CSPP) and a Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP).  Shares issued under the CSPP and
DRIP may be either original issue shares or shares purchased on the open
market.  At December 31, 1994, 2,031,794 shares were available under the CSPP
registration statement and 1,183,323 shares were available under the DRIP
registration statement.

     Not subject to mandatory redemption:  The cumulative preferred stock is
redeemable in whole or in part on 30 to 60 days notice at the option of the
Company.

     Subject to mandatory redemption:  The mandatory sinking fund provisions of
the 8.50% Series preference stock require the Company to redeem 50,000 shares
annually beginning on July 1, 1997, at $100 per share.  The Company may, at
its option, redeem up to an additional 50,000 shares on each July 1, at $100
per share.  The 8.50% Series also is redeemable in whole or in part, at the
option of the Company, subject to certain restrictions on refunding, at a
redemption price of $106.80, $106.23 and $105.67 per share beginning July 1,
1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

     The mandatory sinking fund provisions of the 7.58% Series preference stock
require the Company to redeem 25,000 shares annually beginning on April 1,
2002, and each April 1 through 2006 and the remaining shares on April 1, 2007,
all at $100 per share.  The Company may, at its option, redeem up to an
additional 25,000 shares on each April 1 at $100 per share.  The 7.58% Series
also is redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, subject
to certain restrictions on refunding, at a redemption price of $106.06,
$105.31, and $104.55  per share beginning April 1, 1994, 1995, and 1996,
respectively.


13.  INCOME TAXES

     The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 109 in the first quarter of
1992.  KG&E adopted the provisions of SFAS 96 in 1987 and SFAS 109 in 1992. 
These statements require the Company to establish deferred tax assets and
liabilities, as appropriate, for all temporary differences, and to adjust
deferred tax balances to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect
during the periods the temporary differences reverse.

     In accordance with various rate orders received from the KCC and the OCC,
the Company has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a
significant portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities.  As management
believes it is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable
will be recovered from customers through future rates, it has recorded a
deferred asset for these amounts.  These assets are also a temporary
difference for which deferred income tax liabilities have been provided. 
Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations.
<PAGE>60
     At December 31, 1994, the Company has alternative minimum tax credits
generated prior to April 1, 1992, which carryforward without expiration, of
$41.2 million which may be used to offset future regular tax to the extent the
regular tax exceeds the alternative minimum tax.  These credits have been
applied in determining the Company's net deferred income tax liability and
corresponding deferred future income taxes at December 31, 1994.

     Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The
sources of these differences and their cumulative tax effects are as follows:

15.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
107:

     Cash and Cash Equivalents-
       The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short-term
       maturity of these investments.
     Decommissioning Trust-
       The fair value of the decommissioning trust is based on quoted market
       prices at December 31, 1994 and 1993.
     Variable-rate Debt-
       The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short-term
       variable rates of these debt instruments.
     Fixed-rate Debt-
       The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is based on the sum of the
       estimated value of each issue taking into consideration the interest
       rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.
     Redeemable Preference Stock-
       The fair value of the redeemable preference stock is based on the sum of
       the estimated value of each issue taking into consideration the dividend
       rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

                                   Carrying Value              Fair Value     
    December 31,                   1994       1993          1994       1993   
                                            (Dollars in Thousands)

      equivalents. . . . . . .  $   2,715  $    1,217    $   2,715  $    1,217
    Decommissioning trust. . .     16,944      13,204       16,633      13,929

     The fair value estimates presented herein are based on information
available as of December 31, 1994 and 1993.  These fair value estimates have
not been comprehensively revalued for the purpose of these financial
statements since that date, and current estimates of fair value may differ
significantly from the amounts presented herein.


16.  QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

     The amounts in the table are unaudited but, in the opinion of management,
contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods.  The
business of the Company is seasonal in nature and, in the opinion of
management, comparisons between the quarters of a year do not give a true
indication of overall trends and changes in operations.

                                  ARTICLE I.

Description of Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second
Series.

SECTION 1.
The thirty-first and thirty-second series of Bonds to be
executed, authenticated and delivered under and secured by the
Original Indenture shall be Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-
Second Series.  The Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second
Series shall be designated as ``First Mortgage Bonds, 7-1/2%
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding City of St. Marys Series Due
2032'' and ``First Mortgage Bonds, 7-1/2% Pollution Control
Revenue Refunding City of Wamego Series Due 2032,'' respectively,
of the Company.  The Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second
Series shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in
accordance with the provisions of, and shall in all respects be
subject to, all of the terms, conditions and covenants of the
Original Indenture, as amended, and subject to all the terms,
conditions and covenants of this Supplemental Indenture.

Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series shall each
mature April 15, 2032 and shall each bear interest at the rate of
seven and a half percent (7-1/2%) per annum payable on the
interest payment date for the St. Marys Refunding Bonds (as
defined below) commencing June 7, 1994, in the case of Bonds of
the Thirty-First Series, and the Wamego Refunding Bonds (as
defined below) commencing June 14, 1994, in the case of Bonds of
the Thirty-Second Series.  Every Bond of the Thirty-First and
Thirty-Second Series shall be dated the date of authentication
except that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 of
Article II of the Original Indenture, if any Bond of the Thirty-
First or Thirty Second Series shall be authenticated at any time
subsequent to the record date (as hereinafter in this Section
defined) for any interest payment date but prior to the day
following such interest payment date, it shall be dated as of the
day following such interest payment date, provided, however, that
if at the time of authentication of any Bond of the Thirty-First
or Thirty-Second Series interest shall be in default on any Bonds
of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series, such Bond shall be
dated as of the day following the interest payment date to which
interest has previously been paid in full or made available for
payment in full on outstanding Bonds of the Thirty-First or
Thirty-Second Series, as the case may be, or, if no interest has
been paid or made available for payment, as of the date of
initial authentication and delivery of such Bond.  Every Bond of
the Thirty-First Series shall bear interest from the interest
payment date for the St. Marys Refunding Bonds next preceding the
date thereof, unless such Bond of the Thirty-First Series shall
be dated prior to June 7, 1994, in which case it shall bear
interest from April 28, 1994.  Every Bond of the Thirty-Second
Series shall bear interest from the interest payment date with
respect to the Wamego Refunding Bonds next preceding the date
thereof, unless such Bond of the Thirty-Second Series shall be
dated prior to June 14, 1994, in which case it shall bear
interest from April 28, 1994.


The person in whose name any Bond of the Thirty-First or Thirty-
Second Series is registered at the close of business on any
record date with regard to any interest payment shall be entitled
to receive the interest payable thereon on such interest payment
date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Bond upon the
transfer or exchange thereof subsequent to such record date and
prior to the day following such interest payment date, unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such
interest payment date, in which case such defaulted interest
shall be paid to the person in whose name such Bond is registered
on the date of payment of such defaulted interest.  The term
``record date'' as used in this Section with regard to any
interest payment date shall mean the record date with respect to
the St. Marys Refunding Bonds (in the case of the Thirty-First
Series) or the Wamego Refunding Bonds (in the case of the Thirty-
Second Series) next preceding such interest payment date.  The
Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series shall be
payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest, in any
coin or currency of the United States of America which at the
time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts, at
the agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois.

All Bonds of the Thirty-First Series shall be pledged by the
Company with the St. Marys Trustee (as defined herein) to secure
the payment of the principal of, and up to 7-1/2% per annum of
the interest on the City of St. Marys, Kansas, Pollution Control
Revenue Refunding Bonds (Western Resources, Inc. Project) Series
1994 (referred to herein as the "St. Marys Refunding Bonds")
issued pursuant to the Indenture of Trust, dated as of April 15,
1994 (the "St. Marys Indenture"), from the City of St. Marys,

and in authorized denominations will be issued to the transferee
or transferees in exchange herefor; and this Bond, with or
without others of like form and series, may in like manner be
exchanged for one or more new registered Bonds of the same series
of other authorized denominations but of the same aggregate
principal amount; all upon payment of the charges and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or
premium, if any, or interest on this Bond, or for any claim based
hereon or on the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto,
against any incorporator, or against any stockholder, director or
officer, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any
predecessor or successor corporation, as such, either directly or
through the Company or any such predecessor or successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or
rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty
or otherwise, all such liability, whether at common law, in
equity, by any constitution, statute or otherwise, of
incorporators, stockholders, directors or officers being released
by every owner hereof by the acceptance of this Bond and as part
of the consideration for the issue hereof, and being likewise
released by the terms of the Indenture.

This Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the
Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid
or obligatory for any purpose, until Harris Trust and Savings
Bank, the Trustee under the Indenture, or a successor trustee
thereto under the Indenture, shall have signed the form of

                      ARTICLE II.

     Issue of Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series.

SECTION 1.   The total principal amount of Bonds of the Thirty-
First and Thirty-Second Series which may be authenticated and
delivered hereunder is not limited except as the Original
Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture limit the principal
amount of Bonds which may be issued thereunder.

SECTION 2.   Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series
for the aggregate principal amount of Forty-Five Million Dollars
($45,000,000) and Thirty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($30,500,000), respectively, may forthwith be executed by the

                                 ARTICLE III.

                                  Redemption.

SECTION 1.  Upon the redemption, in whole or in part, of the St.
Marys Refunding Bonds, Bonds of the Thirty-First Series shall be
redeemed in whole or in like part.  To effect the redemption of
Bonds of the Thirty-First Series, the St. Marys Trustee shall
deliver to the Trustee (and mail a copy thereof to the Company) a
written demand (hereinafter referred to as a ``St. Marys
Redemption Demand'') for the redemption of Bonds of the Thirty-
First Series equal in principal amount to the principal amount of
the St. Marys Refunding Bonds to be redeemed.  The St. Marys
Redemption Demand shall be signed by the President, a Vice
President, an Assistant Vice President or a Trust Officer of the
St. Marys Trustee and shall state: (1) the aggregate principal
amount of the St. Marys Refunding Bonds then outstanding under
the St. Marys Indenture; (2) the principal amount of the St.
Marys Refunding Bonds to be redeemed; (3) the interest thereon to
be payable on the redemption date; (4) the redemption date and
that notice thereof has been given as required in the St. Marys
Indenture; (5) in the case of an optional redemption of the St.
Marys Refunding Bonds, that the Company has informed the
St. Marys Trustee that the Company intends to deposit sufficient
available funds with the St. Marys Trustee pursuant to the St.
Marys Indenture to effect such redemption; and (6) that the
Trustee is thereby instructed to call for redemption Bonds of the
Thirty-First Series equal in principal amount to the principal
amount of the St. Marys Bonds specified in (2) above.  The St.
Marys Redemption Demand shall also contain a waiver of notice of
such redemption by the St. Marys Trustee, as holder of all Bonds
of the Thirty-First Series then outstanding.  The Trustee may
conclusively presume the statements contained in the St. Marys
Redemption Demand to be correct.

Except as provided in the next sentence, redemption of Bonds of
the Thirty-First Series shall be at the principal amount of the
Bonds to be redeemed, together with accrued interest to the
redemption date, and such amount shall become and be due and
payable on the redemption date.  In the event the St. Marys
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a Long-Term Interest Rate (as
defined in the St. Marys Indenture), the Bonds of the Thirty-
First Series will be redeemable as follows:  If the St. Marys
Refunding Bonds bear interest at the Long-Term MATES Rate (as
defined in the St. Marys Indenture), the Bonds of the Thirty-
First Series shall be redeemable at the same percentages of their
principal amount and during the same call periods as are
established under the St. Marys Indenture, plus accrued interest
to the date of redemption.  If, on the date the St. Marys
Refunding Bonds begin to bear a Long-Term Interest Rate
(``Effective Date''), the length of the Long-Term Interest Rate
Period falls within one of the entries in the Long-Term Interest
Rate Period column, the Bonds of the Thirty-First Series will not
be redeemable for the number of years after the Effective Date
shown in the No-call Period column.  After the No-call Period,
the Bonds of the Thirty-First Series may be redeemed at the
percentage of the principal amount shown in the Initial Premium
column.  The premium will decline every six months by one-half of
one percentage point until the Bonds of the Thirty-First Series
are redeemable without premium.

                1 year          2 years        1 year       100

The Company hereby covenants that it shall notify the Trustee no
later than thirty days after the date, if any, on which the St.
Marys Refunding Bonds commence bearing a Long-Term Interest Rate,
such notice to set forth the Long-Term Interest Rate Period then
in effect for the St. Marys Refunding Bonds; and of any change to
the redemption table if different from above.

The Company hereby covenants that if a St. Marys Redemption
Demand shall be delivered to the Trustee, the Company, except as
otherwise provided in Section 1 of Article I of this Supplemental
Indenture, will deposit, on or before the redemption date, with
the Trustee, in accordance with Article V of the Indenture, an
amount in cash sufficient to redeem the Bonds of the Thirty-First
Series so called for redemption.

SECTION 2.
Upon the redemption, in whole or in part, of the City of Wamego
Refunding Bonds, Bonds of the Thirty-Second Series shall be
redeemed in whole or in like part.  To effect the redemption of
Bonds of the Thirty-Second Series, the Wamego Trustee under the
Wamego Indenture shall deliver to the Trustee (and mail a copy
thereof to the Company) a written demand (hereinafter referred to
as a ``Wamego Redemption Demand'') for the redemption of Bonds of
the Thirty-Second Series equal in principal amount to the
principal amount of the Wamego Refunding Bonds to be redeemed. 
The Wamego Redemption Demand shall be signed by the President, a
Vice President, an Assistant Vice President or a Trust Officer of
the Wamego Trustee and shall state: (1) the aggregate principal
amount of the Wamego Refunding Bonds then outstanding under the
Wamego Indenture; (2) the principal amount of the Wamego
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed; (3) the interest thereon to be
payable on the redemption date; (4) the redemption date and that
notice thereof has been given as required in the Wamego
Indenture; (5) in the case of an optional redemption of the
Wamego Refunding Bonds, that the Company has informed the Wamego
Trustee that the Company intends to deposit sufficient available
funds with the Wamego Trustee pursuant to the Wamego Indenture to
effect such redemption; and (6) that the Trustee is thereby
instructed to call for redemption Bonds of the Thirty-Second
Series equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the
Wamego Refunding Bonds specified in (2) above.  The Wamego
Redemption Demand shall also contain a waiver of notice of such
redemption by the Wamego Trustee, as holder of all Bonds of the
Thirty-Second Series then outstanding.  The Trustee may
conclusively presume the statements contained in the Wamego
Redemption Demand to be correct.

Except as provided in the next sentence, redemption of Bonds of
the Thirty-Second Series shall be at the principal amount of the
Bonds to be redeemed, together with accrued interest to the
redemption date, and such amount shall become and be due and
payable on the redemption date.  In the event the Wamego
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a Long-Term Interest Rate (as
defined in the Wamego Indenture), the Bonds of the Thirty-Second
Series will be redeemable as follows:  If the Wamego Refunding
Bonds bear interest at the Long-Term MATES Rate (as defined in
the Wamego Indenture), the Bonds of the Thirty-Second Series
shall be redeemable at the same percentages of their principal
amount and during the same call periods as are established under
the Wamego Indenture, plus accrued interest to the date of
redemption.  If, on the date the Wamego Refunding Bonds begin to
bear a Long-Term Interest Rate (``Effective Date''), the length
of the Long-Term Interest Rate Period falls within one of the
entries in the Long-Term Interest Rate Period column, the Bonds
of the Thirty-Second Series will not be redeemable for the number
of years after the Effective Date shown in the No-call Period
column.  After the No-call Period, the Bonds may be redeemed at
the percentage of the principal amount shown in the Initial
Premium column.  The premium will decline every six months by
one-half of one percentage point until the Bonds of the Thirty-
Second Series are redeemable without premium.

              1 year          2 years        1 year       100

The Company hereby covenants that it shall notify the Trustee no
later than thirty days after the date, if any, on which the
Wamego Refunding Bonds commence bearing a Long-Term Interest
Rate, such notice to set forth the Long-Term Interest Rate Period
then in effect for the Wamego Refunding Bonds; and of any change
to the redemption table if different from above.

The Company hereby covenants that if a Wamego Redemption Demand
shall be delivered to the Trustee, the Company, except as
otherwise provided in Section 1 of Article I of this Supplemental
Indenture, will deposit, on or before the redemption date, with
the Trustee, in  accordance with Article V of the Indenture, an
amount in cash sufficient to redeem the Bonds of the Thirty-

Indenture, from time to time prior to maturity subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 1 and Section 2, respectively, of
this Article II.

SECTION 4.
The provisions of Article V of the Original Indenture shall be
applicable to redemptions of Bonds of the Thirty-First and
Thirty-Second Series pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 or 2

redemption of Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series
pursuant to such Section 1 or 2, an election to redeem shall be
made in the manner provided in such Section 1 or 2, respectively,
and notice of redemption shall be given or waived as provided in
such Section 1 or 2, respectively.  The principal amount of Bonds
of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series to be redeemed on any
partial redemption shall be an authorized denomination thereof.

SECTION 5.
Any Bonds of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series redeemed
pursuant to Section 1 or 2 of this Article III are hereby
expressly permitted to be used as refundable Bonds for the
execution, authentication and delivery of additional Bonds
pursuant to Section 6 of Article III of the Original Indenture.

SECTION 6.
Any written notice to the Trustee from the St. Marys Trustee or
the Wamego Trustee shall be signed by an officer of the St. Marys

authorized by such purpose.

                                    ARTICLE IV.

                                 Additional Covenants.

The Company hereby covenants, warrants and agrees:

That the Company is lawfully seized and possessed of all of the
mortgaged property described in the granting clauses of this
Supplemental Indenture; that it has good, right and lawful
authority to mortgage the same as provided in this Supplemental
Indenture; and that such mortgaged property is, at the actual
date of the initial issue of the Bonds of the Thirty-First and
Thirty-Second Series, free and clear of any deed of trust,

released as an entirety from the lien of the Original Indenture,
the Company will, at any time or from time to time within six
months after the date of such release, retire Bonds outstanding
under the Original Indenture in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the lesser of


(a)the fair value of the gas properties so released
pursuant to Section 3 of Article VII of the Original
Indenture, as stated in the engineer's certificate
required by Section 3(b) of said Article VII, and the
proceeds of the gas properties so released pursuant to
Section 5 of said Article VII, less the amount of moneys,
deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 3(d), 4(d)
and 5 of said Article VII on such release, withdrawn or
reduced pursuant to Section 1 of Article VIII of the
Original Indenture simultaneously with or within three
months after such release; or

          Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($175,000) for
          each full year (disregarding any period less than a

          on the date of such release, less One Million Seven
          Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,700,000), or

          (ii)One-half of the fair value of the gas properties
          so released, as stated in the engineer's certificate
          required by Section 3(b) of Article VII of the
          Original Indenture, and one-half of the proceeds of
          the gas properties so released pursuant to Section 5
          of said Article VII.

Such retirement of Bonds shall be effected in either one or
both of the following methods:

(aa)By the withdrawal pursuant to Section 2 of Article
VIII of the Original Indenture of any moneys deposited
with the Trustee pursuant to Sections 3(d), 4(d) and 5 of
Article VII of the Original Indenture upon such release;
or

(bb)By causing the Trustee to purchase or redeem bonds,

Indenture, out of any moneys deposited with the Trustee
pursuant to Sections 3(d), 4(d) and 5 of Article VII of
the Original Indenture upon such release.

SECTION 3.
So long as any Bonds of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series
are outstanding, in the event all or substantially all of the
electric properties shall have been released as an entirety from
the lien of the Original Indenture, the Company will, at any time
or from time to time within six months after the date of such
release, retire Bonds outstanding under the Original Indenture in
an aggregate principal amount equal to the fair value of the
electric properties so released pursuant to Section 3 of Article
VII of the Original Indenture, as stated in the engineer's
certificate required by Section 3(b) of said Article VII, and the
proceeds of the electric properties so released pursuant to

The Bonds to be so retired shall include a principal amount of
Bonds of each Series then outstanding in the same ratio to the
aggregate principal amount of all Bonds so retired as the
aggregate principal amount of all Bonds of each Series
outstanding immediately prior to such release bears to the total
principal amount of all Bonds then outstanding.

SECTION 4.
Subject to the provisions of the fourth and fifth paragraphs of
Section 1 of Article I of this Supplemental Indenture, the

SECTION 1.
So long as any of the Bonds of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second
Series shall remain outstanding:

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 of Article III of
the Original Indenture, no Bonds shall be authenticated and
delivered pursuant to the provisions of Article III of the
Original Indenture and issued upon the basis of net bondable
value of property additions for an aggregate principal amount in
excess of sixty percent (60%) of the net bondable value of
property additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien.

For the purposes of Subsections (e) and (f) of the definition of
``net bondable value of property additions not subject to an
unfunded prior lien'', contained in Article I of the Original
Indenture, and Subdivisions 8 and 9 of clause (a) of Section 4 of
Article III of the Original Indenture, in all computations made
with respect to a period subsequent to April 1, 1949, the
deductions therein referred to shall in each case be ten-sixths
(10/6ths) of the respective amounts mentioned, in lieu of ten-
sevenths (10/7ths).

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(a) of Article
VIII of the Original Indenture, no moneys received by the Trustee
pursuant to Section 5(a) of Article III of the Original Indenture
shall be paid over by the Trustee in an amount in excess of sixty
percent (60%) of the net bondable value of property additions not
subject to an unfunded prior lien, and for the purposes of
Section 3 of Article VII of the Original Indenture, the amount of
cash required to be deposited by the Company pursuant to
Subsection (d) of said Section 3 of Article VII, shall not be
reduced in an amount in excess of sixty percent (60%) of the net
bondable value of property additions not subject to an unfunded
prior lien.

(3) For the purposes of clauses (c) and (d) of the definition of
``net bondable value of property additions subject to an unfunded
prior lien'', contained in Article I of the Original Indenture,
and Subsection 7 of clause (a) of Section 4 of Article III of the
Original Indenture, in all computations made with respect to a
period subsequent to April 1, 1949, the deductions therein
referred to shall in each case be ten-sixths (10/6ths) of the
respective amounts mentioned, in lieu of ten-sevenths (10/7ths).

(4) Subsection (a) of Section 14, clauses (1) and (2) of
Subsection (a) of Section 16 of Article IV and clause (1) of
Subsection (b) of Section 1 of Article XII of the Original
Indenture shall be deemed amended by substituting the words
``sixty percent (60%)'' for ``seventy percent (70%)'' where they
appear in said provisions of the Original Indenture.

(5) The definition of the term ``net earnings available for
interest, depreciation and property retirement'', as contained in
Article I of the Original Indenture, shall be deemed to mean the
net earnings of the Company ascertained as follows:

(a) The total operating revenues of the Company and the
net non-operating revenues of the properties of the
Company shall be ascertained.

(b) From the total, determined as provided in Subsection
(a), there shall be deducted all operating expenses,
including all salaries, rentals, insurance, license and
franchise fees, expenditures for repairs and maintenance,
taxes (other than income, excess profits and other taxes
measured by or dependent on net taxable income),
depreciation as shown on the books of the Company or an
amount equal to the minimum provision for depreciation as
hereinafter defined, whichever is greater, but excluding
all property retirement appropriations, all interest and
sinking fund charges, amortization of stock and debt
discount and expense or premium and further excluding any
charges to income or otherwise for the amortization of
plant or property accounts or of amounts transferred
therefrom.

(c) The balance remaining after the deduction of the total
amount computed pursuant to Subsection (b) from the total
amount computed pursuant to Subsection (a) shall
constitute the ``net earnings of the Company available for
interest'', provided that not more than fifteen percent
(15%) of the net earnings of the Company available for
interest may consist of the aggregate of (i) net non-
operating income, (ii) net earnings from mortgaged
property other than property of the character of property
additions and (iii) net earnings from property not subject
to the lien of this Indenture.

(d) No income received or accrued by the Company from
securities and no profits or losses from the sale of
capital assets shall be included in making the
computations aforesaid.

(e) In case the Company shall have acquired any acquired
plant or systems or shall have been consolidated or merged
with any other corporation, within or after the particular
period for which the calculation of net earnings of the
Company available for interest, depreciation and property
retirement is made, then, in computing the net earnings of
the Company available for interest, depreciation and
property retirement, there may be included, to the extent
they may not have been otherwise included, the net
earnings or net losses of such acquired plant or system or
of such other corporation, as the case may be, for the
whole of such period.  The net earnings or net losses of
such property additions, or of such other corporation for
the period preceding such acquisition or such
consolidation or merger, shall be ascertained and computed
as provided in the foregoing subsections of this
definition as if such acquired plant or system had been
owned by the Company during the whole of such period, or
as if such other corporation had been consolidated or
merged with the Company prior to the first day of such
period.

(f) In case the Company shall have obtained the release of
any property pursuant to Section 3 of Article VII of the
Original Indenture, of a fair value in excess of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), as shown by the
engineer's certificate required by said Section 3, or
shall have obtained the release of any property pursuant
to Section 5 of Article VII of the Original Indenture, the
proceeds of which shall have exceeded Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000), within or after the
particular period for which the calculation of net
earnings of the Company available for interest,
depreciation and property retirement is made, then, in
computing the net earnings of the Company available for
interest, depreciation and property retirement, the net
earnings or net losses of such property for the whole of
such period shall be excluded to the extent practicable on
the basis of actual earnings and expenses of such property
or on the basis of such estimates of the earnings and
expenses of such property as the signers of an officers'
certificate filed with the Trustee pursuant to Section
3(b) of Article III or Section 16 of Article IV of the
Original Indenture shall deem proper.

The term ``minimum charge for depreciation'' as used
herein shall mean an amount equal to (a) fifteen percent
(15%) of the total operating revenues of the Company after
deducting therefrom an amount equal to the aggregate cost
to the Company of electric energy, gas and water purchased
for resale to others and rentals paid for, or other
payments made for the use of, property owned by others and
leased to or operated by the Company, the maintenance of
which and depreciation on which are borne by the owners,
less (b) an amount equal to the expenditures for
maintenance and repairs to the plants and property of the
Company and included or reflected in its operating expense
accounts.

The terms ``net earnings of property available for
interest, depreciation and property retirement'' and ``net
earnings of another corporation available for interest,
depreciation and property retirement'' as contained in
Article I of the Original Indenture, when used with
respect to any property or with respect to another
corporation, shall mean the net earnings of such property
or the net earnings of such other corporation, as the case
may be, computed in the manner provided in Subsections
(a), (b), (c) and (d) hereof.

(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of
subsection (b) of Article III, and Subsection (b) of Section 14
of Article IV, and Subsection (b) of Section 16 of Article IV and
clause (2) of Subsection (b) of Section 1 of Article XII of the
Original Indenture, the computation of net earnings required
therein shall be made as provided in Subsection (5) of this
Section 1, and the net earnings tests required in said mentioned
provisions of Articles III, IV and XII of the Original Indenture
shall be based on two times the annual interest charges described
in such provisions, instead of two and one-half times such
charges, but shall not otherwise affect such provisions or
relieve from the requirements therein pertaining to ten percent
(10%) of the principal amount of bonds therein described.

SECTION 2.
All of the Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series and
of any series initially issued after the initial issuance of
Bonds of the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Series shall, from
time to time, be executed on behalf of the Company by its
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer or
one of its Vice Presidents whose signature, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 12 of Article II of the Original Indenture,
may be by facsimile, and its corporate seal (which may be in
facsimile) shall be thereunto affixed and attested by its
Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries whose signature,
notwithstanding the provisions of the aforesaid Section 12, may
be by facsimile.

In case any of the officers who have signed or sealed any of the
Bonds of the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series or of any
series initially issued after the initial issuance of Bonds of
the Thirty-First or Thirty-Second Series manually or by facsimile
shall cease to be such officers of the Company before such Bonds
so signed and sealed shall have been actually authenticated by
the Trustee or delivered by the Company, such Bonds nevertheless
may be authenticated, issued and delivered with the same force
and effect as though the person or persons who so signed or
sealed such Bonds had not ceased to be such officer or officers
of the Company; and also any such Bonds may be signed or sealed
by manual or facsimile signature on behalf of the Company by such
persons as at the actual date of the execution of any of such
Bonds shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at
the nominal date of any such Bond any such person shall not have
been such officer of the Company.

SECTION 3.
The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate
action, but without consent or other action by holders of bonds
of any series created after June 1, 1975, to make such amendments
to the Original Indenture, as supplemented, as shall be necessary
in order to amend Article XV thereof so as to substitute ``sixty
percent (60%)'' for ``eighty percent (80%)'' wherever appearing
in said Article XV.

SECTION 4.
The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate
action, but without any consent or other action by holders of
bonds of any series created after June 1, 1975, to make such
amendments to the Original Indenture, as supplemented, as shall
be necessary in order to amend Article XV thereof by adding
thereto a Section 9 to read as follows:

``SECTION 9.
(A) Anything in this Article XV contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall receive the written consent
(in any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
bondholders or by their attorneys appointed in writing) of the
holders of sixty per centum (60%) or more in principal amount of
the bonds outstanding hereunder, and, if the rights of one or
more, but less than all, series of bonds then outstanding are to
be affected by action taken pursuant to such consent, then also
by consent of the holders of at least sixty per centum (60%) in
principal amount of each series of bonds so to be affected and
outstanding hereunder (at the time the last such needed consent
is delivered to the Trustee) in lieu of the holding of a meeting
pursuant to this Article XV and in lieu of all action at such a
meeting and with the same force and effect as a resolution duly
adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of this
Article XV.

``(B)Instruments of consent shall be witnessed or in the
alternative may (a) have the signature guaranteed by a bank or
trust company or a registered dealer in securities, (b) be
acknowledged before a Notary Public or other officer authorized
to take acknowledgements, or (c) have their genuineness otherwise
established to the satisfaction of the Trustee.

``The amount of bonds payable to bearer, and the series and
serial numbers thereof, held by a person executing an instrument
of consent (or whose attorney has executed an instrument of
consent in his behalf), and the date of his holding the same, may
be proved by exhibiting the bonds to and obtaining a certificate
executed by (i) any bank or trust or insurance company, or (ii)
any trustee, secretary, administrator or other proper officer of
any pension, welfare, hospitalization or similar fund or funds,
or (iii) the United States of America, any Territory thereof, the
District of Columbia, any State of the United States, any
municipality in any State of the United States or any public
instrumentality of the United States, or of any State or of any
Territory or (iv) any other person or corporation satisfactory to
the Trustee.  A bondholder in any of the foregoing categories may
sign a certificate in his own behalf.

``Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state, in
effect, that, as of the date thereof, a coupon bond or bonds
bearing a specified serial number or numbers was deposited with
or exhibited to the signer of such certificate.  The holding by
the person named in any such certificate of any bond specified
therein shall be presumed to continue unless (1) any certificate
bearing a later date issued in respect of the same bond shall be
produced, (2) the bond specified in such certificate (or any bond
or bonds issued in exchange or substitution for such bond) shall
be produced by another holder, or (3) the bond specified in such
certificate shall be registered as to principal in the name of
another holder or shall have been surrendered in exchange for a
fully registered bond registered in the name of another holder. 
The Trustee may nevertheless, in its discretion, require further
proof in cases where it deems further proof desirable.  The
ownership of registered bonds shall be proved by the registry
books.

``(C) Until such time as the Trustee shall receive the written
consent of the necessary per centum in principal amount of the
bonds required by the provisions of Subsection (A) above for
action contemplated by such consent, any holder of a bond, the
serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included in
the bonds the holders of which have consented to such action,
may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its principal
office and upon proof of holding as provided in Subsection (B)
above, revoke such consent so far as it concerns such bond. 
Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any
bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon
all future holders of such bond (and any bond issued in lieu
thereof or exchanged therefor), irrespective of whether or not
any notation of such consent is made upon such bond, and in any
event any action taken by the holders of the percentage in
aggregate principal amount of the bonds specified in Subsection
(A) above in connection with such action shall be conclusively
binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the
bonds.''

                                    ARTICLE VI.

                              Miscellaneous Provisions.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS


ACQUISITION AND MERGER

    On March 31, 1992, Western Resources, Inc. (formerly The Kansas Power and
Light Company) (Western Resources) through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA), acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KG&E) for $454 million in cash and
23,479,380 shares of Western Resources common stock (the Merger).  Western
Resources also paid approximately $20 million in costs to complete the Merger. 
Simultaneously,  KCA and Kansas Gas and Electric Company merged and adopted
the name Kansas Gas and Electric Company (the Company, KG&E).

    Additional information relating to the Merger can be found in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements.

    
GENERAL

    The Company is an electric public utility engaged in the generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in the southeastern
quarter of Kansas including the Wichita metropolitan area.  The Company owns
47 percent of Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, the operating company
for Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  Corporate headquarters of the
Company is located in Wichita, Kansas.  The Company has no gas properties.  At
December 31, 1994, the Company had no employees.  All employees are provided
by Western Resources.

    For discussion regarding competition in the electric utility industry and
the potential impact on the Company, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Other Information,
Competition included herein.
 
    The Company's business is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak
period occurring during the summer.  Approximately one-third of residential
kilowatthour sales occur in the third quarter.  Accordingly, earnings and
revenue information for any quarterly period should not be considered as a
basis for estimating results of operations for a full year.

    Discussion of other factors affecting the Company are set forth in the
Notes to Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis
included herein.


ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

General

    The Company supplies electric energy at retail to approximately 272,000
customers in 139 communities in Kansas.  The Company also supplies electric
energy to 27 communities and 1 rural electric cooperative, and has contracts
for the sale, purchase or exchange of electricity with other utilities at
wholesale.

Capacity

    The aggregate net generating capacity of the Company's system is presently
2,498 megawatts (MW).  The system comprises interests in twelve fossil fueled
steam generating units, one nuclear generating unit (47 percent interest) and
one diesel generator, located at seven generating stations.  One of the twelve
fossil fueled units has been "mothballed" for future use (see Item 2.
Properties).

    The Company's 1994 peak system net load occurred on July 1, 1994 and
amounted to 1,747 MW.  The Company's net generating capacity together with
power available from firm interchange and purchase contracts, provided a
capacity margin of approximately 27 percent above system peak responsibility
at the time of the peak.

    The Company and ten companies in Kansas and western Missouri have agreed
to provide capacity (including margin), emergency and economy services for
each other.  This arrangement is called the MOKAN Power Pool.  The pool
participants also coordinate the planning of electric generating and
transmission facilities.

    The Company is one of 47 members of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP).  SPP's
responsibility is to maintain system reliability on a regional basis.  The
region encompasses areas within the eight states of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.

    In 1994, the Company joined the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP).  Under
this arrangement, over 50 electric utilities and marketers throughout the
western 
<PAGE> 5

United States have agreed to market energy and to provide transmission
services.  WSPP's intent is to increase the efficiency of the interconnected
power systems operations over and above existing operations.  Services
available include short-term and long-term economy energy transactions, unit
commitment service, firm capacity and energy sales, energy exchanges, and
transmission service by intermediate systems.

    During 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Midwest Energy,
Inc. (MWE), whereby the Company will provide MWE with peaking capacity of 61
megawatts through the year 2008.  The Company also entered into an agreement
with Empire District Electric Company (Empire), whereby the Company will
provide Empire with peaking and base load capacity (20 megawatts in 1994
increasing to 80 megawatts in 2000) through the year 2000.

Future Capacity

    The Company does not contemplate any significant expenditures in
connection with construction of any major generating facilities through the
turn of the century (see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis,
Liquidity and Capital Resources).  The Company has capacity available which
may not be fully utilized by growth in customer demand for at least 5 years. 
The Company continues to market this capacity and energy to other utilities.

Fuel Mix

    The Company's coal-fired units comprise 1,101 MW of the total 2,498 MW of
generating capacity and the Company's nuclear unit provides 545 MW of
capacity.  Of the remaining 852 MW of generating capacity, units that can burn
either natural gas or oil account for 849 MW, and the remaining unit which
burns only diesel fuel accounts for 3 MW (see Item 2. Properties).

    During 1994, low sulfur coal was used to produce 56% of the Company's
electricity.  Nuclear produced 34 percent and the remainder was produced from
natural gas, oil, or diesel fuel.  During 1995, based on the Company's
estimate of the availability of fuel, coal will to be used to produce
approximately 58 percent of the Company's electricity and nuclear will be used
to produce 36 percent.

    The Company's fuel mix fluctuates with the operation of nuclear powered
Wolf Creek which has an 18-month refueling and maintenance schedule.  The 18-
month schedule permits uninterrupted operation every third calendar year.  In
mid-September 1994, Wolf Creek was taken off-line for its seventh refueling
and maintenance outage.  The refueling outage took approximately 47 days to
complete, during which time electric demand was met primarily by the Company's
coal-fired generating units.  There is no refueling outage scheduled for 1995.

Nuclear

    The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract 63 percent of the
uranium required for operation of Wolf Creek through the year 2001.  The
balance is expected to be obtained through spot market and contract purchases.

    Contractual arrangements are in place for 100 percent of Wolf Creek's
uranium enrichment requirements for 1995-1997, 90 percent for 1998-1999, 95
percent for 
<PAGE> 6
2000-2001 and 100 percent for 2005-2014.  The balance of the 1998-2004
requirements is expected to be obtained through a combination of spot market
and contract purchases.  The decision not to contract for the full enrichment
requirements is one of cost rather than availability of service.

    Contractual arrangements are in place for the conversion of uranium to
uranium hexafluoride sufficient to meet Wolf Creek's requirements through 1996
as well as the fabrication of fuel assemblies to meet Wolf Creek's
requirements through 2012.

    The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established schedules, guidelines and
responsibilities for the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop and construct
repositories for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. 
The DOE has not yet constructed a high-level waste disposal site and has
announced that a permanent storage facility may not be in operation prior to
2010 although an interim storage facility may be available earlier.  Wolf
Creek contains an on-site  spent fuel storage facility  which, under  current 
regulatory  guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The Company
believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained, as necessary.

    The Company along with the other co-owners of Wolf Creek are among 14
companies that filed a lawsuit on June 20, 1994, seeking an interpretation of
the DOE's obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal in
1998.  The DOE has filed a motion to have this case dismissed.  The issue to
be decided in this case is whether DOE must begin accepting spent fuel in 1998
or at a future date.
 
Coal

    The three coal-fired units at Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) have an
aggregate capacity of 423 MW (KG&E's 20 percent share) (see Item 2.
Properties).  Western Resources, the operator of JEC, and KG&E, have a long-
term coal supply contract with Amax Coal West, Inc. (AMAX), a subsidiary of
Cyprus Amax Coal Company, to supply low sulfur coal to JEC from AMAX's Eagle
Butte Mine or an alternate mine source of AMAX's Belle Ayr Mine, both located
in the Powder River Basin in Campbell County, Wyoming.  The contract expires
December 31, 2020.  The contract contains a schedule of minimum annual
delivery quantities based on MMBtu provisions.  The coal to be supplied is
surface mined and has an average Btu content of approximately 8,300 Btu per
pound and an average sulfur content of .43 lbs/MMBtu (see Environmental
Matters).  The average delivered cost of coal for JEC was approximately $1.13
per MMBtu or $18.55 per ton during 1994.

    Coal is transported by Western Resources from Wyoming under a long-term
rail transportation contract with Burlington Northern (BN) and Union Pacific
(UP) to JEC through December 31, 2013.  Rates are based on net load carrying
capabilities of each rail car.  Western Resources provides 890 aluminum rail
cars, under a 20 year lease, to transport coal to JEC.

    The two coal-fired units at La Cygne Station have an aggregate generating
capacity of 678 MW (KG&E's 50 percent share) (see Item 2.  Properties).  The
operator, Kansas City Power & Light  Company (KCPL), maintains coal contracts
as discussed in the following paragraphs.

<PAGE> 7
    La Cygne 1 uses low sulfur Powder River Basin coal which is supplied under
a variety of spot market transactions, discussed below.  Illinois or
Kansas/Missouri coal is blended with the Powder River Basin coal and is
secured from time to time under spot market arrangements.  La Cygne 1 uses a
blend of 85 percent Powder River Basin coal.

    La Cygne 2 and additional La Cygne 1 Powder River Basin coal is supplied
through several contracts expiring at various times through 1998.  This low
sulfur coal had an average Btu content of approximately 8,500 Btu per pound
and a maximum sulfur content of .50 lbs/MMBtu (see Environmental Matters). 
For 1994, KCPL secured Powder River Basin coal from two sources; Carter Mining
Company's Caballo Mine, a subsidiary of Exxon Coal USA; and Caballo Rojo Inc's
Caballo Rojo Mine, a subsidiary of Drummond Inc.  Transportation is covered by
KCPL through its Omnibus Rail Transportation Agreement with BN and Kansas City
Southern Railroad through December 31, 1995.  An alternative rail
transportation agreement with Western Railroad Property, Inc. (WRPI), a
partnership between UP and Chicago Northwestern (CNW), lasts through December
31, 1995.  A new five-year coal transportation agreement is being negotiated
to provide transportation beyond 1995.

    During 1994, the average delivered cost of all coal procured for La Cygne
1 was approximately $0.78 per MMBtu or $14.11 per ton and the average
delivered cost of Powder River Basin coal for La Cygne 2 was approximately
$0.73 per MMBtu or $12.30 per ton.

Natural Gas

    The Company uses natural gas as a primary fuel in its Gordon Evans and
Murray Gill Energy Centers.  Natural gas for these generating stations is
supplied under a firm contract that runs through 1995 by Kansas Gas Supply
(KGS).  After 1995, the Company expects to use the spot market to purchase
most of the natural gas needed to fuel these generating stations.  Short-term
economical spot market purchases from the Williams Natural Gas (WNG) system
provide the Company flexible natural gas supply arrangements to meet
operational needs.

Oil

    The Company uses oil as an alternate fuel when economical or when
interruptions to natural gas make it necessary.  Oil is also used as a
supplemental fuel at each of the coal plants.  All oil burned by the Company
during the past several years has been obtained by spot market purchases.  At
December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately 715 thousand gallons of No. 2
oil and 11 million gallons of No. 6 oil which is believed to be sufficient to
meet emergency requirements and protect against lack of availability of
natural gas and/or the loss of a large generating unit.

Other Fuel Matters

    The Company's contracts to supply fuel for its coal- and natural gas-fired
generating units, with the exception of JEC, do not provide full fuel
requirements at the various stations.  Supplemental fuel is procured on the
spot market to provide operational flexibility and, when the price is
favorable, to take advantage of economic opportunities.

<PAGE> 8
    On March 26, 1992, in connection with the Merger, the Kansas Corporation
Commission (KCC) approved the elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause
(ECA) for most Kansas retail customers of the Company effective April 1, 1992. 
The provisions for fuel costs included in base rates were established at a
level intended by the KCC to equal the projected average cost of fuel through
August 1995 and to include recovery of costs provided by previously issued
orders relating to coal contract settlements and storm damage recovery.  Any
increase or decrease in fuel costs from the projected average will impact the
Company's earnings.

    Set forth in the table below is information relating to the weighted
average cost of fuel used by the Company.

Environmental Matters

    The Company currently holds all Federal and State  environmental approvals
required for the operation of its generating units.  The Company believes it
is presently in substantial compliance with all air quality regulations
(including those pertaining to particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and oxides
of nitrogen (NOx)) promulgated by the State of Kansas and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

    The Federal sulfur dioxide  standards  applicable to the Company's JEC and
La Cygne 2 units, prohibit the emission of more than 1.2 pounds of sulfur
dioxide per million Btu of heat input.  Federal particulate matter emission
standards applicable to these units prohibit:  (1) the emission of more than
0.1 pounds of particulate matter per million Btu of heat input and (2) an
opacity greater than 20 percent.  Federal NOx emission standards applicable to
these units prohibit the emission of more than 0.7 pounds of NOx per million
Btu of heat input.

    The JEC and La Cygne 2 units have met:  (1) the sulfur dioxide standards
through the use of low sulfur coal (see Coal); (2) the particulate matter
standards through the use of electrostatic precipitators; and (3) the NOx
standards through boiler design and operating procedures.  The JEC units are
also equipped with flue gas scrubbers providing additional sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter emission reduction capability.

    The Kansas Department of Health and Environment regulations, applicable to
the Company's other generating facilities, prohibit the emission of more than
3.0 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million Btu of heat input at the Company's
generating units.  The Company has sufficient low sulfur coal under contract
(see Coal) to allow compliance with such limits at La Cygne 1.  All facilities
burning coal are equipped with flue gas scrubbers and/or electrostatic
precipitators.

    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a two-phase
reduction in sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions effective in 1995 and 2000 and a
probable 
<PAGE> 9
reduction in toxic emissions.  To meet the monitoring and reporting
requirements under the acid rain program, the Company installed continuous
monitoring and reporting equipment at a total cost of approximately $2.3
million.  The Company does not expect additional equipment to reduce sulfur
emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although the Company currently has
no Phase I affected units, the owners have applied for an early substitution
permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Generating Station under the Phase I
regulations.  
    The NOx and toxic limits, which were not set in the law, will be specified
in future EPA regulations.  NOx regulations for Phase II units and Phase I
group 2 units are mandated in the Act.  The EPA's proposed NOx regulations
were ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in November 1994, and until such time as the EPA resubmits new
proposed regulations, the Company will be unable to determine its compliance
options or related compliance costs.

    All of the Company's generating facilities are in substantial compliance
with the Best Practicable Technology and Best Available Technology regulations
issued by EPA pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1977.  Most EPA regulations
are administered in Kansas by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

    Additional information with respect to Environmental Matters is discussed
in Note 3 of the Notes to Financial Statements.


FINANCING

    The Company's ability to issue additional debt is restricted under
limitations imposed by the Mortgage and Deed of Trust of the Company.

    The Company's mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from
being issued (except in connection with certain refundings) unless the
Company's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement
and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15
months preceding the issuance are not less than two and one-half times the
annual interest charges on, or 10% of the principal amount of, all first
mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. 
Based on the Company's results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1994,
approximately $743 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds
could be issued (8.75 percent interest rate assumed).

    KG&E bonds may be issued, subject to the restrictions in the preceding
paragraph, on the basis of property additions not subject to an unfunded prior
lien and on the basis of bonds which have been retired.  As of December 31,
1994, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of net bondable property
additions not subject to an unfunded prior lien entitling the Company to issue
up to $909 million principal amount of additional bonds.


REGULATION AND RATES

    The Company is subject as an operating electric utility to the
jurisdiction of the KCC which has general regulatory authority over the
Company's rates, extensions and abandonments of service and facilities,
valuation of property, the classification of accounts and various other
matters.  The Company is also 
<PAGE> 10
subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the KCC with respect to the
issuance of the Company's securities.

    Additionally, the Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC,
including jurisdiction as to rates with respect to sales of electricity for
resale, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as to nuclear plant operations
and safety.

    Additional information with respect to Regulation and Rates is discussed

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


FINANCIAL CONDITION

    The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the nine months ended December 31, 1992, included herein, refer to the
Company following the merger with Western Resources, Inc. (formerly The Kansas
Power and Light Company) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, KCA Corporation,
on March 31,
1992 (the Merger) (see Note 1).

    Pro forma results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31,
1992 presented herein, give effect to the Merger as if it occurred on January
1, 1992 and were derived by combining the historical information for the three
month period ended March 31, 1992 and the nine month period ended December 31,
1992.  Additional information relating to changes between years is provided in
the Notes to Financial Statements.

    GENERAL:  The Company had net income of $104.5 million for 1994 compared
to net income of $108.1 million in 1993.  The decrease in net income is
primarily due to increases in income taxes as a result of the completion of
the accelerated amortization of certain deferred income tax reserves and the
receipt of death benefit proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies
in the third quarter of 1993.  As of December 31, 1993, the Company had fully
amortized the deferred income tax reserves related to the allowance for funds
used during construction capitalized for Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf
Creek).  The completion of the amortization of these deferred income tax
reserves increased income tax expense and thereby reduced net income by
approximately $12 million in 1994, and in the future will reduce net income by
this same amount each year.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:  The Company's liquidity is a function of
its ongoing construction program, designed to improve facilities which provide
electric service and meet future customer service requirements.

    During 1994, construction expenditures for the Company's electric system
were approximately $69 million and nuclear fuel expenditures were
approximately $21 million.  It is projected that adequate capacity margins
will be maintained through the turn of the century.  The construction program
is focused on providing service to new customers and improving present
electric facilities.

    Capital expenditures for 1995 through 1997 are anticipated to be as
follows:

                                    Electric       Nuclear Fuel  
                                     (Dollars in Thousands)
            1995. . . . . . . . . .  $53,961         $ 21,400
            1996. . . . . . . . . .   47,388            8,100
            1997. . . . . . . . . .   42,453           24,000

    These expenditures are estimates prepared for planning purposes and are
subject to revisions from time to time.
<PAGE> 15

    The Company's net cash flows to capital expenditures exceeded 100 percent
for 1994 and during the last five years has also averaged in excess of 100
percent.  The Company anticipates all of its cash requirements for capital
expenditures through 1997 will be provided from net cash flows.  The Company
also has $16 million of bonds maturing through 1999 which will be provided
from internal and external sources available under then existing financial
conditions.

    During 1994, the Company continued to take advantage of favorable long-
term interest rates by refinancing long-term debt issues.  The embedded cost
of long-term debt was 7.3% at December 31, 1994, a decrease from 7.7% at
December 31, 1993.

    On January 20, 1994, the Company issued $100 million of First Mortgage
Bonds, 6.20% Series due January 15, 2006.  The net proceeds were used to
reduce short-term debt.  

    On February, 17, 1994, the Company refinanced the City of La Cygne,
Kansas, 5 3/4% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 1973,
$13,980,000 principal amount, with 5.10% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding
Bonds Series 1994, $13,982,500 principal amount, due 2023.

    On April 28, 1994, three series of Market-Adjusted Tax Exempt Securities
totalling $46.4 million were sold on behalf of the Company at a rate of 2.95%
for the initial auction period.  The interest rates are being reset
periodically via an auction process.  As of December 31, 1994, the rate on
these bonds was 4.10%.  The net proceeds from the new issues, together with
available cash, were used to refund three series of Pollution Control Bonds
totalling $46.4 million bearing interest rates between 5 7/8% and 6.8%.

    On November 1, 1994, the Company terminated a long-term agreement which
contained provisions for the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled
revenues, and phase-in revenues (see Note 6).

    In 1986, the Company purchased corporate-owned life insurance policies
(COLI) on certain of its employees.  The annual cash outflow for the premiums
on these policies from 1992 through 1994 was approximately $27 million.  See
Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information on the
accumulated cash surrender value.  The borrowings are expected to produce
annual cash inflows, net of expenses, through the remaining life of the
policies.  Borrowings against the policies will be repaid from death proceeds.

    The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied, as needed,
through short-term bank loans and borrowings under other unsecured lines of
credit maintained with banks.  At December 31, 1994, short-term borrowings
amounted to $50 million compared to $155.8 million at December 31, 1993.  The
decrease is primarily the result of the issuance of the $100 million of bonds
on January 20, 1994 (see Note 5).

    The KG&E common and preferred stock was redeemed in connection with the
Merger, leaving 1,000 shares of common stock held by Western Resources.  The
debt structure of the Company and available sources of funds were not affected
by the Merger.
<PAGE> 16

    The Company's capital structure at December 31, 1994, was 64 percent
common stock equity and 36 percent long-term debt. The capital structure at
December 31, 1994, including short-term debt was 62 percent common stock
equity and 38 percent debt. As of December 31, 1994, the Company's bonds were
rated "A3" by Moody's Investors Service, "A-" by Standard & Poor's Ratings
Group, and "A-" by Fitch Investors Service.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    
    The following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year
results in revenues, operating expenses, other income and deductions, and
interest charges.  Additional information relating to changes between years is
provided in the Notes to Financial Statements.


    REVENUES  

    The operating revenues of the Company are based on sales volumes and rates
authorized by the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Rates charged for the sale and delivery of
electricity are designed to recover the cost of service and allow investors a
fair rate of return.  Future electric sales will continue to be affected by
weather conditions, competition from other generating sources, competing fuel
sources, customer conservation efforts and the overall economy of the
Company's service area.

    The KCC order approving the Merger provided a moratorium on increases,
with certain exceptions, in the Company's electric rates until August 1995. 
The KCC ordered refunds totalling $32 million to the combined companies'
(Western Resources and the Company) customers to share with customers the
Merger-related cost savings achieved during the moratorium period.  Refunds of
approximately $4.9 (Company's portion) million were made in April 1992 and
December 1993 and the remaining refund of approximately $8.7 million
(Company's portion) was made in September 1994 (see Note 1).

    On March 26, 1992, in connection with the Merger, the KCC approved the
elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause (ECA) for most retail
customers of the Company effective April 1, 1992.  The fuel costs are now
included in base rates and were established at a level intended by the KCC to
equal the projected average cost of fuel through August 1995.  Any increase or
decrease in fuel costs from the projected average will impact the Company's
earnings.

    1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating revenues for 1994 of $619.9
million increased less than one percent from revenues of $617.0 million for
1993.  The increase can be attributed to higher revenues in all retail
customer classes.  While residential sales remained virtually unchanged,
commercial and industrial sales increased over two percent during 1994. 
Partially offsetting these increases was a 21 percent decrease in wholesale
and interchange sales as a result of higher than normal sales in 1993 to other
utilities while their generating units were down due to the flooding of 1993.
<PAGE> 17

    1993 Compared to 1992:  Total operating revenues increased $62.7 million
or 11 percent in 1993 compared to 1992 pro forma revenues.  The increase is
due to the return of near normal temperatures during 1993 compared to
unusually mild winter and summer temperatures in 1992.  All customer classes
experienced increased sales volumes during 1993. The number of cooling degree
days recorded for the city of Wichita were 1,546 for 1993, a 23 percent
increase from 1992.  Contributing to the increase in wholesale sales were
sales to neighboring utilities to meet peak demand periods while those
utilities' units were down as a result of the summer flooding.

    Partially offsetting these increases in revenues was the amortization of
the Merger-related refund.


    OPERATING EXPENSES

    1994 Compared to 1993:  Total operating expenses for 1994 of $470.9
million increased slightly from total operating expenses of $469.6 million for
1993.  Federal and state income taxes increased $13.5 million and maintenance
expense increased three percent primarily as a result of the major boiler
overhaul of the Company's coal fired La Cygne 1 generating station.

    The increase in income tax expense was due to the completion at December
31, 1993, of the accelerated amortization of deferred income tax reserves
related to the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction
capitalized for Wolf Creek.  The completion of the amortization of these
deferred income tax reserves increased income tax expense and thereby reduced
net income by approximately $12 million in 1994, and in the future will reduce
net income by this same amount each year.

    Partially offsetting the increases in total operating expenses were lower
fuel costs, due to decreased electric generation during 1994, and lower other
operations expense.

    1993 Compared to 1992:  Total operating expenses increased $45.5 million
or 11 percent in 1993 compared to 1992.  Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased $21.4 million or 23 percent primarily due to increased generation
resulting from increased customer demand for electricity during the summer
peak season.  Federal and state income taxes increased $28.6 million primarily
as a result of higher net income.  General taxes increased $4.8 million
primarily due to an increase in plant, the property tax assessment ratio, and
higher mill levies.

    Partially offsetting these increases in total operating expenses was a
decrease in other operations expense of $10.1 million primarily as a result of
merger-related savings for the entire year of 1993 and reduced net lease
expense for La Cygne 2 resulting from refinancing of the secured facility
bonds (see Note 7) compared to pro forma operating expenses of 1992.
<PAGE> 18

    OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS:  Other income and deductions, net of taxes,
decreased significantly in 1994 compared to 1993 primarily as a result of
increased interest expense on higher COLI borrowings.  Interest on COLI
borrowings increased $9.1 million in 1994 compared to 1993.  Also contributing
to the decrease was the receipt of death benefit proceeds from COLI policies
in the third quarter of 1993.

    Other income and deductions, net of taxes, increased slightly in 1993
compared to 1992 due to the increased cash surrender values of COLI policies
and the receipt of death benefit proceeds.  Partially offsetting these
increases was higher interest expense on COLI borrowings.

    INTEREST CHARGES:  Interest charges decreased 12 percent in 1994 compared
to 1993 primarily as a result of the refinancing of higher cost fixed-rate
debt.  Also accounting for the decrease was the impact of increased COLI
borrowings which reduce the need for other long-term debt and thereby reduced
interest expense.  COLI interest is reflected in Other Income and Deductions
on the Income Statement.  The Company's embedded cost of long-term debt
decreased to 7.3% at December 31, 1994 compared to 7.7% and 7.8% at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Interest charges decreased $12.4 million in 1993 compared to 1992 as the
Company continued to take advantage of lower interest rates on variable-rate
and fixed-rate debt by retiring and refinancing higher cost debt.  

    MERGER IMPLEMENTATION:  In accordance with the KCC Merger order,
amortization of the acquisition adjustment will commence August 1995.  The
amortization will amount to approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per year for
40 years.  Western Resources and the Company (combined companies) can recover
the amortization of the acquisition adjustment through cost savings under a
sharing mechanism approved by the KCC as described in Note 1 of the Notes to
the Financial Statements.  While the combined companies have achieved savings
from the Merger, there is no assurance that the savings achieved will be
sufficient to, or the cost savings sharing mechanism will operate as to, fully
offset the amortization of the acquisition adjustment. 


OTHER INFORMATION

    INFLATION:  Under the ratemaking procedures prescribed by the regulatory
commissions to which the Company is subject, only the original cost of plant
is recoverable in revenues as depreciation.  Therefore, because of inflation,
present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for purposes of
maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareholders and the
related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property.  The impact of this
ratemaking process on common shareholders is mitigated to the extent
depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of
less purchasing power.  While the Company has experienced relatively low
inflation in the recent past, the cumulative effect of inflation on operating
costs may require the Company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these
higher costs.

    ENVIRONMENTAL:  The Company has taken a proactive position with respect to
the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas
sites and has an agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment (KDHE) to systematically evaluate these sites (see Note 3).
<PAGE> 19

    Although the Company currently has no Phase I affected units under the
Clean Air Act of 1990, the Company has applied for an early substitution
permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under the Phase I guidelines. 
The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and air toxic limits, which were not set in law,
will be specified in future Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. 
The EPA's proposed NOx regulations were ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November 1994, and until such
time as the EPA resubmits new proposed regulations, the Company will be unable
to determine its compliance options or related compliance costs (see Note 3).

    COMPETITION:  As a regulated utility, the Company currently has limited
direct competition for retail electric service in its certified service area. 
However, there is competition, based largely on price, from the generation, or
potential generation, of electricity by large commercial and industrial
customers, and independent power producers.

    The 1992 Energy Policy Act (Act) requires increased efficiency of energy
usage and has effected the way electricity is marketed.  The Act also provides
for increased competition in the wholesale electric market by permitting the
FERC to order third party access to utilities' transmission systems and by
liberalizing the rules for ownership of generating facilities.  As part of the
Merger, the Company agreed to open access of its transmission system for
wholesale transactions.  During 1994, wholesale revenues represented less than
seven percent of the Company's total revenues.

    Operating in this competitive environment could place pressure on utility
profit margins and credit quality.  Wholesale and industrial customers may
threaten to pursue cogeneration, self-generation, retail wheeling,
municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to
obtain reduced energy costs.  Increasing competition has resulted in credit
rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit
rating determinations.

    The Company is providing reduced electric rates for industrial expansion
projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain and
increase electric load.  In 1994, The Boeing Company announced it would
develop its 777 jetliner in Wichita and Cessna Aircraft Company announced it
would build a production plant in Independence, Kansas along with expanding
its Wichita facilities, with an addition of 2,000 jobs.

    In order to retain its current electric load, the Company has and will
continue to negotiate with some of its larger industrial customers, who are
able to develop cogeneration facilities, for long term contracts although some
negotiated rates may result in reduced margins for the Company.  During 1996,
the Company will lose a major industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in
a reduction to pre-tax earnings of approximately $7 to $8 million.  This
customer's decision to develop its own cogeneration project was based
partially on factors other than energy cost.

                                NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                              

1.  ACQUISITION AND MERGER

    On March 31, 1992, Western Resources, Inc. (formerly The Kansas Power and
Light Company) (Western Resources) through its wholly-owned subsidiary KCA
Corporation (KCA), acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock
of Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KG&E) for $454 million in cash and
23,479,380 shares of Western Resources common stock (the Merger).  Western
Resources also paid $20 million in costs to complete the Merger.  The total
cost of the acquisition to Western Resources was $1.066 billion. 
Simultaneously, KCA and KG&E merged and adopted the name of Kansas Gas and
Electric Company.  The Merger was accounted for as a purchase.  For income tax
purposes the tax basis of the Company's assets was not changed by the Merger. 
In the accompanying statements, KG&E prior to the Merger is labeled as the
"Predecessor" and after the Merger as the "Successor".  Throughout the notes
to financial statements, the "Company, KG&E" refers to both Predecessor and
Successor.  

    As Western Resources acquired 100% of the common and preferred stock of
KG&E, the Company recorded an acquisition premium of $490 million on the
balance sheet for the difference in purchase price and book value and
increased common stock equity to reflect the new cost basis of Western
Resources' investment in the Company.  This acquisition premium and related
income tax requirement of $311 million under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109) have been classified as plant acquisition
adjustment in electric plant in service on the balance sheets.  Under the
provisions of the order of the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), the
acquisition premium is recorded as an acquisition adjustment and not allocated
to the other assets and liabilities of the Company.

    The pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 1992 in the
accompanying financial statements gives effect to the Merger as if it occurred
on January 1, 1992, and was derived by combining the historical information
for the three month period ended March 31, 1992 and the nine month period
ended December 31, 1992.  No purchase accounting adjustments were made for
periods prior to the Merger in determining pro forma amounts, other than the
elimination of preferred dividends, because such adjustments would be
immaterial. This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations that would have occurred had the Merger been consummated
on January 1, 1992, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating
results or financial position.

    In the November 1991 KCC order approving the Merger, a mechanism was
approved to share equally between the shareholders and ratepayers the cost
savings generated by the Merger in excess of the revenue requirement needed to
allow recovery of the amortization of a portion of the acquisition adjustment,
including income tax, calculated on the basis of a purchase price of KG&E's
common stock at $29.50 per share.  The order provides an amortization period
for the acquisition adjustment of 40 years commencing in August 1995, at which
time the full amount of cost savings is expected to have been implemented. 
Merger savings will be measured by application of an inflation index to
certain pre-merger operating and maintenance costs at the time of the next
Kansas rate case.  While Western Resources and the Company (combined
companies) have achieved savings from the Merger, there is no assurance that 
the savings achieved will be sufficient to, or the cost savings sharing 
<PAGE> 30

mechanism will operate as to fully offset the amortization of the acquisition
adjustment.  The order further provides a moratorium on increases, with
certain exceptions, in the Company's Kansas electric rates until August 1995. 
The KCC ordered refunds totalling $32 million to the combined companies'
customers to share with customers the Merger-related cost savings achieved
during the moratorium period.  Refunds of approximately $4.9 (Company's share)
million for the Company were made in April 1992 and December 1993 and the
remaining refund of approximately $8.7 (Company's share )million was made in
September 1994.

    The KCC order approving the Merger required the legal reorganization of
the Company so that it was no longer held as a separate subsidiary after
January 1, 1995, unless good cause was shown why such separate existence
should be maintained.  The Securities and Exchange Commission order relating
to the Merger granted Western Resources an exemption under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act (PUHCA) until January 1, 1995.  Western Resources has been
granted regulatory approval from the KCC which eliminates the requirement for
a combination.  As a result of the sales of Western Resources' Missouri
Properties, Western Resources is now exempt from regulation as a holding
company under Section 3(a)(1) of the PUHCA.


2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    General:  The  financial statements of KG&E include, through March 31,
1992, its 80% owned subsidiary, CIC Systems, Inc. (CIC).  In April 1992, the
Company disposed of its 80% interest in CIC.  KG&E owns 47 percent of Wolf
Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC), the operating company for Wolf
Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  The Company records its proportionate
share of all transactions of WCNOC as it does other jointly-owned facilities. 
The accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated public utilities.  The
accounting and rates of the Company are subject to requirements of the KCC and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

    Utility Plant:  Utility plant (including plant acquisition adjustment) is
stated at cost.  For constructed plant, cost includes contracted services,
direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering, supervision,
general and administrative costs, and an allowance for funds used during
construction (AFUDC).  The AFUDC rate was 4.07% for 1994, 4.41% for 1993,
6.51% for the nine months ended December 31, 1992, and 6.70%  for the three
months ended March 31, 1992.  The cost of additions to utility plant and
replacement units of property is capitalized.  Maintenance costs and
replacement of minor items of property are charged to expense as incurred. 
When units of depreciable property are retired, they are removed from the
plant accounts and the original cost plus removal charges less salvage are
charged to accumulated depreciation.

    Depreciation:  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based
on estimated useful lives of property.  Composite provisions for book
depreciation approximated 2.7% during 1994, 2.9% during 1993, 2.9% during the
nine months ended December 31, 1992, and 3.0% during the three months ended
March 31, 1992 of the average original cost of depreciable property.  
<PAGE> 31 

    Cash and Cash Equivalents:  For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid
collateralized debt instruments purchased with maturities of three months or
less. 

    Income Taxes:  Income tax expense includes provisions for income taxes
currently payable and deferred income taxes calculated in conformance with
income tax laws, regulatory orders and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109) (see Note 9).

    Investment tax credits previously deferred are being amortized to income
over the life of the property which gave rise to the credits.

    Revenues:  Operating revenues include amounts actually billed for
services rendered and an accrual of estimated unbilled revenues.  Unbilled
revenues represent the estimated amount customers will be billed for service
provided from the time meters were last read to the end of the accounting
period.  Unbilled revenues of $21.4 and $22.3 million at December 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively, are recorded as a component of accounts receivable on the
balance sheets.  At December 31, 1993, certain amounts of unbilled revenues
were sold (see Note 6).

    The Company had reserves for doubtful accounts receivable of $1.9 and
$3.0 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    Fuel Costs:  The cost of nuclear fuel in process of refinement,
conversion, enrichment, and fabrication is recorded as an asset at original
cost and is amortized to expense based upon the quantity of heat produced for
the generation of electricity.  The accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel
in the reactor at December 31, 1994 and 1993, was $13.6 and $17.4 million,
respectively.

    Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Contracts:  The following amounts
related to corporate-owned life insurance contracts (COLI), primarily with one
highly rated major insurance company, are recorded on the balance sheets:
                                                                
                                                 1994         1993 
                                               (Dollars in Millions)      
       Cash surrender value of contracts. . .   $320.6       $269.0
       Borrowings against contracts . . . . .    311.2       (269.0)
                                                ------       ------
           COLI (net) . . . . . . . . . . . .   $  9.4       $  0.0
                                                ======       ======
    The COLI borrowings will be repaid upon receipt of proceeds from death
benefits under contracts.  The Company recognizes increases in the cash
surrender value of contracts, resulting from premiums and investment earnings
on a tax free basis, and the tax deductible interest on the COLI borrowings in
Corporate-owned Life Insurance (net) on the Statements of Income.  Interest
expense included in corporate-owned life insurance (net) on the statements of
income was $21.0 million for 1994, $11.9 million for 1993, $5.3 million for
the nine months ended December 31, 1992, and $1.9 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1992.

to conform with classifications used in the current year presentation.


3.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    Manufactured Gas Sites:  The Company was previously associated with six
former manufactured gas sites which contain coal tar and other potentially
harmful materials.  The Company and the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment (KDHE) conducted preliminary assessments of these sites at minimal
cost.  The results of the preliminary investigations determined the Company
does not have a connection to two of the sites.

    The Company and KDHE entered into a consent agreement governing all
future work at the four remaining sites.  The terms of the consent agreement
will allow the Company to investigate these sites and set remediation
priorities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. 
The prioritized sites will be investigated over a 10 year period.  The
agreement will allow the Company to set mutual objectives with the KDHE in
order to expedite effective response activities and to control costs and
environmental impact.  The Company is aware of other utilities in Region VII
of the EPA (Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa) which have incurred
remediation costs for such sites ranging between $500,000 and $10 million,
depending on the site and that the KCC has permitted another Kansas utility to
recover its remediation costs through rates.  To the extent that such
remediation costs are not recovered through rates, the costs could be material
to the Company's financial position or results of operations depending on the
degree of remediation and number of years over which the remediation must be
completed.

    Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal:  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982,
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the ultimate storage
and disposal of spent nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors.  Under a
contract with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the Company pays a
quarterly fee to DOE of one mill per kilowatthour on net nuclear generation. 
These fees are included as part of nuclear fuel expense and amounted to $3.8
million for 1994, $3.5 million for 1993, $1.6 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 1992, and $.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
1992.

    The Company along with the other co-owners of Wolf Creek are among 14
companies that filed a lawsuit on June 20, 1994, seeking an interpretation of
the DOE's obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal in
1998.  The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires DOE ultimately to accept
and dispose of nuclear utilities' spent fuel.  The DOE has filed a motion to
have this case dismissed.  The issue to be decided in this case is whether DOE
must begin accepting spent fuel in 1998 or at a future date.  Wolf Creek
contains an on-site spent fuel storage facility which, under current
regulatory guidelines, provides space for the storage of spent fuel through
the year 2006 while still maintaining full core off-load capability.  The
Company believes adequate additional storage space can be obtained as
necessary.
<PAGE> 33

    Decommissioning:  On June 9, 1994, the KCC issued an order approving the
decommissioning costs of the 1993 Wolf Creek Decommissioning Cost Study which
estimates the Company's share of Wolf Creek decommissioning costs, under the
immediate dismantlement method, to be approximately $595 million primarily
during the period from 2025 through 2033, or approximately $174 million in
1993 dollars.  These costs were calculated using an assumed inflation rate of
3.45% over the remaining service life, in 1993, of 32 years.

    Decommissioning costs are being charged to operating expenses in
accordance with the KCC order.  Electric rates charged to customers provide
for recovery of these decommissioning costs over the life of Wolf Creek. 
Amounts so expensed ($3.5 million in 1994 increasing annually to $5.5 million
in 2024) and earnings on trust fund assets are deposited in an external trust
fund.  The assumed return on trust assets is 5.9%.

    The Company's investment in the decommissioning fund, including
reinvested earnings was $16.9 million and $13.2 million at December 31, 1994
and December 31, 1993, respectively.  These amounts are reflected in
Decommissioning Trust, and the related liability is included in Deferred
Credits and Other Liabilities, Other, on the Balance Sheets.
    
    The Company carries $118 million in premature decommissioning insurance. 
The insurance coverage has several restrictions.  One of these is that it can
only be used if Wolf Creek incurs an accident exceeding $500 million in
expenses to safely stabilize the reactor, to decontaminate the reactor and
reactor station site in accordance with a plan approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to pay for on-site property damages.  If the
amount designated as decommissioning insurance is needed to implement the
NRC-approved plan for stabilization and decontamination, it would not be
available for decommissioning purposes.

    Nuclear Insurance:  The Price-Anderson Act limits the combined public
liability of the owners of nuclear power plants to $8.9 billion for a single
nuclear incident.  The Wolf Creek owners (Owners) have purchased the maximum
available private insurance of $200 million and the balance is provided by an
assessment plan mandated by the NRC.  Under this plan, the Owners are jointly
and severally subject to a retrospective assessment of up to $79.3 million
($37.3 million, Company's share) in the event there is a major nuclear
incident involving any of the nation's licensed reactors.  This assessment is
subject to an inflation adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and
applicable premium taxes.  There is a limitation of $10 million ($4.7 million,
Company's share) in retrospective assessments per incident per year.
    
    The Owners carry decontamination liability, premature decommissioning
liability, and property damage insurance for Wolf Creek totalling
approximately $2.8 billion ($1.3 billion, Company's share).  This insurance is
provided by a combination of "nuclear insurance pools" ($500 million) and
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) ($2.3 billion).  In the event of an
accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and
site decontamination.  The Company's share of any remaining proceeds can be
used for property damage up to $1.2 billion (Company's share) and premature
decommissioning costs up to $118 million (Company's share) in excess of funds
previously collected for decommissioning (as discussed under
"Decommissioning").
<PAGE> 34

    The Owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to cover costs of
replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage
resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If losses incurred
at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL policies exceed premiums,
reserves, and other NEIL resources, the Company may be subject to
retrospective assessments of approximately $13 million per year.

    Although the Company maintains various insurance policies to provide
coverage for potential losses or liabilities resulting from an accident or
extended outage, the Company's insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover
the costs that could result from a major accident or extended outage at Wolf
Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent not
recoverable through rates, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position and results of operations.

    Clean Air Act:  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require a
two-phase reduction in sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions
effective in 1995 and 2000 and a probable reduction in toxic emissions.  To
meet the monitoring and reporting requirements under the acid rain program,
the Company installed continuous monitoring and reporting equipment at a total
cost of approximately $2.3 million.  The Company does not expect additional
equipment to reduce sulfur emissions to be necessary under Phase II.  Although
the Company currently has no Phase I affected units, the owners have applied
for an early substitution permit to bring the co-owned La Cygne Station under
the Phase I regulations.

    The NOx and air toxic limits, which were not set in the law, will be
specified in future EPA regulations.  The EPA's proposed NOx regulations were
ruled invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in November 1994, and until such time as the EPA resubmits new
proposed regulations, the Company will be unable to determine its compliance
options or related compliance costs.

    Federal Income Taxes:  During 1991, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
completed an examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the
years 1984 through 1988.  In April 1992, the Company received the examination
report and upon review filed a written protest in August 1992.  In October
1993, the Company received another examination report for the years 1989 and
1990 covering the same issues identified in the previous examination report. 
Upon review of this report, the Company filed a written protest in November
1993.  The most significant proposed adjustments reduce the depreciable basis
of certain assets and investment tax credits generated.  Management believes
there are significant questions regarding the theory, computations, and
sampling techniques used by the IRS to arrive at its proposed adjustments, and
also believes any additional tax expense incurred or loss of investment tax
credits will not be material to the Company's financial position and results
of operations.  Additional income tax payments, if any, are expected to be
offset by investment tax credit carryforwards, alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards, or deferred tax provisions.
                                                                
    Fuel Commitments:  To supply a portion of the fuel requirements for its
generating plants, the Company has entered into various commitments to obtain
nuclear fuel, coal, and natural gas.  Some of these contracts contain
provisions for price escalation and minimum purchase commitments.  At
December 31, 1994, WCNOC's nuclear fuel commitments (Company's share) were 
<PAGE> 35

approximately $12.6 million for uranium concentrates expiring at various times
through 1997, $122.9 million for enrichment expiring at various times through
2014, and $56.5 million for fabrication through 2012.  At December 31, 1994,
the Company's coal and natural gas contract commitments in 1994 dollars under
the remaining term of the contracts are $721 million and $9 million,
respectively.  The largest coal contract was renegotiated in early 1993 and
expires in 2020 with the remaining coal contracts expiring at various times
through 2013.  The majority of natural gas contracts expire in 1995 with
automatic one-year extension provisions.  In the normal course of business,
additional commitments and spot market purchases will be made to obtain
adequate fuel supplies.

    Energy Act:  As part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, a special assessment
is being collected from utilities for a uranium enrichment decontamination and
decommissioning fund.  The Company's portion of the assessment for Wolf Creek
is approximately $7 million, payable over 15 years.  Management expects such
costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process.


4.  RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION

    Elimination of the Energy Cost Adjustment Clause (ECA):  On March 26,
1992, in connection with the Merger, the KCC approved the elimination of the
ECA for most retail customers effective April 1, 1992.  The provisions for
fuel costs included in base rates were established at a level intended by the
KCC to equal the projected average cost of fuel through August 1995, and to
include recovery of costs provided by previously issued orders relating to
coal contract settlements and storm damage recovery discussed below.  Any
increase or decrease in fuel costs from the projected average will impact the
Company's earnings.

    Rate Stabilization Plan:  In 1988, the KCC issued an order requiring that
the accrual of phase-in revenues be discontinued effective December 31, 1988. 
Effective January 1, 1989, the Company began amortizing the phase-in revenue
asset on a straight-line basis over 9-1/2 years.  At December 31, 1994
approximately $61 million of deferred phase-in revenues remained on the
Balance Sheet.

    Coal Contract Settlements:  In March 1990, the KCC issued an order
allowing the Company to defer its share of a 1989 coal contract settlement
with the Pittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Company amounting to $22.5 million. 
This amount was recorded as a deferred charge on the balance sheets.  The
settlement resulted in the termination of a long-term coal contract.  The KCC
permitted the Company to recover this settlement as follows:  76% of the
settlement plus a return over the remaining term of the terminated contract
(through 2002) and 24% to be amortized to expense with a deferred return
equivalent to the carrying cost of the asset.  Approximately $18 million of
this deferral remains on the balance sheet at December 31, 1994.

    In February 1991, the Company paid $8.5 million to settle a coal contract
lawsuit with AMAX Coal Company and recorded the payment as a deferred charge
on the Company's Balance Sheet.  In July 1991, the KCC approved the recovery
of the settlement plus a return equivalent to the carrying cost of the asset,
over the remaining term of the terminated contract (through 1996).

5.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

    The Company's short-term financing requirements are satisfied through
short-term bank loans and uncommitted loan participation agreements.  Maximum
short-term borrowings outstanding during 1994 and 1993 were $172.3 million on
January 4, 1994 and $175.8 million on December 14, 1993.  The weighted average
interest rates, including fees, were 4.5% for 1994, 3.5% for 1993, 6.4% for
the nine months ended December 31, 1992, and 7.1% for the three months ended
March 31, 1992.

  
6.  LONG-TERM DEBT

    The amount of first mortgage bonds authorized by the KG&E Mortgage and
Deed of Trust (Mortgage) dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented, is limited to a
maximum of $2 billion.  Amounts of additional bonds which may be issued are
subject to property, earnings, and certain restrictive provisions of the
Mortgage.  Electric plant is subject to the lien of the Mortgage except for
transportation equipment.  
    Debt discount and expenses are being amortized over the remaining lives
of each issue.  The improvement and maintenance fund requirements for certain
first mortgage bond series can be met by bonding additional property.  The
sinking fund requirements for certain pollution control series bonds can be
met only through the acquisition and retirement of outstanding bonds.  

    On November 1, 1994, the Company terminated a long-term agreement which
contained provisions for the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues
(receivables) and phase-in revenues up to a total of $180 million.  Amounts
related to receivables were accounted for as sales while those related to
phase-in revenues were accounted for as collateralized borrowings.  At
December 31, 1993, outstanding receivables amounting to $56.8 million, were
considered sold under the agreement.  The weighted average interest rate,
including fees, on this agreement was 4.6% for 1994, 3.7% for 1993, 6.6% for
the nine months ended December 31, 1992, and 7.9% for the three months ended
March 31, 1992.


7.  SALE-LEASEBACK OF LA CYGNE 2

    In 1987, the Company sold and leased back its 50 percent undivided
interest in the La Cygne 2 generating unit.  The lease has an initial term of
29 years, with various options to renew the lease or repurchase the 50 percent
undivided interest.  The Company remains responsible for its share of
operation and maintenance costs and other related operating costs of La Cygne
2.  The lease is an operating lease for financial reporting purposes.

    As permitted under the lease agreement, the Company in 1992 requested the
Trustee Lessor to refinance  $341.1 million of secured facility bonds of the
Trustee and owner of La Cygne 2.  The transaction was requested to reduce
recurring future net lease expense. In connection with the refinancing on
September 29, 1992, a one-time payment of approximately $27 million was made
by the Company which has been deferred and is being amortized over the
remaining life of the lease and included in operating expense as part of the
future lease expense.  At December 31, 1994, approximately $24.8 million of
this deferral remained on the Balance Sheet.
<PAGE> 37

    Future minimum annual lease payments required under the lease agreement
are approximately $34.6 million for each year through 1999 and $680 million
over the remainder of the lease.

    The gain of approximately $322 million realized at the date of the sale
has been deferred for financial reporting purposes, and is being amortized
over the initial lease term in proportion to the related lease expense.  The
Company's lease expense, net of amortization of the deferred gain and a one-
time payment, was approximately $22.5 million for 1994 and 1993, $20.6 million
for the nine months ended December 31, 1992, and $7.5 million for the three
months ended March 31, 1992.


8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
                                                                
    Pension:  The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension
plans covering substantially all employees of the Company prior to the Merger. 
Pension benefits are based on years of service and the employee's compensation
during the five highest paid consecutive years out of ten before retirement. 
The Company's 
policy is to fund pension costs accrued, subject to limitations set by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code.

    The following table provides information on the components of pension
cost for the Company's pension plans (dollars in millions):

    Retirement and Voluntary Separation Plans:  In January 1992, the Board of
Directors approved an early retirement plan and a voluntary separation
program.  The voluntary early retirement plan was offered to all vested
participants of the Company's defined benefit pension plan who reached the age
of 55 with 10 or more years of service on or before May 1, 1992.  Certain
pension plan improvements were made including a waiver of the actuarial
reduction factors for early retirement and a cash incentive payable as a
monthly supplement up to 60 months or a lump sum payment.  Of the 111
employees eligible for the early retirement option, 71, representing 6% of the
Company's work force, elected to retire on or before the May 1, 1992,
deadline.  Another 29 employees, with 10 or more years of service, elected to
participate in the voluntary separation program.  In addition, 61 employees
received Merger-related severance benefits.  The actuarial cost, based on plan
provisions for early retirement and voluntary separation programs, and Merger-
related severance benefits, was approximately $3.9 million of which $1.8
million was included in the pension liability at December 31, 1992.  The
actuarial cost was considered in purchase accounting for the Merger (See Note
1).                                                        

    Postretirement:  Western Resources adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106) in the first quarter of
1993.  This statement requires the accrual of postretirement benefits other
than pensions, primarily medical benefits costs, during the years an employee
provides service.
  
    Based on actuarial projections and adoption of the transition method of
implementation which allows a 20-year amortization of the accumulated benefit
obligation, the annual expense to be allocated to the Company under SFAS 106
was approximately $3.8 million in 1994 and $3.4 million in 1993.  The
Company's total obligation to be allocated from Western Resources was
approximately $25.3 million and $23.9 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  To mitigate the impact of SFAS 106 expense, Western Resources
implemented programs to reduce health care costs.  In addition, the KCC issued
an order permitting the initial deferral of SFAS 106 expense.  To mitigate the
impact SFAS 106 expense will have on rate increases, Western Resources will
include in the future computation of SFAS 106 expense allocated to the Company
for computation of cost of service and
<PAGE> 39
expense recognition, the actual SFAS 106 expense and an income stream
generated from corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLI) purchased in
1993 and 1992.  To the extent SFAS 106 expense exceeds income from the COLI
program, this excess will be deferred (as allowed by FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 92-12) and offset by income generated through the deferral
period by the COLI program.  Should the income stream generated by the COLI
program not be sufficient to offset the deferred SFAS 106 expense, the KCC
order allows recovery of such deficit through the ratemaking process by the
Company. 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106 the Company's policy was to recognize
expenses as claims were paid.  The costs of benefits were $0.8 million for the
nine months ended December 31, 1992 and $0.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1992.

    The following table summarizes the status of the Company's postretirement
plans for financial statement purposes and the related amount included in the
balance sheet:

    Assumptions:

      Expected rate of return. . . . . . . . . . . .       8.5  %      8.5 % 

    For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost growth rate of 12%
was assumed for 1994, decreasing 1% per year to 5% by 2001 and thereafter. 
The health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the projected
benefit obligation.  Increasing the trend rate by 1% each year would increase
the present value of the accumulated projected benefit obligation by $.3
million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components by
$26,000.

    Savings Plans:  Effective January 1, 1995, the Company's 401(k) savings
plans were merged with Western Resources savings plans.  Prior to the merger
of the savings plans, funds of the plans were deposited with a trustee and
invested at each employee's option in one or more investment funds, including
a Western Resources common stock fund.  The Company's contributions were $1.8
million for 1994, $2.0 million for 1993, $1.7 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 1992, and $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
1992.

9.  INCOME TAXES

    The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96
(SFAS 96) in 1987.  This statement required the Company to establish deferred
tax assets and liabilities, as appropriate, for all temporary differences, and
to adjust deferred tax balances to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be
in effect during the periods the temporary differences reverse.  SFAS 96 was
superseded by SFAS 109 issued in February 1992 and the Company adopted the
provisions of that standard prospectively in the first quarter of 1992.  The
accounting for SFAS 109 is substantially the same as SFAS 96.  

    In accordance with various rate orders received from the KCC, the Company
has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a significant
portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities.  As management believes it
is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable will be
recovered from customers through future rates, it has recorded a deferred
asset for these amounts.  These assets are also a temporary difference for
which deferred income tax liabilities have been provided.  Accordingly, the
adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a material effect on the Company's results
of operations.

    At December 31, 1994, the Company has alternative minimum tax credits
generated prior to April 1, 1992, which carryforward without expiration, of
$41.2 million which may be used to offset future regular tax to the extent the
regular tax exceeds the alternative minimum tax.  These credits have been
applied in determining the Company's net deferred income tax liability and
corresponding deferred future income taxes at December 31, 1994.

    Beginning April 1, 1992, the Company is part of the consolidated income
tax return of Western Resources.  However, the Company determines its income
tax provisions on a separate company basis.

    Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. 
The sources of these differences and their cumulative tax effects are as
follows:

10.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company is involved in various legal and environmental proceedings. 
Management believes that adequate provision has been made within the financial
statements for these matters and accordingly believes their ultimate
dispositions will not have a material adverse effect upon the financial
position or results of operations of the Company.


11.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107:

    Cash and Cash Equivalents-
       The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short-
       term maturity of these investments.
    Decommissioning Trust-
       The fair value of the decommissioning trust is based on quoted market
       prices at December 31, 1994 and 1993.
    Variable-rate Debt-
       The carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short-
       term variable rates of these debt instruments.
    Fixed-rate Debt-
       The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is based on the sum of the
       estimated value of each issue taking into consideration the coupon
       rate, maturity, and redemption provisions of each issue.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

of operating expenses of the plants in service above, as well as such expenses
for a 50 percent undivided interest in La Cygne 2 (representing 335 MW
capacity) sold and leased back to the Company in 1987, are included in
operating expenses in the Statements of Income.  The Company's share of other
transactions associated with the plants is included in the appropriate
classification in the Company's financial statements.

13.  QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATISTICS (Unaudited)
     (Dollars in Thousands)

    The amounts in the table are unaudited but, in the opinion of management,
contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods.  The
business of the Company is seasonal in nature and, in the opinion of
management, comparisons between the quarters of a year do not give a true
indication of overall trends and changes in operations.

14.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

    Subsequent to the Merger, the cash management function, including cash
receipts and disbursements, for KG&E has been assumed by Western Resources. 
As a result, the proceeds of cash collections, including short-term
borrowings, less disbursements related to KG&E transactions have been recorded
by the Companies through an intercompany account which, at December 31, 1994,
resulted in a net advance by KG&E to Western Resources of $64.4 million. 
Certain of the Company's operating expenses have been allocated from Western
Resources.  These expenses are allocated, depending on the nature of the
expense, based on allocation studies, net investment, number of customers,
and/or other appropriate allocators.  Management believes such allocation
procedures are reasonable.  During 1994, the Company declared a dividend to
Western Resources of $125 million.
