PART I
Item 1.  Business

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the state of
Washington in January 1900, as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.  It is
principally engaged in growing and harvesting of timber and the
manufacture, distribution and sale of forest products, real estate
development and construction, and financial services.  Its principal
business segments include timberlands and wood products, pulp and
paper products, real estate, and financial services.  A description of
each of these business segments follows.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The company owns approximately 5.5 million acres of commercial
forestland in the United States (50% in the South and 50% in the
Pacific Northwest),  most of it highly productive and located
extremely well to serve both domestic and international markets.  The
company has, additionally, long-term license arrangements in Canada
covering approximately 17.8 million acres (of which 14 million acres
are considered to be productive forestland).  The combined total
timber inventory on these U.S. and Canadian lands is approximately 245
million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which
approximately 75% is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber varies according to the species, size and quality of timber,
and will change through time as the mix of these variables changes.
To sustain the timber supply from its fee timberland, the company is
engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species,
precommercial and commercial thinning and fertilization and
operational pruning, all of which increase the yield from its fee
timberland acreage.

Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries


Part I
Item 3. Legal Proceedings

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Trial  began in May 1992 in a federal income tax refund case that  the
company  filed  in July 1989 in the United States Claims  Court.   The
complaint  seeks  a refund of federal income taxes  that  the  company
contends  it  overpaid in 1977 through 1983.  The alleged overpayments
are  the result of the disallowance of certain timber casualty  losses
and  certain  deductions claimed by the company  arising  from  export
transactions.   The refund sought was approximately $29 million,  plus
statutory  interest from the dates of the alleged  overpayments.   The
company has reached an agreement with the United States Department  of
Justice  to  settle  the  portion  of  the  case  relating  to  export
transactions.   That  settlement  has  been  approved  by  the   Joint
Committee  on Taxation of the U.S. Congress.  The tax refund remaining
in  dispute  is approximately $9 million plus statutory interest  from
the  dates  of the alleged overpayments.  The court has not entered  a
decision on the remaining issue.

On  March 6, 1992, the company filed a complaint in the Superior Court
for  King  County, Washington against a number of insurance companies.
The   complaint  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  insurance
companies  named  as  defendants are obligated  under  the  terms  and
conditions  of the policies sold by them to the company to defend  the
company  and to pay, on the company's behalf, certain claims  asserted
against  the  company.   The  claims relate to  alleged  environmental
damage  to third-party sites and to some of the company's own property
to  which allegedly toxic material was delivered or on which allegedly
toxic  material  was  placed in the past.  Since  December  1992,  the
company has agreed to settlements with six of the defendants.  In July
1993,  the  trial  court dismissed fourteen of the  thirty-five  sites
named  in the complaint.  Appeal of those dismissals was heard by  the
Washington  State Supreme Court on February 22, 1994.   Trial  on  two
sites is scheduled for October 1994.

In April 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
issued  an  amended  complaint adding the  company  as  an  additional
defendant  in an administrative proceeding under the Toxic  Substances
Control  Act (TSCA).  The proceeding seeks penalties of $171,000  from
all  defendants  with respect to alleged improper storage  and  record
keeping between 1980 and 1989 for certain transformers which contained
polychlorinated biphenyls.  The transformers, which the  company  sold
in 1980, were located at the company's former hardboard siding mill in
Doswell, Virginia.  The company is currently negotiating with the  EPA
to settle the matter with no admission of liability or penalties.

In   April   1992,  the  Georgia  Department  of  Natural   Resources,
Environmental Protection Division issued a Notice of Violation to  the
company's  Adel,  Georgia  particleboard plant  citing  violations  of
particulate emission standards.  A consent order was entered  into  on
September  18,  1992  assessing a $35,000  penalty  and  a  stipulated
penalty of $100 per day until the facility is in full compliance  with
particulate   emission  requirements.   The  Consent  Order   sets   a
compliance  deadline  of  January 31, 1994.  The  Consent  Order  also
requires  that  the  company  demonstrate  that  the  facility  is  in
compliance  with  regulations  under  the  Prevention  of  Significant
Deterioration (PSD) regulations under the Clean Air Act.  The  company
has  submitted compliance data and is awaiting the State's concurrence
that it satisfies the consent order requirements.

The  company  has  undertaken  a  review  of  all  its  wood  products
facilities  for compliance with the PSD regulations and has  disclosed
PSD  compliance  issues to certain state agencies and  the  EPA.   The
company  and  the  State  of Mississippi Department  of  Environmental
Quality  (DEQ)  have entered into a consent agreement  concerning  PSD
regulations  at  two  company  facilities  in  Mississippi   involving
penalties  of $170,000.  The State of Alabama has issued a  compliance
order  with  penalties  totaling $100,000 for noncompliance  with  PSD
regulations at the company's Millport facility.  The company and North
Carolina's  Division of Environmental Management have entered  into  a
consent  agreement  for its Elkin, North Carolina  facility  involving
penalties of $140,000 and are currently negotiating a separate consent
agreement for its Moncure, North Carolina facility involving penalties
of  $140,000.   The  company has signed a consent agreement  including
penalties  of $140,000 relating to PSD issues at the company's  Wright
City,  Oklahoma  facility  with the State of  Oklahoma  Department  of
Environmental Quality.  The company is negotiating a consent agreement
with  the  State  of Arkansas concerning PSD related  issues  for  two
facilities  in  that state involving $375,000 in total  penalties  for
both facilities.  Region V of the EPA has issued a Notice of Violation
for  permit  violations at the company's Grayling, Michigan  facility.
The   company  is  negotiating  settlement  of  those  alleged  permit
violations  and other PSD related issues with the Michigan  Department
of  Natural Resources and the EPA that may involve penalties of up  to
$416,000.  In September 1992, the EPA issued a Section 114 Request for
Information concerning PSD compliance at the company's oriented strand
board  and  medium density fiberboard mills.  In June  1993,  the  EPA
issued  a  similar Section 114 request for the company's  plywood  and
particleboard mills.  The company is also undertaking a review of  its
pulp and paper facilities for PSD compliance.

Part I
Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Continued

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On  April  9, 1993, the company entered into a Stipulated Final  Order
(SFO)  with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for alleged
air  emissions in excess of permit levels and PSD noncompliance at the
company's  North  Bend,  Oregon  containerboard  facility.   The   SFO
establishes  a compliance schedule for installing control  technology.
A   supplemental  SFO  assessed  upfront  penalties  of  $247,000  and
penalties of $500 per day until compliance is demonstrated.   The  SFO
requires  demonstrated compliance by December 1993  and  a  historical
evaluation of the facility's PSD status.  The company has submitted  a
plant site PSD review to the state and is awaiting its review.

In  August  1992, the EPA issued an administrative complaint  for  the
assessment  of  $215,000  in  civil penalties  against  the  company's
Longview,  Washington facility.  The penalties are based upon  alleged
violations  of  the  record  keeping and  storage  provisions  of  the
polychlorinated  biphenyls rules contained in the TSCA.   The  company
and  the  EPA settled the complaint for a maximum penalty of $118,150,
50%  of which was paid when the settlement was signed.  Payment of the
remaining  50%  was  deferred  and will be  eliminated  based  on  the
expenditure  of  more than $118,150 by the company to dispose  of  PCB
contaminated transformers at Longview during 1993.

On  November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company  in  the
Circuit  Court  for  the  First Judicial  District  of  Hinds  County,
Mississippi on behalf of a purported class of riparian property owners
in  Mississippi  and  Alabama  whose properties  are  located  on  the
Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar  Creek  and  the
Magoway  Creek.   The complaint seeks $1 billion in  compensatory  and
punitive  damages for diminution in property value, personal  injuries
and mental anguish allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous  substances, including dioxins and furans, by the  company's
pulp   and  paper  mill  in  Columbus,  Mississippi  and  the  alleged
fraudulent  concealments of such discharge.  The complaint also  seeks
an injunction prohibiting future releases and the removal of hazardous
substances  allegedly released in the past.  On  August  20,  1993,  a
companion  action was filed in Green County, Alabama on  behalf  of  a
similar  purported class of riparian owners with essentially the  same
claims as the Mississippi case.  The action was removed to the Federal
District   Court   for  the  Northern  District  of   Alabama,   which
subsequently remanded the case to state court.

Trial  began in January 1994 in the United States District  Court  for
the  District  of Alaska of claims filed against Weyerhaeuser  by  two
corporations  with  which  Weyerhaeuser  had  entered  into  financing
arrangements,  a  marketing  agreement,  and  a  technical  assistance
agreement.    The   plaintiffs   claim  that   Weyerhaeuser   breached
contractual  and common law duties by allegedly failing to  adequately
market   and  ship  the  plaintiffs'  products,  misrepresenting   its
marketing  and  shipping  capabilities,  and  acting  to  further  its
interests  at  the plaintiffs' expense.  The plaintiffs in  the  First
Amended  Complaint,  filed in May 1992, seek  an  unstated  amount  of
damages  described  as  more than $50 million in compensatory  damages
plus  not  less than $75 million in punitive damages.  The  claim  for
punitive damages has been dismissed by the trial court.

The  company  is also a party to various proceedings relating  to  the
clean   up   of   hazardous  waste  sites  under   the   Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly  known
as  "Superfund," and similar state laws.  The Environmental Protection
Agency and/or various state agencies have notified the company that it
may be a potentially responsible party with respect to other hazardous
waste  sites  as to which no proceedings have been instituted  against
the  company.  The company is also a party to other legal  proceedings
generally  incidental to its business.  Although the final outcome  of
any  legal proceeding is subject to a great many variables and  cannot
be  predicted  with  any  degree of certainty, the  company  presently
believes  that  any  ultimate  liability  resulting  from  the   legal
proceedings discussed herein, or all of them combined, would not  have
a material effect on the company's financial position.

<DESCRIPTION>PORTIONS OF THE 1993 WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY ANNUAL REPORT
<TEXT>


Timberlands and Wood Products

Timberlands and Wood Products reported operating earnings of
$891 million in 1993 as compared with $515 million in 1992,
a 73 percent increase. Timber-supply restrictions in the
public forests of the Pacific Northwest and improving single-
family home-building markets bolstered prices in the
domestic market during the year. U.S. single-family housing
starts reached 1.12 million in 1993 and are expected to move
to the 1.2-1.3 million range in 1994.  >  Prices for logs
and building materials were also strong in the Japanese
market. Wooden-housing starts in Japan were up in 1993 over
1992 and are expected to at least hold that level in 1994.
Government support to upgrade the housing stock, declining
interest rates, and
a desire to improve living conditions have helped keep
housing starts in Japan - especially wooden starts - at a
high level despite the continuing recession.  >
Weyerhaeuser lumber operations experienced strong markets in
1993 with the slowly improving U.S. economy, but prices were
volatile due to the tight supply situation and uncertainty
around the strength and pace of the recovery. Record lumber
prices were set in both the first and fourth quarters.
Markets were strong and prices volatile for structural
panels as well.  >  The Engineered Fiber Products business,
producer of oriented strand board, particleboard and other
panels, showed strong operating performance during most of
the year including significant market

improvement in composite panels after 2 1/2 years of
depressed prices. The Plywood business had a good year
despite being hampered by delays in receiving air quality
permits for newly installed and rebuilt
dryers.  >  The Building Materials Distribution business had
another excellent year, topping last year's record sales and
earnings. Low interest rates, healthy markets in residential
building and repair and
remodel, and focus on customer satisfaction benefited
business units throughout the system. The outlook is
optimistic for 1994 to be even better than 1993 as interest
rates are expected to remain low, and building products
demand high in both new residential and repair and remodel
markets.  >  WOOD PRODUCTS ACCOMPLISHMENTS  Major
accomplishments in 1993 included a better than 30 percent
improvement

achievement of 107 percent of the business improvement
target for the Plywood business; record production in OSB,
softwood and hardwood lumber; and successful completion of

Public attention was again focused on forest
management issues in 1993, including President Clinton's
forest conference held in Portland, Ore., in April.
Following the conference, a list of options was prepared by
the administration, and in July, one
was selected. The plan would reduce federal timber harvests
from certain national forests in Oregon,

                                  24
<PAGE>
Washington and
northern California to 1.2 billion board feet annually (down
from the 4-5 billion board-foot level typical of the 1980s).
In December, the Clinton administration proposed to develop
a new
rule, authorized under Section 4(d) of the Endangered
Species Act, to ease restrictions for protection of the
northern spotted owl on non-federal lands. The proposal
identifies federal lands as those most
important to the protection of the spotted owl and envisions
that private and state lands provide supplemental support to
the federal lands, where necessary. Weyerhaeuser is working
with the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service to develop a habitat-conservation plan
for its timberlands near Coos Bay, Ore.
>  TIMBERLANDS ACCOMPLISHMENTS  Accomplishments for the year
included substantial improvements in all regions against
safety-performance goals, further Total Quality education
across the business
relating to "customer value propositions," the expansion of
a commercial thinning program in Oregon's Willamette
operations, a major salvage operation in drought- and insect-
damaged fir and pine in Oregon's Klamath Falls operation,
and commencement of operational pruning on Western
timberlands. Timberlands Forest Councils made further
headway during 1993 to ensure alignment of Forest Council
goals with the overall goals and objectives of the
timberlands businesses. The councils were formed in

1992 to guide Weyerhaeuser's efforts, and maintain our
industry leadership, into the 21st century.
They focus on adapting forest management practices to meet
changing environmental goals and future public expectations
related to forestry. The councils operate in all geographic
regions and include
employees from operations, research and engineering,
communications and government affairs.  >  After
Washington's Forest Practices Board adopted a watershed
analysis process to address the cumulative

potential model for resolving resource-management issues. In

improvement will top the list of priorities in all
timberlands and wood products businesses in 1994 and beyond.
Actions designed to eliminate both work- and non-work-
related injuries of employees are being implemented in all
businesses, and safe work standards are being reinforced
with contractors and suppliers.  >  Customer satisfaction
and continuous improvement in business basics also remain
high on the list of goals in 1994 for timberlands and wood

empowering people to use their skills and talents
to meet customers' needs, financial goals and productivity-
improvement targets.

Pulp, Paper and Packaging

Worldwide oversupply in the pulp and paper industry kept
product prices depressed in 1993 - some at their lowest
levels in real dollars since World War II. For the year,
operating earnings of the company's pulp and paper segment
were $61 million as compared with operating earnings of $251
million in 1992,
a 76 percent decrease.  >  Recovery in prices is expected to
accelerate in the coming year as the U.S. economy improves
even though some weakness will continue in the European and
Japanese economies.  Worldwide competition will continue as
a result, affecting the rate of price improvement.
Devaluations
of Swedish and Finnish currencies in late 1992 dramatically
improved the Scandinavian producers' export cost position
and, therefore, their competitiveness in Europe and the
United States. Given continuing oversupply in Europe, the
devaluations have led to significant penetration of the U.S.
market in some
paper grades.  >  The world pulp market was oversupplied
throughout 1993, with price pressure increased by excess
inventory built in the second half of 1992. Decreased prices
during the year led to significant downtime for the pulp
industry, including some permanent mill shutdowns. There are
many indications that the bottom of the cycle has been
reached and that market balance may be achieved by mid-1994.

U.S. economic growth. The inflow of European-made,
particularly Scandinavian, lightweight coated
into the U.S. market in the fourth quarter came just as this
paper grade was beginning to show some
price recovery. The outlook for the Fine Paper business is
strengthening demand and slowly improving prices in 1994.  >
U.S. economic weakness and the Japanese recession resulted
in no growth in U.S. newsprint consumption and declines in
Japanese consumption during 1993. The decline in Japan was
driven by lack of print advertising due to the poor economic
climate. There was excess newsprint supply in both markets
and newsprint prices continued to decline in North America.
Scandinavian imports
found their way into eastern U.S. newsprint markets as a
result of the devaluations. The outlook is for continued
difficult economic conditions and slow domestic recovery in
1994.  >  Weyerhaeuser's
Recycling business experienced price erosion due to the
general weakness in the pulp and paper industry during 1993.
Market demand for high grades dropped dramatically as a
result of pulp price declines. In addition, as a result of
Germany's recycling subsidy program and the oversupply
situation throughout
Europe, European exports became a factor in Far East
markets. The 1994 outlook for the business is for

Real Estate and Financial Services

Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO) earned $18.3
million in 1993, a 42 percent improvement over 1992 earnings
of $12.9 million. The company benefited from improving
housing market conditions in all regions except Southern
California. Consumer confidence and mortgage rates improved
during
the year, driving a healthy increase in national starts of
both single- and multi-family housing. With
interest rates continuing at low levels, U.S. single-family
housing starts are expected to strengthen further in 1994.
>  In 1993 WRECO's Winchester Homes subsidiary was awarded
one of the first "National Housing Quality Awards," ever
given by the National Association of Home Builders and
Professional Builder magazine.  >  In 1994 WRECO will be
emphasizing additional employee education and training in
Total Quality principles and processes. Improved safety
practices by employees and contractors, as in all other
Weyerhaeuser businesses, are receiving special attention.  >
Weyerhaeuser Financial Services, Inc. (WFS), whose principal
subsidiaries are Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company and Mortgage

Description of the Business of the Company





Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the
state of Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber
Company.  It is principally engaged in the growing and
harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and
sale of forest products, real estate development and
construction, and financial services.
 The  company  has  37,000 employees, of  which  34,200  are
employed in its timber-based businesses, and of this number,
approximately  17,000  are covered by collective  bargaining
agreements,  which generally are negotiated on a  multi-year
basis.
 Approximately   2,800  of  the  company's   employees   are
involved  in the activities of its real estate and financial
services subsidiaries.
 The  major markets, both domestic and foreign, in which the
company  sells  its  products are highly  competitive,  with
numerous  strong  sellers competing in each.   Many  of  the
company's  products also compete with substitutes  for  wood
and  wood  fiber  products.  The real estate  and  financial
services  subsidiaries  also operate in  highly  competitive
markets, competing with numerous regional and national firms
in real estate development and construction and in financial
services.
 In  1993  the  company's  sales to  customers  outside  the
United  States totaled $2.2 billion (including $1.8  billion
of exports from the United States and Canada), or 23 percent
of  total  consolidated  sales and  revenues.   The  company
believes  these  sales  contributed a higher  proportion  of
aggregate  operating  profits  (see  Note  3  of  Notes   to
Financial  Statements).  All sales to customers outside  the
United  States are subject to risks related to international
trade and to political, economic and other factors that vary
from country to country.
 
Principal Business Segments
Timberlands and Wood Products
The company owns approximately 5.5 million acres of
commercial forestland in the United States (50 percent in
the South and 50 percent in the Pacific Northwest), most of
it highly productive and located extremely well to serve
both domestic and international markets.  The company has,
additionally, long-term license arrangements in Canada
covering approximately 17.8 million acres (of which 14
million acres are considered to be productive forestland).
The combined total timber inventory on these U.S. and
Canadian lands is approximately 245 million cunits (a cunit
is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which approximately 75
percent is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be
produced from timber varies according to the species, size
and quality of timber, and will change through time as the
mix of these variables changes.  To sustain the timber
supply from its fee timberland, the company is engaged in
extensive planting, suppression of non-merchantable species,
precommercial and commercial thinning, fertilization and
operational pruning, all of which increase the yield from
its fee timberland acreage.
 The  company's  wood products businesses produce  and  sell
softwood  lumber,  plywood  and  veneer;  composite  panels;
oriented  strand  board;  hardboard;  hardwood  lumber   and
plywood;  doors; treated products; logs; chips  and  timber.
These products are sold primarily through the company's  own
sales  organizations.  Building materials are sold to  whole
salers, retailers and industrial users.

Environmental Matters
In 1990 the northern spotted owl was listed as a threatened
species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  In 1992,
the marbled murrelet was listed as a threatened species
under the ESA.  Certain Snake River salmon runs have been
listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA.  Petitions
have been filed to list certain Pacific Northwest coastal
salmon runs as threatened or endangered under the ESA.  A
consequence of these listings has been, and a possible
consequence of future listings may be, reductions in the
sale and harvest of timber on federal timberlands in the
Pacific Northwest.  Uncertainty regarding the provision of
habitat for threatened and endangered species on non-federal
timberlands has resulted, and may in the future result, in
restrictions on timber harvest on some non-federal
timberlands in the Pacific Northwest, including some
timberlands of the company.  The listing of the red-cockaded
woodpecker as an endangered species under the ESA has had
some impact on the harvest of public and private timber in
the southeastern United States, but has had little impact on
the company's timberlands.  Forest practice acts in some of
the states in which the company has timber increasingly
impact present or future harvests and forest management
activities.  In addition, the statutory requirements with
respect to the preservation of wetlands and threatened or
endangered species may affect future harvest and forest
management activities on some of the company's Southern
timberlands.
 In  July  1993,  the Clinton administration  announced  its
plan  with  respect to management of federal timberlands  in
the  Pacific  Northwest.   If implemented,  this  plan  will
reduce  timber sales from certain federal lands  in  western
Washington, western Oregon and northern California by  about
75 percent from harvest levels in the 1980s to approximately
1.2  billion  board  feet per year.   If  implemented,  this
reduction  in  federal timber harvest will seriously  reduce
log  supplies  to many independent sawmills that  have  been
important suppliers of wood chips to the company's pulp  and
paper   mills   in  Washington  and  Oregon.   The   company
anticipates  that there will be alternate  sources  of  wood
chips or other fiber to supply its operations.
 The   administration  also  stated  in  its  proposal  that
reduced   timber  harvest  on  federal  lands   will   allow
modifications  to  the  current  federal  requirements   for
protection  of  northern spotted owls on private  lands.  On
December 10, 1993, the administration announced that it  was
taking  the  first steps in the regulatory process  to  ease
those  harvest restrictions.  The company believes that  the
regulatory changes might ultimately allow it to harvest  fee
timber in some areas where it has not been operating because
of  uncertainties regarding the provision of habitat for the
northern spotted owl.  Whether those regulatory changes will
be  implemented  is uncertain.  If those regulatory  changes
are not implemented, the company may not harvest some timber
that it otherwise plans to harvest in 1994.
 Because  those  regulatory changes may not be  implemented,
and  in  order to avoid existing uncertainty under the  ESA,
the  company is seeking approval from the United States Fish
and  Wildlife  Service for a permit and  associated  Habitat
Conservation  Plan  (HCP) with respect to  northern  spotted
owls  on a portion of its Oregon coastal timberlands.   That
HCP would establish a protocol for the harvest of timber and
the   protection   of  northern  spotted   owls   on   those
timberlands.  The company believes the most effective way to
manage  its timberlands for the growth and harvest of timber
and  the  protection  of wildlife and  fish  habitat  is  to
develop  a comprehensive plan for the management of all  the
resources  on those timberlands.  Accordingly,  the  company
may  attempt to develop HCPs for other parts of its  Pacific
Northwest  timberlands that would address the protection  of
wildlife  and  fish habitat for both listed  and  non-listed
species.

 The  combination  of  the  forest  management  and  harvest
restrictions  and  impacts described in the  preceding  four
paragraphs  has  increased  operating  costs,  resulted   in
increases in the value of timber and logs from the company's
Pacific  Northwest  timberlands,  and  contributed   to   an
increase in prices for wood products.  The company does  not
know  whether these effects will continue.  If wood products
prices  remain  at their present levels,  there  may  be  an
increase  in substitution of other products for  lumber  and
plywood.
 The  company  does  not believe that the  restrictions  and
impacts  described in the above paragraphs have had,  or  in
1994  or  1995  will  have,  a  significant  effect  on  the
company's  total harvest of timber, although they  may  have
such an effect in the future.
 In  addition  to the foregoing, the company is  subject  to
federal, state or provincial, and local air, water and  land
pollution  control,  solid and hazardous  waste  management,
disposal  and remediation laws and regulations in all  areas
in  which  it  has  operations, and to market  demands  with
respect  to  chemical content of some products  and  use  of
recycled fiber.  Compliance with these laws, regulations and
demands  usually involves capital expenditures  as  well  as
operating costs.  The company cannot easily quantify  future
amounts  of  capital expenditures required  to  comply  with
these  laws,  regulations  and demands,  or  the  impact  on
operating   costs,  because  in  some  instances  compliance
standards  have not been developed or have not become  final
or  definitive.   In  addition,  compliance  with  standards
frequently  serves  other  purposes  such  as  extension  of
facility life, increase in capacity, changes in raw material
requirements,  or increase in economic value  of  assets  or
products.    While   it   is  difficult   to   isolate   the
environmental   component  of  most  manufacturing   capital
projects,  the  company estimates that capital  expenditures
for environmental compliance were approximately 8 percent of
total  capital expenditures in 1992 and 1993, and  based  on
its  understanding  of current regulatory requirements,  the
company expects this percentage to increase to approximately
11  percent  in 1994 and to range from 13 to 14  percent  of
total capital expenditures in 1995.
 The  company  is involved in the environmental  remediation
of  numerous sites, including 37 Superfund sites  where  the
company  has been named as a potentially responsible  party.
Some  of  the  sites are on property presently  or  formerly
owned  by  the  company  where  the  company  has  the  sole
obligation  to remediate the site or shares that  obligation
with  one or more parties, and others are third-party  sites
involving  several  parties who have  a  joint  and  several
obligation  to remediate the site.  The company's  liability
with  respect  to  these sites ranges from insignificant  at
some  to  substantial at others, depending on the  quantity,
toxicity and nature of materials deposited by the company at
the site and, with respect to some sites, the number and
economic viability of the other responsible parties.
 The  company spent $24 million in 1992 and $57  million  in
1993,   and  expects  to  spend  $45  million  in  1994   on
environmental  remediation  of  these  sites.  It   is   the
company's  policy  to  accrue for environmental  remediation
costs when it is determined that it is probable that such an
obligation  exists and the amount of the obligation  can  be
reasonably   estimated.    Based  on   currently   available
information and analysis, the company believes  that  it  is
reasonably   possible   that  costs  associated   with   all
identified sites may exceed current accruals by amounts that
may   prove  insignificant  or  that  could  range,  in  the
aggregate,  up  to approximately $140 million  over  several
years.   This  estimate of the upper end  of  the  range  of
reasonably  possible additional costs is much  less  certain
than  the estimates upon which accruals are currently  based
and  is  based on assumptions less favorable to the  company
among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

 The  company  has  completed  a  review  of  all  its  wood
products  facilities for compliance with the  Prevention  of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations under the  Clean
Air   Act  and  has  disclosed  PSD  compliance  issues   to
appropriate state agencies and the Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA) and is negotiating compliance settlements  with
those  agencies.  Based on its understanding of the  current
status  of discussions, the company expects to spend  $30-40
million  of capital for required installations of  emission-
control  equipment  at its wood products  facilities  during
1994-95.   The  company  anticipates  completing  a  similar
review  of  all  its  pulp  and  paper  facilities  for  PSD
compliance in 1994.
 A  new  regulation under Title 5 of the Clean Air Act  will
require  additional operating permits at  many  of  the 
company's manufacturing operations.
Although significant  work
is  required to prepare the permit applications in 1994  and
1995, the company anticipates that it will be able to obtain
the necessary permits.
 As  a  result of advances in measurement technology, minute
amounts of dioxin have been detected in wastewater effluent,
sludges  and pulp from bleached kraft pulp mills,  including
certain  of  the company's mills.  The company  has  changed
operating  procedures,  allocated  capital,  and  made  very
substantial  progress  in  reducing  dioxin  in  the  mills'
sludge, pulp, effluent and ultimate product.
 The  EPA has published proposed regulations, known  as  the
"cluster  rules,"  which would establish maximum  achievable
control  technology  standards  for  non-combustion  sources
under  the  Clean  Air Act, and the development  of  revised
wastewater  effluent limitations under the Clean Water  Act.
The  company's operations are well positioned  to  meet  the
proposed  limits for dioxin.  However, if the cluster  rules
are  adopted as proposed, they will require the  company  to
commit  additional capital to further reduce  air  emissions
and wastewater discharges by 1999.  Preliminary estimates of
that additional capital range as high as $400 million, which
may  further increase the annual percentage of the company's
total  capital  expenditures devoted  to  environmental 
compliance, although that is not anticipated prior to 1996.

Financial Review





1993 versus 1992
Sales and revenues in 1993 were $9.5 billion, an increase of
3 percent over 1992.  Net earnings were $579 million, or
$2.83 per common share, up from 1992 net earnings of $372
million, or $1.83 per common share.  Included in 1993 net
earnings are after-tax gains of:
   -$52  million,  or  $.25  per  common  share,  from   the
extinguishment   of   debt,  which   is   reported   as   an
extraordinary item.
   -$44  million, or $.22 per common share, from the sale  of
the infant diaper business.
   -$36  million, or $.18 per common share, from the sale  of
GNA Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary.
 And  a charge of $20 million, or $.10 per common share,  to
reflect  the  new  1993 federal corporate tax  rate  in  the
company's  deferred and current tax accounts.   This  charge
consists of $.08 per common share due to the effect  of  the
higher  rate  on  the accumulated temporary  differences  at
December 27, 1992, and $.02 per common share related to  the
current year.
 The  net  sales and revenues and related costs and expenses
of real estate and financial services are substantially less
in 1993 as compared with 1992 as a result of the sale of GNA
Corporation.
 During 1993 the company refinanced a significant amount  of
debt,  which  resulted in a short-term increase in  interest
expense.   The  increase in capitalized  interest  over  the
prior year coincides with expanded activity in the company's
major capital projects.
 The  significant  decrease in financial  services  interest
expense  is  due  to  the liquidation of  Republic   Federal
Savings & Loan Association during 1992 and the sale  of  GNA
Corporation in early 1993.  In addition, accelerated  
prepayments  caused by mortgage refinancings significantly 
reduced collateralized mortgage obligation bonds.
 Significant  items in relation to net earnings included  in
other income for 1993 were a $70 million pretax gain on  the
disposal  of  the company's investment in the infant  diaper
business through a public offering in a new company, Paragon
Trade  Brands,  Inc.,  and  the real  estate  and  financial
services  pretax  gain of $42 million on  the  sale  of  GNA
Corporation.
 The  timberlands and wood products operating  earnings  for
1993  were $891 million, an increase of 73 percent over  the
$515  million recorded in 1992.  Prices for logs and  lumber
continue to exceed 1992 levels due to increasing demand  for
housing construction materials and raw material supply 
shortages resulting from reduced harvests in the Western
public forests.
 The  pulp  and  paper products segment had  a  $61  million
operating  profit  in  1993, significantly  below  the  $251
million posted in 1992.  Prices for most of the products  in
this  segment  continue  to  be at  levels  well  below  the
previous year.  The personal care products business included
in this segment was divested in the first quarter of 1993.
 The   real  estate  and  financial  services  segments  had
operating earnings of $94 million in 1993 compared with  $81
million in 1992.
 As  a  part  of the GNA Corporation sales transaction,  the
company assumed $225 million of GNA debt.

1992 versus 1991
Sales and revenues in 1992 were $9.3 billion, up 6 percent
from 1991.  Net earnings were $372 million, or $1.83 per
common share, compared with a 1991 loss of $162 million, or
$.80 per common share.  1991 results reflected an after-tax
special-items charge to earnings of $344 million.  1992
research and development expenses decreased 24 percent from
1991 as a result of the implementation of certain of the
company's restructuring and business improvement plans.
Interest expense incurred for 1992 was down by $68 million,
or 14 percent, primarily due to the dissolution of the
company's savings and loan operations in Southern California
during the year.  Significant changes in other income in
1992, compared with 1991, included a $25 million partial
settlement accrued in 1992 with respect to a lawsuit for the
refund of federal income taxes, and earnings of $2 million
in the company's real estate joint-venture and limited-
partnership activities in 1992, after losses of $17 million
in 1991, attributable to the restructuring or sale of a
number of these investments.

                             41
<PAGE>
 In  1992  the  company  purchased  two  pulp  mills,  three
sawmills,  timberlands in Georgia, and a  forest  management
license in Alberta, Canada, from Procter & Gamble.
 The  1992  timberlands and wood products operating earnings
were $515 million, compared with $155 million in 1991, which
included  a  restructuring charge  of  $152  million.   This
segment posted near-record earnings in the year with  strong
raw  material  and  converted  wood  products  prices.   The
curtailment of wood supply from public lands in the  western
United States, along with increased demand generated by  the
slowly  improving U.S. economy, exerted upward  pressure  on
the  value of wood products in both the domestic and  export
markets.
 Pulp  and  paper  products  operating  earnings  were  $251
million for 1992, compared with $108 million in the previous
year, which included a restructuring charge of $129 million.
While pulp pricing showed some temporary strength due to the
mid-year  strike in the company's Canadian pulp  mills,  the
overall trend from a year ago was down.  Newsprint and paper
suffered continued weak prices throughout 1992.
 Real  estate  posted operating earnings of $13  million  in
1992  after recording a loss of $175 million in 1991,  which
included a $155 million restructuring charge.
 Financial  services operating earnings were $68 million  in
1992,  up  13 percent from the 1991 results of $60  million.
While  this segment benefited from lower interest rates  for
most  of  the  year, earnings were affected as a  result  of
reduced   investment  returns.   The  dissolution   of   the
company's wholly owned subsidiary Republic Federal Savings &
Loan  Association,  which  operated  primarily  in  Southern
California, was completed during 1992.

1991 versus 1990
Sales and revenues in 1991 were $8.8 billion, down 3 percent
from 1990.  The net loss was $162 million, or $.80 per
common share, down from 1990 earnings of $394 million, or
$1.87 per common share.  The 1991 net loss included an after-
tax special-items charge of $344 million, or $1.70 per
common
share.  (See Notes 1, 2 and 24 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)
 The $344 million special-items charge included:
  -Implementation of two accounting pronouncements  relating
to postretirement benefits and income taxes.  The net effect
of  the  two pronouncements was a charge of $61 million,  or
$.30 per common share.
  -A  special charge to operations of $283 million, or $1.40
per common share, related to the following:

 Timberlands and wood products operating earnings  for  1991
were  $155 million compared with $300 million in 1990.   The
decrease from 1990 in operating earnings was due to  charges
of  $152  million  for special items.   The  improvement  in
operations,  exclusive  of  special-item  charges,  was  due
primarily  to  improvement in manufacturing  efficiency  and
strength  in  wood products prices reflecting concern  about
the impact, on raw materials supply, of the restrictions  on
the  harvest  of  public  timber in the  Northwest  and  was
accomplished  in spite of an economic climate that  included
the  lowest rate of U.S. housing starts since World  War  II
and Japanese housing starts down 20 percent from 1990.
 Pulp  and  paper products operating earnings for 1991  were
$108 million, down 78 percent from 1990.  Earnings in all of
the  company's major pulp and paper products businesses were
severely  impacted by significant price erosion  during  the
year  and  by a $129 million charge for special  items.   In
pulp,  paper  and containerboard, real prices reached  their
lowest  levels since the mid-'80s.  Real prices for uncoated
paper and newsprint were at their lowest points in 20 years.
 Real  estate  lost  $175 million in 1991 including  a  $155
million  charge for special items, down from the $35 million
earned  in  1990.   In addition to the special  items,  1991
results  were  heavily  impacted by the  low  rate  of  U.S.
housing starts and the capital-constrained banking industry,
which  made  it very difficult for home builders  to  obtain
project  financing and to sell finished commercial projects.
The  company's continuing real estate operations are engaged
primarily in single-family home construction.  The operating
profits  from real estate's continuing operations were  more
than  offset by losses and reserves relating to discontinued
operations, joint ventures and limited partnerships.
 Financial  services operating earnings for  1991  were  $60
million,  up  28  percent  from  1990.   Financial  services
businesses, consisted principally of GNA Corporation,  which
specialized in the sale of annuities and mutual funds to the
customers   of   financial  institutions,  and  Weyerhaeuser
Mortgage   Company,   a  multi-state  residential   mortgage
originator and servicer, posted record profits for the year.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
The company's financial position in 1993 remained strong as
it generated $982 million of cash flow from operations
before changes in working capital.  Cash was also generated
from the sale of mortgage-backed securities.  Capital
expenditures amounted to $967 million during the year and
are currently expected to approximate $1.1 billion in 1994;
however, the expenditures could be increased or decreased as
a consequence of future economic conditions.  The company
had approximately $600 million in capital expenditures com-
mitted on major projects at year-end 1993, representing con-
struction activities at its Longview, Wash., and Plymouth,
N.C., pulp and paper facilities.

 As  a  matter  of policy, the company is committed  to  the
maintenance  of  a  sound, conservative  capital  structure.
This  commitment  is  based upon  two  considerations:   the
obligation to protect the under-
lying  interests  of its shareholders and lenders,  and  the
desire  to  have  access, at all times, to  major  financial
markets.
 The   important  elements  of  the  policy  governing   the
company's capital structure are as follows:
   -To   view   separately   the  capital   structures   of
Weyerhaeuser Company, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate  Company  and
Weyerhaeuser  Financial  Services,  Inc.,  given  the   very
different  nature  of their assets and business  activities.
The  amount  of debt and equity associated with the  capital
structure  of each will reflect the basic earnings capacity,
real  value  and  unique  liquidity characteristics  of  the
assets dedicated to that business.
   -The  combination  of maturing short-term  debt  and  the
structure  of long-term debt will be managed judiciously  to
minimize  liquidity  risk.  Long-term  debt  maturities  are
shown in Notes 16 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.
 To   ensure   its  ability  to  meet  future   commitments,
Weyerhaeuser Company, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate  Company  and
Weyerhaeuser  Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser
Financial Services, Inc., have established at year-end  1993
unused bank lines of credit in the maximum aggregate sum  of
approximately  $2.2  billion.  None of  the  entities  is  a
guarantor of the borrowings of the others under any of these
credit facilities.
 Cash  dividends  paid  on common shares  amounted  to  $246
million  in  1993.   Although common  share  dividends  have
exceeded our target payout ratio in recent years, it is  the
company's intent, over time, to pay dividends to its  common
shareholders in a range of 35 to 45 percent of common  share
earnings.
 During  the  year,  the Accounting and Reporting  Standards
Committee,  comprised  of four outside  directors,  reviewed
with  the  company's  management and  with  its  independent
public  accountants the scope and results of  the  company's
internal  and external audit activities and the adequacy  of
the  company's internal accounting controls.  The  committee
also  reviewed current and emerging accounting and reporting
requirements and practices affecting the company.


Report of Independent Public Accountants



To the shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Company:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
of Weyerhaeuser Company (a Washington
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 26, 1993, and
December 27, 1992, and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, cash flows and shareholders' interest for each
of the three years in the period ended December 26, 1993.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  auditing standards.  Those standards require  that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements  
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used   and
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well   as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for  our
opinion.
 In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present  fairly,  in  all material respects,  the  financial
position  of  Weyerhaeuser Company and  subsidiaries  as  of
December 26, 1993, and December 27, 1992, and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years  in  the period ended December 26, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
 As  explained  in Note 1 of Notes to Financial  Statements,
effective December 31, 1990, the company changed its  method
of  accounting for income taxes and postretirement  benefits
other than pensions.

Notes to Financial Statements





For  the three years in the period ended December 26,  1993.
(Dollar amounts in thousands except per-share figures.)
NOTE 1:
Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its majority-owned
domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany
transactions and accounts are eliminated.
 Certain of the consolidated financial state-
ments and notes to financial statements are pre-
sented   in   two   groupings:   (1)  Weyerhaeuser   Company
(Weyerhaeuser, or the company), which is principally engaged
in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture,
distribution  and  sale  of forest products,  and  (2)  Real
estate  and  financial services, which includes Weyerhaeuser
Real Estate Company (WRECO), which is involved in real
estate   development  and  construction,  and   Weyerhaeuser
Financial Services, Inc. (WFS),
whose   principal  subsidiaries  are  Weyerhaeuser  Mortgage
Company   (WMC)   and   Mortgage  Securities   Corporations.
Republic Federal Savings & Loan Association (RFS&LA), a  sub
sidiary  of WFS, was dissolved in 1992, and GNA Corporation,
a subsidiary of WFS, was sold in April 1993.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
Net earnings (loss) per common share are based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the respective periods.  Average common equivalent shares
(stock options) outstand-
ing have not been included, as the computation would not be
dilutive.  Weighted average common shares outstanding were
204,866,000, 203,373,000 and 201,578,000 for the years ended
December 26, 1993, December 27, 1992, and December 29, 1991,
respectively.
 Fully   diluted   earnings-per-share   amounts   are    not
applicable because the effect of the conversion of the stock
options is not dilutive.

Accounting Changes
During the fourth quarter of 1991, the company implemented,
effective with the first quarter of 1991, Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 96, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," and No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The effect of
the implementation of SFAS No. 96 was an increase in net
earnings of $64,000 ($.32 per common share).  The effect of
the implementation of SFAS No. 106 for the company's U.S.
operations was a charge to net earnings of $198,000 less
related tax effect of $73,000, or $125,000 ($.62 per common
share).
 SFAS  No.  106  is  expected  to  be  implemented  for  the
company's  wholly owned subsidiary Weyerhaeuser Canada  Ltd.
(WCL)  in  the first quarter of 1995.  The company  believes
that  the  future implementation of this pronouncement  will
not  have  a significant impact on the company's results  of
operations or its financial position.
 In  February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB)  issued SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income  Taxes,"
superseding  SFAS No. 96, but reaffirming  the  use  of  the
liability  method.  The company reviewed the  provisions  of
SFAS  No.  109  and determined that it did not  require  any
significant   adjustments  to  the  deferred  tax   accounts
previously reported under SFAS No. 96.  Effective  with  the
beginning   of  the  1992  fiscal  year,  the   company   is
determining its income tax accounts in accordance with  SFAS
No. 109.
 In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemploy-
ment Benefits," to be effective for fiscal years begin-
ning after December 15, 1993.  The company believes that the
future implementation of this pronouncement will not have  a
significant impact on the company's results of operations or
its financial position.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
includes labor, materials and production overhead.  The last-
in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to cost the majority of
domestic raw materials, in process and finished goods
inventories; either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or
average cost method is used to cost all other inventories.
Had the FIFO method

                             52
<PAGE>
been used to cost all inventories, the amounts at which
product inventories are stated would have been $238,560 and
$203,859 greater at December 26, 1993, and December 27,
1992, respectively.

Property and Equipment
The company's property accounts are maintained on an
individual asset basis.  Betterments and replacements of
major units are capitalized.  Maintenance, repairs and minor
replacements are expensed.  Depreciation is provided
generally on the straight-line or unit-of-production methods
at rates based on estimated service lives.  Amortization of
logging railroads and truck roads is provided generally as
timber is harvested and is based upon rates determined with
reference to the volume of timber estimated to be removed
over such facilities.
 The  cost  and  related depreciation of  property  sold  or
retired  is  removed  from the property  and  allowance  for
depreciation accounts and the gain or loss is recorded.

Timber and Timberlands
Timber and timberlands are carried at cost less fee stumpage
charged to disposals.  Fee stumpage is the cost of standing
timber and is charged to fee timber disposals as fee timber
is harvested, lost as the result of casualty or sold.
Stumpage rates are determined with reference to the cost of
timber and the related volume of timber estimated to be
recoverable.  Timber carrying costs are expensed as
incurred.

Income Taxes
Under SFAS Nos. 96 and 109, deferred income taxes are
provided to reflect temporary differences between the
financial and tax bases of assets and lia-
bilities using presently enacted tax rates and laws.

Pension Plans
The company has pension plans covering most of its
employees.  The U.S. plan covering salaried employees
provides pension benefits based on the employee's highest
monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final
10 years before retirement.  Plans covering hourly employees
generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year
of service.  Contributions to U.S. plans are based on
funding standards established by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
In addition to providing pension benefits, the company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
some retired employees and accrues the expected future cost
of these benefits for its current eligible retirees and some
employees.  All of the company's salaried employees and some
hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits when
they retire.

Cash and Short-Term Investments
For purposes of cash flow and fair value reporting (see Note
19), short-term investments with original maturities of 90
days or less are considered as cash equivalents.  Short-term
investments are stated at cost, which approximates market.

Foreign Exchange Contracts
The company enters into foreign exchange contracts as a
hedge for foreign accounts receivable.  Market value gains
and losses are recognized and offset
against foreign exchange gains or losses on the
foreign receivables.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior
years' data to the current format.

Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company
WRECO recognizes income from the sales of single-family
housing units when construction has been completed, required
down payments received and title has passed to the customer.
Income from the sales of multi-family, commercial
properties, developed lots and undeveloped land is
recognized when required down payments are received and
other income recognition criteria are satisfied.
 Real  estate  is  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net
realizable value.  The determination of net realizable value
is based on WRECO's plans for its property and its financial
ability  to carry out such plans.  Changes in future  market
demand,  interest  rates and company plans  may  affect  net
realizable  value.  Land, land development and  construction
costs, including capitalized carrying costs, are accumulated
and  allocated to individual units in proportion to relative
sales value.

Weyerhaeuser Financial Services
Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company and its subsidiaries are
primarily engaged in the mortgage banking industry and also
offer insurance services.
  -Mortgage notes held for sale are stated at the  lower  of
cost  or  market, which is computed by the aggregate  method
(unrealized losses are offset by unrealized gains).  Hedging
transactions are entered into to protect the inventory value
from  increases in interest rates.  Hedge positions are also
used to protect the pipeline of loan applications in process
from  increases in interest rates.  Hedging gains and losses
realized  during the commitment and warehousing  period  are
deferred  to  the extent of unrealized gains on the  related
mortgage loans held for sale.
  -The  costs associated with purchasing mortgage  servicing
rights  are deferred.  Excess service fees result from  loan
sales in which WMC retains the loan servicing rights and are
based on the present value of future servicing revenue  less
a  normal  servicing fee, based upon the estimated remaining
life of the loans sold.
 The  Mortgage Securities Corporations were formed  for  the
limited   purpose   of   issuing   collateralized   mortgage
obligation bonds (CMO bonds) secured by Government  National
Mortgage   Association   and   Federal   National   Mortgage
Association  certificates.   The  CMO  bonds  are  the  sole
obligation  of the issuer, and neither the company  nor  any
affiliated company has guaranteed or is otherwise  obligated
with respect to the CMO bonds.
  -The mortgage-backed certificates are carried at par value
adjusted  for  any unamortized discount or  premium.   These
discounts  or  premiums are amortized using  a  method  that
approximates   the  effective  interest  method   over   the
estimated life of the underlying mortgage loans.
  -CMO bonds are carried at unamortized cost.  Discounts and
premiums are amortized using a method that approximates  the
effective interest method over their estimated life.
 In   March   1992,  Republic  Federal  Savings   and   Loan
Association,  which  was a federally chartered  savings  and
loan   institution  that  operated  primarily  in   Southern
California,  sold  the  remainder of  its  branches,  ceased
accepting deposits as a federally chartered savings and loan
institution,  and filed an application with  the  Office  of
Thrift Supervision to undergo a voluntary dissolution, which
was  approved  in  the fourth quarter of 1992.   During  its
operation:
   -Interest  income  was  recorded on  the  accrual  method;
however,  interest was not accrued on loans that  were  more
than  90 days contractually delinquent and on certain  other
loans that management felt may not be recoverable.
   -U.S.  government  and other securities  were  carried  at
amortized  cost.   Gains  or  losses  were  recognized  upon
realization.
   -Discounts  on loans purchased were amortized into  income
over the expected average loan lives.
 In April 1993, WFS completed the sale of
GNA   Corporation.    As   a  part  of   that   transaction,
Weyerhaeuser assumed $225 million of outstanding  GNA  debt.
GNA Corporation and its life insurance subsidiaries provided
annuities, insurance and securi-
ties  marketed through financial institutions.   During  its
operation:
   -Payments  received  on  investment  and  limited  payment
contracts were recorded directly as deposits.
   -Investment income was recorded when earned.
   -Investments  in  bonds  were stated  at  amortized  cost;
mortgage loans and other investments were carried at cost.
   -The liability for future annuity and contract reserves on
single  premium deferred annuities and single premium  whole
life policies was the contract holder's account value.   The
reserve  for  single premium immediate annuity benefits  was
the present value of such benefits.

 The  corporate  income  tax  rate  was  increased  from  34
percent  to 35 percent, retroactive to January 1,  1993,  by
legislation enacted during the third quarter of 1993.   This
change  in tax law increased income taxes in 1993 by $15,400
due  to the effect of the higher tax rate on the accumulated
temporary  differences at December 27, 1992, and $4,500  due
to  the  effect of adjusting the annual effective  tax  rate
used in prior quarters.

federal statutory tax rate and the company's tax provision

</TABLE>
 As of December 26, 1993, the company has avail-
able  approximately $70 million of alternative  minimum  tax
credit  carryover, which does not expire, and $7 million  of
investment tax credit carryover in
Canada, expiring as follows:  $1 million in 1997, $4 million
in 1998, and $2 million in 2003.
 The  company intends to reinvest undistributed earnings  of
certain foreign subsidiaries; therefore, no U.S. taxes  have
been  provided.   These earnings totaled approximately  $318
million at the end of 1993.  While it is not practicable  to
determine the income tax liability that would result from re
patriation,  it is estimated that withholding taxes  payable
upon repatriation would approximate $32 million.



NOTE 6:
Extraordinary Item
In 1993 the company realized a net gain of $52,052 ($85,784
less related tax effect of $33,732) as a result of
extinguishing certain debt obligations.

 The  assets of the U.S. and Canadian pension plans,  as  of
December  26, 1993, consist of a highly diversified  mix  of
marketable  securities,  real  estate  and  private   equity
securities.
 Approximately  1,700  employees  are  covered   by   union-
administered  multi-employer  pension  plans  to  which  the
company  makes negotiated contributions based  generally  on
fixed amounts per hour per employee.  Contributions to these
plans  were  $5,780 in 1993, $4,606 in 1992  and  $4,372  in
1991.



NOTE 8:
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The company sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans
that provide medical and life insurance coverage as follows:
   -Two  salaried  retiree  medical  plans  that  cover  sub-
stantially  all  salaried employees  who  retire  under  the
company's retirement plan and their spouses.  Plan I  covers
those  retired or eligible to retire as of January 1,  1990,
and  provides full health coverage.  Plan II includes  those
salaried employees not eligible for Plan I, under which  the
company  provides a fixed dollar amount per year of  service
toward  the  premium, with the retiree paying the remainder.
The  company  reserves the right to revise the fixed  dollar
amount.
   -An  hourly retiree medical plan that covers approximately
3,700  active hourly employees and their spouses.  For some,
the  coverage  stops at age 65, while others  have  lifetime
coverage.   In some units the retiree must pay a portion  of
the premium, while in others the company pays the full cost.
There  are approximately 1,000 retired hourly employees  and
their spouses currently covered under these programs.
   -A  salaried retiree life insurance plan that starts at 80
percent  of salary at retirement and reduces to six thousand
dollars  in 20 percent increments.  Approximately 5,200  per-
sons  who  are  retired or were eligible  to  retire  as  of
December 31, 1991, are subject to a different schedule.
   -An  hourly  retiree life insurance plan in which approxi-
mately  11,000  active  hourly employees  are  eligible  and
approximately 2,000 hourly retirees have coverage.  Most  of
these  are covered by fixed dollar amount coverage  that  is
graded  down  after retirement.  Some units have pay-related
insurance on which the company pays the full cost.

The following table sets forth the plans' combined accrued
postretirement benefit costs for its U.S. operations as of
December 26, 1993, December 27, 1992, and December 29, 1991:

 For  measurement  purposes, a 12.0, 11.5 and  11.0  percent
annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed  for
1991,  1992  and 1993, respectively; the rate is assumed  to
decrease  by 0.5 percent annually to a level of 6.0  percent
for the year 2003 and all years thereafter.  The effect of a
one  percent increase in the assumed health care cost  trend
rates  would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 26, 1993, by 11.8 percent, and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
annual postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by 14.0 percent.
 
Other assumptions used were as follows:

amount of $1,650,000, all of which can be availed of by  the
company, and $1,000,000, which can be availed of by  WMC,  a
subsidiary  of WFS.  Borrowings are at LIBOR or  other  such
interest  rates as mutually agreed to between  the  borrower
and  lending banks.  This credit facility agreement has been
extended through November 1995.
   -A  one-year evergreen credit commitment entered  into  in
1990 with a group of banks, which provides for borrowings of

 At  December 26, 1993, and December 27, 1992, respectively,
WMC had $35,000 outstanding against this commitment.
   -Short-term   bank  credit  lines,  which   provide   for
borrowings  of  up to the total amount of $200,000,  all  of
which  can  be  availed  of by the company  and  WRECO,  and
$150,000, which can be availed of
by WMC.
 To  the  extent that these credit commitments  expire  more
than  one year after the balance sheet date and are  unused,
an equal amount of commercial paper is classifiable as long-
term debt.  Amounts so classified are shown in the tables in
this and the following note.  No portion of these lines  has
been  availed  of  by  the company, WRECO,  WMC  or  WFS  at
December 26, 1993, or December 27, 1992, except as noted.
 In  1993, WFS completed the sale of GNA Corporation.  As  a
part of this transaction, the com-
pany assumed $225,000 of outstanding GNA debt.

payments  at a rate of 10.09 percent per annum and  receives
from the bank a monthly payment at a rate equivalent to  the
30-day  commercial  paper rate.  The interest  payments  are
calculated on the notional amount of $25,000.  The agreement
expires in November 1995.  The company is exposed to  credit
loss  in the event of non-performance by the other party  to
the interest rate swap agreement.  However, the company does
not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty.
 Total  interest  costs incurred by WRECO during  the  three
years  ended  December 26, 1993, have been  capitalized  and
will  ultimately be accounted for as an element of operating
costs.
 The  company's  compensating balance  agreements  were  not
significant.



NOTE 18:
Subordinated Debentures
The 5 1/4 percent convertible subordinated debentures were
issued in 1990 in exchange for the company's outstanding
$2.625 convertible exchangeable preference shares.  In the
first quarter of 1993, the company called this issue in full
and paid principal plus premium and accrued interest to
those debenture holders who had not previously exercised the
option to convert their debentures into common shares.
 The limited recourse income debenture, which was repaid  in
January 1993, was the obligation of Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.
and was issued as total consideration for the purchase of  a
pulp mill, chemical plant and sawmill in Saskatchewan.

NOTE 19:
Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the company's financial instruments, and
the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value, are as follows:
Weyerhaeuser
  -Long-term debt and other liabilities - the
fair  value  of  the  company's  long-term  debt  (including
WRECO  and  WFS) is estimated based on quoted market  prices
for the same issues or on the discounted value of the future
cash  flows expected to be paid using incremental  rates  of
borrowing for similar liabilities.
  -Foreign  exchange  contracts -  the  fair  value  of  the
company's $26,500 foreign exchange contracts (see  Note  22)
was estimated by obtaining quotes from its currency brokers.
At  December 26, 1993, the fair value of these contracts was
approximately $28,000.
  -Notes  and contracts receivable - the company  and  WRECO
estimate  that  the  carrying  value  of  their  notes   and
contracts  receivable approximates their fair values  as  of
December 26, 1993, and December 27, 1992.

Real Estate and Financial Services
  -Joint  venture  and partnership guarantees  -  WRECO  has
guaranteed certain borrowings of
joint ventures in which it is a participant in the aggregate
amount  of  $116,954.  During the year,  WRECO  reduced  the
maximum aggregate sum available through several bank  credit
arrangements from  $100,000 at December 27, 1992, to $30,000
at  December
26,  1993.   These credit arrangements were  established  to
guarantee certain borrow-
ings   made   by   subsidiary  limited   partnerships.    At
December  26,  1993,  and  December  27,  1992,  the  amount
utilized under these arrangements is
$22,558  and $54,319, respectively.  In addition, WRECO  has
entered into various other contractual obligations to  fund,
if certain specified events occur, $11,774 to the capital of
its  real estate partnerships.  If funded, these commitments
would  increase  WRECO's equity investment  in  partnerships
and, therefore, are not subject to fair value disclosure.
  -Interest  rate  swaps - WRECO has an interest  rate  swap
agreement  whereby the interest payments under the agreement
are  calculated on the notional amount of $25,000 (see  Note
17).   The liquidation cost (which has been estimated  using
rates currently available for an instrument with similar
terms)  to WRECO  as of December 26, 1993, and December  27,
1992,  if  the  agreement  was canceled,  would  approximate
$2,753 and $4,472, respectively.
  -Mortgage  notes held for sale - are estimated  using  the
quoted market prices for securities backed by similar  loans
adjusted  for  differences  in  loan  characteristics.   The
estimated  fair  value is net of related hedge  instruments,
which  were  estimated based upon quoted market  prices  for
securities.
  -Construction mortgage notes and mortgage loans receivable
- - are based on the discounted value of estimated future cash
flows  using current rates for loans with similar terms  and
risks.
  -Investments - are estimated using quoted  market  prices
for  similar  securities.  The fair value of mortgage  loans
held  as  investments  is based on the discounted  value  of
estimated future cash flows using current rates.
  -Mortgage-backed  certificates and restricted  deposits -
the  fair value of mortgage-backed certificates is estimated
using  the  quoted  market prices for securities  backed  by
similar loans; restricted deposits are a reasonable estimate
of fair value.
  -Notes and commercial paper - WRECO and WFS estimate  that
the  carrying  value  of their notes  and  commercial  paper
approximates their fair value as of December 26,  1993,  and
December 27, 1992.
  -Future  annuity  and contract reserves -  were  the  cash
surrender value payable on demand.
  -Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)
bonds  - fair value is estimated using analysis of projected
cash flows discounted at market yields.
  -Loans  sold  with recourse - the fair value is  estimated
based upon market spreads for sales of similar loans without
recourse  or estimates of the credit risk of the  associated
recourse  obligation.  The fair value  of  the  recourse  on
these loans (see Note 21) is estimated to be $14.8 million.

NOTE 20:
Legal Proceedings
On November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company
in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial District of
Hinds County, Miss., on behalf of a pur-
ported class of riparian property owners in Mississippi and
Alabama whose properties are located on the Tennessee
Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar Creek and the
Magoway Creek.  The complaint seeks $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages for diminution in property
value,
personal injuries and mental anguish allegedly
resulting from the discharge of purported hazardous
substances, including dioxins and furans, by the company's
pulp and paper mill in Columbus, Miss., and the alleged
fraudulent concealments of such discharge.  The complaint
also seeks an injunction prohibiting future releases and the
removal of hazardous substances allegedly released in the
past.  On August 20, 1993, a companion action was filed in
Green County, Ala., on behalf of a similar purported class
of riparian owners with essentially the same claims as the
Mississippi case.  The action was removed to the federal
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, which
subsequently remanded the case to state court.
 The   company   is  a  party  to  other  legal  proceedings
generally  incidental to its business.  Although  the  final
outcome  of any legal proceeding is subject to a great  many
variables  and  cannot  be  predicted  with  any  degree  of
certainty, the company presently believes that any  ultimate
liability  resulting  from the legal  proceedings  discussed
herein,  or all of them combined, would not have a  material
adverse effect on the company's financial position.
 
                             70

NOTE 21:
Commitments and Contingencies
The company's capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions,
have averaged about $823,000 in recent years but are
expected to approximate $1,100,000 in 1994; however, the
1994 expenditure level could be increased or decreased as a
consequence of future economic conditions.  The company had
approximately $600,000 in capital expenditures committed on
major projects at year-end 1993.
 It  is  the  company's policy to accrue  for  environmental
remediation costs when it is determined that it is  probable
that  such  an  obligation exists  and  the  amount  of  the
obligation can be reasonably estimated.  Based on  currently
available  information and analysis,  the  company  believes
that  it  is reasonably possible that costs associated  with
all  identified sites may exceed current accruals by amounts
that  may  prove insignificant or that could range,  in  the
aggregate,  up  to approximately $140 million  over  several
years.  This estimate of the upper end of the range of  rea-
sonably possible additional costs is much less certain  than
the  estimates upon which accruals are currently based,  and
is  based on assumptions less favorable to the company among
the  range  of reasonably possible outcomes.  In  estimating
both its current reserves for environmental remediation  and
the  possible range of additional future costs, the  company
has  assumed  that  it  will not bear  the  entire  cost  of
remediation  of every site to the exclusion of  other  known
potentially  responsible parties  who  may  be  jointly  and
severally   liable.    The  ability  of  other   potentially
responsible  parties  to participate  has  been  taken  into
account, based generally on each party's financial condition
and  probable contribution on a per-site basis.  No  amounts
have  been  recorded for potential recoveries from insurance
carriers.
 WRECO  is  exposed to contingent liabilities  arising  from
joint-venture   participations  and  real   estate   limited
partnerships as described in Note 19.
 As  of  December  26,  1993,  WFS  was  committed  to  fund
approximately $397,812 in mortgage loans, of which  $111,627
was  with affiliates.  Included in WFS's funding commitments
were  approximately $227,324 of commitments to fund mortgage
loans  at floating prices.  WFS had firm agreements with in-
vestors  for  the sale of loans in the aggregate  amount  of
approximately  $523,326  as of  December  26,  1993.   WFS's
construction  lending  program,  which  was  principally  in
California,  was  terminated during 1993.  All  construction
loan investments relate to transactions that were originally
committed prior to 1993.  At December 26, 1993, WFS  is com-
mitted  to  fund an additional $13,831 of construction  loan
advances.   Included therein is $9,358 committed to  various
joint  ventures  in  which WFS is a partner.   WFS  recorded
interest  and  fee income of $1,903, $2,165  and  $3,723  on
loans  to  these  partnerships during 1993, 1992  and  1991,
respectively.
 During  the  normal course of business, WFS has sold  loans
with  limited  recourse requirements.   In  accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles, estimated probable
loan  losses and related costs are provided for at the  time
of  such  sales  when deemed appropriate.  At  December  26,
1993,  the  outstanding balance of loans sold  by  WFS  with
recourse  is  approximately $1.1 billion.  In the  event  of
borrower  non-performance, WFS would assume  losses  to  the
extent  they exceed the value of the collateral and  private
mortgage  insurance  or Veterans Administration  guarantees.
WFS  has  not  historically experienced material  losses  on
these recourse obligations.

NOTE 23:
Shareholders' Interest
Preferred and Preference Shares
The company is authorized to issue:
  - 7,000,000 preferred shares having a par value  of  $1.00
per  share,  of  which none were issued and  outstanding  at
December 26, 1993, and December 27, 1992; and
  - 40,000,000 preference shares having a par value of $1.00
per share, of which none were
issued   and   outstanding  at  December   26,   1993,   and
December 27, 1992.
 The  preferred and preference shares may be issued  in  one
or more series with varying rights and preferences including
dividend rates, redemption rights, conversion terms, sinking
fund  provisions, values in liquidation and  voting  rights.
When issued, the outstanding preferred and preference shares
rank senior to outstanding common shares as to dividends and
assets available on liquidation.
 The  company  has reserved but not issued 2,000,000  shares
of  cumulative  preference shares, fourth  series,  for  the
exercise of the rights described under Common Shares.

Common Shares
Common shares reserved for stock option plans and for
conversion of issued and outstanding convertible
subordinated debentures were 5,178,000 shares at December
26, 1993, and 9,021,000 shares at December 27, 1992.  As to

 In  December 1986, the company adopted a Shareholder Rights
Plan  (the  "Plan") and declared a dividend distribution  of
0.6667 right on each outstanding
 
                             72
 <PAGE>
common  share.  Each right entitles its holder to  purchase
after the distribution date and until December 1996 one one-
hundredth  of a share of the company's cumulative preference
shares,  fourth  series,  at a  price  of  $70,  subject  to
adjustment.   The  distribution date is the  earlier  of  20
business days after the announcement that a person or  group
has  acquired  20  percent  or more  of  Weyerhaeuser's  out
standing common shares or 20 business days after a person or
group commences a tender or exchange offer that could result
in  the  person or group owning 30 percent or  more  of  the
company's   outstanding   common  shares.    Following   the
distribution date, if anyone owning 20 percent  or  more  of
the  company's  outstanding common shares  merges  with  the
company, with the company as the survivor, and the company's
common  shares are not changed or exchanged, or  engages  in
certain self-dealing transactions with the company, or if an
event  occurs  that  results  in  such  20  percent  owner's
interest  being increased by more than one percent (e.g.,  a
reverse  stock split), or if anyone acquires 40  percent  or
more  of the company's outstanding common shares, each right
holder, other than such person or group, will be able,  upon
payment of the right's exercise price, to acquire shares  of
the  company's  common stock or other securities  or  assets
having  an aggregate market value equal to twice the right's
purchase  price.   If,  after  the  company  announces  that
someone owns 20 percent or more of the company's outstanding
common shares, the company is acquired in a merger or  other
business  combination, and the company is not the  survivor,
or  the  company  engages  in a  merger  or  other  business
combination  transaction  in  which  the  company   is   the
surviving  corporation but the company's common  shares  are
changed  or  exchanged, or if 50 percent  of  the  company's
earning  power  or assets is sold in one or several  related
transactions, each right holder, other than any  20  percent
shareholder, will receive shares of the acquiring  company's
common  stock  having  a market value  equal  to  twice  the
right's exercise price.  Subject to certain time periods and
conditions,  the Plan may be amended and the rights  may  be
redeemed   at  a  price  of  $.05  per  right,  subject   to
adjustment.



NOTE 24:
Business Segments
The company is principally engaged in the growing and
harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and
sale of forest products.  The four principal business
segments are timberlands and wood products (including
softwood lumber, plywood and veneer; composite panels;
oriented strand board; hardboard; logs; chips; timber;
doors; hardwood lumber and plywood; and treated products);
pulp and paper products (including pulp, newsprint, paper,
containerboard, paperboard and shipping containers,
recycling and chemicals); real estate development and
construction; and financial services.
 The  timber-based  businesses  involve  a  high  degree  of
integration  among  timber  operations;  building  materials
conversion   facilities;   and   pulp,   newsprint,   paper,
containerboard  and  paperboard  primary  manufacturing  and
secondary   conversion   facilities,   including   extensive
transfers of raw materials, semi-finished materials and  end
products  between  and among these groups.   Accounting  for
segment  profitability  involves allocations  of  joint  raw
materials  and  conversion costs and  the  use  of  transfer
prices that attempt to approximate current market values.
