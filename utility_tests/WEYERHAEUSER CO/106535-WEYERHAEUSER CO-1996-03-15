Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser  Company (the company) was incorporated in the  state  of
Washington  in  January 1900, as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.   It  is
principally  engaged  in  growing and harvesting  of  timber  and  the
manufacture,  distribution and sale of forest  products,  real  estate
development  and construction, and financial services.  Its  principal
business  segments include timberlands and wood products; pulp,  paper
and packaging; real estate; and financial services.

Information with respect to the description and general development of
the  company's business, included on pages 35 through 39,  Description
of the Business of the Company, contained in the company's 1995 Annual
Report to Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial  information with respect to industry segments, included  in
Note  19  of Notes to Financial Statements contained in the  company's
1995  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  is  incorporated  herein   by
reference.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The  company  owns  approximately  5.3  million  acres  of  commercial
forestland  in  the United States (49% in the South  and  51%  in  the
Pacific   Northwest),   most  of  it  highly  productive  and  located
extremely well to serve both domestic and international markets.   The
company  has, additionally, long-term license arrangements  in  Canada
covering  approximately 18.9 million acres (of which 14 million  acres
are  considered  to  be productive forestland).   The  combined  total
timber  inventory  on these U.S. and Canadian lands  is  approximately
244 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which
approximately 75% is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber  varies according to the species, size and quality  of  timber,
and  will  change through time as the mix of these variables  changes.
To  sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the company is
engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species,
precommercial  and commercial thinning, fertilization and  operational
pruning,  all  of  which increase the yield from  its  fee  timberland
acreage.

Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Trial  began in May 1992 in a federal income tax refund case that  the
company  filed  in July 1989 in the United States Claims  Court.   The
complaint  seeks  a refund of federal income taxes  that  the  company
contends  it  overpaid in 1977 through 1983.  The alleged overpayments
are  the result of the disallowance of certain timber casualty  losses
and  certain  deductions claimed by the company  arising  from  export
transactions.   The refund sought was approximately $29 million,  plus
statutory  interest from the dates of the alleged  overpayments.   The
company   settled  the  portion  of  the  case  relating   to   export
transactions  and received a tax refund of approximately $10  million,
plus  statutory interest.  In September 1994, the United States  Court
of  Federal Claims issued an opinion on the casualty loss issues which
will   result   in  the  allowance  of  additional  tax   refunds   of
approximately  $2 million, plus statutory interest.  The  company  has
appealed the decision.

On  March 6, 1992, the company filed a complaint in the Superior Court
for  King County, Washington, against a number of insurance companies.
The   complaint  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  insurance
companies  named  as  defendants are obligated  under  the  terms  and
conditions  of the policies sold by them to the company to defend  the
company  and to pay, on the company's behalf, certain claims  asserted
against  the  company.   The  claims relate to  alleged  environmental
damage  to third-party sites and to some of the company's own property
to  which allegedly toxic material was delivered or on which allegedly
toxic  material  was  placed in the past.  Since  December  1992,  the
company  has agreed to settlements with all but one of the defendants.
In  July  1993, the trial court dismissed 14 of the 35 sites named  in
the  complaint.   In  May  1994, the Washington  State  Supreme  Court
reversed  the  trial court's dismissal of those sites.  Trial  on  two
sites  against the sole remaining defendant began in October 1994  and
resulted  in a jury verdict which awarded damages to the company  with
respect to one of the sites.  Trial on several additional sites  began
in February 1996 and is continuing.

The  company  received  from  the Lane  County,  Oregon  Regional  Air
Pollution Control Authority (LRAPA) a draft Notice of Violation  which
seeks  penalties  for alleged Prevention of Significant  Deterioration
(PSD)  violations at the company's Springfield, Oregon,  particleboard
operations.   LRAPA  informed the company in July 1995  that  it  will
withdraw  its draft Notice of Violation (NOV) and will not seek  fines
or  penalties.  On September 15, 1995, however, LRAPA issued a revised
draft  NOV (the Revised Draft NOV), which alleged that the Springfield
particleboard facility had violated a condition of its Air Contaminant
Discharge Permit (ACDP).  The allegations in the Revised Draft NOV are
based  upon the same facts and circumstances relied upon by  LRAPA  in
the  prior  draft NOV.  The company has contested LRAPA's issuance  of
the Revised Draft NOV.

The  company  has undertaken a review of its 10 major pulp  and  paper
facilities   to   evaluate  the  facilities'   compliance   with   PSD
regulations, and has disclosed the potential of PSD compliance  issues
to seven state agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The  company  is  currently  working  with  the  states  to  negotiate
settlements for the alleged violations.  In April 1995, EPA  Region  X
issued a Notice of Violation to the company and to North Pacific Paper
Corporation  (NORPAC), a joint venture in which  the  company  has  an
80  percent  ownership  interest.  The Notice of  Violation  addresses
alleged  PSD  violations at NORPAC's Longview,  Washington,  newsprint
manufacturing  facility.  A settlement with the  State  of  Washington
that  resolves  all  PSD  issues at the  Longview/NORPAC  complex  was
entered  on  January  26,  1996.  The  company  also  entered  into  a
settlement  with  the State of Oklahoma regarding  the  resolution  of
alleged   PSD   violations  at  the  company's   Valliant,   Oklahoma,
containerboard  manufacturing  facility  on  November  14,  1995.  The
company  has  entered into Special Orders by Consent (SOCs)  with  the
State of North Carolina to resolve alleged PSD issues at its New Bern,
North  Carolina, pulp mill and its Plymouth, North Carolina, pulp  and
paper complex.

The Washington State Department of Ecology investigated the accidental
release  of  chorine, chlorine dioxide and non-condensable  gasses  in
July  1994  at the company's pulp mill in Longview, and issued  a  $10
thousand  penalty  for the chlorine release and a $5 thousand  penalty
for  the  non-condensable gasses release which have been paid  by  the
company.  In June 1995, EPA issued an Administrative Complaint against
the company, seeking penalties of $225 thousand and alleging a failure
to timely report the chlorine release.  The company has appealed.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings - Continued
- --------------------------------------

On  April  9, 1993, the company entered into a Stipulated Final  Order
(SFO)  with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for alleged
air  emissions in excess of permit levels and PSD noncompliance at the
company's  North  Bend,  Oregon,  containerboard  facility.   The  SFO
establishes  a compliance schedule for installing control  technology.
A  supplemental  SFO assessed upfront penalties of $247  thousand  and
penalties of $500 per day until compliance is demonstrated.   The  SFO
required  demonstrated compliance by December 1993  and  a  historical
evaluation  of  the facility's PSD status.  The company  submitted  an
initial  PSD  review to the state in December 1993.  A revised  report
was delivered to the state in March 1995.

On  November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company  in  the
Circuit  Court  for  the  First Judicial  District  of  Hinds  County,
Mississippi,  on  behalf  of a purported class  of  riparian  property
owners in Mississippi and Alabama whose properties are located on  the
Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar  Creek  and  the
Magoway  Creek.   The complaint seeks $1 billion in  compensatory  and
punitive  damages for diminution in property value, personal  injuries
and mental anguish allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous  substances, including dioxins and furans, by the  company's
pulp  and  paper  mill  in  Columbus,  Mississippi,  and  the  alleged
fraudulent  concealments of such discharge.  The complaint also  seeks
an injunction prohibiting future releases and the removal of hazardous
substances  allegedly released in the past.  On  August  20,  1993,  a
companion action was filed in Greene County, Alabama, on behalf  of  a
similar  purported class of riparian owners with essentially the  same
claims  as the Mississippi case.  By order dated April 5, 1995,  venue
of  the Alabama action was transferred to Sumter County, Alabama.   On
January 20, 1995, the court in the Alabama action certified a class of
all  persons  who, as of the date the action commenced, were  riparian
owners,  lessees and licensees of properties located on the  Tennessee
Tombigbee  Waterway in Greene, Sumter, Pickens and  Marengo  counties,
Alabama,  and Lowndes and Noxubee counties, Mississippi, to  determine
whether  the  company  is  liable to the  members  of  the  class  for
compensatory  and/or punitive damages and to determine the  amount  of
punitive  damages, if any, to be awarded to the class as a whole.   By
order dated April 12, 1995, as orally amended on February 1, 1996, the
geographical  boundaries of the class were amended to run  from  below
the   Columbus  mill's  wastewater  discharge  pipe  just  above   the
confluence  of  the  Black Warrior River and the  Tennessee  Tombigbee
Waterway.  The class is estimated to range from approximately 1,000 to
1,500  members.  Neither the Mississippi action nor the Alabama action
is presently scheduled for trial.

The  company  is also a party to various proceedings relating  to  the
clean-up   of   hazardous   waste  sites   under   the   Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly  known
as  "Superfund," and similar state laws.  The EPA and/or various state
agencies  have  notified  the company that it  may  be  a  potentially
responsible  party with respect to other hazardous waste sites  as  to
which  no  proceedings have been instituted against the company.   The
company   is  also  a  party  to  other  legal  proceedings  generally
incidental to its business.  Although the final outcome of  any  legal
proceeding  is  subject  to  a  great many  variables  and  cannot  be
predicted with any degree of certainty, the company presently believes
that  any  ultimate  outcome  resulting  from  the  legal  proceedings
discussed  herein, or all of them combined, would not have a  material
effect  on  the  company's current financial  position,  liquidity  or
results  of operations; however, in any given future reporting period,
such  legal  proceedings could have a material effect  on  results  of
operations.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There  were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders  during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.

Item  7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
and Results of Operations
- -------------------------

On  February  28,  1996, the company signed an  agreement  to  acquire
ownership  and long-term leases to 661,200 acres of private commercial
forestland  and  two sawmills in southeastern Louisiana  and  southern
Mississippi  from Cavenham Forest Industries, a subsidiary  of  Hansen
Plc,  for  $500 million.  This acquisition is not expected to  have  a
significant impact on the company's financial position or liquidity.

In  the  fourth quarter of 1995, pulp and paper prices began to weaken
dramatically as customers reduced purchases in order to reduce  excess
inventories.   These prices continued to decline in the first  quarter
of  1996.   This will result in significantly lower operating earnings
in  the  company's  pulp,  paper and packaging  segment.   This  price
weakness  is expected to continue until the excess inventory situation
corrects itself.

Additional  information  with respect to Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis included on pages 7, 14-17, 19, 24-27 and 32-44; contained in

We  have  audited  in  accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards,   the  financial  statements  included  in   Weyerhaeuser
Company's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this   Form   10-K,  and  have  issued  our  report  thereon   dated
February 12, 1996.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
opinion  on those statements taken as a whole.  The schedule  listed
on  page 14 is the responsibility of the company's management and is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's   rules  and  is  not  part  of  the  basic   financial
statements.   This  schedule  has been  subjected  to  the  auditing
procedures  applied  in the audit of the basic financial  statements
and,  in  our  opinion, fairly states in all material  respects  the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation  to  the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

 The Weyerhaeuser Pulp, Paper and Packaging sector reported record earnings
in 1995. This accomplishment reflects the strength of the rebound in pulp
and paper markets and implementation of business improvement plans.  Sector
operating earnings for the year reached $1.2 billion as compared with 
$211 million in 1994.

 As one of the world's largest producers of pulp, paper and packaging products,
Weyerhaeuser benefited from the dramatic rise in prices during 1995.  As the
cycle matures, only those companies that efficiently execute a strategy
focused on maximizing return on invested capital will achieve improvements in
profitability that create continued, sustained growth in shareholder value. 

 Weyerhaeuser, including its Pulp, Paper and Packaging sector, is taking the
essential steps to be such a company.  The sector's highest priority is to
increase the return earned on invested capital across the cycle by improving
operating performance of in-place capital and exercising disciplined
allocation of new capital.

 The sector has committed to business improvement plans designed to produce
$300 million in additional sustainable pretax operating earnings by the end
of 1997 based on 1994 prices and costs.  In 1995, significant progress was
made on these plans that have positively impacted bottom-line results.  The
plans encompass increasing volume, reducing waste, improving quality and
product mix and reducing cost through improved operational efficiency.
Progress in high performance work systems is driving these improvements.
Changes in the way we do our work are creating an environment of empowerment
and teamwork in which employees take ownership of their performance and the
performance of the business process. Through increased training, we will
improve work processes and alignment to truly empower people to help maximize
performance of mills and machines.

 An efficient, up-to-date asset base is key to achieving excellence

                             14

in manufacturing. Modernization projects were completed in 1995 at three major
pulp and paper complexes that enable core businesses - pulp, containerboard
and fine paper - to improve product quality to meet customer demands, to
increase volume and productivity and to substantially reduce costs.  These
state-of-the-art upgrades also ensure responsible environmental performance.

 An important part of sector growth will continue to come through strategic
acquisitions to enhance core businesses.  The purchase of nine box plants
from Westvaco in 1995 fits well with the company's fully integrated paper
and packaging system, increases internal utilization of Weyerhaeuser
containerboard production and adds new markets and customer-service
capability while boosting packaging capacity.

 Satisfying customer requirements remains a cornerstone for success.  Sector
businesses serve customers around the world.  Our presence in select
international markets brings distinct competitive advantages to the company.
Expansion will continue in markets where product specifications are more
demanding and market prices less volatile.

 All sector businesses are developing closer partnerships with customers that
are based upon a shared quest for world-class quality.  Thorough understanding
of customers' markets, goals and internal systems creates the framework for
such partnerships. Experience shows that this kind of partnership leads to
higher levels of innovation and differentiation from the competition.  Most
importantly, the partnership can generate signficant savings for both
companies, enabling Weyerhaeuser to emerge as a preferred partner as customers
narrow their number of suppliers.

 All major businesses realized outstanding achievements in 1995:

  - The Pulp business, the world's largest producer of market pulp, attained
record financial performance as a result of strong market demand, signficantly
improved prices, effective control of operating costs and intense

                             15
<PAGE>

focus by employees upon business improvement plans.

  - Containerboard Packaging, one of North America's largest fully integrated
producers of corrugated boxes, continued to grow and deliver solid financial
performance and returns on capital during a year of increasingly difficult
market conditions and fierce competition. A new containerboard machine at a
joint venture, the Cedar River Paper Company, started up three months early,
12 percent below budget and cost, and reached design production level in
five months.  This facility also won the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's STAR Worksite Award for safety. Nine box plants were
acquired from Westvaco. A linerboard machine at Plymouth, North Carolina,
was rebuilt to produce 100 percent recycled board. The Valliant, Oklahoma,
containerboard mill was honored by the company for surpassing two million
work hours without a single lost workday.

  - The Fine Paper business nearly tripled its previous record profits and
registered solid returns on capital through a combination of higher prices,
record performance on all operating measures, product-mix enhancements and
implementation of business improvement plans. Product quality measures and
on-time delivery performance also reached record highs.

  - The Recycling business, one of the largest recyclers in North America,
increased its volume of paper collected and processed by 35 percent, to
2.8 million tons. This business consistently ensures a steady stream of
recycled fiber to Weyerhaeuser mills and strategic third-party customers.
During the peak of 1995's volatile recycled fiber market, Weyerhaeuser's
Recycling business contributed greatly to the fiber security of company
mills while helping the paper industry progress toward its goal of 50 percent
paper recovery by the year 2000. Nine new facilities were added in 1995,
bringing the number of recycling collection centers to 36. The business
plans to improve upon capital returns while doubling volume by 1998.

                             16
<PAGE>

  - The Newsprint business also benefited from the upswing in prices,
further growth with its key customers and operating improvements that
helped deliver strong increases in earnings and returns in 1995. Through
our newsprint joint venture, the North Pacific Paper Corporation (NORPAC),
this business is the leading foreign supplier to markets in Japan. The
U.S. Department of Commerce awarded NORPAC its prestigious E-Award for
excellence in export sales. An independent survey of domestic customers
also recognized NORPAC as the leader in quality, service and overall
customer satisfaction. Located in Longview, Washington, NORPAC also achieved
record levels of safety performance, recording a year without a lost-time
accident.

  - The Bleached Paperboard business successfully grew its market share
throughout the Pacific Rim by increasing focus on customer requirements and
new product introductions. It is a leading supplier to liquid packaging
markets in Japan.  A machine rebuild and the fiberline modernization at the
Longview site were completed and will further strengthen Weyerhaeuser's
competitive position.

 The sector's goals are to be valued by its customers as a source of
world-class quality and distinctive customer service and to be recognized
by shareholders as a source of superior returns and the creation of
sustained value. These goals will be achieved by leading the industry in
product quality through a better understanding of customer needs, cost
efficiency through manufacturing excellence, and innovation in marketing,
sales and product development.

 The company's Timberlands and Wood Products sector reported operating
earnings of $808 million in 1995. While below the record earnings of
$1.034 billion achieved in 1994, these results were, by historical standards,
very good.

 The decrease from last year's record performance was caused by a drop in
domestic housing starts resulting from higher mortgage interest rates in the
first half of the year. Lower demand for wood products for North American new
home construction was somewhat offset by remodeling and commercial building.
The continued decline in western timber harvests coincided with the lower
demand for wood products and maintained log and timber prices.

 The strong 1995 performance can be attributed to maintaining business focus
and attaining the 1995 targets defined in the sector's 1990 improvement
plans. Timberlands and Wood Products will continue this focus by relentlessly
pursuing superior understanding of customer requirements and continuous
improvements in operating performance. This strategy will also drive the
$300 million in new pretax operating profit improvements that the Timberlands
and Wood Products sector plans to put in place by the end of 1997.

 In 1995, Wood Products concentrated on reducing its operating costs,
improving the recovery of products from raw materials and increasing overall
product value. This focus on cost, productivity and value forms the
cornerstone of the sector's improvement plans and encompasses thousands of
opportunities. For example, improving saw design and the saw-filing process
in a single mill eliminated over 700 truckloads of sawdust generated each
year while producing higher value lumber and chips and, as a result, improved
revenues. Replication of such practices throughout the system will make a
major impact on Weyerhaeuser's bottom line.

 To improve productivity at mills, teams are concentrating on preventive
maintenance by identifying potential failures before they can occur. To
achieve this, Wood Products is installing

                             24
<PAGE>

advanced computer systems. As part of a systematic approach to maintenance,
networked personal computers are used to place all vital data at employee
fingertips - including safety procedures, work plans, preventive maintenance,
scheduling information and parts inventories. The benefits are improved
machine reliability, less unscheduled downtime, lower maintenance costs and
increased worker safety.

 Markets for lumber softened from 1994 levels. However, by continuing to
focus on customers, target segments and improving recovery, Wood Products was
able to produce and market higher lumber volumes in all of its product
regions.  Weyerhaeuser's Wood Products businesses continue to benefit from
the company's geographic diversification.

 Structural-panel demand and prices were strong in 1995. This was largely
caused by the continued growth of engineered wood products and healthy demand
in the repair and remodel market and in nonresidential construction.

 The Hardwood Lumber business delivered excellent returns in 1995, and the
company acquired new hardwood facilities.  Weyerhaeuser purchased two
sawmills and 9,000 acres of forestlands from Diamond Wood Products in Oregon,
as well as a mill in Sedro Woolley, Washington.

 The Building Materials Distribution business continues to maximize
Weyerhaeuser's strength as an integrated supplier of wood products to
North American markets. This business enables the company to meet a wide range
of customer requirements and allows Weyerhaeuser-made products to reach their
highest-value markets. The distribution business continued to expand its
geographic reach by adding five new centers in 1995.

 Success in achieving profit improvements in all our businesses depends
heavily on success in achieving work systems improvements. These improvements
begin at the executive level, and for that reason, senior managers are
modeling desired teaming behaviors and becoming "champions for change."

                             25
<PAGE>

This is part of a larger strategy that includes benchmarking, training and
implementing best work practices to contain cost and improve efficiency. Such
training and benchmarking provide Weyerhaeuser people with a greater
understanding of what it takes to excel in customer satisfaction, which, in
turn, allows decision making at the level closest to the work process. The
systems that emerge from such strong employee involvement benefit both
customers and shareholders by giving all employees a greater role in meeting
customer requirements.

 Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands operations, the world's largest private owner
of merchantable softwood timber, provides a substantial portion of the wood
fiber used in the company's manufacturing operations - from traditional
solid-wood products and engineered fiber products to a variety of paper,
pulp and packaging products.

 Since its founding in 1900, Weyerhaeuser has managed its forestlands by the
principle of long-term stewardship.  Forest-management practices have evolved
dramatically in the last 95 years, driven by advances in scientific knowledge
and shifts in public expectations. In 1966, for example, Weyerhaeuser began
to systematically apply science to its timberlands to encourage the
sustainable, vigorous growth of healthy, high-quality trees. The productivity
and quality produced by 30 years of intensive forest management will begin to
impact Weyerhaeuser's harvests within the next five years. By the year 2020,
the company will have a 25 percent increase in yields on its land in the
Pacific Northwest and a 70 percent increase in yields on its land base in the
South. These high-quality forests should generate tremendous shareholder
value in the future as they have done in the past.

 Today the company's vision of stewardship is even broader.  Weyerhaeuser is
aware of the need to address public expectations for managed industrial
forests and the need to do so in a way that protects shareholder value. As a
result, Weyerhaeuser is working with

                             26
<PAGE>

regulatory agencies to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species
living in Weyerhaeuser forests while protecting the economic value of the
land. In 1995, the company passed a major milestone when it obtained approval
from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for a Habitat Conservation Plan on
210,000 acres of the company's Millicoma Tree Farm near Coos Bay, Oregon.
Under this plan, the company can both continue its harvesting operations and
complement federal efforts for the recovery of the northern spotted owl.

 Also in 1995, the company further illustrated its leadership in habitat
conservation by conducting the research needed to develop multi-species
habitat management plans on 500,000 acres in Washington and Oregon. Working
with adjacent landowners and other interested stakeholders, the company
continues to conduct watershed analyses in major watersheds where it owns
property in Washington and Oregon. These efforts comprise a key part of the
solution to address concern over salmon habitat in Northwest forests, and
many will eventually be part of the company's multi-species habitat
management plans.

 In 1994, Timberlands further strengthened its stewardship commitment with
the adoption of the Weyerhaeuser Forestry Resource Strategies. The Resource
Strategies provide broad operating guidelines for producing a sustainable
supply of wood while protecting the full range of natural resources found in
the company's forests, including soil, water and wildlife. In 1995,
Timberlands made substantial progress toward establishing specific
stewardship goals and measurement standards in each of its operating regions.

 Intensive management of industrial forests has become a global industry.
To increase its competitive position, Weyerhaeuser is forming a joint-venture
partnership with institutional investors to acquire timberlands and related
assets around the world.

Real Estate and Financial Services.

 Sector earnings before the special charge were $13 million for the year
compared with 1994 earnings of $18 million.  High home mortgage interest
rates in the early months of the year affected Weyerhaeuser's Real Estate
and Financial Services businesses in 1995.

 The sector's business improvement plans are based on a dual strategy.
That strategy consists of liquidating assets that are impaired or poorly
performing and increasing the focus on primary businesses and markets.
Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company is concentrating on home building and land
development in Southern California, Las Vegas, Houston, Washington, D.C.
and Puget Sound.

 Weyerhaeuser Financial Services is increasing loan production by using
existing locations and expanded strategic alliances. Loan quality, customer
satisfaction and cost-effectiveness are being improved by applying
state-of-the-art technology to originating, processing and servicing loans.

 In 1995, the company announced that it was taking a charge to earnings to
reflect revaluation of certain real estate assets within Weyerhaeuser Real
Estate Company and Weyerhaeuser Financial Services. The after-tax amount of
the charge was $184 million. The charge was recorded to comply with a
Financial Accounting Standards Board statement, which changes the method of
valuing long-lived assets and assets to be disposed of, and by the company's
decision to accelerate the disposition of some of the affected real estate
assets. The company plans to dispose of most of the impaired assets over the
next two years.

1995 Events and Accomplishments

People

 Safety remains the highest priority for Weyerhaeuser people.  Lost-time
accidents decreased 30 percent - from a rate of 1.17 per 100 employees in
1994 to 0.86 per 100 employees in 1995. Over the past five years, the
lost-time accident rate has improved 70 percent, a tribute to the efforts and
vigilance of Weyerhaeuser employees everywhere.

 Many Weyerhaeuser units achieved outstanding safety milestones in 1995.
The Valliant, Okla., containerboard mill surpassed two million work hours
without a single lost workday. The Mississippi/Alabama Timberlands team
completed nine years, more than 1.3 million workhours without a lost-time
accident or injury. North Carolina Timberlands surpassed five years, or
1.5 million workhours without a lost-time accident. A Weyerhaeuser joint
venture, the Cedar River Paper Company, won the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's STAR Worksite Award for safety, and another joint
venture, the North Pacific Paper Corporation, achieved a new record for
safety performance and recorded a year without a lost-time accident.

 In May, Weyerhaeuser President John W. Creighton, Jr., formed a task force
to help foster diversity in the workplace - a corporate area of emphasis
outlined in 1995.

 Two pioneers of High Yield Forestry passed away: George R. Staebler, former
director of forestry research, and Royce O. Cornelius, former chief forest
engineer. Both were retired.

 Norton Clapp, former Weyerhaeuser president and chairman of the board, died
in April. During his 36 years of service to Weyerhaeuser Company, Clapp
served as company secretary, vice president, president, director and chairman
of the board. Clapp served as president during a pivotal period in its
growth - from 1960 to 1966 - and made significant civic contributions both
locally and nationally.

Customers

Pulp, Paper and Packaging's box plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, achieved a major
quality milestone by registering under ISO 9000 standards. ISO, the only
internationally recognized quality standard, defines a model for quality
systems. The registration process requires extensive documentation of
quality processes, direct evidence of quality system effectiveness and
periodic audits to ensure conformance with registration requirements.

 Wood Products carried its Manufacturing Excellence Award program into its
second year. The award encourages all manufacturing units to attain
top-quartile performance in their respective businesses and to raise
standards of manufacturing to world-class levels. Winners were the Elkin,
N.C., oriented strand board (OSB) mill, which also won the award in 1994;
the Grayling, Mich., OSB mill, and the Marshfield, Wis., Steam-Thru
particleboard facility, which was a finalist last year.

 Weyerhaeuser Canada's Edson, Alta., OSB mill was awarded the Structural
Board Association's Ron Baker Memorial Award for Manufacturing Excellence.
The international award recognizes superior quality, productivity,
environmental sensitivity and safety. Weyerhaeuser's Drayton Valley, Alta.,
OSB mill finished second.

 Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown presented the NORPAC newsprint mill in
Longview, Wash., with a Presidential "E" Award for Excellence in Exporting.
The company was recognized for its success in international markets.
President John W. Creighton, Jr., was named the 1995 recipient of the
prestigious Prime Minister's Trade Award by the Japanese government. The
award is given annually to an individual whose contributions have helped
improve the balance of trade and promote mutual understanding on trade issues.

Citizenship

 Fortune magazine ranked Weyerhaeuser number one among forest products
companies for "responsibility to the community and environment" in its
1994 Corporate Reputation Survey. Weyerhaeuser demonstrated its environmental
leadership in 1995 by:

  - Completing ten watershed analyses in Washington and Oregon.  Weyerhaeuser
has completed 21 assessments in the Northwest covering 446,000 acres of its
forestland since 1993.

  - Achieving capability to manufacture elemental chlorine-free pulp products
at all of its bleached kraft mills.

  - Converting its containerboard machines in Plymouth, N.C., and North Bend,
Ore., to use 100 percent recycled wastepaper.

  - Signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Forest Service and
USFWS to protect the red-cockaded woodpecker by managing habitat on
Weyerhaeuser lands near the Croatan National Forest in eastern North Carolina.

  - Receiving the American Forest & Paper Association's Environmental and
Energy Achievement Award for air-pollution control at the company's Grayling,
Mich., OSB mill.

  - Signing a partnership agreement with the National Wild Turkey Federation
to promote conservation of the wild turkey on 2.6 million acres of
Weyerhaeuser forestlands in the South. The agreement formalizes a cooperative
relationship that Weyerhaeuser has had with the Federation for many years.

  - Reaching agreement with five environmental groups to develop management
criteria for protecting wildlife habitat, water quality, unique wetlands
sites and rare plants on the company's lands on the Albemarle-Pamlico
Peninsula in North Carolina. The agreement with the Environmental Defense
Fund, National Audubon Society, Sierra Club, North Carolina Wildlife
Federation and North Carolina Coastal Federation brings to a close the
groups' legal challenge of the company's forestry practices on those lands.

 The Washington State Department of Transportation, the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation and Weyerhaeuser Company jointly opened the Charles W. Bingham
Forest Learning Center.  Located near the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic
Monument, the Forest Learning Center was dedicated on May 18, the fifteenth
anniversary of the volcano's eruption.

 The Weyerhaeuser Company Foundation, the company's principal vehicle for
philanthropy, was recognized by the Professional Educators of North Carolina,
Inc., for outstanding service to education. In 1995, the Foundation surpassed
the $100 million mark for contributions made since 1948.

Description of the Business of the Company

Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated in the
state of Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser Timber
Company. It is principally engaged in the growing and
harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and
sale of forest products, real estate development and
construction, and financial services.

The company has 39,400 employees, of whom 37,500 are
employed in its timber-based businesses, and of this number,
approximately 17,000 are covered by collective bargaining
agreements, which generally are negotiated on a multi-year
basis.

Approximately 1,900 of the company's employees are involved
in the activities of its real estate and financial services
subsidiaries.

The major markets, both domestic and foreign, in which the
company sells its products are highly competitive, with
numerous strong sellers competing in each. Many of the
company's products also compete with substitutes for wood
and wood fiber products. The real estate and financial ser-
vices subsidiaries also operate in highly competitive mar-
kets, competing with numerous regional and national firms in
real estate development and construction and in financial
services.

In 1995, the company's sales to customers outside the United
States totaled $2.9 billion (including exports of $1.9 bil-
lion from the United States and $1 billion of Canadian
export and domestic sales), or 25 percent of total
consolidated sales and revenues. The company believes these
sales contributed a higher proportion of aggregate operating
profits (see Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements). All
sales to customers outside the United States are subject to
risks related to international trade and to political,
economic and other factors that vary from country to
country.

Principal Business Segments

Timberlands and Wood Products

The company owns approximately 5.3 million acres of com-
mercial forestland in the United States (49 percent in the
South and 51 percent in the Pacific Northwest), most of it
highly productive and located extremely well to serve both
domestic and international markets. The company has, addi-
tionally, long-term license arrangements in Canada covering
approximately 18.9 million acres (of which 14 million acres
are considered to be productive forestland). The combined
total timber inventory on these U.S. and Canadian lands is
approximately 244 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet
of solid wood), of which approximately 75 percent is soft-
wood species. The relationship between cubic measurement and
the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber varies according to the species, size and quality of
timber, and will change through time as the mix of these
variables changes. To sustain the timber supply from its fee
timberlands, the company is engaged in extensive planting,
suppression of nonmerchantable species, precommercial and
commercial thinning, fertilization and operational pruning,
all of which increase the yield from its fee timberland
acreage.

The company's wood products businesses produce and sell
softwood lumber, plywood and veneer; composite panels;
oriented strand board; hardboard; hardwood lumber and
plywood; doors; treated products; logs; chips and timber.
These products are sold primarily through the company's own
sales organizations. Building materials are sold to whole-
salers, retailers and industrial users.

Pulp, Paper and Packaging

The company's pulp, paper and packaging businesses include:
Pulp, which manufactures chemical wood pulp for world
markets; Newsprint, which manufactures newsprint at the
company's North Pacific Paper Corporation mill and markets
it to West Coast and Japanese newspaper publishers; Paper,
which manufactures and markets a range of both coated and
uncoated fine papers through paper merchants and printers;
Containerboard Packaging, which manufactures linerboard and
corrugating medium, which is primarily used in the
production of corrugated packaging, and manufactures and
markets industrial and agricultural packaging; Paperboard,
which manufactures and markets bleached paperboard, used for
production of liquid containers, to West Coast and Pacific
Rim customers; Recycling, which operates an extensive
wastepaper collection system and markets it to company mills
and worldwide customers; and Chemicals, which produces
chlorine, caustic and tall oil, which are used principally
by the company's pulp, paper and packaging operations.

In 1993, the Personal Care Products business, which manufac-
tured disposable diapers sold under the private-label brands
of many of North America's largest retailers, was sold
through an initial public offering of stock.

Environmental Matters

In 1990 the northern spotted owl was listed as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
In 1992 the marbled murrelet was listed as a threatened
species under the ESA. Certain Snake River salmon runs
have been listed as threatened or endangered under the
ESA. The National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed
listing coho salmon that spawn in Oregon coastal rivers
and some cutthroat trout as a threatened species.
Petitions have been filed to list certain Pacific
Northwest salmon runs and other fish populations as
threatened or endangered under the ESA. A consequence of
these listings has been, and a possible consequence of
future listings may be, reductions in the sale and harvest
of timber on federal timberlands in the Pacific Northwest.
Requirements to protect habitat for threatened and
endangered species on non-federal timberlands has
resulted, and may in the future result, in restrictions on
timber harvest on some non-federal timberlands in the
Pacific Northwest, including some timberlands of the
company. The listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker as an
endangered species under the ESA has had some impact on
the harvest of public and private timber in the
southeastern United States, but has had little impact on
the company's timberlands. Forest practice acts in some of
the states in which the company has timber increasingly
impact present or future harvests and forest management
activities. In addition, the statutory requirements with
respect to the protection of wetlands and threatened or
endangered species may affect future harvest and forest
management practices on some of the company's southern
timberlands.

In April 1994, the Clinton administration adopted its plan
with respect to management of federal timberlands in the
Pacific Northwest. This plan has reduced timber sales from
certain federal lands in western Washington, western
Oregon and northern California by more than 75 percent

                              37
<PAGE>

from harvest levels in the 1980s. This reduction in
federal timber sales will seriously reduce log supplies to
many independent sawmills that have been important
suppliers of wood chips to the company's pulp and paper
mills in Washington and Oregon. The company anticipates
that there will be alternate sources of wood chips or
other fiber.

The administration also has stated that reduced timber
harvest on federal lands will provide the opportunity to
clarify the uncertainty surrounding federal policies for
protection of northern spotted owls on some private
lands. On February 7, 1995, the administration proposed a
special rule to clarify federal harvest restrictions on
some private lands in Washington and California. The
company believes that the regulatory changes might
ultimately allow it to harvest fee timber in some areas
where it has not been operating because of uncertainties
regarding regulations intended to protect the northern
spotted owl. Whether those regulatory changes will be
implemented is uncertain.  If those regulatory changes are
not implemented, the company may not harvest some timber
that it otherwise might harvest in late 1996 and 1997.

Because those regulatory changes may not be implemented,
and in order to avoid existing uncertainty under the ESA,
the company, in February 1995, developed a Habitat
Conservation Plan (HCP) and obtained from the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service an Incidental Take Permit
with respect to northern spotted owls on most of its
Oregon coastal timber lands. That HCP establishes a
protocol for the harvest of timber and the protection of
the northern spotted owl on those timberlands and is
expected to remain in effect for at least 50 years. The
company believes the most effective way to manage its
timberlands for the growth and harvest of timber and the
protection of wildlife and fish habitat is to develop
comprehensive plans for the management of all the
resources on those timberlands. Accordingly, the company
is seeking to develop HCPs or other arrangements with
federal and state fish and wildlife agencies for some
other parts of its Pacific Northwest timberlands that
would address the protection of wildlife and fish habitat
for both listed and non-listed species.

The combination of the forest management and harvest
restrictions and impacts described in the preceding four
paragraphs has increased operating costs, resulted in in-
creases in the value of timber and logs from the company's
Pacific Northwest timberlands, and contributed to
increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood
chips. The company does not know whether these effects
will continue. One additional effect may be the
continuation of some reduced usage of, and some
substitution of other products for, lumber and plywood.

The company does not believe that the restrictions and
impacts described in the above paragraphs have had, or in
1996 or 1997 will have, a significant effect on the com-
pany's total harvest of timber, although they may have
such an effect in the future.

In addition to the foregoing, the company is subject to
federal, state or provincial and local air, water and land
pollution control, solid and hazardous waste management,
disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas
in which it has operations, and to market demands with
respect to chemical content of some products and use of re-
cycled fiber. Compliance with these laws, regulations and
demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as
operating costs. The company cannot easily quantify future
amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with
these laws, regulations and demands, or the impact on
operating costs, because in some instances compliance
standards have not been developed or have not become final
or definitive. In addition, compliance with standards
frequently serves other purposes such as extension of
facility life, increase in capacity, changes in raw
material requirements, or increase in economic value of
assets or products. While it is difficult to isolate the
environmental component of most manufacturing capital
projects, the company estimates that capital expenditures
for environmental compliance were approximately 5 percent
of total capital expenditures in 1995. Based on its understanding
of current regulatory requirements, the company expects
that this percentage will range from 10 to 11 percent of
total capital expenditures in 1996 and 1997.

The company is involved in the environmental remediation
of numerous sites, including 41 superfund sites where the
company has been named as a potentially responsible party.
Some of the sites are on property presently or formerly
owned by the company where the company has the sole
obligation to remediate the site or shares that obligation
with one or more parties, and others are third-party sites
involving several parties who have a joint and several
obligation to remediate the site. The company's liability
with respect to these sites ranges from insignificant at
some sites to substantial at others, depending on the
quantity, toxicity and nature of materials deposited by
the company at the site and, with respect to some sites,
the number and economic viability of the other responsible
parties.

The company spent $39 million in 1995 and expects to spend
$29 million in 1996 on environmental remediation of these
sites. It is the company's policy to accrue for environ-
mental remediation costs when it is determined that it is
probable that such an obligation exists and the amount of

                             38
<PAGE>

the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Based on
currently available information and analysis, the company
believes that it is reasonably possible that costs
associated with all identified sites may exceed current
accruals by amounts that may prove insignificant or that
could range, in the aggregate, up to approximately $120
million over several years. This estimate of the upper
end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs
is much less certain than the estimates upon which
accruals are currently based and utilizes assumptions
less favorable to the company among the range of
reasonably possible outcomes.

An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation under
Title 5 of the Clean Air Act requires additional operating
permits at many of the company's manufacturing operations.
Although significant work is required to prepare the
permit applications in 1996 and 1997, the company
anticipates that it will be able to obtain the necessary
permits.

The company has continued to make substantial progress in
reducing the minute amount of dioxin that had previously
been detected in wastewater effluent, sludge and pulp from
the company's bleached kraft pulp mills. Using EPA
quantitation limits, the company's analysis of its
effluent discharge reveals no detectable levels of dioxin
at any of the company's pulp mills.

The EPA published proposed regulations on December 17,
1993, known as the "cluster rules," which would establish
maximum achievable control technology standards for non-
combustion sources under the Clean Air Act, and the
development of revised wastewater effluent limitations
under the Clean Water Act. The company's operations are
well positioned to meet the proposed limits for dioxin.
However, if the cluster rules are adopted as proposed,
they will require the company to commit additional capital
to further reduce air emissions and wastewater discharges
by 1999. Preliminary estimates of that additional capital
range as high as $400 million, which may further increase
the annual percentage of the company's total capital
expenditures devoted to environmental compliance.  The EPA
has indicated that it is considering reproposing the cluster
rules. If the cluster rules are reproposed, the company's
understanding of the potential effect is that it will significantly
reduce the amount and timing of capital expenditures to comply with
the rules.

Financial Review

Results of Operations

1995 Compared With 1994

The company's consolidated net sales and revenues
increased 13 percent to a record $11.8 billion in 1995
compared with $10.4 billion in 1994. The pulp, paper and
packaging segment accounted for $5.7 billion of this
record performance, 40 percent over its sales of $4.1
billion in 1994, with strong year-to-year improvement in
all product lines. These markets have weakened in the
fourth quarter, and this weakness may persist in 1996 as
customers continue to reduce inventories. The timberlands
and wood products segment sales of $4.9 billion
approximated last year's. The real estate and financial
services segments had combined sales of $919 million, down
from last year's $1.1 billion, largely attributable to
declines in single-family home sales.

The company also achieved record earnings of $799 million,
or $3.93 per common share, in 1995, which was 36 percent
over the $589 million, or $2.86 per common share, recorded
in 1994. The 1995 earnings were net of an after-tax charge
of $184 million ($290 million pretax), or 90 cents per
common share, within the real estate and financial
services segments. The 1994 earnings included a net
contribution of $.03 per common share for the return of
countervailing duty by the U.S. government against
Canadian lumber imports and the expected cost of
postretirement benefits for Canadian employees.

Operating earnings in the timberlands and wood products
segment were $808 million, down from the record $1 billion
for the previous year. This was attributable to price
declines primarily in softwood lumber, caused by a drop in
domestic housing starts.

The pulp, paper and packaging segment posted record operat-
ing earnings of $1.2 billion in 1995 compared with $211
million earned in 1994. Significant price improvement over
the prior year and ongoing improvements in operations were
the key factors in recovery in this segment.

The company's real estate and financial services segments
recorded a combined operating loss of $277 million for the
year after reflecting the $290 million special charge that
came from two related actions: (1) the implementation of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which
required the company to change its method of valuing long-
lived assets, and (2) the company's decision to accelerate
the disposition of some of the affected assets. Before
these actions, the combined segments earned $13 million
compared with $18 million in 1994.

Weyerhaeuser's cost of products sold as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 69 percent in 1995 compared with 73
percent in 1994. The company continued to benefit from its
mill modernization program and implementation of its
business improvement plans, offset in part by the costs
associated with higher sales activity, principally in the
pulp, paper and packaging segment. Depreciation expense
increased over the prior year as a result of the
completion and start-up of several mill modernization
projects in late 1994 in the pulp, paper and packaging
segment. The expansion of the company's Performance Share
Plan to include all employees was the major contributor to
the $109 million increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Contributions made by the company
into this plan are invested in company stock on behalf of
each employee. The size of the contribution, if any, is
decided by the board of directors each year on the basis
of that year's profits and the company's performance
relative to its competition.

Excluding the revaluation charge, the decrease in costs
and operating expenses of the real estate and financial
services segments are in line with the reduced sales
activity.

Other income (expense) is an aggregation of both recurring
and occasional income and expense items and, as a result,
fluctuates from period to period. No individual income
(expense) item in 1995 was significant in relation to net
earnings.

Weyerhaeuser's interest expense incurred was up $34
million over the prior year as a result of prefunding 1995
debt maturities that were due late in the year as well as
an increase in the company's combined long- and short-term
debt levels. Capitalized interest was $16 million less
than the prior year as mill modernization projects at
Longview, Washington, and Plymouth, North Carolina, were
completed.


1994 Compared With 1993

The company's 1994 consolidated sales and revenues were
$10.4 billion, a 9 percent increase over the $9.5 billion
reported last year. Net earnings were $589 million, or
$2.86 per common share, compared with 1993 net earnings of
$579 million, or $2.83 per common share. 1994 earnings
included the return of countervailing duty by the U.S.
government against Canadian lumber imports and the
expected cost of postretirement benefits for Canadian
employees. The net effect of these two items contributed
$.03 per common share. 1993 earnings included gains of

                              40
<PAGE>

$132 million, or $.65 per common share, from the sale of
assets and extinguishment of debt, and a $15 million, or
$.08 per common share, charge to earnings to reflect the
revised 1993 federal corporate tax rate in the company's
deferred tax accounts.

The continuation in 1994 of the company's major mod-
ernization projects, started in 1993, accounted for the
significant increase in capitalized interest from year to
year.

The significant changes from 1993 in other income were
attributable to the $70 million pretax gain on the
disposal of the company's investment in the infant diaper
business and the real estate and financial services pretax
gain of $42 million on the sale of GNA Corporation, both
in 1993.

The timberlands and wood products segment posted record
operating earnings of $1 billion in 1994, which was a 16
percent increase over the $891 million reported in 1993.
Sales for this segment were $5 billion, up 12 percent over
the $4.5 billion reported in 1993. This segment posted
record performances during 1994 as the businesses continued to
accomplish their business improvement plans, timber
supplies remained tight and markets remained strong
throughout the year.

The pulp, paper and packaging segment's 1994 operating
earnings were $211 million, up substantially from 1993's
$61 million. This segment reported sales of $4.1 billion
for the year, an increase of 14 percent over the $3.6
billion in 1993. Strong demand coupled with continued
price improvement over the prior year in both the domestic
and export pulp, paper and packaging markets were the key
factors in this recovery.

The combined real estate and financial services segments
earned $18 million in 1994 compared with 1993 earnings of
$94 million, which included a pretax gain of $42 million
on the sale of GNA Corporation as well as one quarter of
GNA operating results.


1993 Compared With 1992

Consolidated sales and revenues in 1993 were $9.5 billion,
an increase of 3 percent over 1992. Net earnings were $579
million, or $2.83 per common share, up from 1992 net
earnings of $372 million, or $1.83 per common share.
Included in 1993 net earnings were after-tax gains of:

 . $52 million, or $.25 per common share, from the
extinguishment of debt, which was reported as an
extraordinary item.

 . $44 million, or $.22 per common share, from the sale of
the infant diaper business.

 . $36 million, or $.18 per common share, from the sale of
GNA Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary.

And a charge of $20 million, or $.10 per common share,
which reflected the revised 1993 federal corporate tax rate
in the company's deferred and current tax accounts. This
charge consisted of $.08 per common share due to the effect
of the higher rate on the accumulated temporary differences
at December 27, 1992, and $.02 per common share related to
1993.

The net sales and revenues and related costs and expenses
of real estate and financial services were substantially
less in 1993 when compared with 1992 as a result of the
sale of GNA Corporation.

During 1993 the company refinanced a significant amount of
debt, which resulted in a short-term increase in interest
expense. The increase in capitalized interest over the
prior year coincided with expanded activity in the
company's major capital projects.

The significant decrease in financial services interest
expense was due to the liquidation of Republic Federal
Savings & Loan Association during 1992 and the sale of GNA
Corporation in early 1993. In addition, accelerated prepay-
ments caused by mortgage refinancings significantly reduced
collateralized mortgage obligation bonds.

Significant items in relation to net earnings included in
other income for 1993 were a $70 million pretax gain on the
disposal of the company's investment in the infant diaper
business through a public offering in a new company,
Paragon Trade Brands, Inc., and the real estate and
financial services pretax gain of $42 million on the sale
of GNA Corporation.

The timberlands and wood products operating earnings for
1993 were $891 million, an increase of 73 percent over the
$515 million recorded in 1992. Prices for logs and lumber
exceeded 1992 levels due to increasing demand for housing
construction materials and raw material supply shortages
resulting from reduced harvests in the Western public forests.

The pulp, paper and packaging segment had a $61 million
operating profit in 1993, significantly below the $251
million posted in 1992. Prices for most of the products in
this segment were at levels well below the previous year.
The personal care products business included in this
segment was divested in the first quarter of 1993.

The real estate and financial services segments had oper-
ating earnings of $94 million in 1993 compared with $81
million in 1992.

As a part of the GNA Corporation sales transaction, the
company assumed $225 million of GNA debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

The company is committed to the maintenance of a sound,
conservative capital structure. This commitment is based
upon two considerations: the obligation to protect the
under lying interests of its shareholders and lenders, and
the desire to have access, at all times, to major
financial markets.

The important elements of the policy governing the
company's capital structure are as follows:

 . To view separately the capital structures of Weyerhaeuser
Company, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and Weyerhaeuser
Financial Services, Inc., given the very different nature
of their assets and business activities. The amount of
debt and equity associated with the capital structure of
each will reflect the basic earnings capacity, real value
and unique liquidity characteristics of the assets
dedicated to that business.

 . The combination of maturing short-term debt and the
structure of long-term debt will be managed judiciously to
minimize liquidity risk. Long-term debt maturities are
shown in Note 14 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Operations

The company's consolidated financial position was very
strong in 1995 as it generated $1.9 billion of cash flow
from operations before working capital changes compared
with $1.3 billion in 1994.

Cash flow from operations before changes in working
capital by business segment was as follows:

Weyerhaeuser's net working capital at December 31, 1995,
increased $321 million from the previous year-end. Signifi-
cant factors were an increase of $148 million in
inventories and prepaid expenses, excluding acquisitions,
and a net reduction of $196 million in current portion of
long-term debt, as the 9 1/4 percent and 9.36 percent notes
totaling $300 million, due in 1995, were paid.

Real estate and financial services segments cash flow from
operations was down in 1995. Loan origination activity
exceeded loan sales in the mortgage banking operations
compared with the previous year when sales exceeded
origination activity, creating a net change of $378
million from year to year.

Significant non-recurring items that impacted the cash
flow from operations in 1993 were the $52 million gain on
extinguishment of debt, net of income tax, which was re-
corded as an extraordinary item; the pretax gain of $70
million from the sale of the company's infant diaper
business; and the pretax gain of $42 million from the sale
of GNA Corporation.


Investing

Capital expenditures amounted to $1.1 billion in 1995,
including acquisitions, and $1.1 billion in 1994. They are
currently expected to approximate $900 million in 1996;
however, the expenditures could be increased or decreased
as a consequence of future economic conditions. The
company had approximately $269 million in capital
expenditures committed on major projects at year-end 1995
including construction of its new oriented strand board
mill in West Virginia as well as environmental and
productivity improvement projects at the New Bern, North
Carolina, and Kamloops, British Columbia, pulp and paper
complexes. In addition, near year-end, the company
announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire
241,000 acres of southern private commercial forestland.
The ultimate purchase price could range up to $275 million.

                              42

Recent capital spending, including acquisitions, has been
in the following areas:

Capital assets acquired in 1995, using $77 million of cash
and $46 million of the company's treasury shares, were
three hardwood lumber mills, timber and timberlands, nine
corrugated packaging plants and five recycling collection
facilities.

The change from 1994 to 1995 in the financial services
segment was the result of the sale of adjustable-rate mort-
gages and partnership distributions in 1995 compared with
partnership investments made and the sale of mortgage-
backed certificates in 1994.


Financing

The increases in sales of debentures and industrial
revenue bonds and related payments on debentures,
commercial paper and other debt by Weyerhaeuser in 1995
compared with the prior year are a result of replacing
maturing and higher cost debt with lower-priced
instruments.

Real estate and financial services segments used the
proceeds from the sale of adjustable-rate mortgages and
mortgage loans to reduce total debt from the 1994 ending
balance.

Cash dividends paid on common shares amounted to $306
million in 1995 and $247 million in 1994. The increase in
1995, compared with 1994, is a result of increasing the
quarterly dividend on common shares from 30 cents to 40
cents in the second quarter. Although common share
dividends have exceeded the company's target payout ratio
in recent years, it is our intent, over time, to pay
dividends to our common shareholders in a range of 35 to
45 percent of common share earnings.

As a part of its 10 million share repurchase program an-
nounced in the second quarter of 1995, the company had ac-
quired 8.5 million common shares by year-end at a cost of
$379 million.

To ensure its ability to meet future commitments,
Weyerhaeuser Company, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and
Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of
Weyerhaeuser Financial Services, Inc., have established at
year-end 1995 unused bank lines of credit in the maximum
aggregate sum of approximately $2.5 billion. None of the
entities is a guarantor of the borrowings of the others
under any of these credit facilities.


Contingencies

The company is a party to legal proceedings and environmen-
tal matters generally incidental to its business. Although
the final outcome of any legal proceeding or environmental
matter is subject to a great many variables and cannot be
predicted with any degree of certainty, the company
presently believes that the ultimate outcome resulting
from these proceedings and matters would not have a
material effect on the company's current financial
position, liquidity or results of operations; however, in
any given future reporting period, such proceedings or
matters could have a material effect on results of
operations.


Accounting Matters

Pronouncements

During the year, the company implemented the following
pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB):

 . Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."

 . SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan -- Income Recognition and Disclosures," which amended
SFAS No. 114.

 . SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

 . SFAS No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights --
an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 65."

These statements are described in Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial
Statements.

                             43
<PAGE>

In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation," which requires companies to
change what they disclose about their employee stock-based
compensation plans, recommends that they change the
accounting for these plans to a fair-value based method and
requires those companies that do not change their
accounting to disclose what their earnings and earnings per
share would have been if they had changed. This disclosure
is applicable for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995. The company will
continue to account for these plans using the method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 and will conform to the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for the fiscal year 1996.


Accounting and Reporting Standards Committee

During the year, the Accounting and Reporting Standards
Committee, comprised of four outside directors, reviewed
with the company's management and with its independent
public accountants the scope and results of the company's
internal and external audit activities and the adequacy of
the company's internal accounting controls. The committee
also reviewed current and emerging accounting and reporting
requirements and practices affecting the company.

Other

The company has embarked on a new series of business
improvement plans which targets $600 million in pretax
operating improvements measured in 1994 prices and costs by
year-end 1997.

In 1995, the company announced that it is in private
discussions with potential financial investors about the
possibility of forming a joint-venture partnership that
would make investments in timberlands and related assets
around the world. The size of the venture, of which the
company would be a 50 percent owner, would depend upon the
specific investments made, but could ultimately reach
$1.5 billion over time. The company's contribution to the
joint venture would be U.S. timberlands (with a market
value of approximately $260 million) and cash, while the
investors' group would provide cash contributions of an
equal amount.


Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company (a Washington corporation)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and December 25,
1994, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
cash flows and shareholders' interest for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

For the three-year period ended December 31, 1995

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Weyerhaeuser Company and all of its majority-owned
domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated.

Certain of the consolidated financial statements and notes
to financial statements are presented in two groupings:
(1) Weyerhaeuser Company (Weyerhaeuser, or the company),
which is principally engaged in the growing and harvesting
of timber and the manufacture, distribution and sale of
forest products, and (2) real estate and financial
services, which includes Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company
(WRECO), which is involved in real estate development and
construction, and Weyerhaeuser Financial Services, Inc.
(WFS), whose principal subsidiary is Weyerhaeuser Mortgage
Company (WMC). GNA Corporation, a subsidiary of WFS, was
sold in April 1993.


Nature of Operations

The company's principal business segments, which account
for the majority of sales and earnings and 70 percent of
the asset base, are:

 . Timberlands and wood products, which is engaged in the
management of 5.3 million acres of company-owned
forestland in the United States and 18.9 million acres of
forestland in Canada under long-term licensing
arrangements and the production of a full line of solid
wood products that are sold primarily through the
company's own sales organizations to wholesalers,
retailers and industrial users in North America, the
Pacific Rim and Europe.

 . Pulp, paper and packaging, which manufactures and sells
pulp, newsprint, paper, paperboard and containerboard in
North American, Pacific Rim and European markets, and
packaging products for the domestic markets, and which
operates an extensive wastepaper recycling system that
serves company mills and worldwide markets.


Fiscal Year-End

The company's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of the
year. Fiscal year 1995 had 53 weeks, and fiscal years 1994
and 1993 had 52 weeks.


Changes in Accounting Principles

In 1994, the company implemented the following pronounce-
ments by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB):

 . Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," for its wholly owned subsidiary,
Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd. The adoption of this pronouncement
did not have a significant impact on the company's results
of operations or its financial position.

 . SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," which requires accrual accounting to be used for
the cost of benefits provided to former or inactive
employees who have not yet retired. The adoption of this
pronouncement, which required a cumulative catch-up charge
to earnings, did not have a significant impact on the
company's results of operations or its financial position.

 . SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities," which addresses accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values, and for all investments
in debt securities. The adoption of this pronouncement did
not have a significant impact on the company's results of
operations or its financial position.

In 1995, the company also implemented:

 . SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan," which requires creditors to measure impairment based
on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, and SFAS
No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan
- - Income Recognition and Disclosures," which amended SFAS
No. 114 to allow creditors to use existing methods for
recognizing interest on impaired loans and also requires
creditors to disclose certain information about how
interest income was recognized on impaired loans. The
adoption of these pronouncements did not have a significant
impact on results of operations or financial position.

 . SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which
requires companies to change their method of valuing long-
lived assets. The implementation of this pronouncement,
along with the company's decision to accelerate the dispo-
sition of some of those real estate assets, resulted in a
charge of $290 million to operations. The company currently
plans to dispose of most of the impaired assets over the
next two years. The carrying value of the affected assets
at December 31, 1995, is approximately $291 million.

 . SFAS No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights --
an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 65," which modifies the
treatment of the capitalization of servicing rights by
mortgage banking enterprises. The change constitutes a
simplification in procedures, eliminating the separate
treatment of servicing rights acquired through loan origina-
tion and those acquired through purchasing transactions, as
previously required under SFAS No. 65. The change also
requires that the enterprise periodically evaluate
servicing rights for impairment. The adoption of this
pronouncement by WMC did not have a significant impact on
results of operations or financial position.

                              51

Prospective Accounting Changes

In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation," which requires companies to
change what they disclose about their employee stock-based
compensation plans, recommends that they change the
accounting for these plans to a fair-value based method
and requires those companies that do not change their
accounting to disclose what their earnings and earnings
per share would have been if they had changed. This
disclosure is applicable for financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The
company will continue to account for these plans using the
method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 and will conform to the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for the fiscal year 1996.


Net Earnings Per Common Share

Net earnings per common share are based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the
respective periods. Average common equivalent shares
(stock options) outstanding have not been included, as the
computation would not be dilutive. Weighted average common
shares outstanding were 203,525,000, 205,543,000 and
204,866,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995,
December 25, 1994, and December 26, 1993, respectively.


Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The company has, where appropriate, estimated the fair
value of financial instruments. These fair value amounts
may be significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including the discount rate and estimates of cash flow.
Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a
current market exchange. Where these estimates
approximate carrying value, no separate disclosure of fair
value is shown.


Derivatives

The company has only limited involvement with derivative
financial instruments and does not use them for trading
purposes. They are used to manage well-defined interest
rate and foreign exchange risks. These include:

 . Foreign exchange contracts, which are hedges for foreign
denominated accounts receivable and payable, have gains or
losses recognized at settlement date.

 . Interest rate swaps entered into with major banks or
financial institutions in which the company pays a fixed
rate and receives a floating rate with the interest
payments being calculated on a notional amount. The
premiums received by the company on the sale of these
swaps are treated as deferred income and amortized against
interest expense over the term of the agreements.

 . Hedging transactions entered into by the company's
mortgage banking subsidiary to protect both the completed
loan inventory and loans in process against changes in
interest rates. The financial instruments used to manage
interest rate risk are forward sales commitments, interest
rate futures and options. Hedging gains and losses realized
during the commitment and warehousing period are deferred
to the extent of unrealized gains on the related mortgage
loans held for sale.

The company is exposed to credit-related losses in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial
instruments but does not expect any counterparties to fail
to meet their obligations. The company deals only with
highly rated counterparties.

The notional amount of these derivative financial in-
struments is $891 million at December 31, 1995. The
company's use of derivatives does not have a significant
effect on the company's results of operations or its
financial position.


Cash and Short-Term Investments

For purposes of cash flow and fair value reporting, short
term investments with original maturities of 90 days or
less are considered as cash equivalents. Short-term
investments are stated at cost, which approximates market.


Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
includes labor, materials and production overhead. The last-
in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to cost the majority of
domestic raw materials, in process and finished goods inven-
tories; either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average
cost method is used to cost all other inventories. Had the
FIFO method been used to cost all inventories, the amounts
at which product inventories are stated would have been
$267 million and $237 million greater at December 31, 1995,
and December 25, 1994, respectively.


Property and Equipment

The company's property accounts are maintained on an
individual asset basis. Betterments and replacements of
major units are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor
replacements are expensed. Depreciation is provided
generally on the straight-line or unit-of-production method
at rates based on estimated service lives. Amortization of
logging railroads and truck roads is provided generally as
timber is harvested and is based upon rates determined with
reference to the volume of timber estimated to be removed
over such facilities.

                              52
<PAGE>

The cost and related depreciation of property sold or
retired is removed from the property and allowance for
depreciation accounts and the gain or loss is included in
earnings.


Timber and Timberlands

Timber and timberlands are carried at cost less fee
stumpage charged to disposals. Fee stumpage is the cost of
standing timber and is charged to fee timber disposals as
fee timber is harvested, lost as the result of casualty or
sold. Stumpage rates are determined with reference to the
cost of timber and the related volume of timber estimated
to be recoverable. Timber carrying costs are expensed as
incurred.


Accounts Payable

The company's banking system provides for the daily
replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are
presented. Accordingly, there were negative book cash
balances of $149 million and $151 million at December 31,
1995, and December 25, 1994, respectively. Such balances
result from outstanding checks that had not yet been paid
by the bank and are reflected in accounts payable in the
consolidated balance sheets.


Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect temporary
differences between the financial and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and
laws.


Pension Plans

The company has pension plans covering most of its em-
ployees. The U.S. plan covering salaried employees
provides pension benefits based on the employee's highest
monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the
final 10 years before retirement. Plans covering hourly
employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for
each year of service. Contributions to U.S. plans are
based on funding standards established by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).


Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

In addition to providing pension benefits, the company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits
for some retired employees and accrues the expected future
cost of these benefits for its current eligible retirees
and some employees. All of the company's salaried
employees and some hourly employees may become eligible
for these benefits when they retire.


Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior
years' data to the current format.


Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company

Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of cost
or fair value. The determination of fair value is based on
market pricing of comparable assets when available, or
the present value of expected future cash flows from these
assets. Real estate held for development is stated at cost
to the extent it does not exceed the future undiscounted
net cash flows.


Weyerhaeuser Financial Services

The company's financial services businesses are engaged in
the mortgage banking industry, hold mortgage-backed
certificates and other financial instruments pledged as
collateral for collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)
bonds, and also offer insurance services.

Mortgage notes held for sale are stated at the lower of
cost or market, which is computed by the aggregate method
(unrealized losses are offset by unrealized gains).

Mortgage-backed certificates are carried at par value
adjusted for any unamortized discount or premium.

CMO bonds are carried at unamortized cost. Discounts and
premiums are amortized using a method that approximates
the effective interest method over their estimated lives.

Other income (expense), net, is an aggregation of both
recurring and occasional non-operating income and expense
items and, as a result, fluctuates from period to period.
No individual income or (expense) item is significant
other than the $70 million gain on the disposal of the
company's investment in the infant diaper business in 1993
and the real estate and financial services gain of $42
million on the sale of GNA Corporation in 1993.

The corporate income tax rate was increased from 34
percent to 35 percent, retroactive to January 1, 1993, by
legislation enacted during the third quarter of 1993.
This change in tax law increased income taxes in 1993 by
$15 million due to the effect of the higher tax rate on
the accumulated temporary differences at December 27,
1992, and $5 million due to the effect of adjusting the
annual effective tax rate used in prior quarters.

A reconciliation between the federal statutory tax rate
and the company's effective tax rate before the
extraordinary item follows:

</TABLE>

As of December 31, 1995, the company has available
approximately $20 million of alternative minimum tax
credit carryforward, which does not expire, and foreign
tax credit carryforwards of $1 million, $4 million and $1
million expiring in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

The company intends to reinvest undistributed earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries; therefore, no U.S. taxes
have been provided. These earnings totaled approximately
$734 million at the end of 1995. While it is not
practicable to determine the income tax liability that
would result from repatriation, it is estimated that
withholding taxes payable upon repatriation would
approximate $73 million.


Note 5. Extraordinary Item

In 1993 the company realized a net gain of $52 million
($86 million less related tax effect of $34 million) as a
result of extinguishing certain debt obligations.

The assets of the U.S. and Canadian pension plans, as of
December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994, consist of a
highly diversified mix of equity, fixed income and real
estate securities.

Approximately 1,750 employees are covered by union-
administered multi-employer pension plans to which the com-
pany makes negotiated contributions based generally on
fixed amounts per hour per employee. Contributions to
these plans were $7 million in 1995, $7 million in 1994
and $6 million in 1993.


Note 7. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The company sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans
for its U.S. employees that provide medical and life insur-
ance coverage as follows:
 . Two salaried retiree medical plans that cover
substantially all salaried employees who retire under the
company's retirement plan and their spouses. Plan I covers
those retired or eligible to retire as of January 1, 1990,
and provides full health coverage. Plan II includes those
salaried employees not eligible for Plan I, under which the
company provides a fixed dollar amount per year of service
toward the premium, with the retiree paying the remainder.
The company reserves the right to revise the fixed dollar
amount.
 . An hourly retiree medical plan that covers approximately
3,700 active hourly employees and their spouses. For some,
the coverage stops at age 65, while others have lifetime
coverage. In some units the retiree must pay a portion of
the premium, while in others the company pays the full
cost. There are approximately 1,800 retired hourly
employees and their spouses currently covered under these
programs.
 . A salaried retiree life insurance plan that starts at 80
percent of salary at retirement and reduces to six thousand
dollars in 20 percent increments. Approximately 4,700
persons who are retired or were eligible to retire as of
December 31, 1991, are subject to a different schedule.
 . An hourly retiree life insurance plan in which approxi-
mately 11,000 active hourly employees are eligible and
approximately 2,000 hourly retirees have coverage. Most of
these are covered by fixed dollar amount coverage that is
graded down after retirement. Some units have pay-related
insurance on which the company pays the full cost.

The company sponsors three defined benefit and two defined
contribution postretirement plans for its Canadian
employees that provide medical and life insurance.
Collectively, 320 retired employees are covered and 510
active employees are eligible for coverage in these five
plans as of year-end 1995.

For measurement purposes, an 11.0, 10.5 and 8.5 percent
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
health care benefits was assumed for 1993, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. Beginning in 1996, the rate is assumed to
decrease by 0.5 percent annually to a level of 5.5 percent
for the year 2001 and all years thereafter. The effect of
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995, by 10.3
percent, and the aggregate of the service and interest
cost components of net annual postretirement benefit cost
for 1995 by 11.9 percent.

Note 10. Mortgage-Backed Certificates and Other Pledged
Financial Instruments, and Collateralized Mortgage
Obligation Bonds

The company's financial services businesses hold mortgage-
backed certificates and other financial instruments
pledged as collateral for the collateralized mortgage
obligation (CMO) bonds. These assets are held by banks as
trustees. Principal and interest collections on the
certificates are used to meet the interest payments and
reduce the outstanding principal balance of the bonds.

The CMO bonds are the obligation of the issuer, and
neither the company nor any affiliated company has
guaranteed or is otherwise obligated with respect to the
bonds.

Lines of Credit

At December 31, 1995, the company's lines of credit
include a five-year competitive advance and revolving
credit facility agreement entered into in July 1994 with a
group of banks that provides for borrowings of up to the
total amount of $1.55 billion, all of which can be availed
of by the company, and $1 billion, which can be availed
of by WMC. Borrowings are at LIBOR or other such interest
rates as mutually agreed to between the borrower and
lending banks.

At December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994, WMC had $35
million outstanding against a one-year evergreen credit
commitment entered into in 1990.

WMC has a revolving credit agreement with a bank to
provide for: (1) borrowings of up to $35 million for two
years at prime rate, LIBOR or such other rate as may be
agreed upon by WMC and the banks, (2) a commitment fee
based on the unused credit, and (3) conversion of the note
as of July 1, 1998, to a five-year term loan payable in
equal quarterly installments. At December 31, 1995, and
December 25, 1994, $20 million was outstanding under this
revolving credit agreement.

During 1992 WFS entered into a credit facility agreement,
which was subsequently amended in May 1994 and provides
for: (1) borrowings of up to $525 million at December 31,
1995, and $405 million at December 25, 1994, at LIBOR or
other such rates as may be agreed upon by WFS and the
banks, and (2) a commitment fee on the unused portion of
the credit. $450 million and $405 million were outstanding
under this facility at December 31, 1995, and December 25,
1994, respectively.

To the extent that these credit commitments expire more
than one year after the balance sheet date and are unused,
an equal amount of commercial paper is classifiable as
long-term debt. Amounts so classified are shown in the
tables in this note.

No portion of these lines has been availed of by the
company, WRECO, WMC or WFS at December 31, 1995, or
December 25, 1994, except as noted.

The company's compensating balance agreements were not
significant.

</TABLE>

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value are as follows:

 . Long-term debt, including real estate and financial
services, is estimated based on quoted market prices for
the same issues or on the discounted value of the future
cash flows expected to be paid using incremental rates of
borrowing for similar liabilities.
 
 . Mortgage notes held for sale are estimated using the
quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans
adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The esti-
mated fair value is net of related hedge instruments, which
were estimated based upon quoted market prices for
securities.

 . Mortgage loans receivable are estimated based on the
discounted value of estimated future cash flows using cur-
rent rates for loans with similar terms and risks.

 . Investments are estimated using quoted market prices for
similar securities. Fair value for mortgage loans held as
investments is based on the discounted value of estimated
future cash flows using current rates.

 . Mortgage-backed certificates and other pledged financial
instruments are estimated using the quoted market prices
for securities backed by similar loans and restricted
deposits held at cost, which is a reasonable estimate.

 . Collateralized mortgage obligation bonds are estimated
using analysis of projected cash flows discounted at
market yields.


Note 16. Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies


Legal Proceedings

On November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the
company in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial
District of Hinds County, Mississippi, on behalf of a
purported class of riparian property owners in Mississippi
and Alabama whose properties are located on the Tennessee
Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar Creek and the
Magoway Creek. The complaint seeks $1 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages for diminution in
property value, personal injuries and mental anguish
allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous substances, including dioxins and furans, by the
company's pulp and paper mill in Columbus, Mississippi,
and the alleged fraudulent concealments of such discharge.
The complaint also seeks an injunction prohibiting future
releases and the removal of hazardous substances allegedly
released in the past. On August 20, 1993, a companion
action was filed in Greene County, Alabama, on behalf of a
similar purported class of riparian owners with
essentially the same claims as the Mississippi case. By
order dated April 5, 1995, venue of the Alabama action was
transferred to Sumter County, Alabama. On January 20,
1995, the court in the Alabama action certified a class of
all persons who, as of the date the action commenced, were
riparian owners, lessees and licensees of properties
located on the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway in Greene,
Sumter, Pickens and Marengo counties, Alabama, and Lowndes
and Noxubee counties, Mississippi, to determine whether
the company is liable to the members of the class for
compensatory and/or punitive damages and to determine the
amount of punitive damages, if any, to be awarded to the
class as a whole. By order dated April 12, 1995, as orally
amended on February 1, 1996, the geographical boundaries
of the class were amended to run from below the Columbus
mill's wastewater discharge pipe to just above the
confluence of the Black Warrior River and the Tennessee
Tombigbee Waterway. The class is estimated to range from
approximately 1,000 to 1,500 members. Neither the
Mississippi action nor the Alabama action is presently
scheduled for trial.

Environmental

It is the company's policy to accrue for environmental
remediation costs when it is determined that it is
probable that such an obligation exists and the amount of
the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Based on
currently available information and analysis, the company
believes that it is reasonably possible that costs
associated with all identified sites may exceed current
accruals by amounts that may prove insignificant or that
could range, in the aggregate, up to approximately $120
million over several years. This estimate of the upper end
of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is
much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals
are currently based, and utilizes assumptions less
favorable to the company among the range of reasonably
possible outcomes. In estimating both its current accruals
for environmental remediation and the possible range of
additional future costs, the company has assumed that it
will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site
to the exclusion of other known potentially
responsible parties who may be jointly and severally
liable. The ability of other potentially responsible
parties to participate has been taken into account, based
generally on each party's financial condition and probable
contribution on a per-site basis. No amounts have been
recorded for potential recoveries from insurance
carriers.

The company is a party to legal proceedings and envi-
ronmental matters generally incidental to its business.
Although the final outcome of any legal proceeding or
environmental matter is subject to a great many variables
and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, the
company presently believes that the ultimate outcome
resulting from these proceedings and matters would not
have a material effect on the company's current financial
position, liquidity or results of operations; however, in
any given future reporting period, such proceedings or
matters could have a material effect on results of
operations.


Other Items

The company's capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions, have averaged about $869 million in recent
years but are expected to approximate $900 million in
1996; however, the 1996 expenditure level could be
increased or decreased as a consequence of future economic
conditions. The company had approximately $269 million in
capital expenditures committed on major projects at year-
end 1995. In addition, near year-end, the company announced
that it had signed an agreement to acquire 241,000 acres
of southern private commercial forestland. The ultimate
purchase price could range up to $275 million.

During the normal course of business, the company's real
estate and financial services subsidiaries have entered
into certain financial commitments comprised primarily of
agreements to fund up to $146 million in mortgage loans at
fixed and floating prices, guarantees made on $69 million
of partnership borrowings, and limited recourse
obligations associated with $1.6 billion of sold mortgage
loans. The fair value of the recourse on these loans is
estimated to be $9 million, which is based upon market
spreads for sales of similar loans without recourse or
estimates of the credit risk of the associated recourse
obligation.

Note 18. Shareholders' Interest


Preferred and Preference Shares

The company is authorized to issue:

 . 7,000,000 preferred shares having a par value of $1.00
per share, of which none were issued and outstanding at
December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994; and

 . 40,000,000 preference shares having a par value of $1.00
per share, of which none were issued and outstanding at
December 31, 1995, and December 25, 1994.

The preferred and preference shares may be issued in one
or more series with varying rights and preferences
including dividend rates, redemption rights, conversion
terms, sinking fund provisions, values in liquidation and
voting rights. When issued, the outstanding preferred and
preference shares rank senior to outstanding common shares
as to dividends and assets available on liquidation.

The company has reserved but not issued 2,000,000 shares
of cumulative preference shares, fourth series, for the
exercise of the rights described under Common Shares.


Common Shares

Common shares reserved for stock option plans were
5,972,195 shares at December 31, 1995, and 5,687,934
shares at December 25, 1994. As to the company's various
stock option plans, the following information is provided:

</TABLE>

In December 1986, the company adopted, and in February
1989 amended, a Shareholder Rights Plan (the "Plan") and
declared a dividend distribution of 0.6667 right on each
outstanding common share. Each right entitles its holder
to purchase after the distribution date and until December
1996 one one-hundredth of a share of the company's
cumulative preference shares, fourth series, at a price of
$70, subject to adjustment. The distribution date is the earlier of 20
business days after the announcement that a person or
group has acquired 20 percent or more of Weyerhaeuser's
outstanding common shares or 20 business days after a
person or group commences a tender or exchange offer that
could result in the person or group owning 20 percent or
more of the company's outstanding common shares.
Following the distribution date, if anyone owning 20
percent or more of the company's outstanding common shares
merges with the company, with the company as the survivor,
and the company's common shares are not changed or
exchanged, or engages in certain self-dealing transactions
with the company, or if an event occurs that results in
such 20 percent owner's interest being increased by more
than one percent (e.g., a reverse stock split), or if
anyone acquires 30 percent or more of the company's out-
standing common shares, each right holder, other than such
person or group, will be able, upon payment of the right's
exercise price, to acquire shares of the company's common
stock or other securities or assets having an aggregate
market value equal to twice the right's purchase price.
If, after the company announces that someone owns 20
percent or more of the company's outstanding common
shares, the company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination, and the company is not the survivor,
or the company engages in a merger or other business
combination transaction in which the company is the
surviving corporation but the company's common shares are
changed or exchanged, or if 50 percent of the company's
earning power or assets is sold in one or several related
transactions, each right holder, other than any 20 percent
shareholder, will receive shares of the acquiring
company's common stock having a market value equal to
twice the right's exercise price. Subject to certain time
periods and conditions, the Plan may be amended and the
rights may be redeemed at a price of $.05 per right,
subject to adjustment.

Note 19. Business Segments

The company is principally engaged in the growing and
harvesting of timber and the manufacture, distribution and
sale of forest products. The four principal business seg-
ments are timberlands and wood products (including
softwood lumber, plywood and veneer; composite panels;
oriented strand board; hardboard; logs; chips; timber;
doors; hardwood lumber and plywood; and treated products);
pulp, paper and packaging (including pulp, newsprint,
paper, containerboard, paperboard, packaging, recycling
and chemicals); real estate development and construction;
and financial services.

The timber-based businesses involve a high degree of
integration among timber operations; building materials
conversion facilities; and pulp, newsprint, paper,
container board and paperboard primary manufacturing and
secondary conversion facilities, including extensive
transfers of raw materials, semi-finished materials and
end products between and among these groups. Accounting
for segment profitability involves allocations of joint
raw materials and conversion costs and the use of transfer
prices that attempt to approximate current market values.

                            65

Mr. Richard C. Gozon
533 Waterloo Road
Devon PA 19333

Dear Dick:

This summarizes our agreement concerning the terms of your
employment with Weyerhaeuser Company.

Weyerhaeuser Company (the "Company") will employ you as
Executive Vice President, Pulp, Paper & Packaging at an
annual salary of $340,000 commencing on your hire date.
Salary reviews are currently done on a 12-month cycle.

You will be a participant in the incentive compensation plan
for Weyerhaeuser senior executives.  In this plan your
target bonus will be 50 percent of your base salary.  For
1994 you will receive at least a prorata target bonus for
the portion of the year you are employed by Weyerhaeuser.

You will be a participant in the Company's long-term
incentive compensation plan.  The Board of Directors has
approved a 30,000 share stock option grant to you under that
plan, conditioned on your coming to work for the Company.
This stock option will be granted to you on your first day
of employment with Weyerhaeuser.  I will also recommend a
grant of at least 20,000 shares at the time of regular
management grants in early 1995.  Thereafter your grants
will be determined by our regular granting process.

You will be eligible for the regular salaried benefits
outlined in the employee handbook provided to you under
separate cover.  You also will be a member of Weyerhaeuser's
key group and eligible for the benefits accorded this group.
The enclosed summarizes the current program.

If you leave Weyerhaeuser after you reach age 65, your
Company pension and post-retirement health benefits will be
calculated based on at least ten years of service.  The
difference between your target pension benefit (based on ten
years' credited service) and your actual pension benefit
under the Company's salaried retirement plan will be paid as
a non-qualified retirement

benefit from general Company assets.  You may elect that
this difference be paid in any form allowable under the
plan.  The Company's contribution to any post-retirement
health plan in effect at that time will be based on at least
10 years of service.  The additional service provided under
this arrangement is not available if you leave the Company
before age 65.

The Company will reimburse your relocation expenses in
accordance with the "Relocation Policy Procedure Guide for
Salaried Employees," and a separate letter you have received
from Steve Hill.

The Company reserves the right to terminate your employment
at any time with or without cause.  In the event the Company
does terminate your employment, you will be entitled to a
special severance benefit which will decrease based on the
number of months you are employed by the Company.  This
benefit will be equal to your monthly base pay times the
number of months of base pay shown on the following
schedule:

in job performance.  The severance benefit will commence
upon notification of termination and will be paid on a
monthly basis.  This benefit will be in lieu of any other
notice policy or severance plan offered by the Company.

You have provided us copies of your October 1993 agreement
with Alco Standard that included a "Non-Competition
Covenant" where you agreed to not by employed by a
competitor of theirs in the "paper distribution" business.
Your understanding is that they would not consider
Weyerhaeuser to be in  the "paper distribution" business.
We agree that Weyerhaeuser's General Counsel, Bob Lane, can
make contact with Alco Standard's legal department to verify
that they do not see your employment with us as a breach of
this agreement.  If they raise concerns, you and I agree
that you would not start employment with Weyerhaeuser until
Also Standard provides written consent that your employment
is not a breach of this agreement.

You have also disclosed to me that you hold options to
purchase Alco Standard stock and that under the terms of
your agreement with Alco Standard, you have 3 years to
exercise those shares.  I have asked our General Counsel to
advise you and me on steps we should take to avoid actual or
perceived conflict of interest.

You and I agree that you will start your Weyerhaeuser
employment sometime next month.

If the arrangement described herein reflects your
understanding of our agreement, please indicate by signing
and returning the enclosed copy of this letter.


Sincerely,

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY
