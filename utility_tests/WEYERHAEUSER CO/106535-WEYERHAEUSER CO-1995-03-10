Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I



Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

Weyerhaeuser  Company (the company) was incorporated in the  state  of
Washington  in  January 1900, as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company.   It  is
principally  engaged  in  growing and harvesting  of  timber  and  the
manufacture,  distribution and sale of forest  products,  real  estate
development  and construction, and financial services.  Its  principal
business  segments include timberlands and wood products; pulp,  paper
and packaging; real estate; and financial services.

Information with respect to the description and general development of
the  company's business, included on pages 35 through 40,  Description
of the Business of the Company, contained in the company's 1994 Annual
Report to Shareholders, is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial  information with respect to industry segments, included  in
Note  21  of Notes to Financial Statements contained in the  company's
1994  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  is  incorporated  herein   by
reference.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The  company  owns  approximately  5.6  million  acres  of  commercial
forestland  in  the United States (51% in the South  and  49%  in  the
Pacific   Northwest),   most  of  it  highly  productive  and  located
extremely well to serve both domestic and international markets.   The
company  has, additionally, long-term license arrangements  in  Canada
covering  approximately 17.8 million acres (of which 14 million  acres
are  considered  to  be productive forestland).   The  combined  total
timber  inventory  on these U.S. and Canadian lands  is  approximately
246 million cunits (a cunit is 100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which
approximately 75% is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement and the quantity of end products that may be produced from
timber  varies according to the species, size and quality  of  timber,
and  will  change through time as the mix of these variables  changes.
To  sustain the timber supply from its fee timberlands, the company is
engaged in extensive planting, suppression of nonmerchantable species,
precommercial   and   commercial  thinning   and   fertilization   and
operational  pruning, all of which increase the  yield  from  its  fee
timberland acreage.

Weyerhaeuser Company and Subsidiaries

PART I


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Trial  began in May 1992 in a federal income tax refund case that  the
company  filed  in July 1989 in the United States Claims  Court.   The
complaint  seeks  a refund of federal income taxes  that  the  company
contends  it  overpaid in 1977 through 1983.  The alleged overpayments
are  the result of the disallowance of certain timber casualty  losses
and  certain  deductions claimed by the company  arising  from  export
transactions.   The refund sought was approximately $29 million,  plus
statutory  interest from the dates of the alleged  overpayments.   The
company   settled  the  portion  of  the  case  relating   to   export
transactions  and received a tax refund of approximately $10  million,
plus  statutory interest.  In September 1994, the United States  Court
of  Federal Claims issued an opinion on the casualty loss issues which
will   result   in  the  allowance  of  additional  tax   refunds   of
approximately  $2  million,  plus  statutory  interest.   The  company
currently intends to appeal the decision.

On  March 6, 1992, the company filed a complaint in the Superior Court
for  King  County, Washington against a number of insurance companies.
The   complaint  seeks  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  insurance
companies  named  as  defendants are obligated  under  the  terms  and
conditions  of the policies sold by them to the company to defend  the
company  and to pay, on the company's behalf, certain claims  asserted
against  the  company.   The  claims relate to  alleged  environmental
damage  to third-party sites and to some of the company's own property
to  which allegedly toxic material was delivered or on which allegedly
toxic  material  was  placed in the past.  Since  December  1992,  the
company  has agreed to settlements with all but one of the defendants.
In  July  1993, the trial court dismissed fourteen of the  thirty-five
sites  named  in  the  complaint.  In May 1994, the  Washington  State
Supreme  Court  reversed the trial court's dismissal of  those  sites.
Trial  on  two  sites  against the sole remaining defendant  began  in
October  1994 and resulted in a jury verdict which awarded damages  to
the company with respect to one of the sites.

The  company  has  undertaken  a  review  of  all  its  wood  products
facilities   for   compliance  with  the  Prevention  of   Significant
Deterioration  (PSD)  regulations and  has  disclosed  PSD  compliance
issues  to  certain  state  agencies and the Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA).  The company and the State of Mississippi Department  of
Environmental Quality have entered into a consent agreement concerning
PSD  regulations  at  company facilities in  Philadelphia  and  Bruce,
Mississippi,  involving  penalties of $170  thousand.   The  State  of
Alabama  has  issued a compliance order with penalties  totaling  $100
thousand  for  noncompliance  with PSD regulations  at  the  company's
Millport  facility.   The  company and North  Carolina's  Division  of
Environmental Management have entered into a consent agreement for its
Elkin,  North  Carolina facility involving penalties of $140  thousand
and  concluded  a  separate consent agreement for its  Moncure,  North
Carolina  facility involving penalties of $140 thousand.  The  company
has  signed  a consent agreement including penalties of $140  thousand
relating to PSD issues at the company's Wright City, Oklahoma facility
with  the State of Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.   The
company  has  signed  consent agreements with the  State  of  Arkansas
concerning  PSD related issues for facilities in Dierks  and  Mountain
Pine,  involving $375 thousand in total penalties for both facilities.
Region  V  of  the  EPA  has issued a Notice of Violation  for  permit
violations at the company's Grayling, Michigan facility.  The  company
has  negotiated  a settlement of those alleged permit  violations  and
other  PSD  related  issues with the Michigan  Department  of  Natural
Resources that involves penalties of approximately $499 thousand.  The
company  has  entered into negotiations with the Lane  County,  Oregon
Regional Air Pollution Control Authority concerning a draft Notice  of
Violation which would seek penalties for alleged PSD violations at the
company's  Springfield, Oregon particleboard operations.  In September
1992,  the EPA issued a Section 114 Request for Information concerning
PSD  compliance  at  the company's oriented strand  board  and  medium
density  fiberboard  mills.  In June 1993, the EPA  issued  a  similar
Section 114 request for the company's plywood and particleboard mills.
The  EPA  issued a notice of violation in August 1994 for nine company
facilities  (including the Plymouth, North Carolina and Adel,  Georgia
wood  products  facilities and all of the facilities  mentioned  above
except   the  Grayling,  Michigan,  Springfield,  Oregon  and   Bruce,
Mississippi  wood  products facilities) as part of  its  national  PSD
enforcement  action  against  the company  and  other  forest  product
companies.

The  company  has also undertaken a review of its ten major  pulp  and
paper  facilities  to  evaluate the facilities'  compliance  with  PSD
regulations  and has disclosed the potential of PSD compliance  issues
to  six  state agencies and the EPA.  The company is currently working
with the states to negotiate settlements for the alleged violations.

The  Washington  State  Department of  Ecology  has  investigated  the
accidental  release of chlorine, chlorine dioxide and  non-condensable
gasses  at the company's pulp mill in Longview, in July 1994  and  has
issued  a  $10  thousand  penalty  for  the  chlorine  release  and  a
$5  thousand penalty for the non-condensable gasses release.  The  EPA
is also investigating the accidental chlorine release.

PART I


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings - Continued
- --------------------------------------

On  April  9, 1993, the company entered into a Stipulated Final  Order
(SFO)  with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for alleged
air  emissions in excess of permit levels and PSD noncompliance at the
company's  North  Bend,  Oregon  containerboard  facility.   The   SFO
establishes  a compliance schedule for installing control  technology.
A  supplemental  SFO assessed upfront penalties of $247  thousand  and
penalties  of  500  dollars per day until compliance is  demonstrated.
The  SFO  required  demonstrated compliance by  December  1993  and  a
historical  evaluation of the facility's PSD status.  The company  has
submitted  a  plant site PSD review to the state and is  awaiting  its
review.

In  August  1992, the EPA issued an administrative complaint  for  the
assessment  of $215 thousand in civil penalties against the  company's
Longview,  Washington facility.  The penalties are based upon  alleged
violations  of  the  record  keeping and  storage  provisions  of  the
polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCB)  rules  contained   in   the   Toxic
Substances Control Act.  The company and the EPA settled the complaint
for a maximum penalty of $118 thousand, 50% of which was paid when the
settlement was signed.  Payment of the remaining 50% was deferred  and
will be eliminated based on the expenditure of more than $118 thousand
by the company to dispose of PCB contaminated transformers.

On  November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company  in  the
Circuit  Court  for  the  First Judicial  District  of  Hinds  County,
Mississippi,  on  behalf  of a purported class  of  riparian  property
owners in Mississippi and Alabama whose properties are located on  the
Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville Lake, Cedar  Creek  and  the
Magoway  Creek.   The complaint seeks $1 billion in  compensatory  and
punitive  damages for diminution in property value, personal  injuries
and mental anguish allegedly resulting from the discharge of purported
hazardous  substances, including dioxins and furans, by the  company's
pulp  and  paper  mill  in  Columbus,  Mississippi,  and  the  alleged
fraudulent  concealments of such discharge.  The complaint also  seeks
an injunction prohibiting future releases and the removal of hazardous
substances  allegedly released in the past.  On  August  20,  1993,  a
companion action was filed in Greene County, Alabama, on behalf  of  a
similar  purported class of riparian owners with essentially the  same
claims as the Mississippi case.  On January 20, 1995, the court in the
Alabama  action certified a class of all persons who, as of  the  date
the  action commenced, were riparian owners, lessees and licensees  of
properties  located  on the Tennessee Tombigbee  Waterway  in  Greene,
Sumter, Pickens and Marengo counties, Alabama, and Lowndes and Noxubee
counties,  Mississippi, to determine whether the company is liable  to
the  members of the class for compensatory and/or punitive damages and
to  determine the amount of punitive damages, if any, to be awarded to
the  class  as a whole.  The class is estimated to exceed 400  members
and  may  range from 1,000 to 1,500 members.  Neither the  Mississippi
action nor the Alabama action is presently scheduled for trial.

The  company  was  sued in the United States District  Court  for  the
District  of  Alaska by two corporations with which  the  company  had
entered  into  financing arrangements, a marketing  agreement,  and  a
technical  assistance agreement.  The plaintiffs claimed  the  company
breached  contractual  and common law duties by allegedly  failing  to
adequately  market and ship the plaintiffs' products,  misrepresenting
its  marketing  and shipping capabilities, and acting to  further  its
interests  at  the plaintiffs' expense.  The plaintiffs in  the  First
Amended  Complaint,  filed in May 1992, sought an unstated  amount  of
damages  described  as  more than $50 million in compensatory  damages
plus  not  less than $75 million in punitive damages.  The  claim  for
punitive damages was dismissed by the trial court.  In March  1994,  a
jury  returned a verdict against the company awarding damages of  $1.2
million.  Both the company and the plaintiffs have appealed.

The  company  is also a party to various proceedings relating  to  the
clean-up   of   hazardous   waste  sites   under   the   Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly  known
as  "Superfund," and similar state laws.  The EPA and/or various state
agencies  have  notified  the company that it  may  be  a  potentially
responsible  party with respect to other hazardous waste sites  as  to
which  no  proceedings have been instituted against the company.   The
company   is  also  a  party  to  other  legal  proceedings  generally
incidental to its business.  Although the final outcome of  any  legal
proceeding  is  subject  to  a  great many  variables  and  cannot  be
predicted with any degree of certainty, the company presently believes
that  any  ultimate  outcome  resulting  from  the  legal  proceedings
discussed  herein, or all of them combined, would not have a  material
effect  on  the  company's current financial  position,  liquidity  or
results  of operations; however, in any given future reporting period,
such  legal  proceedings could have a material effect  on  results  of
operations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES



Report  of  Independent  Public  Accountants  on  Financial  Statement
Schedules

To Weyerhaeuser Company:

We  have  audited  in  accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards,   the  financial  statements  included  in   Weyerhaeuser
Company's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 7,
1995.   Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
those  statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed on page  14
is  the  responsibility of the company's management and is presented
for   purposes  of  complying  with  the  Securities  and   Exchange
Commission's   rules  and  is  not  part  of  the  basic   financial
statements.   This  schedule  has been  subjected  to  the  auditing
procedures  applied  in the audit of the basic financial  statements
and,  in  our  opinion, fairly states in all material  respects  the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation  to  the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

Timberlands and Wood Products

The company's Timberlands and Wood Products businesses

reported record operating earnings of $1,034 million in 1994

compared with $891 million in 1993 -- a 16 percent increase.

These earnings were achieved through improvements made in

our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses over

the past five years while timber supplies were tight and

markets strong.   >   Although U.S. single-family home

construction is expected to slow, multi-family starts are

expected to increase in 1995, keeping total housing starts

near the 1994 level.  Strong demand in repair, remodeling,

industrial and export markets should also benefit our

businesses in 1995.   >   In spite of a weak economy,

housing starts in Japan were strong, increasing from 1.48

million in 1993 to 1.56 million units in 1994.   >

Timberlands Businesses.  All of the Timberlands businesses'

domestic and export log markets were strong in 1994 --

especially for Douglas fir.  Timber harvest from public

lands continued to decline in 1994, resulting in demand

pressure on private lands, both West and South.  Increased

demand for timber in the Southern United States continues as

builders and building materials dealers increasingly look to

the South to compensate for the declines in the West.   >

Near the end of 1994, the company entered into a long-term

cooperative alliance with SAFCOL, a South African forest

products company, to market logs internationally

and wood products in North America.   >   We began

geographic planning in a portion of our Southern operations

in 1994 in preparation for increasing future timber-harvest

volumes from company lands.

>   Safety.  The Timberlands businesses all kept a clear

focus on safety improvement objectives in 1994.  Oregon

Timberlands passed a landmark -- 1 million work hours without

a lost-time accident in October -- and Southern Timberlands'

Mississippi/Alabama timberlands operations completed eight

years without a lost-time accident during the year.

Washington Timberlands also made substantial improvements in

safety

performance in 1994.   >   Environmental Stewardship.

During 1994, Weyerhaeuser adopted a uniform set of goals for

the productive management and enhancement of all forest

resources on Weyerhaeuser lands across the United States.

>   These "Forestry Resource Goals" guide our efforts at

protecting

the wide range of natural resources found in our private

forests while we continue to profitably grow,

harvest and utilize trees.  The new goals address water

quality, wildlife habitat, soil productivity and

scenic values.   >   The company's six regional forest

councils are now developing implementation plans and

measurable targets for each goal.  Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.

is also developing a goal-setting process for operations in

public forests in Canada.   >   In line with the forestry

goals, we initiated numerous projects during 1994 to address

public concerns and continue to profitably manage our

resource.

We have reached agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service on a permit for a long-term

Habitat Conservation Plan for the protection of the northern

spotted owl on the company's 209,000-acre Millicoma Tree

Farm near Coos Bay, Ore.  Authorized under the Endangered

Species Act, habitat

conservation plans are agreements between landowners and the

federal government to minimize impacts on listed species in

a specific area during normal land-use activities.   >   A

pilot Habitat Management Plan for 107,000 acres in

southwestern Washington was commenced by Washington

Timberlands in 1994 to protect fish and wildlife on those

lands.   >   Ten watershed analyses were completed on

Weyerhaeuser's Washington and Oregon timberlands during the

year.  And our Oregon Timberlands operations implemented the

state of Oregon's demanding new stream-protection rules in

addition to

participating in the development of the company's new

resource goals.   >   In Arkansas, Weyerhaeuser is

participating in the Ouachita Mountains Ecosystem Management

Research Project in cooperation with


                                    26

<PAGE>
the U.S. Forest Service, area universities and others.  This

project involves landscape-scale research

in four watersheds owned largely by the Ouachita National

Forest and Weyerhaeuser and is planned to cover at least

four years of fieldwork.  Studies are designed to evaluate

forestry-habitat-wildlife

relationships and to develop models for managing wildlife at

a landscape scale.  Other topics of research include forest

hydrology, aquatic ecology, vegetation and the human

dimensions of forest management.   >   Wood Products

Businesses.  The Wood Products businesses' outstanding

operating performance

in 1994 was facilitated by improved alignment of resources

with key customers in strategic geographies, better

partnering with suppliers, and clarification of customer

requirements through a structured

value-determination process.  In addition, numerous

important gains were made in safety performance including

the milestone -- 2 million hours without a lost-time accident

- -- reached by the Millport, Ala., wood products facility.   >

The company's lumber businesses -- Western, Southern and

Canadian -- made significant contributions to our 1994

performance.  Western Lumber topped four straight years of

operating performance improvements in 1994 as well as four

years of safety performance improvements.   >   The Southern

Lumber business posted record sales, earnings and

productivity.  The business was

very successful in reducing converting costs in its

manufacturing operations.  The business will continue to

focus on safety improvements, lower converting costs, and

improved recovery in the coming year.

>   Canadian Lumber reported record profitability in 1994

while continuing to focus on manufacturing excellence.  The

business's improvement plan will focus on improving

consistency and reducing variability in mill operations in

1995.   >   The Engineered Fiber Products business, producer

of oriented strand board, particleboard and other panels,

posted record profits in 1994.  Expansion of the Elkin,

furniture in the U.S. market.  The business sustained its

industry leadership and expects excellent demand, both

domestic and export, in 1995.   >   In 1995 the company's

Timberlands and Wood Products businesses will continue

efforts toward:  - prudent management of the company's

timber and capital resources to sustain top-quartile

financial performance; - achieving an accident-free work

environment; - empowering employees to achieve business

goals; - relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction; -

attaining industry leadership in manufacturing excellence; -

ensuring that information,

skills and reliable methods are in place to achieve full

environmental compliance; and - alignment with public values

to ensure continued ability to grow, harvest and utilize our

timber resource.

Pulp, Paper and Packaging

The long downturn for Pulp, Paper and Packaging businesses

ended between the fourth quarter of

1993 and early 1994.  The sector has been recovering rapidly

since.  For the year, sector operating earnings reached $211

million as compared with $61 million in 1993, with strong

improvement each

quarter.   >   Strong paper demand and economic recovery in

Europe led to a strong turnaround in the Pulp business in

1994.  Tight supply caused by little new capacity during the

prolonged downturn led

to significant price improvements through the year as

markets strengthened.  With the completion of major

maintenance and modernization projects, the business is

extremely well positioned for 1995.

>   The Containerboard Packaging business continued a robust

recovery through 1994.  The expanding U.S. economy resulted

in strong corrugated box demand and pricing.  In 1995

increased containerboard volume will allow the business to

continue to grow with its strategic customer alliances as

better understanding of customer product-quality and service

needs are gained.  Significant profit improvement in the

business is expected through modernization and improved

reliability of processes.   >   Fine Paper prices recovered

strongly in the third quarter of 1994 and by year-end had

approached late-1980s levels in both lightweight coated and

uncoated freesheet.  In 1995 the business will focus on

maximizing paper output to meet the increasing demand for

printing papers, upgrading paper mix, and making continued

improvements in reliability of manufacturing processes.

While producing higher volumes, the business

will take steps to reduce waste and optimize costs.   >

The improving U.S. economy and the strong Japanese yen were

the key factors affecting our Newsprint business in 1994.

Tight newsprint supply

and continued growth in demand from publishers led to price

improvement in the second half of 1994.

In conjunction with our joint-venture partner, the Newsprint

business has reaffirmed its commitment

to increasing newsprint volume flow to Japan while attaining

a low-cost domestic supplier position

in 1995.   >   Weyerhaeuser's Recycling business added six

new facilities in 1994.  The Recycling business's extensive

paper collection system now has 27 facilities and annually

handles more than

2 million tons of recycled fiber.  The growth rate of the

business is expected to increase as we continue to pursue

our goal of building one of the largest, most efficient

recycling systems in North America.

safety improvements across the system in 1994.

The Columbus, Miss., pulp and paper complex achieved 2

million hours without a lost-time accident, and the

Plymouth, N.C., pulp and paper complex passed 1 million

hours without a lost-time accident early in the year.

Numerous other milestones were reached at individual plants

Real Estate and Financial Services

Rising interest rates and an abrupt dropoff in mortgage

refinancing activity were the chief factors

affecting Weyerhaeuser's real estate and financial services

businesses in 1994.  The sector earnings were $18 million

for the year compared with 1993 earnings of $94 million.

Earnings in 1993 included four months of contributions from

GNA Corporation and the $42 million gain on the sale of GNA.

>  WRECO home-building subsidiaries sold 4,409 units in

1994, down from 5,020 in 1993.  Weyerhaeuser Real

Estate Company was further downsized with the sale of three

operations:  Scarborough Corporation of

New Jersey, Westminster Homes in North Carolina, and the

utility contracting business of Scarborough Constructors of

Florida.   >   For the mortgage business, the dramatic

slowdown in refinancing activity

in 1994, following three consecutive years of improvement,

resulted in significant industry overcapacity and price

competition.  Higher interest rates in 1995 could further

slow home sales and financing.

Description of the Business of the Company





Weyerhaeuser Company (the company) was incorporated  in  the
state  of Washington in January 1900 as Weyerhaeuser  Timber
Company.   It  is  principally engaged in  the  growing  and
harvesting  of timber and the manufacture, distribution  and
sale  of  forest  products,  real  estate  development   and
construction, and financial services.
 The  company  has  37,000 employees,  of  whom  35,000  are
employed in its timber-based businesses, and of this number,
approximately  17,000  are covered by collective  bargaining
agreements,  which generally are negotiated on a  multi-year
basis.
 Approximately   2,000  of  the  company's   employees   are
involved  in the activities of its real estate and financial
services subsidiaries.
 The  major markets, both domestic and foreign, in which the
company  sells  its  products are highly  competitive,  with
numerous  strong  sellers competing in each.   Many  of  the
company's  products also compete with substitutes  for  wood
and  wood  fiber  products.  The real estate  and  financial
services  subsidiaries  also operate in  highly  competitive
markets, competing with numerous regional and national firms
in real estate development and construction and in financial
services.
 In  1994,  the  company's sales to  customers  outside  the
United  States  totaled $2.5 billion (including  exports  of
$1.5  billion  from the United States and $1 billion  export
from  and  domestic sales within Canada), or 24  percent  of
total consolidated sales and revenues.  The company believes
these  sales  contributed a higher proportion  of  aggregate
operating  profits  (see Note 2 of Notes to Financial
Statements).
All sales to customers outside the United States are subject
to  risks  related to international trade and to  political,
economic  and  other  factors  that  vary  from  country  to
country.

Principal Business Segments

Timberlands and Wood Products

The   company  owns  approximately  5.6  million  acres   of
commercial  forestland in the United States (51  percent  in
the South and 49 percent in the Pacific Northwest), most  of
it  highly  productive and located extremely well  to  serve
both  domestic and international markets.  The company  has,
additionally,  long-term  license  arrangements  in   Canada
covering  approximately  17.8 million  acres  (of  which  14
million  acres are considered to be productive  forestland).
The  combined  total  timber inventory  on  these  U.S.  and
Canadian lands is approximately 246 million cunits (a  cunit
is  100 cubic feet of solid wood), of which approximately 75
percent is softwood species.  The relationship between cubic
measurement  and the quantity of end products  that  may  be
produced  from timber varies according to the species,  size
and  quality of timber, and will change through time as  the
mix  of  these  variables changes.  To  sustain  the  timber
supply  from its fee timberlands, the company is engaged  in
extensive planting, suppression of non-merchantable species,
precommercial  and  commercial thinning,  fertilization  and
operational  pruning, all of which increase the  yield  from
its fee timberland acreage.
 The company's wood products businesses pro-
duce and sell softwood lumber, plywood and veneer; composite
panels;  oriented strand board; hardboard;  hardwood  lumber
and  plywood;  doors;  treated  products;  logs;  chips  and
timber.   These  products  are sold  primarily  through  the
company's  own sales organizations.  Building materials  are
sold to wholesalers, retailers and industrial users.

Environmental Matters

In  1990 the northern spotted owl was listed as a threatened
species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  In 1992 the
marbled  murrelet was listed as a threatened  species  under
the  ESA.  Certain Snake River salmon runs have been  listed
as  threatened or endangered under the ESA.  Petitions  have
been filed to list certain Pacific Northwest salmon runs and
other fish populations as threatened or endangered under the
ESA.  A consequence of
these  listings  has  been, and a  possible  consequence  of
future  listings may be, reductions in the sale and  harvest
of timber on federal timberlands in the
Pacific  Northwest.   Requirements to  protect  habitat  for
threatened and endangered species on non-federal timberlands
has  resulted, and may in the future result, in restrictions
on  timber  harvest on some non-federal timberlands  in  the
Pacific
Northwest,  including some timberlands of the company.   The
listing  of  the  red-cockaded woodpecker as  an  endangered
species under the ESA has had some impact on the harvest  of
public and private timber in the southeastern United States,
but  has  had  little  impact on the company's  timberlands.
Forest  practice  acts in some of the states  in  which  the
company  has  timber increasingly impact present  or  future
harvests and forest management activities.  In addition, the
statutory  requirements with respect to the preservation  of
wetlands  and  threatened or endangered species  may  affect
future  harvest and forest management activities on some  of
the company's Southern timberlands.
 In  April 1994, the Clinton administration adopted its plan
with  respect  to management of federal timberlands  in  the
Pacific Northwest.  This plan will reduce timber sales  from
certain federal lands in western Washington, western  Oregon
and northern California by more than 75 percent from harvest
levels in the 1980s to approximately 1.1 billion board  feet
per  year or less.  This reduction in federal timber harvest
will  seriously  reduce  log supplies  to  many  independent
sawmills that have been important suppliers of wood chips to
the company's pulp and paper mills in Washington and Oregon.
The company anticipates that there will be alternate sources
of wood chips or other fiber.
 The  administration  also has stated  that  reduced  timber
harvest  on  federal lands will allow modifications  to  the
current  federal  requirements for  protection  of  northern
spotted owls on some private lands. On February 7, 1995, the
administration announced that it is proposing a special rule
to  ease those harvest restrictions on some private lands in
Washington  and California.  The company believes  that  the
regulatory changes might ultimately allow it to harvest  fee
timber in some areas where it has not been operating because
of  uncertainties regarding regulations intended to  protect
the  northern spotted owl.  Whether those regulatory changes
will  be  implemented  is uncertain.   If  those  regulatory
changes  are  not implemented, the company may  not  harvest
some timber that it otherwise might harvest in late 1995 and
1996.

                               38
<PAGE>
 Because  those  regulatory changes may not be  implemented,
and  in  order to avoid existing uncertainty under the  ESA,
the  company,  in  February 1995, obtained from  the  United
States  Fish and Wildlife Service an Incidental Take  Permit
and  associated Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) with respect
to  northern spotted owls on a portion of its Oregon coastal
timberlands.  That HCP estab-
lishes  a  protocol  for  the  harvest  of  timber  and  the
protection  of the northern spotted owl on those timberlands
and  is  expected to remain in effect for at least 50 years.
The  company believes the most effective way to  manage  its
timberlands for the
growth  and harvest of timber and the protection of wildlife
and  fish habitat is to develop comprehensive plans for  the
management  of  all  the  resources  on  those  timberlands.
Accordingly,   the  company  may  develop  HCPs   or   other
arrangements with
federal and state fish and wildlife agencies for other parts
of its Pacific Northwest timberlands that
would  address the protection of wildlife and  fish  habitat
for both listed and non-listed species.
 The  combination  of  the  forest  management  and  harvest
restrictions  and  impacts described in the  preceding  four
paragraphs  has  increased  operating  costs,  resulted   in
increases in the value of timber and logs from the company's
Pacific  Northwest timberlands, and contributed to increases
in  the  prices paid for wood products and wood chips.   The
company  does not know whether these effects will  continue.
If  wood  products  prices remain at their  present  levels,
there  may be an increase in substitution of other  products
for lumber and plywood.
 The  company  does  not believe that the  restrictions  and
impacts  described in the above paragraphs have had,  or  in
1995  or  1996  will  have,  a  significant  effect  on  the
company's  total harvest of timber, although they  may  have
such an effect in the future.
 In  addition  to the foregoing, the company is  subject  to
federal,  state or provincial and local air, water and  land
pollution  control,  solid and hazardous  waste  management,
disposal  and remediation laws and regulations in all  areas
in  which  it  has  operations, and to market  demands  with
respect  to  chemical content of some products  and  use  of
recycled fiber.  Compliance with these laws, regulations and
demands  usually involves capital expenditures  as  well  as
operating costs.  The company cannot easily quantify  future
amounts  of  capital expenditures required  to  comply  with
these  laws,  regulations  and demands,  or  the  impact  on
operating   costs,  because  in  some  instances  compliance
standards
have  not  been  developed  or  have  not  become  final  or
definitive.    In   addition,  compliance   with   standards
frequently serves other purposes such as exten-
sion of facility life, increase in capacity, changes in  raw
material  requirements, or increase  in  economic  value  of
assets  or  products.  While it is difficult to isolate  the
environmental   component  of  most  manufacturing   capital
projects,  the  company estimates that capital  expenditures
for environmental compliance were approximately 8 percent of
total  capital expenditures in 1992 and 1993 and 11  percent
in  1994.   Based on its understanding of current regulatory
requirements, the company expects that this percentage  will
range from 9 to 11 percent of total capital expenditures  in
1995 and 1996.
 The  company  is involved in the environmental  remediation
of  numerous sites, including 36 Superfund sites  where  the
company  has been named as a potentially responsible  party.
Some  of  the  sites are on property presently  or  formerly
owned  by  the  company  where  the  company  has  the  sole
obligation  to remediate the site or shares that  obligation
with  one or more parties, and others are third-party  sites
involving  several  parties who have  a  joint  and  several
obligation  to remediate the site.  The company's  liability
with  respect  to  these sites ranges from insignificant  at
some  sites  to  substantial at  others,  depending  on  the
quantity, toxicity and nature of materials deposited by  the
company  at  the site and, with respect to some  sites,  the
number  and  economic  viability of  the  other  responsible
parties.

                                 39
<PAGE>
 The company spent $57 million in 1993,
$32 million  in  1994, and expects to spend $43  million  in
1995 on environmental remediation of
these  sites.   It  is the company's policy  to  accrue  for
environmental  remediation costs when it is determined  that
it is probable that such an obligation exists and the amount
of  the  obligation can be reasonably estimated.   Based  on
currently  available information and analysis,  the  company
believes   that  it  is  reasonably  possible   that   costs
associated  with  all identified sites  may  exceed  current
accruals by amounts that may prove insignificant or that
could   range,   in  the  aggregate,  up  to   approximately
$140 million over several years.  This estimate of the upper
end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs  is
much less certain than the estimates upon which accruals are
currently  based and utilizes assumptions less favorable  to
the company among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.
 The  company  has  completed  a  review  of  all  its  wood
products  facilities for compliance with the  Prevention  of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations under the  Clean
Air  Act,  has  disclosed PSD compliance issues  to  various
appropriate state
agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  and
is  negotiating compliance settlements with those  agencies.
The  company  is  currently in the process of  completing  a
similar  review of all of its pulp and paper facilities  for
PSD compliance in 1995.
 A new regulation under Title 5 of the Clean
Air Act will require additional operating permits
at many of the company's manufacturing operations.  Although
significant   work  is  required  to  prepare   the   permit
applications in 1995 and 1996, the company anticipates  that
it will be able to obtain the necessary permits.
 The  company has continued to make substantial progress  in
reducing  the  minute amount of dioxin that  had  previously
been  detected in wastewater effluent, sludge and pulp  from
the company's
bleached kraft pulp mills.
 The  EPA has published proposed regulations, known  as  the
"cluster  rules,"  which would establish maximum  achievable
control  technology  standards  for  non-combustion  sources
under  the  Clean  Air Act, and the development  of  revised
wastewater  effluent limitations under the Clean Water  Act.
The  company's operations are well positioned  to  meet  the
proposed  limits for dioxin.  However, if the cluster  rules
are  adopted as proposed, they will require the  company  to
commit  additional capital to further reduce  air  emissions
and wastewater
discharges   by   1999.   Preliminary  estimates   of   that
additional capital range as high as $400 million, which  may
further  increase  the annual percentage  of  the  company's
total   capital   expenditures  devoted   to   environmental
compliance, although that is not anticipated prior to 1996.

Financial Review


Results of Operations

1994 Compared With 1993

The  company's  1994 consolidated sales  and  revenues  were
$10.4  billion, a 9 percent increase over the  $9.5  billion
reported  last  year.  Net earnings were  $589  million,  or
$2.86  per common share, compared with 1993 net earnings  of
$579  million,  or  $2.83 per common share.   1994  earnings
include  the  return  of countervailing  duty  by  the  U.S.
government against Canadian lumber imports and
the  expected  cost of postretirement benefits for  Canadian
employees.   The  net effect of these two items  contributed
$.03 per common share.  1993 earnings included gains of $132
million,  or $.65 per common share, from the sale of  assets
and  extinguishment of debt, and a $15 million, or $.08  per
common share, charge to earnings to reflect the revised 1993
federal  corporate  tax rate in the company's  deferred  tax
accounts.
 The continuation in 1994 of the company's
major modernization projects, started in 1993, accounted for
the  significant increase in capitalized interest from  year
to year.
 The  significant  changes  from the  prior  year  in  other
income for the company and real estate and
financial services are attributable to the $70 mil-
lion pretax gain on the disposal of the company's investment
in  the  infant  diaper business and  the  real  estate  and
financial services pretax gain of
$42 million on the sale of GNA Corporation, both in 1993.
 The  timberlands and wood products segment posted operating
earnings  of  $1  billion in 1994, which  is  a  16  percent
increase over the $891 million reported in 1993.  Sales  for
this segment were $5 bil-
lion,  up  12  percent over the $4.5 billion  reported  last
year.   This  segment posted record performances during  the
year   as  the  businesses  continued  to  accomplish  their
business  improvement plans, timber supplies remained  tight
and markets re-
mained strong throughout the year.
 The  pulp,  paper  and packaging segment's  1994  operating
earnings  were  $211  million, up  substantially  from  last
year's  $61  million.  This segment reported sales  of  $4.1
billion  for  the year, an increase of 14 percent  over  the
$3.6  billion in 1993.  Strong demand coupled with continued
price  improvement over the prior year in both the  domestic
and  export  pulp, paper and packaging markets are  the  key
factors in this recovery.
 The  combined  real estate and financial services  segments
earned $18 million in 1994 compared
with  last year's earnings of $94 million, which included  a
pretax gain of $42 million on the sale of GNA Corporation as
well as one quarter of GNA operating results.

1993 Compared With 1992

Sales and revenues in 1993 were $9.5 billion, an increase of
3  percent  over 1992.  Net earnings were $579  million,  or
$2.83  per common share, up from 1992 net earnings  of  $372
million,  or $1.83 per common share.  Included in  1993  net
earnings were after-tax gains of:
 -   $52  million,  or  $.25  per  common  share,  from  the
extinguishment   of   debt,  which  was   reported   as
an extraordinary item.
 -  $44 million, or $.22 per common share, from the sale  of
the infant diaper business.

                             41
<PAGE>
 -  $36 million, or $.18 per common share,
from the sale of GNA Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary.

 And  a  charge  of $20 million, or $.10 per  common  share,
which reflected the revised 1993 federal corporate tax  rate
in  the  company's deferred and current tax accounts.   This
charge  consisted of $.08 per common share due to the effect
of  the higher rate on the accumulated temporary differences
at  December 27, 1992, and $.02 per common share related  to
1993.
 The  net  sales and revenues and related costs and expenses
of  real  estate  and financial services were  substantially
less in 1993 when compared with 1992 as a result of the sale
of GNA Corporation.
 During 1993 the company refinanced a significant amount  of
debt,  which  resulted in a short-term increase in  interest
expense.   The  increase in capitalized  interest  over  the
prior year coincided with expanded activity in the company's
major capital projects.
 The  significant  decrease in financial  services  interest
expense  was  due  to the liquidation of  Republic   Federal
Savings & Loan Association during 1992 and the sale  of  GNA
Corporation   in  early  1993.   In  addition,   accelerated
prepayments  caused  by mortgage refinancings  significantly
reduced collateralized mortgage obligation bonds.
 Significant  items in relation to net earnings included  in
other income for 1993 were a $70 million pretax gain on  the
disposal  of  the company's investment in the infant  diaper
business through a public offering in a new company, Paragon
Trade  Brands,  Inc.,  and  the real  estate  and  financial
services  pretax  gain of $42 million on  the  sale  of  GNA
Corporation.
 The  timberlands and wood products operating  earnings  for
1993  were $891 million, an increase of 73 percent over  the
$515  million recorded in 1992.  Prices for logs and  lumber
exceeded  1992 levels due to increasing demand  for  housing
construction  materials  and raw material  supply  shortages
resulting    from   reduced   harvests   in   the    Western
public forests.
 The  pulp,  paper and packaging segment had  a  $61 million
operating  profit  in  1993, significantly  below  the  $251
million posted in 1992.  Prices for most of the products  in
this  segment  were at levels well below the previous  year.
The personal care products business included in this segment
was di-
vested in the first quarter of 1993.
 The   real  estate  and  financial  services  segments  had
operating earnings of $94 million in 1993 compared with  $81
million in 1992.
 As  a  part  of the GNA Corporation sales transaction,  the
company assumed $225 million of GNA debt.
 
1992 Compared With 1991

Sales  and  revenues in 1992 were $9.3 billion, up 6 percent
from  1991.   Net earnings were $372 million, or  $1.83  per
common share, compared with a 1991 loss of $162 million,  or
$.80  per common share.  1991 results reflected an after-tax
special-items  charge  to earnings of  $344  million.   1992
research and development expenses decreased 24 percent  from
1991  as  a result of the implementation of certain  of  the
company's  restructuring  and  business  improvement  plans.
Interest  expense incurred for 1992 was down by $68 million,
or  14  percent,  primarily due to the  dissolution  of  the
company's savings and loan operations in Southern California
during  the  year.  Significant changes in other  income  in
1992,  compared  with 1991, included a $25  million  partial
settlement accrued in 1992 with respect to a lawsuit for the
refund  of  federal income taxes, and earnings of $2 million
in  the  company's  real estate joint-venture  and  limited-
partnership activities in 1992, after losses of $17  million
in  1991,  attributable to the restructuring or  sale  of  a
number of these investments.
 In 1992 the company purchased two pulp
mills, three sawmills, timberlands in Georgia, and a
forest management license in Alberta, Canada, from Procter &
Gamble.

                                   42
<PAGE>
 The  1992  timberlands and wood products operating earnings
were $515 million, compared with $155 million in 1991, which
included  a  restructuring charge  of  $152  million.   This
segment's improved earnings were driven, in part, by  strong
raw  material  and  converted  wood  products  prices.   The
curtailment of wood supply from public lands in the  western
United States, along with increased demand generated by  the
slowly  improving U.S. economy, exerted upward  pressure  on
the  value of wood products in both the domestic and  export
markets.
 Pulp,  paper  and  packaging operating earnings  were  $251
million for 1992, compared with $108 million in the previous
year, which included a restructuring charge of $129 million.
While pulp pricing showed some temporary strength due to the
mid-year  strike in the company's Canadian pulp  mills,  the
overall trend from a year ago was down.  Newsprint and paper
suffered continued weak prices throughout 1992.
 Real estate posted operating earnings of $13 mil-
lion in 1992 after recording a loss of $175 million in 1991,
which included a $155 million restructuring charge.
 Financial  services operating earnings were $68 million  in
1992,  up  13 percent from the 1991 results of $60  million.
While  this segment benefited from lower interest rates  for
most  of  the  year, earnings were affected as a  result  of
reduced investment
returns.   The  dissolution of the  company's  wholly  owned
subsidiary  Republic  Federal Savings  &  Loan  Association,
which   operated  primarily  in  Southern  California,   was
completed during 1992.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

The company is committed to the maintenance of
a sound, conservative capital structure.  This commitment is
based  upon  two considerations:  the obligation to  protect
the  underlying interests of its shareholders  and  lenders,
and  the  desire  to  have access, at all  times,  to  major
financial markets.
 The   important  elements  of  the  policy  governing   the
company's capital structure are as follows:
 -  To view separately the capital structures of Weyerhaeuser
Company,  Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and  Weyerhaeuser
Financial Services,
Inc.,  given the very different nature of their  assets  and
business   activities.   The  amount  of  debt  and   equity
associated  with the capital structure of each will  reflect
the basic earnings capacity, real value and unique liquidity
characteristics of the assets dedicated to that business.
 -  The  combination  of maturing short-term  debt  and  the
structure  of long-term debt will be managed judiciously  to
minimize  liquidity  risk.  Long-term  debt  maturities  are
shown in Note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

Operations

The company's financial position in 1994 remained strong  as
it  generated  $1.3  billion of cash  flow  from  operations
before  changes  in  working  capital,  compared  with  $982
million in 1993.

                                43

Cash  flow from operations before changes in working capital
by business segment was as follows:

</TABLE>
 
 Weyerhaeuser    Company's   working    capital    decreased
$512 million   from  the  prior  year-end.   Major   factors
affecting  the  decline  were an  increase  in  the  current
portion  of  long-term  debt as the 9 1/4  percent  and  9.36
percent  notes  totaling $300 million became  due  in  1995,
increases  in  accounts   payable  and  accrued  liabilities
amounting  to  $283  million, and an  increase  in  accounts
receivable of $126 million.
 In the real estate and financial services seg-
ments,  the  mortgage  operations  built  an  inventory   of
mortgage  loans  receivable in 1993, which was  reversed  in
1994 as loan sales exceeded originations.
 Significant  non-recurring items  that  impacted  the  cash
flow  from operations in 1993 were the $52 million  gain  on
extinguishment  of  debt,  net  of  income  tax,  which  was
recorded  as an extraordinary item; the pretax gain  of  $70
million  from  the  sale  of  the  company's  infant  diaper
business; and the pretax gain of $42 million from  the  sale
of GNA Corporation.

Investing

Capital  expenditures amounted to $1.1 billion in  1994  and
$967  million  in  1993.   They are  currently  expected  to
approximate  $1.2 billion in 1995; however, the expenditures
could  be increased or decreased as a consequence of  future
economic   conditions.    The  company   had   approximately
$306 million  in  capital expenditures  committed  on  major
projects   at   year-end   1994  representing   construction
activities at its Longview, Wash., and Plymouth, N.C.,  pulp
and paper facilities and a new oriented strand board mill in
West Virginia.


Recent capital spending, including acquisitions, has been in
the following areas:

 Financial  services had a decrease from  1993  to  1994  in
mortgage and investment securities ac-
quired  and  the related proceeds from the sale of  mortgage
and  investment securities principally as a  result  of  the
sale of GNA Corporation.
 The  company had proceeds of $616 million from the sale  of
its  infant  diaper business and the sale of GNA Corporation
in 1993.

                                44

Financing

The  reductions  in  both the sales of  debentures  and  the
related  payments on debentures, commercial paper and  other
debt by Weyerhaeuser in 1994 as compared with the prior year
are a result of the debt restructuring activity in 1993.
 Cash dividends paid on common shares
amounted  to $247 million in 1994 and $246 million in  1993.
Although  common  share dividends have exceeded  our  target
payout  ratio  in recent years, it is the company's  intent,
over time, to pay dividends to its common shareholders in  a
range of 35 to 45 percent of common share earnings.
 To   ensure   its  ability  to  meet  future   commitments,
Weyerhaeuser Company, Weyerhaeuser Real Estate  Company  and
Weyerhaeuser  Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser
Financial Services, Inc., have established at year-end  1994
unused bank lines of credit in the maximum aggregate sum  of
approximately  $2.5  billion.  None of  the  entities  is  a
guarantor of the borrowings of the others under any of these
credit facilities.

Contingencies

The   company   is   a  party  to  legal   proceedings   and
environmental matters generally incidental to its  business.
Although  the  final  outcome of  any  legal  proceeding  or
environmental  matter is subject to a great  many  variables
and  cannot  be predicted with any degree of certainty,  the
company   presently  believes  that  the  ultimate   outcome
resulting from these proceedings and matters would not  have
a   material  effect  on  the  company's  current  financial
position,  liquidity or results of operations;  however,  in
any  given  future  reporting period,  such  proceedings  or
matters   could  have  a  material  effect  on  results   of
operations.

Accounting Matters

Pronouncements

During the year, the company implemented:
 -  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  (SFAS)  No.
106,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement  Benefits
Other  Than  Pensions,"  for its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,
Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.
 -  SFAS  No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," which requires accrual accounting to be used  for
the  cost  of  benefits  provided  to  former  and  inactive
employees who have not yet retired.
 -  SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and  Equity  Securities,"  which  addresses  accounting  and
reporting for invest-
ments  in  equity securities that have readily  determinable
fair values and for all investments in debt securities.
 -  SFAS  No. 119,  "Disclosure about  Derivative  Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"  which
requires  more complete disclosures on derivative  financial
instruments.
  None of these implementations had a significant impact  on
the   company's  results  of  operations  or  its  financial
position.

Accounting and Reporting Standards Committee

During  the  year,  the Accounting and  Reporting  Standards
Committee,  comprised of three outside  directors,  reviewed
with  the  company's  management and  with  its  independent
public  accountants the scope and results of  the  company's
internal  and external audit activities and the adequacy  of
the  company's internal accounting controls.  The  committee
also  reviewed current and emerging accounting and reporting
requirements and practices affecting the company.

Report of Independent Public Accountants





To the shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Company:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Weyerhaeuser Company (a Washington
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 25,  1994,  and
December  26, 1993, and the related consolidated  statements
of  earnings, cash flows and shareholders' interest for each
of  the  three years in the period ended December 25,  1994.
These  financial  statements are the responsibility  of  the
company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  auditing standards.  Those standards require  that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial state-
ments  are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used   and
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well   as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for  our
opinion.
 In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present  fairly,  in  all material respects,  the  financial
position  of  Weyerhaeuser Company and  subsidiaries  as  of
December 25, 1994, and December 26, 1993, and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years  in  the period ended December 25, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements





For the three-year period ended December 25, 1994

NOTE 1:
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The  consolidated financial statements include the  accounts
of  Weyerhaeuser  Company  and  all  of  its  majority-owned
domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany
transactions and accounts are eliminated.
 Certain of the consolidated financial state-
ments and notes to financial statements are pre-
sented   in   two   groupings:    (1) Weyerhaeuser   Company
(Weyerhaeuser, or the company), which is principally engaged
in the growing and harvesting of
timber  and the manufacture, distribution and sale of forest
products, and (2) real estate and financial services,  which
includes Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO), which  is
involved  in real  estate development and construction,  and
Weyerhaeuser Financial Services, Inc. (WFS), whose principal
subsidiary is Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company (WMC).  Republic
Federal Savings & Loan Association, a subsidiary of WFS, was
dissolved in 1992, and GNA Corporation, a subsidiary of WFS,
was sold in April 1993.
 
Changes in Accounting Principles

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS)  No.  106, "Employers' Accounting for  Postretirement
Benefits  Other  Than  Pensions," was  implemented  for  the
company's wholly owned subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.,
in  1994  and  did  not  have a significant  impact  on  the
company's results of operations or its financial position.
 In  November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB)  issued  SFAS  No.  112, "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postemployment Benefits," which requires accrual  accounting
to be used for the cost of benefits provided to former
and  inactive  employees  who have  not  yet  retired.   The
company  adopted this pronouncement in the first quarter  of
1994 by recording a cumulative catch-
up  charge  to  earnings, which did not have  a  significant
impact on results of operations or financial position.
 In  May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities,"  which
addresses accounting
and reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values, and for all investments in
debt   securities,  and  was  effective  for  fiscal   years
beginning  after  December 15, 1993.  The adoption  of  this
pronouncement in 1994 did not have a significant  effect  on
the   company's  results  of  operations  or  its  financial
position.
 In  October 1994, the FASB issued SFAS No. 119, "Disclosure
about Derivative Financial Instru-
ments  and  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments,"  which
requires more complete disclosures on deriva-
tive  financial instruments.  This pronouncement, which  was
effective  for fiscal years ending after December 15,  1994,
was implemented by the company in 1994.
 
Prospective Accounting Changes

In  May  1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting  by
Creditors   for  Impairment  of  a  Loan,"  which   requires
creditors  to measure impairment based on the present  value
of  expected  future  cash flows discounted  at  the  loan's
effective interest rate.
 In October 1994, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -
Income Recognition and Disclosures," which amended SFAS  No.
114   to  allow  creditors  to  use  existing  methods   for
recognizing  interest on impaired loans  and  also  requires
creditors to disclose certain information about how interest
income was recognized on impaired loans.
 Both   of   these   pronouncements  become  effective   for
financial  statements  for  fiscal  years  beginning   after
December  15,  1994.  The company believes that  the  future
adoption of these pronouncements will not have a significant
impact on results of operations or financial position.


                             53

<PAGE> 
Net Earnings Per Common Share

Net  earnings  per common share are based  on  the  weighted
average  number  of  common shares  outstanding  during  the
respective periods.  Average common equivalent shares (stock
options) outstand-
ing have not been included, as the computation would not  be
dilutive.   Weighted average common shares outstanding  were
205,543,000, 204,866,000 and 203,373,000 for the years ended
December 25, 1994, December 26, 1993, and December 27, 1992,
respectively.
 Fully   diluted   earnings-per-share   amounts   are    not
applicable because the effect of the conversion of the stock
options is not dilutive.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The company has, where appropriate, estimated the fair value
of  financial instruments.  These fair value amounts may  be
significantly  affected by the assumptions  used,  including
the  discount rate and estimates of cash flow.  Accordingly,
the  estimates  presented are not necessarily indicative  of
the
amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange.
Where   these  estimates  approximate  carrying  value,   no
separate disclosure of fair value is shown.

Derivatives

The  company  has  only limited involvement with  derivative
financial  instruments and does not  use  them  for  trading
purposes.   They  are  used to manage well-defined  interest
rate and foreign exchange risks.  These include:
 -  Foreign exchange contracts, which are hedges for foreign
denominated accounts receivable and payable, have  gains  or
losses recognized at settlement date.
 -  Interest  rate swaps entered into with  major  banks  or
financial  institutions in which the company  pays  a  fixed
rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments
being   calculated  on  a  notional  amount.   The  premiums
received  by  the  company on the sale of  these  swaps  are
treated  as  deferred income and amortized against  interest
expense over the term of the agreements.
 -  Hedging  transactions  entered  into  by  the  company's
mortgage banking subsidiary to protect
both  the  completed  loan inventory and  loans  in  process
against   changes   in   interest  rates.    The   financial
instruments  used to manage interest rate risk  are  forward
sales commitments, interest rate futures and options.
 The   company's  use  of  derivatives  does  not   have   a
significant effect on the company's results of opera-
tions or its financial position.
 
Cash and Short-Term Investments

For  purposes of cash flow and fair value reporting,  short-
term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less
are  considered as cash equivalents.  Short-term investments
are stated at cost, which approximates market.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
includes labor, materials and production overhead.  The last-
in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to cost the majority  of
domestic  raw  materials,  in  process  and  finished  goods
inventories;  either  the  first-in,  first-out  (FIFO)   or
average  cost  method is used to cost all other inventories.
Had  the FIFO method been used to cost all inventories,  the
amounts  at which product inventories are stated would  have
been  $237  million and $239 million greater at December 25,
1994, and December 26, 1993, respectively.

Property and Equipment

The  company's  property  accounts  are  maintained  on   an
individual  asset  basis.  Betterments and  replacements  of
major units are capitalized.  Maintenance, repairs and minor
replacements   are  expensed.   Depreciation   is   provided
generally on the straight-line or unit-of-production  method
at  rates based on estimated service lives.  Amortization of
logging  railroads and truck roads is provided generally  as
timber is harvested and is based upon rates determined  with
reference  to the volume of timber estimated to  be  removed
over such facilities.
 The  cost  and  related depreciation of  property  sold  or
retired  is  removed  from the property  and  allowance  for
depreciation  accounts and the gain or loss is  included  in
earnings.


                             54

<PAGE>
Timber and Timberlands

Timber and timberlands are carried at cost less fee stumpage
charged  to disposals.  Fee stumpage is the cost of standing
timber  and is charged to fee timber disposals as fee timber
is  harvested,  lost  as the result  of  casualty  or  sold.
Stumpage rates are determined with reference to the cost  of
timber  and  the  related volume of timber estimated  to  be
recoverable.    Timber  carrying  costs  are   expensed   as
incurred.

Income Taxes

Deferred  income  taxes are provided  to  reflect  temporary
differences  between the financial and tax bases  of  assets
and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and laws.

Pension Plans

The   company  has  pension  plans  covering  most  of   its
employees.   The  U.S.  plan  covering  salaried   employees
provides  pension  benefits based on the employee's  highest
monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final
10 years before retirement.  Plans covering hourly employees
generally  provide benefits of stated amounts for each  year
of  service.   Contributions to  U.S.  plans  are  based  on
funding  standards  established by the  Employee  Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

In  addition  to  providing pension  benefits,  the  company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
some  retired employees and accrues the expected future cost
of these benefits for its current eligible retirees and some
employees.  All of the company's salaried employees and some
hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits when
they retire.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications have been made to  conform  prior
years' data to the current format.

Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company

WRECO  recognizes  income from the  sales  of  single-family
housing units when construction has been completed, required
down  payments have been received, and title has  passed  to
the  customer.   Income  from  the  sales  of  multi-family,
commercial  properties, developed lots and undeveloped  land
is  recognized when required down payments are received  and
other income recognition criteria are satisfied.
 Real  estate  is  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net
realizable value.  The determination of net realizable value
is based on WRECO's plans for its property and its financial
ability  to carry out such plans.  Changes in future  market
demand,  interest  rates and company plans  may  affect  net
realizable  value.  Land, land development and  construction
costs, including capitalized carrying costs, are accumulated
and  allocated to individual units in proportion to relative
sales value.
 
Weyerhaeuser Financial Services

WMC  and  its  subsidiaries  are primarily  engaged  in  the
mortgage banking industry and also offer insurance services.
 -  Mortgage notes held for sale are stated at the lower  of
cost  or  market, which is computed by the aggregate  method
(unrealized losses are offset by unrealized gains).  Hedging
transactions are entered into to protect the inventory value
from  changes in interest rates.  Hedge positions  are  also
used to protect the pipeline of loan applications in process
from  changes in interest rates.  Hedging gains  and  losses
realized  during the commitment and warehousing  period  are
deferred  to  the extent of unrealized gains on the  related
mortgage loans held for sale.
 -  The  costs associated with purchasing mortgage servicing
rights  are deferred.  Excess service fees result from  loan
sales in which WMC retains the loan servicing rights and are
based on the present value of future servicing revenue  less
a  normal  servicing fee, based upon the estimated remaining
life of the loans sold.


                             55

<PAGE>
 The  Mortgage Securities Corporations were formed  for  the
limited   purpose   of   issuing   collateralized   mortgage
obligation bonds (CMO bonds) secured by Government  National
Mortgage   Association   and   Federal   National   Mortgage
Association  certificates.   The  CMO  bonds  are  the  sole
obligation  of the issuer, and neither the company  nor  any
affiliated company has guaranteed or is otherwise  obligated
with respect to the CMO bonds.
 - The mortgage-backed certificates are carried at par value
adjusted  for  any unamortized discount or  premium.   These
discounts  or  premiums are amortized using  a  method  that
approximates   the  effective  interest  method   over   the
estimated life of the underlying mortgage loans.
 - CMO bonds are carried at unamortized cost.  Discounts and
premiums are amortized using a method that approximates  the
effective interest method over their estimated lives.
 In March 1992, Republic Federal Savings &
Loan  Association,  which was a federally chartered  savings
and  loan  institution that operated primarily  in  Southern
California,  sold  the  remainder of  its  branches,  ceased
accepting deposits as a federally chartered savings and loan
institution,  and filed an application with  the  Office  of
Thrift Supervision to undergo a voluntary dissolution, which
was  approved  in  the fourth quarter of 1992.   During  its
operation:
 -  Interest  income  was recorded on  the  accrual  method;
however,  interest was not accrued on loans that  were  more
than  90 days contractually delinquent and on certain  other
loans that management felt may not be recoverable.
 -  Gains  or losses on U.S. government and other securities
were recognized upon realization.
 -  Discounts on loans purchased were amortized into  income
over the expected average loan lives.
 In April 1993, WFS completed the sale of
GNA   Corporation.    As   a  part  of   that   transaction,
Weyerhaeuser assumed $225 million of outstanding  GNA  debt.
GNA Corporation and its life insurance subsidiaries provided
annuities, insurance and securi-
ties  marketed through financial institutions.   During  its
operation:
 -  Payments  received  on investment  and  limited  payment
contracts were recorded directly as deposits.
 - Investment income was recorded when earned.

NOTE 3:

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other  income  (expense), net, is  an  aggregation  of  both
recurring  and occasional non-operating income  and  expense
items  and,  as a result, fluctuates from period to  period.
No  individual income or (expense) item is significant other
than  the  $70 million gain on the disposal of the company's
investment  in the infant diaper business in  1993  and  the
real  estate and financial services gain of $42  million  on
the sale of GNA Corporation in 1993.

 The  corporate  income  tax  rate  was  increased  from  34
percent  to 35 percent, retroactive to January 1,  1993,  by
legislation enacted during the third quarter of 1993.   This
change  in  tax law increased income taxes in  1993  by  $15
million  due  to the effect of the higher tax  rate  on  the
accumulated temporary differences at December 27, 1992,  and
$5  million  due  to  the  effect of  adjusting  the  annual
effective tax rate used in prior quarters.

</TABLE>
  
 As   of   December  25,1994,  the  company  has   available
approximately $64 million of alternative minimum tax  credit
carryover,  which  does not expire, and foreign  tax  credit
carryovers of $1 million and $4 million expiring in 1998 and
1999,  respectively.  In addition, the company has  entities
that are not included in the consolidated federal income tax
return  which  have a net operating loss  carryover  of  $21
million expiring in 2009.
 The  company intends to reinvest undistributed earnings  of
certain foreign subsidiaries; therefore, no U.S. taxes  have
been  provided.   These earnings totaled approximately  $461
million at the end of 1994.  While it is not practicable  to
determine  the income tax liability that would  result  from
repatriation, it is estimated that withholding taxes payable
upon repatriation would approximate $46 million.
 

NOTE 5:

Extraordinary Item

In  1993 the company realized a net gain of $52 million ($86
million less related tax effect of $34 million) as a  result
of extinguishing certain debt obligations.

 The  assets of the U.S. and Canadian pension plans,  as  of
December  25,  1994,  and December 26, 1993,  consist  of  a
highly  diversified  mix of equity, fixed  income  and  real
estate securities.
 Approximately  1,550  employees  are  covered   by   union-
administered  multi-employer  pension  plans  to  which  the
company  makes negotiated contributions based  generally  on
fixed amounts per hour per employee.  Contributions to these
plans  were  $7 million in 1994, $6 million in 1993  and  $5
million in 1992.
 

NOTE 7:

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The company sponsors defined benefit post-
retirement plans for its U.S. employees that provide medical
and life insurance coverage as follows:
 -   Two   salaried   retiree  medical  plans   that   cover
substantially  all salaried employees who retire  under  the
company's retirement plan and their spouses.  Plan I  covers
those  retired or eligible to retire as of January 1,  1990,
and  provides full health coverage.  Plan II includes  those
salaried employees not eligible for Plan I, under which  the
company  provides a fixed dollar amount per year of  service
toward  the  premium, with the retiree paying the remainder.
The  company  reserves the right to revise the fixed  dollar
amount.
 -  An hourly retiree medical plan that covers approximately
3,750  active hourly employees and their spouses.  For some,
the  coverage  stops at age 65, while others  have  lifetime
coverage.   In some units the retiree must pay a portion  of
the premium, while in others the company pays the full cost.
There  are approximately 1,500 retired hourly employees  and
their spouses currently covered under these programs.
 -  A salaried retiree life insurance plan that starts at 80
percent  of salary at retirement and reduces to six thousand
dollars  in  20  percent  increments.   Approximately  5,200
persons  who  are retired or were eligible to retire  as  of
December 31, 1991, are subject to a different schedule.


                                  60

<PAGE>
 -   An   hourly  retiree  life  insurance  plan  in   which
approximately  11,000 active hourly employees  are  eligible
and approximately 2,000 hourly retirees have coverage.  Most
of these are covered by fixed dollar amount coverage that is
graded  down  after retirement.  Some units have pay-related
insurance on which the company pays the full cost.
 The  company sponsors three defined benefit and two defined
contribution postretirement plans for its Canadian employees
that provide medical and life insurance.  Collectively,  320
retired  employees are covered and 510 active employees  are
eligible  for  coverage in these five plans as  of  year-end
1994.

 For  measurement purposes, an 11.5, 11.0 and  10.5  percent
annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed  for
1992,  1993  and 1994, respectively; the rate is assumed  to
decrease  by  0.5 percent annually to a level of 6.0 percent
for the year 2003 and all years thereafter.  The effect of a
one  percent increase in the assumed health care cost  trend
rates would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 25, 1994, by 11.3 percent,
and   the  aggregate  of  the  service  and  interest   cost
components of net annual post-
retirement benefit cost for 1994 by 13.2 percent.

 The company, through its financial services busi-
ness,  has  investments in debt and equity  securities  that
management intends to hold to maturity.
These consist primarily of mortgage-backed securi-
ties  that were issued in prior years as collateral  against
the company's collateralized mortgage obligation bonds (Note
12).  In accordance with SFAS No. 119, these securities  are
included  in the balance sheet at amortized cost with  gains
and losses being recorded as realized.

 These assets are held by banks as trustees.  Principal  and
interest  collections on the certificates are used  to  meet
the  interest payments and reduce the outstanding  principal
balance of the bonds.
 The fair value of mortgage-backed certificates
is  estimated using the quoted market prices for  securities
backed  by  similar loans; restricted deposits are  held  at
cost, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

 The  above  maturities are calculated based on  anticipated
prepayments  on  the  certificates.   The  bonds   are   the
obligation  of the issuer, and neither the company  nor  any
affiliated company has guar-
anteed or is otherwise obligated with respect to the bonds.
 The  fair value of collateralized mortgage obligation bonds
is   estimated  using  analysis  of  projected  cash   flows
discounted at market yields.

liabilities.
 
 
Lines of Credit

At December 25, 1994, the company's lines of
credit include a five-year competitive advance and revolving
credit  facility agreement entered into in July 1994 with  a
group  of  banks that provides for borrowings of up  to  the
total  amount of $1.55 billion, all of which can be  availed
of  by the company, and $1 billion, which can be availed  of
by  WMC.   Borrowings  are at LIBOR or other  such  interest
rates as mutually agreed to between the borrower and lending
banks.   This credit facility agreement replaces  a  similar
agreement for $1.65 billion entered into 1990, which was  in
place at December 26, 1993.
 At  December 25, 1994, and December 26, 1993, WMC  had  $35
million  outstanding  against a  one-year  evergreen  credit
commitment entered into in 1990.
 WMC  has  a  revolving  credit agreement  with  a  bank  to
provide for:  (1) borrowings of up to $35 mil-
lion  for two years at prime rate, LIBOR or such other  rate
as may be agreed upon by WMC and the banks, (2) a commitment
fee  based on the unused credit, and (3) conversion  of  the
notes  as of July 1, 1997, to a five-year term loan  payable
in equal
quarterly   installments.   At  December   25,   1994,   and
December 26,   1993,   $20   million   and   $30    million,
respectively,  were outstanding under the  revolving  credit
agreement.
 During 1992 WFS entered into a three-year
term loan facility that was amended in May 1994 and provides
for:  (1) borrowings of up to $405 mil-
lion  at December 25, 1994, and $295 million at December 26,
1993, at LIBOR or other such rates as may be agreed upon  by
WFS  and  the banks, and (2) a commitment fee on the  unused
portion  of the credit.  $405 million and $295 million  were
outstanding  under this facility at December 25,  1994,  and
December 26, 1993, respectively.
 To  the  extent that these credit commitments  expire  more
than  one year after the balance sheet date and are  unused,
an equal amount of com-
mercial paper is classifiable as long-term debt.  Amounts so
classified are shown in the tables in this note.
 No portion of these lines has been availed of
by  the company, WRECO, WMC or WFS at December 25, 1994,  or
December 26, 1993, except as noted.
 In  1993 WFS completed the sale of GNA Corporation.   As  a
part of this transaction, the com-
pany assumed $225 million of outstanding GNA debt.
 Total interest costs incurred by WRECO
during each of the three years ended December 25, 1994, have
been capitalized and will be accounted for as an element  of
operating costs.
 The  company's  compensating balance  agreements  were  not
significant.

Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

On November 2, 1992, an action was filed against the company
in the Circuit Court for the First
Judicial  District of Hinds County, Miss., on  behalf  of  a
purported class of riparian property owners
in  Mississippi and Alabama whose properties are located  on
the  Tennessee  Tombigbee Waterway, Aliceville  Lake,  Cedar
Creek and the Magoway Creek.  The complaint seeks $1 billion
in  compensatory  and  punitive damages  for  diminution  in
property value, personal injuries and mental anguish
allegedly resulting from the discharge of pur-
ported  hazardous substances, including dioxins and  furans,
by the company's pulp and paper mill in Columbus, Miss., and
the  alleged fraudulent concealments of such discharge.  The
complaint  also  seeks  an  injunction  prohibiting   future
releases  and the removal of hazardous substances  allegedly
released  in  the  past.  On August 20,  1993,  a  companion
action  was  filed in Green County, Ala.,  on  behalf  of  a
similar purported class of riparian
owners  with  essentially the same claims as the Mississippi
case.  On January 20, 1995, the court
in  the Alabama action certified a class of all persons who,
as  of  the  date  of  the action commenced,  were  riparian
owners, lessees and licensees of properties located  on  the
Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway
in  Greene,  Sumter, Pickens and Marengo counties,  Alabama,
and  Lowndes and Noxubee counties, Mississippi, to determine
whether  the company is liable to the members of  the  class
for compensa-
tory and/or punitive damages and to determine the amount  of
punitive  damages, if any, to be awarded to the class  as  a
whole.  The class is estimated to exceed 400 members and may
range  from 1,000 to 1,500 members.  Neither the Mississippi
action
nor the Alabama action is presently scheduled for trial.

Environmental

It  is  the  company's  policy to accrue  for  environmental
remediation costs when it is determined that it is  probable
that  such  an  obligation exists  and  the  amount  of  the
obligation can be reasonably estimated.  Based on  currently
available  information and analysis,  the  company  believes
that  it  is reasonably possible that costs associated  with
all  identified sites may exceed current accruals by amounts
that  may  prove insignificant or that could range,  in  the
aggregate,  up  to approximately $140 million  over  several
years.   This  estimate of the upper end  of  the  range  of
reasonably  possible additional costs is much  less  certain
than  the estimates upon which accruals are currently based,
and utilizes assumptions less favor-
able  to  the company among the range of reasonably possible
outcomes.   In  estimating  both its  current  accruals  for
environmental remediation and the pos-
sible  range  of  additional future costs, the  company  has
assumed that it will not bear the entire cost of remediation
of  every  site to the exclusion of other known  potentially
responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable.
The  ability  of  other potentially responsible  parties  to
participate has been taken into account, based generally  on
each  party's  financial condition and probable contribution
on  a  per-site  basis.  No amounts have been  recorded  for
potential recoveries from insurance carriers.
 The   company   is   a  party  to  legal  proceedings   and
environmental matters generally incidental to its  business.
Although  the  final  outcome of  any  legal  proceeding  or
environmental  matter is subject to a great  many  variables
and  cannot  be predicted with any degree of certainty,  the
company   presently  believes  that  the  ultimate   outcome
resulting from
these  proceedings  and matters would not  have  a  material
effect   on   the  company's  current  financial   position,
liquidity  or results of operations; however, in  any  given
future  reporting period, such proceedings or matters  could
have a material effect on results of operations.
 
Other Items

The  company's capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions,
have  averaged  about $855 million in recent years  but  are
expected  to approximate $1.2 billion in 1995; however,  the
1995 expenditure level could be increased or decreased as  a
consequence of future economic conditions.  The company  had
approximately $306 million in capital expenditures committed
on major projects at year-end 1994.
 During  the  normal course of business, the company's  real
estate and financial services subsidiaries have entered into
certain   financial  commitments  comprised   primarily   of
agreements to fund up to $835 million in mortgage  loans  at
fixed  and floating prices, guarantees made on $137  million
of  partnership borrowings, and limited recourse obligations
associated  with $922 million of sold mortgage  loans.   The
fair value of the recourse on these loans is estimated to be
$8  million, which is based upon market spreads for sales of
similar  loans without recourse or estimates of  the  credit
risk of the associated recourse obligation.

 WRECO's  policy for requiring collateral is that a  secured
interest  will be established on receivables generated  from
the  sale of inventory and land and that the collateral will
be  subject  to foreclosure in the event of the  purchaser's
default.  Collateral
is not required for short-term, general accounts receivable.

 In  December 1986, the company adopted a Shareholder Rights
Plan  (the  "Plan") and declared a dividend distribution  of
0.6667  right on each outstanding common share.  Each  right
entitles its holder to purchase after the distribution  date
and  until December 1996 one one-hundredth of a share of the
company's cumulative preference shares, fourth series, at  a
price of $70, subject to adjustment.  The distribution  date
is  the  earlier of 20 business days after the  announcement
that  a  person or group has acquired 20 percent or more  of
Weyerhaeuser's outstanding common shares or 20 business days
after a person or group commences a tender or exchange offer
that  could  result in the person or group owning 30 percent
or   more   of  the  company's  outstanding  common  shares.
Following the distribution date, if anyone owning 20 percent
or  more  of the company's outstanding common shares  merges
with the company, with the company as the survivor, and  the
company's  common  shares are not changed or  exchanged,  or
engages  in  certain  self-dealing  transactions  with   the
company,  or  if  an event occurs that results  in  such  20
percent  owner's interest being increased by more  than  one
percent (e.g., a reverse stock split), or if anyone acquires
40  percent  or  more  of the company's  outstanding  common
shares, each right holder, other than such person or  group,
will be able, upon payment of the right's exercise price, to
acquire  shares  of  the  company's common  stock  or  other
securities or assets having an aggregate market value  equal
to  twice the right's purchase price.  If, after the company
announces  that  someone  owns 20 percent  or  more  of  the
company's outstanding common shares, the company is acquired
in  a  merger or other business combination, and the company
is  not the survivor, or the company engages in a merger  or
other  business combination transaction in which the company
is the surviving corporation but the company's common shares
are  changed or exchanged, or if 50 percent of the company's
earning  power  or assets is sold in one or several  related
transactions,  each right holder, other than any  20 percent
shareholder, will receive shares of the acquiring  company's
common  stock  having  a market value  equal  to  twice  the
right's exercise price.  Subject to certain time periods and
conditions,  the Plan may be amended and the rights  may  be
redeemed   at  a  price  of  $.05  per  right,  subject   to
adjustment.

Business Segments

The  company  is  principally engaged  in  the  growing  and
harvesting  of timber and the manufacture, distribution  and
sale  of  forest  products.   The  four  principal  business
segments   are  timberlands  and  wood  products  (including
softwood  lumber,  plywood  and  veneer;  composite  panels;
oriented  strand  board;  hardboard;  logs;  chips;  timber;
doors;  hardwood lumber and plywood; and treated  products);
pulp, paper and packaging (including pulp, newsprint, paper,
containerboard,   paperboard   and   shipping    containers,
recycling  and  chemicals);  real  estate  development   and
construction; and financial services.
 The  timber-based  businesses  involve  a  high  degree  of
integration  among  timber  operations;  building  materials
conversion   facilities;   and   pulp,   newsprint,   paper,
containerboard  and  paperboard  primary  manufacturing  and
secondary   conversion   facilities,   including   extensive
transfers of raw materials, semi-finished materials and  end
products  between  and among these groups.   Accounting  for
segment  profitability  involves allocations  of  joint  raw
materials  and  conversion costs and  the  use  of  transfer
prices that attempt to approximate current market values.
