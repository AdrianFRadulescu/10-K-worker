PART I.

ITEM I. - BUSINESS
- ------    --------
VWR Corporation ("VWR," "the Corporation," or "the Company") is one of the 
nation's largest suppliers of laboratory equipment, chemicals, and supplies to 
the scientific marketplace with sales of $509 million in 1993.  VWR was 
incorporated in Delaware on January 3, 1986, in order to complete the 
Distribution Plan ("Distribution Plan") of Univar Corporation.  Under the 
Distribution Plan, common stock of VWR Corporation was distributed in a tax-
free distribution to shareholders of record of Univar Corporation on February 
28, 1986.

Prior to March 1, 1990, the Company, through its subsidiaries, served four 
major markets:  laboratory equipment and supplies; photographic and graphic 
arts supplies; construction textiles and supplies used in the manufacture of 
upholstered furniture, bedding, and other products; covering fabrics and 
leathers for furniture manufacturers and the interior design industry.  

Effective March 1, 1990, the non-laboratory businesses were spun-off, in a 
tax-free transaction, into a new public company, Momentum Corporation 
(formerly Momentum Distribution, Inc., "Momentum").  Momentum shares were 
distributed as a tax-free dividend to VWR  shareholders of record on March 1, 
1990.  For each five shares of VWR stock held, shareholders received one share 
of Momentum common stock.  The distribution of shares was completed on March 
16, 1990.

In October 1992 the Company acquired certain assets related to the laboratory 
supply business of Johns Scientific, Inc. of Canada for approximately $7.4 
million.  In January 1993 the Company entered into an agreement with BDH Ltd. 
of Canada to become their sole distributor of laboratory chemicals and 
supplies.

In May 1992, the Company moved its headquarters from Media, Pennsylvania to 
West Chester, Pennsylvania.  

Principal Customers
- -------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries are not dependent on a single customer or 
a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a material 
adverse effect on its operations.











      <PAGE>5

Competition
- -----------
The Company competes in the industrial, governmental, biomedical, and 
educational market for laboratory equipment and supplies with numerous 
national and regional distributors.  In addition, there are numerous 
distributors of specialty lines and manufacturers who sell their product lines 
direct.  In the opinion of management, the Corporation is the nation's second 
largest distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.

As to all the activities of VWR, a combination of quality, price, and service 
are the major determining competitive factors.  All activities are considered 
highly competitive.

Environmental Regulation
- ------------------------
VWR has been designated by the EPA as a potentially-responsible party in 
connection with several sites.  Management believes that the Company's alleged 
contribution to each of these sites is de minimis and that the potential 
financial impact of these matters is not material to the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.

Employees
- ---------
Approximately 1,270 persons were employed by VWR Corporation as of February 
28, 1994.  Approximately 13% of the Company's employees are represented by 
unions.  The Company believes its relations with employees are excellent.

Methods of Distribution
- -----------------------
Approximately 19% of the Company's employees are outside sales personnel who 
provide product information and technical support to our customers.  Customers 
also place individual orders by telephone with the nearest inside sales 
representative or by computer.  Orders are shipped from local or central 
warehouses, depending on the nature of the product ordered.

Foreign Operations and Export Sales
- -----------------------------------
VWR acquired the scientific distribution business of Sargent-Welch Scientific 
of Canada, Limited in September, 1989.  In April, 1990, VWR purchased all the 
outstanding stock of Oxford Laboratories Ltd. of London, Ontario, Canada.  In 
October, 1992 the Company acquired certain assets related to the laboratory 
supply business of Johns Scientific, Inc. of Toronto, Canada.  In 1993 the 
Company entered into an agreement with BDH Ltd. of Canada to become their sole 
distributor of laboratory chemicals and supplies.






       <PAGE>6

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Canadian sales and identifiable 
assets attributable to these Canadian operations amounted to less than 10% of 
the Company's totals in each category.  During the year ended December 31, 
1993, VWR also had sales made by domestic locations to certain non-Canadian 
foreign customers.  


Raw Materials
- -------------
Numerous sources of supply generally exist for all products essential to the 
business of the Company.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade names
- -----------------------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries own several trademarks and trade names, 
none of which is considered material to the business as a whole.

Seasonality
- -----------
No material portion of the business of VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries is 
regarded as seasonal.  However, the majority of sales of the Sargent-Welch 
science education business occur in the third quarter of the calendar year.

Working Capital Items
- ---------------------
It is anticipated that VWR's financial resources and funds generated by 
operations will continue to be adequate to enable the Company to fund its 
current business.

Backlog
- -------
Backlog figures for the Company are not maintained on a consolidated basis.  
Such figures would not be meaningful because most orders received are for 
merchandise held in inventory and available for immediate shipment.

Research and Development
- ------------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries do not manage or conduct significant 
research activities relating to the development of new products, although the 
Company periodically works with customers or suppliers to improve or develop 
new uses for existing products.  In addition, VWR develops proprietary 
computer systems for internal use.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Results of Operations
- ---------------------
Sales

          1993       Increase        1992          Increase     1991
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          $509.2       3.9%          $490.2           11.2%     $441.0


Sales increased by almost 4% in 1993 due primarily to strong growth rates in 
our international export, high school science education (Sargent-Welch 
     <PAGE>12

division) businesses and the effects of the acquisition of Johns Scientific 
and the distribution agreement with BDH Ltd. in Canada.  Growth in Canada was 
less than expected.  Combining the operations and systems of the three 
companies proved to be a more complex task than anticipated and we experienced 
higher costs.  In addition, sales of our principal U.S. operating unit (VWR 
Scientific) lagged behind the market and we missed our internal target.

In 1992 each of our areas of business activity gained market share and 
contributed to our growth from 1991.  Sargent-Welch and our international 
export business sales were very strong.  The acquisition of Johns Scientific 
in the fourth quarter of 1992 for approximately $7.4 million and a large 
international order in the second half of 1992 accounted for about 1% of the 
sales growth.  Approximately 2% of the sales growth was due to price 
increases. 

Gross Margin
- -------------
                   1993     Increase     1992     Increase     1991
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Margin             $116.3      1.7%     $114.4       9.1%     $104.9
Percent 
  of Sales          22.8%                23.3%                 23.8%

Over the three-year period, gross margin as a percent of sales declined 
primarily as a result of customer mix and competitive price pressures.

Operating Expenses Before Restructuring and Other Charges
- ---------------------------------------------------------
                    1993      Increase      1992    Increase     1991
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Expenses          $101.9         6.7%      $95.5       8.2%     $88.3
Percent
  of Sales         20.0%                   19.5%                20.0%

In 1993 the increase in operating expenses before restructuring and other 
charges is primarily due to higher personnel costs and transition costs 
associated with the acquisition of Johns Scientific and the distribution 
agreement with BDH, Ltd., and our investment in a new direct marketing effort.  
Excluding the impact from Canadian acquisitions and direct marketing, 
operating expenses grew approximately 1.4%. 

Operating expenses grew at a rate slower than sales in 1992.  The reasons for 
the slower growth rate were our continuous emphasis on cost containment and 
the fact that fixed costs were stable while sales increased.


     <PAGE>13

Restructuring and Other Charges
- -------------------------------

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company made the decision to refocus 
certain information systems efforts into customer service systems and to take 
actions that would reduce operating expenses.  As a result of this effort, the 
Company recorded a $3.3 million charge which included non-cash charges of $1.3 
million (primarily for software development costs that do not have continuing 
value) and $2 million related to the consolidation of functions and facilities 
which consists primarily of severance and personnel-related costs.  
Approximately $2 million is accrued at December 31, 1993, and is reflected in 
current liabilities.  It is anticipated that the impact of the consolidation 
of certain functions will result in annualized cost savings of approximately 
$2 million, beginning in the first half of 1994.

Interest Expense
- ----------------
                    1993     Increase     1992     Decrease     1991
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest            $4.5      15.4%       $3.9      (7.1)%      $4.2
Percent
  of Sales           .9%                   .8%                  1.0%


In 1993 interest expense increased due to increased borrowing levels which 
occurred primarily for the purchase of a new warehouse facility for the 
Sargent-Welch division, system enhancements, and the 1992 acquisition of Johns 
Scientific.

Interest expense decreased in 1992 primarily as a result of reduced debt 
levels.  Lower debt levels were achieved primarily by improvements in working 
capital management.

Income Taxes
- ------------
                    1993     Decrease     1992     Increase     1991
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Taxes               $2.7      (52.6)%     $5.7        23.9%     $4.6
Percent
  of Sales           .5%                  1.2%                  1.0%
Effective
  tax rate         40.6%                 37.5%                 37.5%


The income taxes footnote to the financial statements describes the difference 
between the statutory and effective income tax rates.  The higher effective 
tax rate in 1993 reflects the impact of new U.S. federal tax legislation and 
the carryforward to future years of Canadian tax benefits not recognized 
currently. 

In 1993 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," which did not have a material effect on 
the consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Income Before Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change and Per Share Data
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   1993     Decrease     1992     Increase     1991
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Income             $3.9      (58.5)%     $9.4       22.1%      $7.7
Percent 
  of Sales          .8%                  1.9%                  1.8%
Per Share         $ .35                 $ .85                 $ .71
 
In addition to the impact of the restructuring and other charges, which were 
$3.3 million pre-tax ($1.9 million net of tax or $.18 per share),  income 
before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased primarily due to 
decreased operating income from lower than expected sales and margins, and 
higher operating expenses along with higher interest costs. 

In 1992 the improvement was the result of sales growth, improved profitability 
in our newer areas of business activity, expense controls, lower debt levels, 
and strong asset management.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
- ---------------------------------
The ratio of debt to equity over the past four years is as follows:

          1993            1992            1991            1990
- --------------------------------------------------------------
           1.5             1.1             1.3             1.8

The ratio of income before cumulative effect of accounting change, plus 
depreciation and amortization, to interest expense over the past four years is 
as follows:

          1993            1992            1991            1990
- --------------------------------------------------------------
           2.9             4.6             3.7             2.6



VWR continues to maintain a liquid financial position.  VWR's current ratio 
was 2.7 at December 31, 1993 and accounts receivable and inventory accounted 
for 63% of total assets.  For the year ended December 31, 1993 cash flow from 
operations of $6.4 million and debt borrowings of $14 million were used to 
finance investments in property and equipment of $13.4 million and to pay 
dividends of $4.4 million.  The significant investment in property and 
equipment was due to the purchase of a new warehouse facility for the Sargent-
Welch division and system enhancements.  Sufficient credit availability 
existed at December 31, 1993 to provide for the amounts of bank checks 
outstanding less cash in bank of $1.1 million.  Cash requirements reach a low 
toward the end of each calendar year due to the natural business cycle.

The Company has unsecured revolving credit loan agreements, expiring in 1996 
which provide for committed facilities of $75 million.  The Company is 
obligated to make available an unsecured subordinated revolving line of credit 
for approximately $5 million to Momentum Corporation (formerly Momentum 

     <PAGE>15

Distribution, Inc., the company spun off in 1990) through February 1995.  
There have been no loans to Momentum Corporation through December 31, 1993.

VWR borrows at short-term interest rates.  Our credit agreements give us the 
option to convert up to $37.5 million to a five-year term loan. Interest rate 
collars effectively establish a minimum and maximum rate on up to $55 million 
of revolving credit debt.  Collars of $25 million will expire in 1994 and are 
expected to be replaced with interest rate swaps of $10 million at a fixed 
rate.  The remaining collar of $30 million will expire in 1996 and is expected 
to be replaced at a fixed rate into 1999. 

On January 1, 1994, the company formed a joint venture with E. Merck of 
Germany to acquire an interest in Bender & Hobein GmbH, a distributor of 
laboratory supplies and equipment in Germany.  The investment will be 
accounted for using the cost method of accounting and was funded through the 
Company's revolving credit line.

VWR has been designated by the EPA as a potentially responsible party for 
various sites.  Management believes that any required expenditures would be 
immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other 
Than Pensions," in 1993, which resulted in a one-time non-cash charge of $1.4 
million (net of deferred tax benefit of $.9 million).  See notes to the 
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Due to declining interest and inflation rates, the Company changed certain 
pension and retiree medical actuarial assumptions, which included lowering the 
discount rate to 7.75% and rate of compensation increase to 4%.  These changes 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in 
1994.

As of December 31, 1993 the estimated cost for capital improvement projects is 
expected to range between $4-$5 million in 1994 related primarily to continued 
investments in new computer and warehouse systems.

                                 VWR CORPORATION 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ------------------------------------------
Principles of Consolidation
- --------------------
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VWR 
Corporation (the Company) and all of its subsidiaries (including its wholly 
owned Canadian subsidiary).  All significant intercompany accounts and 
transactions have been eliminated.  

Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization
- ---------------------------------------
Land, buildings, and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is computed 
using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and, 
generally, accelerated methods for income tax purposes.  Acquisition and 
development costs for significant business systems and related software for 
internal use are capitalized on significant projects and amortized over their 
estimated useful lives of seven years.  Interest is capitalized on major 
construction and development projects while in progress.  The Company 
capitalizes the costs of developing and producing catalogs, which are used by 
customers for ordering products.  Such costs are amortized over the period of 
use, generally two years.

Income Taxes
- ------------
In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," which supersedes SFAS No. 96 
previously followed by the Company.  The adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a 
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  
SFAS 109 uses the asset and liability method under which deferred taxes are 
determined based on the difference between the financial statement amounts and 
tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates.  Deferred tax 
expense is the result of changes in the asset or liability for deferred taxes.

Postretirement Benefits
- -----------------------
In 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions."  This Statement requires the Company to accrue 
the cost of retiree medical expenses over the period earned by the 
participants, which is a change from the Company's prior practice of recording 
these costs when incurred.


       <PAGE>26

Earnings Per Share and 1992 Stock Split
- ----------------------------------
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares and 
dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period.

On April 20, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one 
stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record 
as of May 9, 1992.  The aggregate par value, which did not change on a per-
share basis, of $5.6 million for the additional shares was transferred from 
additional paid-in capital to common stock.  All share and per-share data in 
these financial statements have been restated to give effect to the stock 
split.

Segment and Customer Information
- --------------------------------
The Company is engaged in one line of business, industrial distribution.  No 
single customer accounts for more than 10% of sales.  The majority of the 
Company's business activity pertains to, and accounts receivable result from, 
sales of laboratory equipment and supplies to businesses across a wide 
geographical area in various industries, mainly industrial, governmental, 
biomedical, and educational.  At December 31, 1993, the Company had no 
significant concentrations of credit risk.

Reclassifications
- -----------------

Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current 
year's presentation.

INVENTORIES
- -----------
Inventories consist primarily of purchased goods for sale and are valued at 
the lower of cost (substantially last-in, first-out method) or market.

LIFO cost at December 31, 1993, and 1992, was approximately $26.8 million and 
$25.5 million, respectively, less than current cost.  The effect of LIFO layer 
liquidations decreased the cost of sales by $.6 million in 1993, and $.4 
million in 1992 and 1991.

- ------------------------------
The Company has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign 
currency transactions with its Canadian subsidiary.  As of December 31, 1993, 
the Company had approximately $3.4 million of forward exchange contracts 
outstanding.  Net transaction gains and losses are not material.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had unsecured revolving lines of credit of 
$75 million.  Under the terms of these agreements, which expire in 1996, the 
Company may borrow U.S. dollars at various rates.  In addition, the Company 
can elect to convert up to $37.5 million of the line into term notes which can 
extend into the year 2001.  Principal amounts due on long-term debt, including 
assumed conversion in 1995 of the revolving credit agreements to term notes, 
in each of the five years beginning January 1, 1994, are $.1 million, $3.9 
million, $32.1 million, $7.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

A principal payment of $1.1 million due in 1994 on other debt is expected to 
be funded from the revolving credit facility and, accordingly, is classified 
as long-term.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the approximate weighted average 
interest rate on borrowings made under the unsecured revolving lines was 
7.88%, which approximates the year-end rate.



     <PAGE>29

The Company has purchased interest rate collars on $55 million, of which $20 
million expires on March 27, 1994, $5 million expires on May 3, 1994, and $30 
million expires on March 1, 1996.  The collars are based on the three-month 
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and have a floor of 6.75% and a 
ceiling of 9.5%.  The cost of the collars is treated as a reduction of the 
revolving credit debt and is being amortized as revolving credit interest 
expense over the terms of the collars.

The Company's long-term debt agreement provides for, among other terms, 
restrictive covenants with respect to working capital, tangible net worth, the 
current ratio, and the debt-to-equity ratio, which may restrict the Company's 
ability to declare or pay dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these 
terms, approximately $2 million of retained earnings at December 31, 1993, is 
available to pay dividends.

INCOME TAXES
- ------------
During 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  
The cumulative effect of the accounting change was not material.  

The income (loss) before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting 
change is as follows:

$.9 million which expire at various dates through 2000.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT
- ----------------------------
On May 20, 1988, the Company established a Shareholder Rights Agreement.  The 
Agreement is designed to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics that could 
deprive shareholders of an opportunity to realize the full value of their 
shares.

Under the Agreement, the Company has distributed a dividend of one Right for 
each outstanding share of the Company's stock.  When exercisable, each Right 
will entitle its holder to buy two shares of the Company's common stock at 
$45.00 per share.  The Rights will become exercisable if a purchaser acquires 
or makes an offer to acquire 20 percent of the Company's common stock.  In the 
event that a purchaser acquires 20 percent of the common stock, each Right 
shall entitle the holder, other than the acquirer, to purchase, at the Right's 
then-current full exercise price, shares of the Company's common stock having 
a market value of twice the then-current full exercise price of the Right.  In 
the event that, under certain circumstances, the Company is acquired in a 
merger or transfers 50 percent or more of its assets or earnings to any one 
entity, each Right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the 
surviving or purchasing company having a market value of twice the full 
exercise price of the Right.  The Rights, which expire on May 31, 1998, may be 
redeemed by the Company at a price of $.005 per Right.

STOCK AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS
- ----------------------------
Under the stock option and restricted stock plans, in addition to outstanding 
options, 235,411 shares were reserved for issuance at December 31, 1993.

Restricted Stock Awards
- -----------------------
The Company's restricted stock award plan, provides for grants of common stock 
to certain directors, officers, and managers.  The vesting periods range from 
one to eight years.  The fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
establishes the compensation amount, which is amortized to operations over the 
vesting period.  During the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, the 
Company granted 45,219, 7,580 and 15,116 shares, respectively, at fair market 
values of approximately  $.7 million, $.1 million and $.1 million, 
respectively.

Stock Options
- -------------
Under the stock option plan, options, which vest over 3 to 10 years, have been 
granted to certain officers and managers to purchase common stock of the 
Company at its fair market value at date of grant.  Changes in options 
outstanding were:

At December 31, 1993, there were 98,871 options exercisable at an average 
price of $7.50.

Savings Investment Plan
- -----------------------
The Company has a savings investment plan whereby it matches 50% of the 
employee's contribution up to 3% of the employee's pay.  For employee 
contributions between 3% and 7.5% of their pay, the Company will match 50% of 
the contribution within prescribed limits based on the Company's profitability 
for the year.  All Company contributions are used to buy shares of the 
Company's stock.  Expenses under this plan for the years ended December 31, 
1993, 1992, and 1991, were $.5 million, $.6 million and $.4 million, 
respectively.  At December 31, 1993, there were approximately 538,000 shares 
available for issuance under this Plan.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
- -----------------------------
In September, 1990, the Company established an employee stock ownership plan 
(ESOP) by, in effect, contributing 400,000 shares of treasury stock ($2.9 
million fair value) to the ESOP.  All full-time and part-time employees, 
except certain union employees, are eligible to participate in the plan.

The ESOP shares will be allocated equally to individual participants' accounts 
over a period up to ten years.  Vesting occurs equally over an employment 
period of five years at which time the employee is 100% vested in the plan.  
Expenses are recognized based on shares to be allocated in the subsequent year 
and are reduced for dividends paid, which approximated $.1 million in 1993, 
and $.2 million in 1992 and 1991.  The net expense for 1993, 1992, and 1991 
was approximately $.1 million, $.3 million and $.2 million, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
- ------------------------
Pension Plans:

The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all 
of its domestic employees, except for employees covered by independently 
operated collective bargaining plans.  Pension benefits are based on years of 
credited service and the highest five consecutive years' average compensation.  
Contributions to the Company plans are based on funding standards established 
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

The total VWR Corporation plans' funding status and the amounts recognized in 
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1993, and 1992, are:

The Company maintains a supplemental pension plan for certain senior officers.  
Expenses incurred under this plan in 1993 were approximately $.3 million.  
There were no expenses incurred under this plan for 1992 and 1991.

Certain employees are covered under union-sponsored, collectively bargained 
plans.  Expenses under these plans for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 
and 1991, were $.2 million, $.2 million and $.1 million, respectively, as 
determined in accordance with negotiated labor contracts.

Retiree Medical Benefits Program
- --------------------------------
The Company provides certain medical benefits for retired employees.  In 1993, 
the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
Than Pensions."  The Company elected to immediately recognize the calculated 
liability resulting in a one-time non-cash charge to income of approximately 
$1.4 million, net of a deferred tax benefit of approximately $.9 million.

Employees retired as of December 31, 1992 and active employees who reached age 
55 by December 31, 1992 are eligible to participate in the company's retiree 








<PAGE>36

health plan (the "plan").  There are also certain provisions for participation 
by spouses.  The plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on 
years of service and includes other co-payment and co-insurance provisions.

The Company does not fund the plan.  The liability of the plan at December 31, 
1993 is as follows:

The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following 
components:
  Service cost                                   $  7
  Interest cost                                   174

                                                =====
The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation is 10% through 1996 and declines 1% per year 
to a level of 5.4% in 2001 and thereafter.  The effect of a 1% annual increase 
in the assumed cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation by approximately 8%; the annual service and interest cost 
components in the aggregate would not be materially affected.  A 7.75% 
discount rate was used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation.

Before the adoption of SFAS No. 106, the retiree health care expense was 
recorded as claims were incurred.  The expense for 1992 and 1991 was 
approximately $.2 million.

LEASES
- ------
The Company leases office and warehouse space, computer equipment, and 
automobiles under operating leases with terms ranging up to 15 years, subject 
to renewal options.

Rental expense for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 
1993, 1992, and 1991, was approximately $5.2 million, $4.8 million, and $4.4 
million, respectively.

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
- ------------------------------
The Company is involved in various environmental, contractual, warranty, and 
public liability cases and claims, which are considered routine to the 
Company's business.  In the opinion of management, the potential financial 
impact of these matters is not material to the consolidated financial 
statements.

As a result of the March, 1990 spin-off of Momentum Corporation, VWR is 
obligated to make available to the spun-off company, through February 1995, an 
unsecured subordinated revolving line of credit of $5 million.  There have 
been no loans to Momentum Corporation under this facility.


ACQUISITION
- ----------

Effective October 5, 1992, the Company, through its wholly owned Canadian 
subsidiary,  acquired certain assets related to the laboratory supply business 
of Johns Scientific, Inc. of Toronto, Canada for approximately $7.4 million.  
This  acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
and was funded through the Company's revolving credit line, and a $1.6 
million, 8% note payable expected to be refinanced through the revolving line 
of credit.  The acquisition  is not material in relation to the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.  The $2.6 million excess purchase price 
over net assets acquired is being amortized over a 15 year period.


      <PAGE>38

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
- -------------------------------
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company made the decision to refocus 
certain information systems efforts into customer service systems and to take 
actions that would reduce operating expenses.  As a result of this effort, the 
Company recorded a $3.3 million charge which included non-cash charges of $1.3 
million (primarily for software development costs that do not have continuing 
value) and $2 million related to the consolidation of functions and facilities 
which consists primarily of severance and personnel-related costs.  As of 
December 31, 1993, approximately $2 million of these costs are accrued on the 
Company's consolidated balance sheet as a current liability.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- ------------------------------
To The Shareholders of VWR Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of VWR Corporation as of 
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1993.  Our audits also include the financial 
statement schedules listed in the index at Item 14(a).  These financial 
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and 
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of VWR Corporation 
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its operations 
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 
31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, 
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in 
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in 
all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
(postretirement benefits), in 1993, the Company changed its method of 
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

initial Interest Period(s) elected.

          (iii)  Limitations.  Each Term Loan shall be in the minimum amount

the Term Loan(s) in the aggregate be in the original principal amount of more 
than Thirty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000); and in 
no event shall a Conversion Option be exercised if following such exercise the 
aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loan(s) would be in excess of 
fifty percent (50%) of the then effective Commitment.  Except with respect to 
conversions of Portions of the Revolving Credit Loan which bear interest based 
on the Base Rate, the effective date of each Conversion Option shall be on the 
last day of the Interest Period(s) of the applicable Portion(s) of the 
Revolving Credit Loan being converted to a Term Loan.

     (d)  Authority of VWR.  Each of the Borrowers hereby irrevocably 
authorizes and requests that VWR execute all Advance Request Forms, make all 
elections as to interest rates, and take any other actions required or 
permitted of Borrowers hereunder, on its respective behalf, in each case with 
the same force and effect as if such entity had executed such Advance Request 
Form, made such election or taken such other action itself.

2.2.  Promissory Notes.  The indebtedness of Borrowers to each Bank under the 
Loan will be evidenced by Notes executed by Borrowers in favor of such Bank in 
the form of Exhibit C with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment and 
Exhibit D with respect to the Term Commitment (with appropriate insertions as 
to date of execution and principal amount).  The original principal amount of 
each Bank's Revolving Credit Note will be the amount identified in Paragraph 
2.3 hereof as its respective Maximum Principal Amount; provided, however, that 
notwithstanding the face amount of each such Note, Borrowers' liability under 
each such Note shall be limited at all times to the actual indebtedness, 
principal, interest and fees, then outstanding thereunder. The original 
principal amount of each Bank's Term Note(s) will be in the amount of the 
corresponding Term Loan multiplied by such Bank's Participation Percentage.

2.3.  Banks' Participations.  Banks shall participate in the Loan up to the 
Maximum Principal Amounts and in the Participation Percentages set forth in 
the schedule below:

2.4.  Use of Proceeds.  Funds advanced under the Loan shall be used solely for 
repayment in full of all amounts outstanding under the Existing Facilities and 
for Borrowers' working capital and general corporate purposes; provided, 
however, that the maximum principal amount which may be advanced to VWR 
International shall not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) outstanding at 
any time.

2.5.  Repayment.  

     (a)  Revolving Credit Loan.  

          (i)  The aggregate outstanding principal balance under the Revolving 
Credit Loan shall be due and payable on the Termination Date; provided, 
however, that each Money Market Advance shall be repaid in full on the earlier 
to occur of the Termination Date or expiration of the Interest Period with 
respect to such Money Market Advance.

          (ii)  The Termination Date may be extended not more than twice, each 
time for an additional one (1) year period, if (A) between August 1 and 
<PAGE>61

September 1 of each of 1994 and 1995, Borrowers submit to Agent a written 
request for such extension, which request Agent shall promptly forward to the 
Banks, and (B) all of the Banks agree in writing to such requested extension 
not later than October 1 of 1994 or 1995, as applicable.  Each Bank's decision 
to approve or decline an extension request shall be in its sole discretion, 
without any obligation, express or implied, to grant such extension, and may 
be based, without limitation, upon (A) such Bank's full credit assessment of 
Borrowers at the time of the request and (B) the ability of each Bank to 
propose to Agent, which will negotiate with Borrowers on behalf of Banks, 
revised terms of and conditions to this Agreement.  If all of the Banks have 
not agreed in writing to extend the Termination Date on or before October 1 of 
1994 or 1995, as applicable, then the Termination Date shall not be extended 
and the Termination Date then in effect shall continue to apply as to all 
Banks. 

     (b)  Term Loans.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) 
above, if Borrowers shall have exercised the Conversion Option and any Term 
Loans are then outstanding, then the aggregate outstanding principal balance 
under each Term Loan shall be payable in sixty (60) equal consecutive monthly 
installments on the first day of each month commencing on the first day of the 
first month after the applicable conversion to a Term Loan and continuing 
thereafter until Borrowers' indebtedness under each such Term Loan has been 
paid in full, provided that all Term Loans shall have a maturity date no later 
than the fifth anniversary of the Termination Date as from time to time in 
effect.

     (c)  Event of Default.  Notwithstanding the immediately preceding 
subparagraphs, the aggregate outstanding balance of the Loan shall be due and 
payable on the date of acceleration of the Loan in accordance with Paragraph 
8.2 hereof.

Upon each request for a Money Market Advance, Borrowers shall be deemed to 
have made the representations and warranties set forth in Paragraph 2.7(a)(iv) 
and (v) hereof. Each request for a Money Market Advance shall be irrevocable 
and binding upon Borrowers, and Borrowers shall indemnify the applicable Bank 
against any loss, cost or expense incurred as a result of any failure of 
Borrowers to meet on or before the date specified in any such request for a 
Money Market Advance the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4 hereof,

excess of the rates then available to and elected by Borrowers for each 
Portion then outstanding through the end of the applicable Interest Periods 
and, thereafter, at the rate of two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the 
Adjusted Base Rate.

     (c)  Procedure for Determining Rates of Interest for Pro Rata Advances 
and Term Loan(s).  The following procedures shall apply to the determination 
of the rates of interest and Interest Periods to be applicable to the Term 
Loan(s) and Portions of the Revolving Credit Loan advanced pursuant to Pro 
Rata Advances:

          (i)  If Borrowers elect the Fixed Rate or the Adjusted Base Rate to 
be applicable to a Portion of the Loan, Borrowers must notify Agent of such 
election prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon Philadelphia time on the date of 
the proposed application of such Rate.  If Borrowers elect the Adjusted Libor 
Rate to be applicable to a Portion of the Loan, Borrowers must notify Agent of 
such election prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon Philadelphia time at least 
two (2) London Business Days prior to the commencement of the proposed 
Interest Period.  If Borrowers elect the Adjusted CD Rate to be applicable to 
a Portion of the Loan, Borrowers must notify Agent of such election prior to 
twelve o'clock (12:00) noon at least one Business Day prior to the 
commencement of the proposed Interest Period.  Agent shall send notice to 
<PAGE>66

Banks by twelve thirty (12:30) p.m. on the Business Day of such request.  If 
Borrowers do not provide the applicable notice for the Fixed Rate, Adjusted 
Libor Rate or Adjusted CD Rate, then Borrowers shall be deemed to have 
requested that the Adjusted Base Rate shall apply to any Portion which was 
subject to the rate of interest applicable during an expiring Interest Period 
and to any new advance of the Loan until Borrowers shall have given proper 
notice of a change in or determination of the rate of interest in accordance 
with this Paragraph 2.6(c).  

          (ii)  Borrowers shall not elect more than five (5) different 
Portions (other than Portions bearing interest at the Adjusted Base Rate) to 
be applicable to the Loan at one time.

     (d)  Payment and Calculation of Interest. Interest on Fixed Rate 
Portions, Money Market Portions, Libor Portions and CD Portions shall be due 
and payable on the last day of the Interest Period for each such Portion; 
provided, however, that with respect to Fixed Rate Portions and CD Portions 
having an Interest Period in excess of ninety (90) days, and Libor Portions 
having an Interest Period in excess of three (3) months, interest shall be 
payable on the ninetieth (90th) day and on the last day of such Interest 
Period.  Interest with respect to Base Rate Portions shall be due and payable 
on the last day of each month. Interest shall be calculated in accordance with 
the provisions of Paragraph 2.6(b) hereof; interest based on the Prime Rate 
shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 
year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) 
days, as the case may be, and interest based on the Fixed Rate, the Federal 
Funds Rate, the Money Market Rate, the Adjusted CD Rate, and the Adjusted 
Libor Rate shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 
2.6(b) on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of three 
hundred sixty (360) days.  For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), in 
order to effectuate the agreed rates of interest provided herein, (i) the 
principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest 
calculation under this Agreement or the Notes, (ii) the rates of interest 
stipulated under this Agreement and the Notes are intended to be nominal rates 
and not effective rates or yields, and (iii) each rate of interest determined 
pursuant to such calculation expressed as an annual rate is equivalent to such 
rate as so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar 
year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 365 (for interest 
based on the Prime Rate) or 360 (in the case of interest based on the Fixed 
Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, the Money Market Rate, the Adjusted CD Rate or 
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate). 

     (e)  Reserves.  If at any time a Libor or CD Portion is outstanding and a 
Bank is subject to and incurs a Reserve, Borrowers hereby agree to pay within 
five (5) Business Days of written demand thereof from time to time, as billed 
by Agent on behalf of itself or a Bank, such additional amount as is necessary 
to reimburse such Bank for its costs in maintaining such Reserve.  Such amount 
shall be computed by taking into account the cost incurred by the Bank in 
maintaining such Reserve in an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share of 
the Portion on which such Reserve is incurred.  The determination by Agent or 
a Bank of such costs incurred and the allocation, if any, of such costs among 
Borrowers and other customers which have similar arrangements with such Bank 
shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the fact and the amount of 
such additional costs.

<PAGE>67

     (f)  Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted CD Rate.

          (i)  Change of CD Rates.  The Adjusted CD Rate may be automatically 
adjusted by Agent on a prospective basis to take into account additional or 
increased costs incurred by Banks due to changes in applicable law occurring 
subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, 
including but not limited to changes in tax laws (except changes of general 
applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve 
requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(or any successor), including the Reserve Percentage, and assessments imposed 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or any successor), (including 
the Assessment Rate as provided in the definition of "Assessment Rate" above), 
that increase the cost to Banks of funding the Loan or a Portion thereof 
bearing interest at the Adjusted CD Rate.  Agent shall give Borrowers notice 
of such determination and adjustment, and Borrowers may, by notice to Agent, 
require Agent to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the basis for 
adjusting such Adjusted CD Rate and the method for determining the amount of 
such adjustment. Thereafter, Borrower shall either pay interest on the 
affected Portion(s) at the increased rate or repay the Portion with respect to 
which such adjustment is made in accordance with Paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 
hereof.

          (ii)   Unavailability of Adjusted CD Rate.  In the event that 
Borrowers shall have requested a quotation of the Adjusted CD Rate in 
accordance with Paragraph 2.6(c) hereof and Agent shall have reasonably 
determined that the Adjusted CD Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect 
the cost of making or maintaining the principal amount of the Loan or a 
Portion thereof specified by Borrowers during the Interest Period selected 
because of the inability of Agent to obtain bids in the amount of a requested 
Advance in accordance with the terms of the definition of Certificate of 
Deposit Rate set forth above, Agent shall promptly give notice of such 
determination to Borrowers.  A determination by such Bank or Agent hereunder 
shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the fact.  Upon such a 
determination, (i) the Banks' obligation to advance or maintain CD Portions 
shall be suspended until Agent shall have notified Borrowers and Banks that 
such conditions shall have ceased to exist, and (ii) Borrowers shall elect the 
Fixed Rate (if available), Adjusted Libor Rate, Adjusted Base Rate or Money 
Market Rate to be applicable to Portions.

     (g)  Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted Libor Rate.  The following 
special provisions shall apply to the Adjusted Libor Rate:  

          (i)  Change of Adjusted Libor Rate.  The Adjusted Libor Rate may be 
automatically adjusted by Agent on a prospective basis to take into account 
the additional or increased cost of maintaining any necessary reserves for 
Eurodollar deposits or increased costs due to changes in applicable law 
occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest 
Period, including but not limited to changes in tax laws (except changes of 
general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve 
requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(or any successor), including the Reserve Percentage, that increase the cost 
to Banks of funding the Loan or a Portion thereof bearing interest at the 
Adjusted Libor Rate. Agent shall give Borrowers notice of such a determination 
and adjustment, and Borrowers may, by notice to Agent require Agent to furnish 
to Borrowers a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting such Adjusted 
<PAGE>68

Libor Rate and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment.  
Thereafter, Borrowers shall either pay interest on the affected Portion(s) of 
the increased rate or repay the Portion with respect to which such adjustment 
is made in accordance with Paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 hereof.

         (ii)  Unavailability of Eurodollar Funds.  In the event that 
Borrowers shall have requested a quotation of the Adjusted Libor Rate in 
accordance with Paragraph 2.6(c) hereof and any Bank shall have reasonably 
determined that Eurodollar deposits equal to the amount of the principal of 
the Portion and for the Interest Period specified are unavailable, or that the 
Adjusted Libor Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making 
or maintaining the principal amount of the Portion specified by Borrowers 
during the Interest Period specified or that by reason of circumstances 
affecting Eurodollar markets, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for 
ascertaining the Adjusted Libor Rate applicable to the specified Interest 
Period, Agent shall promptly give notice of such determination to Borrowers 
that the Adjusted Libor Rate is not available.  A determination by any Bank 
hereunder shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the fact.  Upon 
such a determination, (i) the Banks' obligation to advance or maintain 
Portions at the Adjusted Libor Rate shall be suspended until Agent shall have 
notified Borrowers and Banks that such conditions shall have ceased to exist, 
and (ii) Borrowers shall elect the Fixed Rate (if available), Adjusted CD 
Rate, Adjusted Base Rate or Money Market Rate to be applicable to Portions.

          (iii)  Illegality.  In the event that it becomes unlawful for a Bank 
to maintain Eurodollar liabilities sufficient to fund such Bank's share of any 
Portion subject to the Adjusted Libor Rate, then such Bank shall immediately 
notify Borrowers thereof (with a copy to Agent) and such Bank's obligations 
hereunder to make or maintain Advances at the Adjusted Libor Rate shall be 
suspended until such time as such Bank may again cause the Adjusted Libor Rate 
to be applicable to its share of any Portion of the outstanding principal 
balance of the Loan and such Bank's share of any Portion shall then be subject 
to the Fixed Rate (if available), the Adjusted Base Rate or the Adjusted CD 
Rate, as Borrowers may elect in accordance with the provisions of this 
Paragraph 2.6.

2.7.  Pro Rata Advances.  

     (a)  Borrowers shall give Agent written notice of each requested Pro Rata 
Advance under the Revolving Credit Commitment, specifying the date and amount 
thereof, prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon at least two (2) London Business 
Days prior to Pro Rata Advances to bear interest based on the Adjusted Libor 
Rate, at least one Business Day prior to Pro Rata Advances to bear interest 
based on the Adjusted CD Rate, and on the date of each requested Pro Rata 
Advance to bear interest based on the Base Rate.  Such notice shall be made by 
delivery of the Advance Request Form and shall contain a statement certified 
by the chief financial officer or other authorized officer of VWR, for itself 
and on behalf of Borrowers, containing the following information and 
representations, which shall be deemed affirmed and true and correct as of the 
date of the Advance Request Form and the date of the requested Pro Rata 
Advance:

          (i)  the aggregate amount of the requested Pro Rata Advance, which 
shall be in multiples of $250,000 but not less than the lesser of $1,000,000 
or the unborrowed balance of the Revolving Credit Commitment;
<PAGE>69

          (ii)  confirmation of the interest rate(s) Borrowers have elected to 
apply to the Pro Rata Advance and, if more than one Portion has been elected, 
the amount of the Portion as to which each interest rate shall apply, together 
with the Interest Period applicable thereto;

          (iii)  certification that there are no Money Market Advances 
outstanding or that there will be no Money Market Advances outstanding on the 
date of the requested Pro Rata Advance;

          (iv)  confirmation of Borrowers' compliance with Paragraphs 5.12 
through 5.17 and 6.1 through 6.5 thereof following such Pro Rata Advance; and

          (v)  statements that the representations and warranties set forth in 
Section 3 hereof are true and correct as of the applicable dates; that no 
Event of Default or Default hereunder has occurred and is then continuing; and 
that there has been no Material Adverse Effect since the date of this 
Agreement.

     (b)     (i)  Upon receiving a request for a Pro Rata Advance in 
accordance with subparagraph (a) above, Agent shall send notice to Banks by 
twelve thirty (12:30) p.m. on such day requesting that each Bank advance funds 
to Agent so that each Bank participates in the requested Pro Rata Advance in 
the same percentage as it participates in the Commitment.  Each Bank shall 
advance its Participation Percentage of the requested Pro Rata Advance to 
Agent by delivering federal funds immediately available at Agent's offices 
prior to two o'clock (2:00) p.m. on the date of the Pro Rata Advance.  Subject 
to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions hereof, Agent shall make the 
requested Pro Rata Advance available to Borrowers by crediting such amount to 
VWR's deposit account with Agent not later than three o'clock (3:00) p.m. on 
the day of the requested Pro Rata Advance; provided, however, that in the 
event Agent does not receive a Bank's share of the requested Pro Rata Advance 
by such time as provided above, Agent shall not be obligated to advance such 
Bank's share.

          (ii)  Unless Agent shall have been notified by a Bank prior to the 
date such Bank's share of any such Pro Rata Advance is to be made by such Bank 
that such Bank does not intend to make its share of such requested Pro Rata 
Advance available to Agent, Agent may assume that such Bank has made such 
proceeds available to Agent on such date, and Agent may, in reliance upon such 
assumption (but shall not be obligated to), make available to Borrowers a 
corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made 
available to Agent by such Bank on the date the Pro Rata Advance is made, 
Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand from such Bank, 
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period 
commencing on the date such amount was made available to Borrowers and ending 
on (but excluding) the date Agent recovers such amount, from such Bank, at a 
rate per annum equal to the effective rate for overnight federal funds in New 
York as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for such day or, if 
such day is not a Business Day, for the next preceding Business Day); or, if 
such Bank fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, from Borrowers 
together with interest at the Adjusted Base Rate.

          (iii)  Each Bank shall receive interest on its share of any Pro Rata 
Advance from the date on which the amount of its share of such Pro Rata 
Advance is received by Agent and not from the date on which Agent makes such 
<PAGE>70

Pro Rata Advance (if it elects to do so as permitted in clause (ii) of 
subparagraph 2.7(b)) unless such dates are the same.

     (c)  Each request for a Pro Rata Advance pursuant to this Paragraph 2.7 
shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers.  In the case of any Pro Rata 
Advance which is to be based upon the Adjusted CD Rate or Adjusted Libor Rate, 
Borrowers shall indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred 
by such Bank as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date 
specified in such request for a Pro Rata Advance the applicable conditions set 
forth in Section 4, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of 
margin), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment 
of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund the Pro Rata Advance 
to be made by such Bank when such Pro Rata Advance, as a result of such 
failure, is not made on such date, as calculated by Agent in accordance with 
Exhibit E attached hereto.

2.8.  Reduction and Termination of Commitment. 

     (a)  Borrowers.  Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time 
to time, upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to Agent, to 
reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment in whole or in part pro rata among the 
Banks without penalty or premium, provided that: (i) any such reduction shall 
be in an aggregate amount not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); 
(ii) on the effective date of such reduction Borrowers shall make a prepayment 
of the Revolving Credit Loan in an amount, if any, by which the aggregate 
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loan exceeds the amount 
of the Revolving Credit Commitment as then so reduced, together with accrued 
interest on the amount so prepaid; and (iii) if a Portion is paid prior to the 
last day of an Interest Period, Borrowers shall pay any funding costs and loss 
of earnings and anticipated profits which may arise in connection with such 
prepayment or repayment, as calculated by Agent in accordance with Exhibit E 
attached hereto.  A reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to 
this Paragraph 2.8(a) shall not require Borrowers to prepay the Term Loan(s) 
or a portion thereof, notwithstanding that following such reduction in the 
Revolving Credit Commitment the aggregate original principal amounts of the 
Term Loan(s) is then in excess of 50% of the Revolving Credit Commitment.

     (b)  Banks.  Pursuant to Paragraph 8.2 hereof, Required Banks shall have 
the right to terminate the Commitment at any time, in their discretion and 
upon notice to Borrowers, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default here-
under.  Any payment following the occurrence of an Event of Default, 
acceleration and demand for payment shall include the payment of any amounts 
due pursuant to Paragraph 2.10 hereof.

     (c)  Restoration Only With Consent.  Any termination or reduction of the 
Commitment pursuant to subparagraphs 2.8(a) and (b) shall be permanent, and 
the Commitment cannot thereafter be restored or increased without the written 
consent of all Banks.

2.9.  Prepayment; Repayment.  Upon one (1) Business Day's prior written notice 
by Borrowers to Agent, Borrowers may prepay the outstanding principal balance 
of the Revolving Credit Loan or the Term Loan(s) as specified by Borrowers at 
any time without premium or penalty, except as provided in Paragraph 2.10 
below, provided that repayments of the Revolving Credit Loan prior to the 
Termination Date shall not reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment and may be 
<PAGE>71

reborrowed and partial prepayments of the Term Loan will be applied first to 
accrued interest and then to the outstanding principal balance of the Term 
Loans, pro rata, in the inverse order of the maturity of the installments 
thereof.  Any prepayment shall be in an amount equal to or in excess of 
$250,000.

2.10.  Funding Costs; Loss of Earnings.  In connection with any prepayment or 
repayment of a Portion bearing interest based on the Fixed Rate, Adjusted 
Libor Rate, Adjusted CD Rate or Money Market Rate made on other than the last 
day of the applicable Interest Period, whether such prepayment or repayment is 
voluntary, mandatory, by demand, acceleration or otherwise, Borrowers shall 
pay to Banks all funding costs and loss of margin which may arise in 
connection with such prepayment or repayment, as calculated by Agent or the 
applicable Bank in accordance with Exhibit E attached hereto.  

2.11.  Payments.  All payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts 
due hereunder, including any prepayments thereof, shall be made by Borrowers 
to Agent in immediately available funds before twelve o'clock (12:00) noon on 
any Business Day at the principal office of Agent set forth at the beginning 
of this Agreement (except for payments of principal and interest with respect 
to Money Market Advances and payments of the commitment fees provided in 
Paragraph 2.12 hereof, which shall be paid directly to the applicable Bank).  
Borrowers hereby authorize Agent and each Bank to charge any Borrower's 
account with Agent or such Bank for all payments of principal, interest and 
fees not paid when due hereunder.

2.12.  Commitment Fee.  Borrowers shall pay to each Bank a non-refundable 
commitment fee at the rate of (i) one-eighth of one percent (1/8%) per annum 
on the unborrowed portion of each Bank's Maximum Principal Amount up to Five 
Million Dollars ($5,000,000), plus (ii) three-eighths of one percent (3/8%) 
per annum on the unborrowed portion of each Bank's Maximum Principal Amount in 
excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Such commitment fee shall be 
payable at the offices of each Bank quarterly in arrears on the first Business 
Day of each January, April, July and October, as billed by each Bank.  The 
commitment fee shall be calculated on the daily unborrowed portions of each 
Bank's Maximum Principal Amount and on the basis of the actual number of days 
elapsed over a year of three hundred sixty (360) days.

2.13.  Agent Fee.  Borrowers will pay to Agent an agent fee in accordance with 
the letter agreement between Borrowers and Agent dated of even date herewith.

2.14.  Regulatory Changes in Capital Requirements.  If any Bank shall have 
determined that the adoption after the date hereof of any law, rule, 
regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of 
the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any of the 
foregoing by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency 
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by 
such Bank (or any lending office of such Bank) or such Bank's holding company 
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not 
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable 
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such 
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Bank's holding company if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement or the Advances made by such Bank pursuant 
hereto to a level below that which such Bank or its holding company could have 
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into 
<PAGE>72

consideration such Bank's policies and the policies of such Bank's holding 
company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to 
be material, then from time to time Borrowers shall pay to such Bank on demand 
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or its holding 
company for any such reduction suffered together with interest on each such 
amount from the date demanded until payment in full thereof at the rate 
provided in Paragraph 2.6(b)(iv) hereof with respect to amounts not paid when 
due. Such Bank will notify Borrowers of any event occurring after the date of 
this Agreement that will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this 
Paragraph 2.14 as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof 
and determines to request such compensation.

A certificate of such Bank setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be 
necessary to compensate such Bank or its holding company as specified above 
shall be delivered to Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
Borrowers shall pay such Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate 
delivered by such Bank within five (5) days after its receipt of the same.

Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for increased costs or 
reduction in amounts received or receivable or reductions in return on capital 
with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Bank's right 
to demand compensation with respect to such period or any other period.

under which a Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any unfunded 
obligation to contribute or has incurred any other unfunded liability or would 
have any withdrawal liability if they fully withdrew as of the date the

System.

3.16.  Hazardous Wastes, Substances and Petroleum Products.

     (a)  Each Borrower: (i) has received all permits, licenses, 
authorizations and approvals and filed all notifications and reports necessary 
to carry on its businesses; and (ii) is in compliance with all material 
federal, state or local, foreign or domestic, laws and regulations governing 
the control, removal, spill, release or discharge of hazardous or toxic 
wastes, substances and petroleum products, including without limitation as 
provided in the provisions of and the regulations under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by 
the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and any regulations 
thereunder, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, and the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act (all of the foregoing enumerated and non-enumerated 
statutes, including without limitation any applicable state or local statutes, 
as amended, collectively the "Environmental Control Statutes").

     (b)  Except as set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto, no Borrower has 
given any written or oral notice to the Environmental Protection Agency 
("EPA") or any state or local or foreign agency or governmental body with 
regard to any actual or imminently threatened removal, spill, release or 
discharge of hazardous or toxic wastes, substances or petroleum products on 
properties owned or leased by such Borrowers or in connection with the conduct 
of its business and operations and, to the best of Borrowers' knowledge, there 
are no circumstances, processes, facilities, operations, equipment or any 
other activities at, on or under any such properties that constitute a 
material breach of or material non-compliance with any of the Environmental 
Control Statutes.

     (c)  Except as set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto, no Borrower has 
received notice that it is potentially responsible for costs of clean-up of 
any actual or imminently threatened spill, release or discharge of hazardous 
<PAGE>76

or toxic wastes or substances or petroleum products pursuant to any 
Environmental Control Statute.  Exhibit F attached hereto does not include 
notice with respect to matters that are no longer pending.

3.17.  Solvency.  To the best of VWR's knowledge, VWR is, and after receipt 
and application of the first advance will be, solvent such that: (i) the fair 
value of its assets (including without limitation the fair salable value of 
the goodwill and other intangible property of VWR) is greater than the total 
amount of its liabilities, including without limitation, contingent 
liabilities, (ii) the present fair salable value of its assets (including 
without limitation the fair salable value of the goodwill and other intangible 
property of VWR) is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the 
probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured, and (iii) 
it is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and other liabilities, 
contingent obligations and other commitments as they mature in the normal 
course of business. VWR (i) does not intend to, and does not believe that it 
will, incur debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as such debts and 
liabilities mature, and (ii) is not engaged in a business or transaction, or 
about to engage in a business or transaction, for which its property would 
constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due consideration to the 
prevailing practice and industry in which it is engaged.  For purposes of this 
Paragraph 3.17, in computing the amount of contingent liabilities at any time, 
it is intended that such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in 
light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the 
amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual mature liability.

3.18.  Senior Debt Status.  The obligations of Borrowers under this Agreement 
and the Notes do rank and will rank at least pari passu in priority of payment 
with all other indebtedness of Borrowers except indebtedness of Borrowers to 
the extent secured by liens permitted pursuant to Paragraph 6.3 hereof.

3.19.  No Burdensome Agreements.  No Borrower is a party to or bound by any 
agreement, contract, instrument, understanding or commitment of any kind or 
subject to any corporate or other restriction the performance or observance of 
which now has or, as far as Borrowers can reasonably foresee, would have a 
Material Adverse Effect.

3.20.  Full Disclosure.  As of the date hereof, neither this Agreement, nor 
any certificate, statement, agreement or other documents furnished to Banks in 
connection herewith or therewith, contains any untrue statement of a material 
fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements contained herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading.  There is no fact pertaining 
specifically to Borrowers known to Borrowers which could have a Material 
Adverse Effect, which has not been set forth in this Agreement or in the 
certificates, statements, agreements or other documents furnished in writing 
to Banks prior to or at the date hereof in connection with the transactions 
contemplated hereby or in the Borrowers' filings with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

     (a)  Except as provided in subparagraph (b) below, Agent shall apply all 
payments of principal, interest, fees or other amounts hereunder made to Agent 
by or on behalf of Borrowers, to Banks on the basis of their respective 
Participation Percentages, except that (i) all payments of principal and 
<PAGE>88

interest with respect to any Money Market Advance shall be paid to the Bank 
which made such Money Market Advance, (ii) the fee payable under Paragraph 
2.12 shall be paid directly to each Bank in accordance with the terms thereof, 
and (iii) the fee payable under Paragraph 2.13 hereof shall be paid solely to 
Agent.  Such distribution of payments shall be made promptly in federal funds 
immediately available at the office of each Bank set forth above.  

     (b)  Payments (whether voluntary, involuntary, or otherwise, except as 
provided in Paragraph 9.2 hereof with respect to the exercise of set-off 
rights) received by a Bank after the occurrence and during the continuance of 
an Event of Default shall be paid to Agent for distribution to the Banks pro 
rata on the basis of the ratio which each Bank's total amount of outstanding 
Advances (including Money Market Advances and Pro Rata Advances) and Term 
Loans bears to the aggregate principal amount of all Advances (including Money 
Market Advances and Pro Rata Advances) and Term Loans then outstanding.

9.2.  Setoff.  In the event a Bank, by exercise of its right of setoff, or 
otherwise, reduces indebtedness owing to it hereunder by an amount greater 
than its pro rata share of such amount based upon the Banks' respective shares 
of principal indebtedness outstanding immediately before such setoff or other 
reduction, such Bank shall purchase a portion of the indebtedness hereunder 
owing to each other Bank so that after such purchase each Bank shall hold its 
pro rata share of all the indebtedness then outstanding hereunder, based upon 
the Banks' respective shares of principal indebtedness outstanding immediately 
before such setoff or other reduction, provided that if all or any portion of 
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Bank, such purchase 
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of any such 
recovery, but without interest.  

9.3.  Modifications and Waivers.  No modification or amendment hereof, consent 
hereunder or waiver of any Event of Default shall be effective except by 
written consent of the Required Banks, provided, however, that the written 
consent of all Banks shall be required to (a) decrease the rate of interest, 
(b) change the amount of the Commitment or the Revolving Credit Commitment, or 
the Banks' respective Maximum Principal Amounts, except as provided in the 
definition of such terms and in Paragraph 2.8 hereof, or the definition of 
Required Banks, (iii) amend, modify, wave, discharge or suspend compliance 
with any date of payment hereunder or the definition of the Termination Date, 
(iv) modify, amend, waive, discharge or suspend compliance with the commitment 
fee, or (v) modify, amend, waive, discharge or suspend compliance with this 
Paragraph 9.3 hereof.  Any amendment or waiver made pursuant to this Paragraph 
9.3 shall apply to and bind all of the Banks and any future holder of any 
Notes.

9.4.  Obligations Several.  The obligations of the Banks hereunder are 
several, and each Bank hereunder shall not be responsible for the obligations 
of the other Banks hereunder, nor, will the failure of one Bank to perform any 
of its obligations hereunder relieve the other Banks from the performance of 
their respective obligations hereunder.  

9.5.  Banks' Representations.  Each Bank represents and warrants to the other 
Banks that (i) it has been furnished all information it has requested for the 
purpose of evaluating its proposed participation under this Agreement; and 
(ii) it has decided to enter into this Agreement on the basis of its 
independent review and credit analysis of Borrowers, this Agreement and the 
<PAGE>89

documentation in connection therewith and has not relied for such analysis on 
any information or analysis provided by any other Bank.  

9.6.  Investigation.  No Bank shall have any obligation to the others to 
investigate the condition of Borrowers or any of the Collateral or any other 
matter concerning the Loan.  

9.7.  Powers of Agent.  Agent shall have and may exercise those powers 
specifically delegated to Agent herein, together with such powers as are 
reasonably incidental thereto.

9.8.  General Duties of Agent, Immunity and Indemnity. Agent will promptly 
deliver to Banks financial information and other material information 
regarding Borrowers received by it from Borrowers, and which has not been 
delivered by Borrowers to Banks.  In performing its duties as Agent hereunder, 
Agent will take the same care as it takes in connection with loans in which it 
alone is interested, subject to the limitations on liabilities contained 
herein; provided that Agent shall not be obligated to ascertain or inquire as 
to the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof by 
Borrowers.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or 
employees shall be liable for any action or omission by any of them hereunder 
or in connection herewith except for gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
Subject to such exception, each of the Banks hereby indemnifies Agent on the 
basis of such Bank's Participation Percentage, against any such liability, 
claim, loss or expense. 

9.9.  No Responsibility for Representations or Validity, etc.  Each Bank 
agrees that Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for any 
representations, statements, or warranties of Borrowers herein.  Neither Agent 
nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be responsible 
for the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency, perfection or enforceability of 
this Agreement and any collateral security therefor, or any documents relating 
thereto or for the priority of any of Banks' security interests in any such 
collateral security.  

9.10.  Action on Instruction of Banks; Right to Indemnity.  Agent shall in all 
cases be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting hereunder in 
accordance with written instructions to it signed by Required Banks unless the 
consent of all the Banks is expressly required hereunder in which case Agent 
shall be so protected when acting in accordance with such instructions from 
all the Banks.  Such instructions and any action taken or failure to act 
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Banks, provided that except as 
otherwise provided herein, Agent may act hereunder in its own discretion 
without requesting such instructions.  Agent shall be fully justified in 
failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be 
specifically indemnified to its satisfaction by the other Banks on the basis 
of their respective Participation Percentages, against any and all liability 
and expense which it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any 
such action.  

9.11.  Employment of Agents.  In connection with its activities hereunder, 
Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable, 
except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for 
the default or misconduct of agents or attorneys-in-fact selected with 
reasonable care.  
<PAGE>90

9.12.  Reliance on Documents.  Agent shall be entitled to rely upon (a) any 
paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been 
signed or sent by the proper person or persons and (b) upon the opinion of its 
counsel with respect to legal matters.  

9.13.  Agent's Rights as a Bank.  With respect to its share of the 
indebtedness hereunder, Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder 
as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent.  Each 
of the Banks may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in 
any kind of banking or trust business with Borrowers as if it were not Agent 
or a Bank hereunder.  

9.14.  Expenses.  Each of the Banks shall reimburse Agent, from time to time 
at the request of Agent, for its share of any expenses incurred by Agent, 
based on such Bank's Participation Percentage, in connection with the 
performance of its functions hereunder (excluding, however, unless an Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and 
expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder), provided 
however that in the event Banks shall reimburse Agent for expenses for which 
Borrowers subsequently reimburse Agent, Agent shall remit to each Bank the 
respective amount received from such Bank against such expenses, and provided 
further, that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent 
they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent.

9.15.  Resignation of Agent.  Agent may at any time resign its position as 
Agent, without affecting its position as a Bank, by giving written notice to 
Banks and Borrowers.  The Borrowers and Required Banks may at any time request 
that Agent resign its position as Agent and Agent agrees to so resign in 
accordance with the provisions hereof.  Any such resignation shall take effect 
upon the appointment of a successor agent in accordance with this Paragraph.  
In the event Agent shall resign, Banks shall appoint a Bank as successor 
agent, which successor Agent shall be subject to the approval of Borrowers.  
If within thirty (30) days of the Agent's notice of resignation no successor 
agent shall have been appointed by Banks and approved by Borrowers and 
accepted such appointment, then Agent, in its discretion may appoint any other 
Bank as a successor agent.

9.16.  Successor Agent.  The successor Agent appointed pursuant to Paragraph 
9.15 shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and Banks an instrument in 
writing accepting such appointment, and thereupon such successor, without any 
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the 
properties, rights, duties and obligations of its predecessor Agent.  The 
predecessor Agent shall deliver to its successor Agent forthwith all 
collateral security, documents and moneys held by it as Agent, if any, 
whereupon such predecessor Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations as Agent under this Agreement.  

9.17.  Collateral Security.  Agent will hold, administer and manage any 
collateral security pledged from time to time hereunder either in its own name 
or as Agent, but each Bank shall hold a direct, undivided beneficial interest 
therein, on the basis of its share of the indebtedness outstanding hereunder, 
by reason of and as evidenced by this Agreement, in accordance with Paragraph 
9.1 hereof.  


<PAGE>91

9.18.  Enforcement by Agent.  All rights of action under this Agreement and 
under the Notes and all rights to the collateral security, if any, hereunder 
may be enforced by Agent and any suit or proceeding instituted by Agent in 
furtherance of such enforcement shall be brought in its name as Agent without 
the necessity of joining as plaintiffs or defendants any other Banks, and the 
recovery of any judgment shall be for the benefit of Banks subject to the 
expenses of Agent.


SECTION 10

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1.  Indemnification and Release Provisions. Borrowers hereby agree to 
defend Agent and each Bank and their respective directors, officers, agents, 
employees and counsel from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and 
all losses, liabilities (including without limitation settlement costs and 
amounts, transfer taxes, documentary taxes, or assessments or charges made by 
any governmental authority), claims, damages, interest judgments, costs, or 
expenses, including without limitation fees and disbursements of counsel, 
incurred by any of them arising out of or in connection with or by reason of 
this Agreement, the Commitment, or the making of the Loan, including without 
limitation, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, interests, 
judgments, costs or expenses relating to or arising under any Environmental 
Control Statute or the application of any such Statute to any Borrower's or a 
Subsidiary's properties or assets.  All obligations provided for in this 
Paragraph 10.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the 
Commitment and the repayment of the Loan.  

10.2.  Participations and Assignments.  Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree 
that a Bank may at any time: (a) grant participations in all or any portion of 
its Maximum Principal Amount of the Loan or any Note or of its right, title 
and interest therein or in or to this Agreement (collectively, 
"Participations") to any other lending office or to any other bank, lending 
institution or other entity which has the requisite sophistication to evaluate 
the merits and risks of investments in Participations ("Participants"); 
provided, however, that:  (i) all amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall 
be determined as if such Bank had not granted such Participation; and (ii) any 
agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant a Participation: (x) shall 
provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to 
enforce the obligations of Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, 
the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provisions 
of this Agreement; (y) may provide that such Bank will not agree to any 
modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement without the consent of the 
Participant if such amendment, modification or waiver would reduce the 
principal of or rate of interest on the Loan or postpone the date fixed for 
any payment of principal of or interest on the Loan; and (z) shall not relieve 
such Bank from its obligations, which shall remain absolute, to make Advances 
hereunder; and (b) assign all or any portion of its rights under the Loan with 
the prior written consent of the Agent and Borrowers together with the payment 
to the Agent of a $2,000 transfer fee.

10.3.  Binding and Governing Law.  This Agreement and all documents executed 
hereunder shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties 
hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall be governed as to 
<PAGE>92

their validity, interpretation and effect by the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.  

10.4.  Survival.  All agreements, representations, warranties and covenants of 
Borrowers contained herein or in any documentation required hereunder shall 
survive the execution of this Agreement and the making of the Loan hereunder 
and except for Paragraphs 5.9 and 10.1 which provide otherwise, will continue 
in full force and effect as long as any indebtedness or other obligation of 
Borrowers to any Bank remains outstanding. 

10.5.  No Waiver; Delay.  If Banks or any of them shall waive any power, right 
or remedy arising hereunder or under any applicable law, such waiver shall not 
be deemed to be a waiver upon any other Bank or the later occurrence or 
recurrence of any of said events with respect to any Bank.  No delay by Banks 
in the exercise of any power, right or remedy shall, under any circumstances, 
constitute or be deemed to be a waiver,  express or implied, of the same and 
no course of dealing between the parties hereto shall constitute a waiver of 
Banks' powers, rights or remedies.  The remedies herein provided are 
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.  

10.6.  Modification; Waiver.  No modification or waiver of any provision of 
this Agreement or any Note, nor any consent to any departure by Borrowers 
herefrom or therefrom, shall in any case be effective unless the same be in 
writing, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the 
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.  No notice to 
or demand on Borrowers in any case shall entitle Borrowers to any other or 
further notice or demand in any similar or other circumstances.

10.7.  Headings.  The various headings in this Agreement are inserted for 
convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this 
Agreement or any provision hereof.

Failure to provide notice to Drinker, Biddle & Reath as provided above shall 
not cause to be ineffective any notice provided to Borrowers which is 
otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.

10.9.  Payment on Non-Business Days.  Whenever any payment to be made 
hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such 
payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, provided however that 
such extension of time shall be included in the computation of interest due in 
conjunction with such payment or other fees due hereunder, as the case may be.  

10.10.  Time of Day.  All time of day restrictions imposed herein shall be 
calculated using Agent's local time.  

10.11.  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the application 
thereof to any person or circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable to any 
extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provisions 
to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be 
enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.  


<PAGE>94

10.12.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of 
counterparts with the same effect as if all the signatures on such 
counterparts appeared on one document, and each such counterpart shall be 
deemed to be an original.

10.13.  Withholding Taxes Clause.  All amounts payable under this Agreement, 
whether principal, interest or otherwise, shall be paid in full, free and 
clear of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees 
or withholdings and without set-off or counterclaim or any restriction or 
condition or deduction whatsoever.  If Borrowers or any of them are compelled 
by law to make any deduction or withholding, it or they will ensure that the 
same does not exceed the minimum liability therefor and will promptly pay 
Agent (for the benefit of Banks) such additional amount as will result in the 
net amount received by Banks being equal to the full amount which would have 
been receivable had there been no deduction or withholding.

10.14.  Currency Conversion Clause.

     (a)  All payments due hereunder shall be made in United States currency.  
If any amount due from Borrowers under this Agreement or any order or judgment 
given or made in relation hereto has to be converted from United States 
currency (the "first currency") in which the same is payable hereunder or 
under such order or judgment into another currency (the "second currency") for 
the purpose of (i) making or filing a claim or proof against Borrowers, (ii) 
obtaining an order or judgment in any court or other tribunal, or (iii) 
enforcing any order or judgment given or made in relation hereto, Borrowers 
hereby undertake to indemnify Banks from and against any loss suffered as a 
result of any discrepancy between (a) the rate of exchange used for such 
purpose to convert the amount in question from the first currency into the 
second currency and (b) the rate or rates of exchange of which Banks may in 
the ordinary course of business purchase the first currency with the second 
currency upon receipt of an amount paid to it in satisfaction, in whole or in 
part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof.

     (b)  Any such conversion shall be made at the buying spot rate of 
exchange at which Banks could purchase the first currency with the second 
currency at the close of business on the day before the day on which the 
judgment is given at the place where such court is located.  If there is a 
change in such rate of exchange prevailing between the day before the judgment 
is given and the date of payment thereof, Borrowers agree to pay such 
additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid 
on such date is the amount in the second currency which, when converted into 
the first currency at such rate of exchange in effect on the date of payment, 
is the amount then due under this Agreement in the first currency.

     (c)  Any amount due from Borrowers under this Paragraph 10.14 will be due 
as a separate debt and shall not be affected by or merged into any judgment 
being obtained for any other amounts due under or in respect of this 
Agreement.  In no event, however, shall Borrowers be required to pay more in 
the first currency at such rate of exchange when payment is made than the 
amount of the first currency stated to be due hereunder, so that in any event 
Borrowers' obligations hereunder will be effectively maintained as obligations 
in the first currency.


<PAGE>95

10.15.  Submission to Jurisdiction.

     (a)  Borrowers hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Federal court sitting in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement.  VWR Canada, Scientific Holdings and VWR International each hereby 
irrevocably appoint VWR (the "Process Agent"), as its agent to receive on its 
behalf service of copies of summons and complaints and any other process which 
may be served in any action or proceeding arising hereunder.  Such service may 
be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such process by registered or 
certified mail, postage prepaid, to VWR Canada, Scientific Holdings or VWR 
International, as the case may be, in care of VWR at its address set forth at 
the beginning of this Agreement, and VWR Canada, Scientific Holdings and VWR 
International each hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent 
to accept such service on its behalf.  Borrowers agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive, subject to 
appellate relief, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the 
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  

     (b)  Nothing in this Paragraph 10.15 shall affect the right of Banks to 
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right 
of Banks to bring any action or proceeding against Borrowers or any of its or 
their properties in the courts of other jurisdictions to the extent otherwise 
permitted by law.  

     (c)  To the extent that Borrowers have or hereafter may acquire (i) any 
immunity from jurisdiction of any court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or 
any federal court sitting in Philadelphia, PA or from any legal process out of 
any such court (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to 
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect 
to itself or its property, or (ii) any objection to the laying of the venue or 
of an inconvenient forum of any suit, action or proceeding, if brought in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Federal court sitting in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania under process served in accordance with subparagraph (a) above, 
Borrowers hereby irrevocably waive such immunity or objection in respect of 
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or 
the Loan.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement the day and 
year first above written.
