PART I.

ITEM I. - BUSINESS
------    --------
VWR Corporation ("VWR," "the Corporation," or "the Company") is one of the 
nation's largest suppliers of laboratory equipment, chemicals, and supplies 
to the scientific marketplace with sales of $535 million, $509 million, and 
$490 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  VWR was incorporated in 
Delaware on January 3, 1986, in order to complete the Distribution Plan of 
Univar Corporation.  In 1994 the Company changed its State of Incorporation to 
Pennsylvania.

In October 1994, the Company expanded its Canadian operations through the 
acquisition of certain assets related to the laboratory supply business of 
Canlab, a division of Baxter International for approximately $13.9 million. 

In January 1994, the Company formed a joint venture with E. Merck of Germany 
and acquired an interest in Bender & Hobein GmbH, a distributor of laboratory 
supplies and equipment in Germany.

Principal Customers
-------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries are not dependent on a single customer
or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have a material 
adverse effect on its operations.

Competition
-----------
The Company competes in the industrial, governmental, biomedical, and 
educational market for laboratory equipment, chemicals, and supplies with 
numerous national and regional distributors.  In addition, there are numerous 
distributors of specialty lines and manufacturers who sell their product lines 
direct.  In the opinion of management, the Corporation is the nation's second 
largest distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.

In all of VWR's markets, a combination of quality, price, and service are the 
major determining competitive factors.  All activities are considered highly 
competitive.

Environmental Regulation
------------------------
VWR has been designated by the EPA as a potentially-responsible party in 
connection with several sites.  Management believes that the Company's alleged 
contribution to each of these sites is de minimis and that the potential 
financial impact of these matters is not material to the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.





Employees
---------
Approximately 1,320 persons were employed by VWR Corporation as of February 
28, 1995.  Approximately 13% of the Company's employees are represented by 
unions.  The Company believes its relations with employees are excellent.

Methods of Distribution
-----------------------
Approximately 23% of the Company's employees are full-time outside and inside 
sales personnel who provide product information and technical support to our 
customers.  With continuous reference to the "VWR Catalogue," customers also 
place individual orders by telephone with an inside sales representative, 
directly with an outside sales representative or by computer.  Orders are 
shipped from local or central warehouses, depending on the nature of the 
product ordered.

Foreign Operations and Export Sales
-----------------------------------
The Company has operations in Canada which serve the country's industrial, 
educational, governmental and biomedical markets.  See "Foreign and Domestic 
Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in item 8 below.

The Company also exports scientific equipment to 54 countries worldwide, with 
primary markets in the Middle East, Central and South America, and the Pacific 
Rim.

Raw Materials
-------------
The Company does not manufacture any of its products.  Numerous sources of 
supply generally exist for all products essential to the business of the 
Company.

Patents, Trademarks, and Trade names
-----------------------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries own several trademarks and trade names, 
none of which is considered material to the business as a whole. Some of the 
registered and unregistered trademarks and trade names include VWR Scientific, 
VWRbrand, VWR IBS, Sargent-Welch and VWR Canlab.

Seasonality
-----------
No material portion of the business of VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries is 
regarded as seasonal.  However, approximately 50% of sales of the Sargent-
Welch science education business occur in the third quarter of the calendar 
year.





Backlog
-------
Backlog is not meaningful because most orders received are for merchandise 
held in inventory and available for immediate shipment.

Research and Development
------------------------
VWR Corporation and its subsidiaries do not manage or conduct significant 
research activities relating to the development of new products, although the 
Company periodically works with customers or suppliers to improve or develop 
new uses for existing products.  In addition, VWR develops proprietary 
computer systems for internal use.

The sales increase in 1994 was due to growth in all areas of our business.  
The acquisition of Canlab, the Toronto-based distribution division of Baxter 
International, in the fourth quarter of 1994 accounted for approximately 20% 
of the sales growth for the year.  During the second half of 1994 our Canadian 
operations showed strong sales growth, improving margins and operating 
results.

In 1993 sales increased primarily due to strong growth rates in our inter- 
national export, high school science education (Sargent-Welch division) 
businesses and the effects of the acquisition of Johns Scientific and the 
distribution agreement with BDH Ltd. in Canada.  Growth in Canada was less 
than expected.  Combining the operations and systems of the three companies 
proved to be a more complex task than anticipated and we experienced higher 
costs.  In addition, sales of our principal U.S. operating unit (VWR 
Scientific) lagged behind the market and we missed our internal target.

Over the three-year period, gross margin as a percent of sales declined 
primarily as a result of continued competitive price pressures and customer 
mix.

Operating Expenses before Restructuring and Other Charges in 1993

In 1994 operating expenses grew at a rate lower than sales growth.  
Approximately 28% of the increase in operating expenses is the result of the 
acquisition of Canlab in the fourth quarter of 1994.

In 1993 the increase in operating expenses before restructuring and other 
charges is primarily due to higher personnel costs and transition costs 
associated with the acquisition of Johns Scientific and the distribution 




agreement with BDH, Ltd., and our investment in a new direct marketing effort. 
Excluding the impact from Canadian acquisitions and direct marketing, 
operating expenses grew approximately 1.4%. 

Restructuring and Other Charges
-------------------------------

In December 1994, the Company made the decision to consolidate certain sales 
offices and functions.  As a result, the Company will incur approximately $2 
million in charges which are primarily for severance and other personnel-
related costs.  It is expected that the consolidation will be completed by the 
end of 1995 and will result in annualized cost savings of approximately 
$3 million. The cost of the consolidation effort will be accounted for in 
accordance with the new guidance set forth in FASB EITF Issue 94-3 "Accounting 
for Restructuring Charges."  Under EITF 94-3, the costs will be recognized 
primarily when they are incurred throughout 1995. 

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company made the decision to refocus 
certain information systems efforts into customer service systems and to take 
actions that would reduce operating expenses.  As a result of this effort, the 
Company recorded a $3.3 million charge which included non-cash charges of $1.3 
million (primarily for software development costs that did not have continuing 
value) and $2 million related to the consolidation of functions and facilities 
which consisted primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs. In 
1994 the Company completed the consolidation of certain administrative 
functions which was provided for in the fourth quarter of 1993 and has 
expended the $2 million of cost accrued at December 31, 1993, which was 
reflected in current liabilities.  

At December 31, 1993 it was anticipated that the impact of the consolidation 
of certain functions and the reduction of expenses would result in annualized 
cost savings of approximately $2 million, beginning in the first-half of 1994.  
Actual cost savings for fiscal 1994 were approximately $1.2 million.  Planned 
investments in sales and marketing have offset those savings in 1994.

Interest Expense and Other
--------------------------
                                                 
                    1994     Increase     1993     Increase     1992
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest and Other  $5.1       8.5%       $4.7      17.5%       $4.0
Percent
  of Sales           1.0%                   .9%                   .8%

In 1994 interest expense and other increased primarily due to increased 
borrowings for the acquisition of Canlab, partially offset by replacing 
expired interest rate collars with fixed rate interest swaps. Foreign currency 
transaction losses accounted for approximately $.2 million of the increase.

In 1993 interest expense and other increased due to increased borrowing levels 
which occurred primarily for the purchase of a new warehouse facility for the 
Sargent-Welch division, system enhancements, and the 1992 acquisition of Johns 
Scientific.





Income Taxes

                   1994      Decrease     1993     Decrease     1992
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Taxes              $1.0       (63.0%)     $2.7      (52.6)%     $5.7
Percent
  of Sales           .2                     .5%                  1.2%
Effective
  tax rate         32.0%                  40.6%                 37.5%

The income taxes footnote to the financial statements describes the difference 
between the statutory and effective income tax rates.  The lower effective tax 
rate in 1994 reflects the recognition of the benefits of a portion of the 
Canadian net operating loss carrforwards and lower state taxes. Management 
expects that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to the 
Canadian net operating losses will result from improved margins and 
elimination of duplicate personnel and facility cost, coupled with the 
acquisition of Canlab in late 1994.  The higher effective tax rate in 1993 
reflects the carryforward to future years of Canadian tax benefits not 
recognized in 1993. 


Income Before Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change and Per Share Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   1994     Decrease     1993     Decrease     1992
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Income             $2.1      (46.2)%     $3.9      (58.5)%     $9.4
Percent
  of Sales           .4%                   .8%                  1.9%
Per Share          $ .18                 $ .35                 $ .85
 
In 1994, the decrease in income before cumulative effect of accounting change 
is primarily due to lower margins.

In 1993, in addition to the impact of the restructuring and other charges, 
which were $3.3 million pre-tax ($1.9 million net of tax or $.18 per share),  
income before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased primarily due 
to decreased operating income from lower sales and margins, and higher 
operating expenses along with higher interest costs. 

Financial Condition and Liquidity
---------------------------------
The ratio of debt to equity over the past four years is as follows:

           1994           1993            1992            1991
--------------------------------------------------------------
           2.0            1.5             1.1             1.3

The ratio of operating income, plus depreciation and amortization, to interest 
expense over the past four years is as follows:

           1994           1993            1992            1991
--------------------------------------------------------------
           3.8            4.5             7.1             5.8





VWR continues to maintain a liquid financial position.  VWR's current ratio 
was 2.7 at December 31, 1994 and accounts receivable and inventory accounted 
for 66% of total assets.  The increase in accounts receivable is due to 
transition issues related to the consolidation of the Company's credit 
department and higher sales growth in the fourth quarter of 1994 compared to 
the fourth quarter of 1993.  The increase in inventory and accounts payable is
primarily due to various marketing programs, and to supporting new supplier 
partnerships with several customers.  For the year ended December 31, 1994 
cash flow from operations of $5.1 million and debt borrowings of $19.5 million 
were used to finance investments in property and equipment of $2.9 million, 
the Canlab acquisition of $13.9 million, the joint venture investment of $2.9 
million and to pay dividends of $4.4 million.  Sufficient credit availability 
existed at December 31, 1994 to provide for the amounts of bank checks 
outstanding less cash in bank of $1.4 million.  Cash requirements reach a low 
toward the end of each calendar year due to the natural business cycle.

On October 27, 1994 the Company replaced its previously unsecured revolving 
credit facility with a dual-currency secured revolving credit and term loan 
agreement, expiring in 1997, with four banks which provides for committed 
facilities of $80 million subject to the maintenance of certain levels of 
accounts receivable and inventory, and a $20 million five-year loan due in 
varying installments beginning December 31, 1994.  The facility provides for 
the ability to borrow Canadian dollars in an amount up to $16 million in U.S. 
dollars.  Canadian borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of Canlab.  
Interest on borrowings is at variable short-term interest rates. 

To reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on floating rate long-term 
debt, the Company uses a combination of interest rate swaps, and collars.  The 
notional amounts of the interest rate collars and swaps are based upon 
expected actual debt levels during a five-year period.  The Company provides 
protection to meet actual exposures and does not speculate in derivatives.

The Company's interest rate collar effectively establishes a minimum and 
maximum rate on up to $30 million of credit, and expires in 1996. The Company 
also has interest rate swap agreements which change interest rate exposure on 
$10 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of 4.86% through  February 
1996, and on $30 million at a fixed rate of 6.38% from February 1996 to 
February 1999. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of 
nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreements.  
However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

Due to the increase in debt levels from the Canadian acquisition, the board of 
directors made a decision to reduce the company's quarterly dividend, declared 
on December 16, 1994 to $.04 per share from the previous $ .10 per share.  

On February 27, 1995, the Company and EM Industries, Incorporated ("EM") (an 
affiliate of E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) entered into an agreement that 
calls for EM to invest $20 million in the Company for common shares 
(calculated at a price per share of $11) and a three-year warrant to purchase 
an additional $10 million of common shares at $11 per share, subject to 
regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.  Assuming exercise of the 
warrant, EM would own approximately 20% of the common stock of the Company.  



 

EM  has also agreed to a four-year "standstill" agreement, which limits its 
ability to increase its equity interest in the Company during the four years.  
After the four-year period, without prior approval of the Board of Directors 
of the Company, EM would be permitted to acquire additional equity in the 
Company only by offering to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the 
Company.  The standstill agreement also grants EM certain registration rights.  
The Company has also agreed to elect two representatives of EM to its Board of 
Directors.  In addition, the Companies have agreed to enter into new 
distribution agreements encompassing the U.S. and Canadian markets.

The agreements have been unanimously approved by the Company's Board of 
Directors and do not require shareholder approval.  The expected proceeds of 
approximately $20 million from the issuance of the shares under the share 
purchase agreement are expected to be used to repay debt.

VWR has been designated by the EPA as a potentially responsible party for 
various sites.  Management believes that any required expenditures would be 
immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 1994 the estimated cost for capital improvement projects is
expected to range between $4 and $5 million in 1995 related primarily to 
continued investments in new computer systems and equipment and warehouse 
equipment.

                                 VWR CORPORATION 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
--------------------
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VWR
Corporation and all of its subsidiaries (the Company).  All significant 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization
---------------------------------------
Land, buildings, and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is com-
puted using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and, 
generally, accelerated methods for income tax purposes.  Acquisition and 
development costs for significant business systems and related software for 
internal use are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
of seven years.  The Company capitalizes the costs of developing and producing 
catalogs, which are used by customers for ordering products.  Such costs are 
amortized over the period of use, generally two years.  Goodwill is amortized 
over periods of 15 and 40 years.

Income Taxes
------------
In 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," which supersedes SFAS No. 96 
previously followed by the Company.  The adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a 
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.  

Postretirement Benefits
-----------------------
In 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions."  This Statement requires the Company to accrue 
the cost of retiree medical expenses over the period earned by the 
participants, which is a change from the Company's prior practice of recording 
these costs when incurred.




Earnings Per Share and 1992 Stock Split
---------------------------------------
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares and 
dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period.

On April 20, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one 
stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record 
as of May 9, 1992.  The aggregate par value, which did not change on a per-
share basis, of $5.6 million for the additional shares was transferred from 
additional paid-in capital to common stock.  All share and per-share data in 
these financial statements have been restated to give effect to the stock 
split.

Segment and Customer Information
--------------------------------
The Company is engaged in one line of business, industrial distribution.  No 
single customer accounts for more than 10% of sales.  The majority of the 
Company's business activity pertains to, and accounts receivable result from, 
sales of laboratory equipment and supplies to businesses across a wide 
geographical area in various industries, mainly industrial, governmental, 
biomedical, and educational.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had no 
significant concentrations of credit risk.

Reclassifications
-----------------
Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current 
year's presentation.

INVENTORIES
-----------
Inventories consist primarily of purchased goods for sale and are valued at 
the lower of cost or market.  Inventory valued using the last-in, first-out 
(LIFO) method comprised 88% and 95% of inventory at December 31, 1994 and 
1993, respectively.  Cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the 
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 

LIFO cost at December 31, 1994, and 1993, was approximately $27.7 million and 
$26.8 million, respectively, less than current cost.  The effect of LIFO layer 
liquidations decreased the cost of sales by $.6 million in 1993, and $.4 
million in 1992.




FIXED ASSETS

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, was 
$6.3 million, $5.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES
-------------------
Included in accrued liabilities at December 31, 1994, and 1993, is accrued 
compensation of approximately $3.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
------------------------------
The Company supplies product to its Canadian subsidiary for sale to the 
subsidiary's Canadian customers.  The Company has entered into forward 
exchange contracts to fix the rate of exchange on the Canadian dollar payments 
made to the Company upon settlement of the intercompany accounts related to 
those shipments to its subsidiary.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had 
approximately $1.1 million of forward exchange contracts outstanding.  Net 
transaction gains and losses are not material and are included in interest 
expense.

On October 27, 1994, the Company replaced its previously unsecured revolving 
credit facility with a dual-currency secured revolving credit and term loan 
agreement, expiring in 1997, with four banks which provides for committed 
facilities of $80 million subject to the maintenance of certain levels of 
accounts receivable and inventory, and a $20 million five-year term note due 
quarterly in varying installments beginning December 31, 1994.  The facility 
provides for the ability to borrow Canadian dollars up to $16 million in U.S. 
dollars.  Canadian borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of Canlab 
as noted under "Acquisitions."  Interest on borrowings is at short-term 
interest rates.  The agreement is secured by the Company's accounts receivable 
and inventory.  The Company expects to have sufficient accounts receivable and 
inventory to provide adequate availability under these facilities.  Principal 
amounts due on long-term debt, before the impact of the equity transaction 
(see "Subsequent Event" note), in each of the five years beginning January 1, 
1995, are $2.3 million, $3.3 million, $66.6 million, $5.3 million and $4.5 
million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, the approximate weighted average 
interest rate on borrowings made under the outstanding loan facilities was 
7.0%, which approximates the year-end rate.  Interest expense for the years 
ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, was $4.8 million, $4.5 million, and 
$3.9 million, respectively.





The Company has an interest rate collar on $30 million which expires on March 
1, 1996.  The collar is based on the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate 
("LIBOR") and has a floor of 6.75% and a ceiling of 9.5%.  The cost of the 
collar is treated as a reduction of the revolving credit debt and is being 
amortized as revolving credit interest expense over the term of the collar.

The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with a financial 
institution which effectively change the Company's interest rate exposure on 
$10 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of 4.86% from March 28, 1994 
through February 29, 1996, and on $30 million to a fixed rate of 6.38% from 
February 29, 1996 through February 28, 1999.  Net receipts or payments under 
the agreements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.  The fair 
market value of the swap agreements is based on the present value of the 
future cash flows determined by the interest rate difference between the 
contracts' fixed rate and the then current replacement rate.  At December 31, 
1994 the fair market value of the swap agreements, which is not recorded in 
the consolidated financial statements, is approximately $1.4 million.  The 
Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other 
parties to the interest rate swap agreements.  However, the Company does not 
anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company's long-term debt agreement provides for, among other terms, 
restrictive covenants with respect to working capital, tangible net worth, the 
current ratio, and the debt-to-equity ratio, which may restrict the Company's 
ability to declare or pay dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these 
terms, approximately $1.8 million of retained earnings at December 31, 1994 is 
available to pay dividends.

INCOME TAXES

During 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Included in other current assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993 are refundable
income taxes of approximately $.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and 
net current deferred tax assets of $.8 million and $.6 million, respectively. 
The Company has Canadian tax loss carryforwards of approximately $1.0 million
which expire at various dates through 2001.  Management expects that the 
realization of the deferred tax assets related to the Canadian net operating 
losses will result from improved margins, elimination of duplicate personnel 
and facility cost, coupled with the acquisition of Canlab in late 1994.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT
----------------------------
On May 20, 1988, the Company established a Shareholder Rights Agreement.  The 
Agreement is designed to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics that could 
deprive shareholders of an opportunity to realize the full value of their 
shares.  On February 23, 1995, the Company amended the Agreement to change the 
definition of "Acquiring Person," and to provide that the Agreement be 
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania instead of the laws 
of the State of Delaware.

Under the Agreement, the Company has distributed a dividend of one Right for 
each outstanding share of the Company's stock.  When exercisable, each Right 
will entitle its holder to buy two shares of the Company's common stock at 
$45.00 per share.  The Rights will become exercisable if an Acquiring Person 
acquires or makes an offer to acquire 20 percent of the Company's common 
stock.  In the event that a purchaser acquires 20 percent of the common stock, 
each Right shall entitle the holder, other than the acquirer, to purchase, at  


the Right's then-current full exercise price, shares of the Company's common 
stock having a market value of twice the then-current full exercise price of 
the Right.  In the event that, under certain circumstances, the Company is 
acquired in a merger or transfers 50 percent or more of its assets or earnings 
to any one entity,each Right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of 
the surviving or purchasing company having a market value of twice the full 
exercise price of the Right.  The Rights, which expire on May 31, 1998, may be 
redeemed by the Company at a price of $.005 per Right.

STOCK AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS
----------------------------
Under the stock option and restricted stock plans, in addition to outstanding 
options, 241,440 shares were reserved for issuance at December 31, 1994.

Restricted Stock Awards
-----------------------
The Company's restricted stock award plan provides for grants of common stock 
to certain directors, officers, and managers.  The vesting periods range from 
one to eight years.  The fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
establishes the compensation amount, which is amortized to operations over the 
vesting period.  During the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, the 
Company granted 21,816, 45,219 and 7,580 shares, respectively, at fair market 
values of approximately $.2 million, $.7 million and $.1 million, 
respectively.

Stock Options
-------------
Under the stock option plan, options, which vest over 3 to 10 years, have been 
granted to certain officers and managers to purchase common stock of the 
Company at its fair market value at date of grant.  Changes in options 
outstanding were:

At December 31, 1994, there were 135,870 options exercisable at an average 
price of $7.79.

Savings Investment Plan
-----------------------
The Company has a savings investment plan whereby it matches 50% of the 
employee's contribution up to 3% of the employee's pay.  For employee 
contributions between 3% and 7.5% of their pay, the Company will match 50% of 
the contribution within prescribed limits based on the Company's profitability 
for the year.  All Company contributions are used to buy shares of the 
Company's stock.  Expenses under this plan for the years ended December 31, 
1994, 1993, and 1992, were $.6 million, $.5 million and $.6 million, 
respectively.  At December 31, 1994, there were 407,513 shares available for 
issuance under this Plan.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
-----------------------------
In September, 1990, the Company established an employee stock ownership plan 
(ESOP) by, in effect, contributing 400,000 shares of treasury stock ($2.9 
million fair value) to the ESOP of which 153,568 shares are allocated to 
participants at December 31, 1994.  All full-time and part-time employees, 
except certain union employees, are eligible to participate in the plan.

The ESOP shares will be allocated equally to individual participants' accounts 
over a period up to ten years.  Vesting occurs equally over an employment 
period of five years at which time the employee is 100% vested in the plan.  
The total number of shares to be allocated in a year is the higher of an 
amount based on the Company's profitability or the minimum allocation required 
per the ESOP agreement.  Expenses are recognized based on shares to be 
allocated in the subsequent year and are reduced for dividends paid on 
unallocated shares.




POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Pension Plans

The Company has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all 
of its domestic employees, except for employees covered by independently 
operated collective bargaining plans.  Pension benefits are based on years of 
credited service and the highest five consecutive years' average compensation.  
Contributions to the Company plans are based on funding standards established 
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

The total VWR Corporation plans' funding status and the amounts recognized in 
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1994, and 1993, are:

The Company maintains a supplemental pension plan for certain senior officers.  
Expenses incurred under this plan in 1994 and 1993 were approximately $.2 
million and $.3 million, respectively.  There were no expenses incurred under 
this plan in 1992. 

Certain employees are covered under union-sponsored, collectively bargained 
plans.  Expenses under these plans for each of the years ended December 31, 
1994, 1993 and 1992, were $.2 million, as determined in accordance with 
negotiated labor contracts.

Retiree Medical Benefits Program
--------------------------------
The Company provides certain medical benefits for retired employees.  In 1993, 
the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
Than Pensions."  The Company elected to immediately recognize the calculated 
liability resulting in a one-time non-cash charge to income of approximately 
$1.4 million, net of a deferred tax benefit of approximately $.9 million.

Employees retired as of December 31, 1992 and active employees who reached age 
55 by December 31, 1992 are eligible to participate in the Company's retiree 
health plan (the "plan").  There are also certain provisions for participation 
by spouses.  The plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on 
years of service and includes other co-payment and co-insurance provisions.




The Company does not fund the plan.  The liability of the plan at December 31, 
1994 and 1993 is as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation is 10% through 1996 declining 1% per year to 
a level of 5.4% in 2001 and thereafter.  The effect of a 1% annual increase in 
the assumed cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation by approximately 9%; the annual service and interest cost 
components in the aggregate would not be materially affected.  An 8.75% 
discount rate was used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1994 and 7.75% was used at December 31, 1993.

Before the adoption of SFAS No. 106, the retiree health care expense was 
recorded as claims were incurred.  The expense for 1992 was approximately $.2 
million.

LEASES
------
The Company leases office and warehouse space, computer equipment, and 
automobiles under operating leases with terms ranging up to 15 years, subject 
to renewal options.

Rental expense for continuing operations was approximately $5.2 million for 
the years ended December 31, 1994, and 1993, and $4.8 million in 1992

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
------------------------------
The Company is involved in various environmental, contractual, warranty, and 
public liability cases and claims, which are considered routine to the 
Company's business.  In the opinion of management, the potential financial 
impact of these matters is not material to the consolidated financial 
statements.

ACQUISITIONS
------------
Effective October 31, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned Canadian 
subsidiary, acquired certain assets related to the laboratory supply business 
of Canlab, a division of Baxter International for approximately $13.9 million.  
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and 
was funded through the Company's secured term loan.  The unamortized balance 
of the excess purchase price over net assets acquired is $5.1 million at 
December 31, 1994 which is included in other long-term assets.  In the fourth 
quarter of 1994, as a result of the acquisition, VWR terminated certain of its 
employees and closed certain facilities.  The total cost of these actions, 
which was expensed in 1994, was $.9 million.

Canlab's results of operations have been included in the consolidated results 
of operations since the date of acquisition.  The following unaudited pro 
forma combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 
1993 have been prepared assuming that the acquisition had occurred as of the 
beginning of each period.  It is based on historical information and does not 
necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it

The pro forma results of operations include, among other items, certain 
adjustments for increased interest on acquisition debt, amortization of 
goodwill, plus expense savings from discontinued fucntions, and related income 
tax effects.  	

Effective October 5, 1992, the Company, through its wholly owned Canadian 
subsidiary,  acquired certain assets related to the laboratory supply business 
of Johns Scientific, Inc. of Toronto, Canada for approximately $7.4 million.  
This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and 
was funded through the Company's revolving credit line, and a $1.6 million, 8% 
note payable which was refinanced through the revolving line of credit.  The 
acquisition  is not material in relation to the Company's consolidated 
financial statements.  The unamortized balance of the excess purchase price 
over net assets acquired is $2.1 million at December 31, 1994 and $2.5 million 
at December 31, 1993 which is included in other long-term assets.

JOINT VENTURE
-------------
On January 1, 1994 the Company formed a joint venture with E. Merck of Germany 
to acquire an interest in Bender & Hobein GmbH, a distributor of laboratory 
supplies and equipment in Germany.  The $2.9 million investment, included in 
other long-term assets, is accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
and was funded through the Company's revolving credit line.

The initial term of this agreement is for a period of three years.  During the 
initial term, VWR has the right to "put" its investment to E. Merck and 
receive the original DM cost of the investment.  Subsequent to the initial 
term, if either party terminates the agreement, E. Merck will have to re-
acquire the shares from VWR at fair value.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
-------------------------------
In December 1994, the Company made the decision to consolidate certain sales 
offices and functions.  As a result, the Company will incur approximately $2 
million in charges which are primarily for severance and other personnel-
related costs.  The cost of the consolidation effort will be accounted for in 
accordance the new guidance set forth in FASB EITF Issue 94-3 "Accounting for 
Restructuring Charges."  Under EITF 94-3 costs will be recognized primarily 
when they are incurred throughout 1995. 


In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company made the decision to refocus 
certain information systems efforts into customer service systems and to take 
actions that would reduce operating expenses.  As a result of this effort, the 
Company recorded a $3.3 million charge which included non-cash charges of $1.3 
million (primarily for software development costs that did not have continuing 
value) and $2 million related to the consolidation of functions and facilities 
which consisted primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs.  All 
of the Company's contemplated actions were completed during 1994, and all of 
the cash expenditures related to the $2 million accrued at December 31, 1993 
have been made.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT
----------------

On February 27, 1995, the Company and EM Industries, Incorporated ("EM") (an 
affiliate of E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) entered into an agreement that 
calls for EM to invest $20 million in the Company for common shares 
(calculated at a price per share of $11) and a three-year warrant to purchase 
an additional $10 million of common shares at $11 per share, subject to 
regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.  Assuming exercise of the 
warrant, EM would own approximately 20% of the common stock of the Company.  

EM  has also agreed to a four-year "standstill" agreement, which limits its 
ability to increase its equity interest in the Company during the four years.  
After the four-year period, without prior approval of the Board of Directors 
of the Company, EM would be permitted to acquire additional equity in the 
Company only by offering to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the 
Company.  The standstill agreement also grants EM certain registration rights.  
The Company has also agreed to elect two representatives of EM to its Board of 
Directors.  In addition, the Companies have agreed to enter into new 
distribution agreements encompassing the U.S. and Canadian markets.

The agreements have been unanimously approved by the Company's Board of 
Directors and do not require shareholder approval.  The expected proceeds of 
approximately $20 million from the issuance of the shares under the share 
purchase agreement are expected to be used to repay debt.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS
-------------------------------

At December 31, 1994, identifiable assets of the Company's Canadian operations 
were $28 million.  Approximately half of the assets are attributable to the 
Canlab acquisition on October 31, 1994.  Because Canlab's operations are 
reflected in the consolidated totals for only two months in 1994, net sales 
and operating income (loss) of the Canadian operations are proportionately 
smaller - - in each case less than 10 percent of the consolidated total for 
such amounts.  For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 sales and 
identifiable assets attributable to these Canadian operations were less than 
10% of the Company's totals in each category.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
------------------------------
To The Shareholders of VWR Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of VWR Corporation as of 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1994.  Our audits also include the financial 
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 14(a).  These financial 
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and 
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of VWR Corporation at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results 
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, 
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a 
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth 
therein.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
(postretirement benefits), in 1993 the Company changed its method of 
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

                        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
                                   BETWEEN
                               VWR CORPORATION
                          (a Delaware corporation)
                                     AND
                                VWR NEW CORP.
                        (a Pennsylvania corporation)


AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of March 28, 1994, made 
by and between VWR CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("VWR"), and VWR NEW 
CORP., a Pennsylvania corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of VWR 
("Newco"), (which corporations are sometimes hereinafter collectively called 
the "Constituent Corporations").


WITNESSETH:


WHEREAS, VWR has authority to issue 31,000,000 shares of capital stock, 
consisting of 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, 
and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share 
(collectively, the "VWR Capital Stock"); and

WHEREAS, Newco on the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) will have the 
authority to issue 31,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 
30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 1,000,000 
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (collectively, the "Newco 
Capital Stock"); and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Constituent Corporations deems 
it advisable and in the best interests of each of the Constituent Corporations 
and its shareholder or stockholders that VWR be merged with and into Newco as 
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("GCL") and 
the Business Corporation Law of 1988 of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
("BCL") under and pursuant to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth; 
and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Constituent Corporations has 
approved this agreement and directed that this Agreement be submitted to its 
stockholders or shareholder



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual 
agreements and covenants herein contained and in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of the GCL and the BCL, the parties hereto have agreed 
and covenanted, and do hereby agree and covenant, as follows:


ARTICLE I
THE MERGER, THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 
AND THE EFFECTIVE DATE
-------------------------------------

1.	As soon as practicable following the fulfillment (or waiver, to the 
extent permitted therein) of the conditions specified in Article IV hereof, 
taking into consideration the closing of accounting periods, VWR shall be 
merged with and into Newco (the "Merger") and Newco shall survive the Merger.

2.	The date on which the Merger occurs and becomes effective is hereinafter 
called the Effective Date.  The Merger shall occur and be effective on the 
hour and on the date set forth as the effective date in Articles of Merger 
incorporating this Agreement filed in the Department of State of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as provided in Subchapter 19C (relating to 
merger, consolidation, share exchanges and sale of assets) of the BCL, if 
prior thereto a duly certified, executed and acknowledged copy of this 
Agreement or certificate of merger with respect thereto has been filed with 
the Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in Sections 103 and 252 of the 
GCL.

3.	Newco, as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), shall 
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania.  On the Effective Date, the separate existence and corporate 
organization of VWR, except insofar as it may be continued by operation of 
law, shall be terminated and cease.


ARTICLE II
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS, DIRECTORS 
AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION
--------------------------------------------

1.	The Articles of Incorporation of Newco on the Effective Date, in the 
form set forth in Attachment I hereto, shall be the Articles of Incorporation 
of the Surviving Corporation, until amended or repealed in accordance with the 
provisions thereof and of applicable law.  Following the Merger, the Surviving 
Corporation shall operate under the name "VWR Corporation."

2.	The Bylaws of Newco on the Effective Date, in the form set forth in 
Attachment II hereto, shall on the Effective Date become and be the Bylaws of 
the Surviving Corporation, until amended or repealed in accordance with the 
provisions thereof, of the Articles of Incorporation and of applicable law



3.	The directors and officers of VWR on the Effective Date will be the 
directors and officers, respectively, of Newco on and after the Effective Date 
until expiration of their current terms and until their successors are elected 
and qualify, or their prior resignation, removal or death, subject to the 
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Newco.

ARTICLE III
TREATMENT OF SHARES OF EACH OF 
THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS
------------------------------

1.     On the Effective Date:

	(a)	each share of Common Stock of VWR, par value $1.00 per share, 
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger and 
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and 
become one share of Newco Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share;

	(b)	each share of Newco Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to 
the Merger shall cease to exist and be cancelled;

	(c)	each share of VWR Capital Stock issued and held in the treasury of 
VWR on the Effective Date shall be cancelled, and no shares of stock or other 
securities of Newco shall be issuable with respect thereto;

	(d)	each option outstanding under the VWR 1986 Long Term Incentive 
Stock Plan immediately prior to the Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger and 
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and 
become an option to purchase the same number of shares of Newco Common Stock 
at the same price and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions; and

	(e)	Each right to purchase a share of Common Stock of VWR, par value 
$1.00 per share, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the 
part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become a right to purchase a 
share of Newco Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, at the same price and 
otherwise under the same terms and conditions as contained in the Rights 
Agreement dated as of May 20, 1988 between VWR and First Interstate Bank of 
Washington, N.A.

2.	Certificates representing shares of Newco Capital Stock outstanding 
immediately prior to the Merger shall be cancelled. No certificates for shares 
of Newco Capital Stock will be issued to holders of any of the shares of VWR 
Capital Stock upon the Merger.  Certificates representing shares of VWR 
Capital Stock (other than certificates representing shares which are cancelled 
pursuant to Section 1(c) of this Article III) shall upon the Merger be deemed 
for all purposes to represent an equal number of shares of the same class and 
series of Newco Capital Stock. After the Effective Date, whenever certificates


     
which formerly represented shares of VWR Capital Stock are presented for 
exchange or registration of transfer, Newco will cause to be issued in respect 
thereof certificates representing an equal number of shares of Newco Capital 
Stock of the same class and series.

ARTICLE IV
CONDITIONS, DEFERRAL, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT
-----------------------------------------------

1.	The obligation of VWR and Newco to effect the transactions contemplated 
hereby is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions (any or all of 
which may be waived by VWR and Newco in their sole discretion to the extent 
permitted by law):

	(a)	VWR as sole shareholder of Newco shall have approved this 
Agreement in accordance with the BCL;

	(b)	the stockholders of VWR entitled to vote thereon shall have 
adopted this Agreement at a meeting thereof duly held in accordance with GCL;

	(c)	the Newco Common Stock to be issued in the Merger or reserved for 
issuance shall have been approved for quotation on NASDAQ National Market 
System, subject to official notice of issuance;

	(d)	VWR shall have received an opinion of its tax counsel, 
satisfactory to VWR and substantially to the effect that, for federal income 
tax purposes (i) no gain or loss will be recognized by VWR, Newco or the 
stockholders of VWR by reason of the consummation of the Merger, (ii) each VWR 
stockholder's tax basis in Newco Capital Stock into which his or her VWR 
Capital Stock is converted will be the same as the tax basis of the VWR 
Capital Stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to consummation of 
the Merger and (iii) a VWR stockholder who holds VWR Capital Stock as a 
capital asset will include in his holding period for the Newco Capital Stock 
the period during which he held the VWR Capital Stock converted into such 
Newco Capital Stock; and

	(e)	a duly certified, executed and acknowledged copy to this Agreement 
or certificate of merger with respect thereto shall have been filed with the 
Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance with Sections 103 and 252 of the 
GCL.

2.	Consummation of the Merger may be deferred by the Board of Directors of 
VWR for a reasonable period of time, not later than December 31, 1994, if the 
Board determines that deferral would be in the best interests of VWR and its 
stockholders.



   
3.	(a)	This Agreement may be terminated by the Board of Directors of VWR 
or Newco at any time before or after the adoption and approval thereof by the 
shareholder of Newco or the stockholders of VWR or both, but not later than 
the Effective Date.  In the event of a termination after Articles of Merger 
have been filed in the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and before the Effective Date, a timely statement of termination may be filed 
in the Department of State by the terminating corporation.

	(b)	In the event of termination of this Agreement as above provided, 
this Agreement shall become wholly void and of no effect, and there 
shall be no liability on the part of either Constituent Corporation or its 
Board of Directors or its stockholders or shareholder except as provided in 
Section 4 of this Article IV.

4.	If the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall assume 
and pay all expenses in connection therewith not theretofore paid by the 
respective parties.  If for any reason the Merger shall not become effective, 
VWR shall pay all expenses incurred in connection with all the proceedings 
taken in respect of this Agreement or relating thereto.

5.	The parties hereto, by mutual consent of their respective Boards of 
Directors, may amend, modify or supplement this Agreement in such manner as 
may be agreed upon by them in writing at any time before or after adoption and 
approval of this Agreement by the shareholder of Newco and stockholders of 
VWR, but not later than the Effective Date, except that no such amendment, 
modification or supplement not adopted and approved by the shareholder of 
Newco and the stockholders of VWR shall affect the rights of such shareholder 
or stockholders in a manner which is materially adverse to them, in the sole 
judgment of the Board of Directors of VWR.


ARTICLE V
TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
----------------------------------

ARTICLE VIII
------------

1.	Subject to the provisions of any series of Preferred Shares which may at 
the time be outstanding, any Major Transaction shall require the affirmative 
vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the Voting Power of the 
outstanding Voting Shares of the Corporation, which shall include the 
affirmative vote of at least 50% of the Voting Power of the outstanding Voting 
Shares held by shareholders other than the 20% Shareholder involved in such 
Major Transaction, provided however that such voting requirement shall not be 
applicable if:
    
	(a)	The Major Transaction was approved by the Board either (i) prior 
to the 20% Shareholder involved in the Major Transaction having become a 20% 
Shareholder, or (ii) after such 20% Shareholder became such but only if the 
20% Shareholder has sought and obtained the unanimous approval by the Board of 
such 20% Shareholder's acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Voting 
Shares prior to such acquisition being consummated; or

	(b)	The Major Transaction involves solely the Corporation and a 
Subsidiary none of whose stock is Beneficially Owned by a 20% Shareholder 
(other than Beneficial Ownership arising solely because of control of the 
Corporation); provided that each shareholder of the Corporation receives the 
same type of consideration in such transaction in proportion to his 
shareholdings; or

	(c)	Prior to becoming a 20% Shareholder, such 20% Shareholder made a 
tender offer for Voting Shares which:  (i) conformed in all respects to 
federal laws and regulations governing such a transaction whether or not the 
Corporation or such shares were then regulated by or registered under said 
laws, (ii) committed such 20% Shareholder to take all shares tendered if it 
took any shares, and (iii) resulted in such 20% Shareholder acquiring at least 
75% of the Voting Power of the outstanding Voting Shares held by Persons other 
than such 20% Shareholder.


ARTICLE IX
----------

1.	Any purchase by the Corporation of Voting Shares from a 5% Shareholder, 
other than pursuant to an offer to the holders of all of the outstanding 
Voting Shares of the same class as those so purchased, at a per share price in 
excess of the Market Price at the time of such purchase of the shares so 
purchased, shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of that amount of 
the Voting Power of the Voting Shares equal to the sum of (i) the Voting Power 
of the Voting Shares of which the 5% Shareholder is the Beneficial Owner and 
(ii) a majority of the Voting Power of the remaining outstanding Voting 
Shares, voting together as a single class.

2.	In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or these Articles of 
Incorporation:

	(a)	any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any Subsidiary 
with (1) any 5% Shareholder or (2) any other corporation (whether or not 
itself a 5% Shareholder) which is, or after such merger or consolidation would 
be, an Affiliate of a 5% Shareholder; or

	(b)	any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other 
disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or with any 5% 
Shareholder or any Affiliate of any 5% Shareholder of any assets of the 
Corporation or any Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value of 
$2,000,000 or more; or
     
	(c)	the issuance or transfer by the Corporation or any Subsidiary (in 
one transaction or a series of transactions) of any securities of the 
Corporation or any Subsidiary having an aggregate Fair Market Value of 
$2,000,000 or more to any 5% Shareholder or any Affiliate of any 5% 
Shareholder in exchange for cash, securities or other property (or a 
combination thereof); or

	(d)	the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or 
dissolution of the Corporation proposed by or on behalf of a 5% Shareholder or 
any Affiliate of any 5% Shareholder; or

	(e)	any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock 
split), or recapitalization of the Corporation, or any merger or consolidation 
of the Corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any other transaction 
(whether or not with or into or otherwise involving a 5% Shareholder) which 
has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share 
of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of 
the Corporation or any Subsidiary which is directly or indirectly owned by any 
5% Shareholder or any Affiliate of any 5% Shareholder;

shall require either (a) the approval of a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors or (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of that amount of Voting 
Power of the Voting Shares equal to the sum of (1) the Voting Power of the 
Voting Shares of which the 5% Shareholder is the Beneficial Owner and (2) a 
majority of the Voting Power of the remaining outstanding Voting Shares, 
voting together as a single class; provided, however, that no such vote shall 
be required for (i) the purchase by the Corporation of Voting Shares from a 5% 
Shareholder unless such vote is required by Section 1 of this Article IX, or 
(ii) any transaction with a 5% Shareholder who is also a 20% Shareholder as 
defined in Article VII and to which the provisions of Article VIII apply and 
are complied with.

3.	At any election of directors of the Corporation on or after the date on 
which any Person becomes a 40% Shareholder, and until such time as there is no 
longer any 40% Shareholder, there shall be cumulative voting for the election 
of directors so that any holder of shares of Voting Stock entitled to vote in 
such election shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of 
directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which such 
shareholder's shares would be entitled except for the provisions of this 
Section 3, and such shareholder may cast all of such votes for a single 
director, or distribute such votes among as many candidates as such 
shareholder sees fit.  In any such election of directors, one or more 
candidates for the Board may be nominated by a majority of the Disinterested 
Directors or by any Person who is the Beneficial Owner of Voting Shares having 
a Market Price of $250,000 or more.  With respect to any candidates nominated 
by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or by any Person who is the 
Beneficial Owner of Voting Shares having a Market Price of $250,000 or more, 
there shall be included in any proxy statement or other communication with 
respect to such election to be sent to holders of Voting Shares by the 
Corporation during the period in which there is a 40% Shareholder, at the


  
expense of the Corporation, descriptions and other statements of or with 
respect to such candidates submitted by them or on their behalf, which shall 
receive equal space, coverage and treatment as is received by candidates 
nominated by the Board or management of the Corporation provided that such 
information is received on a timely basis and complies with applicable federal 
and state securities laws.


ARTICLE X
---------

1.	The number of Directors of the Corporation shall be specified in the 
Bylaws, and such number may from time to time be increased or decreased in 
such manner as may be prescribed in the Bylaws, provided the number of 
Directors of the Corporation shall not be less than three (3) so long as the 
Corporation has only one shareholder and not less than seven (7) otherwise.

2.	On or before the date on which the Corporation first has more than one 
shareholder, Directors shall be classified with respect to the time for which 
they shall severally hold office by dividing them into three classes, as

may be removed from office as a Director at any time (a) for cause, at a duly 
called meeting of shareholders, by the affirmative vote of shareholders owning 
shares representing at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes which all 
shareholders would be entitled to cast at an Annual Election of Directors or 
(b) without cause, at a duly called meeting of shareholders, by the 
affirmative vote which satisfies the requirements of Article XII applicable to 
an amendment, modification, or repeal of certain of these Articles.

4.	Vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from 
an increase in the number of Directors, shall be filled only by a majority of

      --------------------

Nominations of candidates for election as directors at any meeting of

shareholders are, at the time, entitled to cumulate their votes in the

Incorporation of the Corporation by a majority of the "Disinterested 
Directors," or (iv) by any "Person" who is the "Beneficial Owner" of "Voting 
Shares" having a "Market Value" of $250,000 or more (as said terms are defined 
in the Articles of Incorporation).  Only persons nominated in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in this Section 3.12 shall be eligible for election 
as directors at a shareholders' meeting.

Nominations, other than those made by the Board of Directors, the 
Disinterested Directors, or a duly authorized committee of the Board, shall be 
made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation 
as set forth in this Section 3.12.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall 
be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not less than 120 days prior 
to the date corresponding to the date on which the Corporation mailed its 
proxy statement in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of 
shareholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the date of the annual meeting has 
been changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the 
time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the shareholder to be 
timely must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the 
close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which 
notice of the date of the scheduled meeting was mailed or the day on which 
public disclosure of (such date) was made.



     


Such shareholder's notice shall set forth as to each person whom the 
shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, 
and as to the shareholder giving the notice (i) the name, age, business 
address, and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation 
or employment of such person, (iii) the class and number of shares of the 
Corporation which are beneficially owned by such person on the date of such 
shareholder notice, and (iv) any other information relating to such person 
that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies with respect to 
nominees for election as directors, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.

No person shall be elected as a director of the Corporation unless nominated 
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.12.  Ballots 
bearing the names of all the persons who have been nominated for election as 
directors at a shareholders' meeting in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in this Section 3.12 shall be provided for use at the shareholders' 
meeting.

The Board of Directors may reject any nomination by a shareholder not timely 
made in accordance with the requirements of this Section 3.12.  If the Board 
of Directors, or a designated committee thereof, determines that the 
information provided in a shareholder's notice does not satisfy the 
informational requirements of this Section in any material respect, the 
Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly notify such shareholder of the 
deficiency in the notice.  The shareholder shall have an opportunity to cure 
the deficiency by providing additional information to the Secretary within 
such period of time not to exceed five (5) days from the date such deficiency 
notice is given to the shareholder as the Board of Directors or such committee 
shall reasonably determine.  If the deficiency is not cured within such 
period, or if the Board of Directors or such committee reasonably determines 
that the additional information provided by the shareholder, together with 
information previously provided, does not satisfy the requirements of this 
Section in any material respect, then the Board of Directors may reject such 
shareholder's nomination.  The Secretary of the Corporation shall notify a 
shareholder in writing whether his nomination has been made in accordance with 
the time and information requirements of this Section.

Notwithstanding the procedure set forth in this paragraph, if neither the 
Board of Directors nor such committee makes a determination as to the validity 
of any nominations by a shareholder, the presiding officer of the meeting 
shall determine and declare at the meeting whether a nomination was made in 
accordance with the terms of this Section.  If the presiding officer 
determines that a nomination was made in accordance with the terms of this 
Section, he shall so declare at the meeting and ballots shall be provided for


     

use at the meeting with respect to such nominee.  If the presiding officer 
determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the terms of this 
Section, he shall so declare at the meeting and the defective nominations 
shall be disregarded.

3.13	Rights Agreement

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, any action stated in the Rights 
Agreement between this Corporation and the First Jersey National Bank, dated 
as of May 20, 1988, as such agreement may be amended from time to time (the 
"Rights Agreement") to be taken by the Board of Directors after a Person has

ARTICLE VI
INDEMNITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AND OTHER PERSONS
---------------------------------------------------

6.1	Right to Indemnification
      ------------------------

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to 
or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any 
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, 
derivative, criminal, administrative, or investigative (a "proceeding"), by 
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the 
Corporation or, being or having been such a director or officer, he or she or


     


a person of whom he or she is a legal representative, is or was serving at the 
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, 
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or 
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, 
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction in an 
official capacity as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent 
or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, partner, 
trustee, employee, or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the 
Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Pennsylvania Business 
Corporation Law of 1988, public policy, or other applicable law (including 
binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or other commitments with, 
any governmental entity or agency) as the same exists or may hereafter be 
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such 
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights 
than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), 
against all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, 
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, or penalties and amounts paid or to be 
paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such 
person in connection therewith.  The right to indemnification granted in this 
Section 6.1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid 
by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in 
advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such 
expenses in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made 
only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of 
such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall 
ultimately be determined (including the final resolution of any suit brought 
pursuant to Section 6.2) that such director or officer is not entitled to be 
indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise. The indemnification granted 
in this Section 6.1 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a 
director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent, and shall inure to 
the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, and administrators; provided, 
however, that except as provided in Section 6.2 of this Article with respect 
to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation 
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a 
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding 
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

6.2	Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
      -------------------------------

If a claim under Section 6.1 of this Article is not paid in full by the 
Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by 
the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for expenses incurred in 
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, in which case the 
applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the claimant may at any time


     


thereafter bring an action against the Corporation to recover the unpaid 
amount of the claim and, to the extent successful in whole or in part, the 
claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such 
claim.  The claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under 
this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to 
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance 
of its final disposition, upon tender of any required undertaking) and 
thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the 
presumption that the claimant is so entitled.  Neither the failure of the 
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or 
its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of 
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the 
circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its 
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the 
claimant is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the action 
or create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled.  If an action is 
brought pursuant to this Section, a final non-appealable order in such action 
shall constitute the ultimate determination of the claimant's right to 
indemnification.

6.3	Non-exclusivity of Rights
      -------------------------

The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending 
a proceeding in advance of its final disposition granted in this Article shall 
not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter 
acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation, or 
these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders, or disinterested directors, or 
otherwise.  The Corporation shall have the express right to grant additional 
indemnity without seeking further approval by the shareholders.  All 
applicable indemnity provisions and any applicable law shall be interpreted 
and applied so as to provide a claimant with the broadest but non-duplicative 
indemnity to which he or she is entitled.

6.4	Insurance, Contracts and Funding
      --------------------------------

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and 
any director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of the Corporation 
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise 
against any expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would 
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or 
loss under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988.  The Corporation 
may enter into contracts granting indemnity to any director or officer of the 
Corporation and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest, or use


     


other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to secure or 
ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect 
indemnification.

 6.5	Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
      ----------------------------------------------------------

The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors from time to time, 
provide indemnification and pay expenses in advance of the final disposition 
of a proceeding to employees and agents of the Corporation with respect to the 
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the 
Corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the 
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 or otherwise.

6.6	Partial Indemnification
      -----------------------

If a claimant is entitled to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a 
portion of expenses, liabilities, or losses actually and reasonably incurred 
by claimant in an investigation, defense, appeal, or settlement but not, 
however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless 
indemnify claimant for the portion of such expenses, liabilities, or losses to 
which claimant is entitled.

6.7	Successors and Assigns
      ----------------------

All obligations of the Corporation to indemnify any director or officer shall 
be (i) binding upon all successors and assigns of the Corporation (including 
any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by 
merger or otherwise by operation of law) and (ii) binding on and inure to the 
benefit of the spouse, heirs, personal representatives and estate of the 
director or officer.  The Corporation shall not effect any sale of 
substantially all of its assets, merger, consolidation, or other 
reorganization unless the surviving entity agrees in writing to assume all 
such obligations of the Corporation.




     


ARTICLE VII
MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

7.1	Corporate Seal
      --------------

The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be a seal consisting of two (2) 
concentric circles, in the outer of which circles shall appear and be 
inscribed the following words, to wit: "VWR CORPORATION PENNSYLVANIA," and in 
the inner of which circles shall appear and be inscribed the following words 
and figures, to wit: "CORPORATE SEAL 1994;" and such seal, as impressed on the 
margin thereof, shall be the corporate seal of the Corporation until altered 
or replaced pursuant to the following proviso to this Section 7.1; provided, 
however, that at any time, and from time to time, such seal may be altered or 
a new corporate seal for the Corporation may be authorized and adopted, at the 
pleasure of its Board of Directors, by resolution duly adopted by such Board 
at any meeting thereof duly held.

7.2	Fiscal Year
      -----------

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall begin on January 1 and end December 
31 of each year.

7.3	Amendments
      ----------

The Bylaws of the Corporation may be amended, altered, or repealed, in whole 
or in part, or new Bylaws may be made for the Corporation from time to time by 
the affirmative vote of the majority of its whole Board of Directors, 
including the affirmative vote of at least one (1) director of each class, at 
any meeting of such Board duly held, subject to the right and power of the 
shareholders of the Corporation to change or repeal such Bylaws.

7.4	Severability
      ------------

In the event that any provision of these Bylaws is determined by a court to 
require the Corporation to do or to fail to do an act which is in violation of 
applicable law, such provision shall be limited or modified in its application 
to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law and, as so limited 
or modified, such provision and the balance of these Bylaws shall remain in 
full force and effect.

                                                       (Signature)

Revolving Credit Notes amend and restate the Revolving Credit Notes dated 
December 20, 1993 executed and delivered by Borrowers to U.S. Banks in

                        -----------------

				(i)	Revolving Credit Loan.  At Borrowers' election

an Event of Default or Default hereunder, any Portion of the Revolving Credit 
Loan shall bear interest at any one of the following rates:

Cost of Funds plus the Applicable Canadian Dollar Margin.

			    (iii)	Term Loan.  At Borrowers' election in accordance 
with the provisions of Paragraph 2.6(c) below, in the absence of an Event of 
Default or Default hereunder, any Portion of the Term Loan shall bear interest 
at any one of the following rates:

					(C)	Adjusted CD Rate.  The Adjusted CD Rate

outstanding principal balance of the Loans at the rate of two percent (2%) per 
annum in excess of the rates then available to and elected by Borrowers for 
each Portion then outstanding through the end of the applicable Interest 
Periods and, thereafter, at the rate of two percent (2%) per annum in excess 
of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

			(c)	Procedure for Determining Rates of Interest.  
				(i)	Revolving Credit Loan or Term Loan.  If 
Borrowers elect the Base Rate to be applicable to a Portion of the Revolving 
Credit Loan or Term Loan, Borrowers must notify Agent of such election prior 
to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon Philadelphia time on the date of the proposed 
application of such Rate.  If Borrowers elect the Adjusted Libor Rate to be


     


applicable to a Portion of the Revolving Credit Loan or Term Loan, Borrowers 
must notify Agent of such election prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon 
Philadelphia time at least two (2) London Business Days prior to the 
commencement of the proposed Interest Period.  If Borrowers elect the Adjusted 
CD Rate to be applicable to a Portion of the Revolving Credit Loan or Term 
Loan, Borrowers must notify Agent of such election prior to twelve o'clock 
(12:00) noon at least one Business Day prior to the commencement of the 
proposed Interest Period.  Agent shall send notice by telecopy to Banks by 
twelve thirty (12:30) p.m. on the Business Day of such request.  If Borrowers 
do not provide the applicable notice for the Adjusted Libor Rate or Adjusted 
CD Rate, then Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that the Base Rate 
shall apply to any Portion which was subject to the rate of interest 
applicable during an expiring Interest Period and to any new advance of the 
Revolving Credit Loan until Borrowers shall have given proper notice of a 
change in or determination of the rate of interest in accordance with this 
Paragraph 2.6(c).  

			    (ii)	Canadian Dollar Loans.  Borrowers shall notify 
BOA Canada, with a copy to Agent (which Agent shall deliver to Banks within 
one Business Day of receipt), of its selected Interest Period with respect to 
any Canadian Dollar Portion outstanding or to be advanced, prior to twelve 
o'clock (12:00) noon Philadelphia time at least one Canadian Business Day 
prior to the commencement of the proposed Interest Period.  If Borrowers fail 
to provide the required notice of a selected Interest Period, the Borrowers 
shall be deemed to have requested an Interest Period of thirty (30) days to be 
applicable to any outstanding Portion with an expiring Interest Period and for 
any new Advance of the Canadian Dollar Loan.  

			   (iii)	Number of Portions.  Borrowers shall not elect 
more than eight (8) different Portions (other than Base Rate Portions) to be 
applicable to the Loans at one time.

			(d)	Payment and Calculation of Interest. Interest on Libor 
Portions, CD Portions and Canadian Dollar Portions shall be due and payable on 
the last day of the Interest Period for each such Portion; provided, however, 
that with respect to CD Portions or Canadian Dollar Portions having an 
Interest Period in excess of ninety (90) days, and Libor Portions having an 
Interest Period in excess of three (3) months, interest shall be payable on 
the ninetieth (90th) day and on the last day of such Interest Period.  
Interest with respect to Base Rate Portions shall be due and payable on the 
last day of each month.  Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the 
provisions of Paragraph 2.6(b) hereof; interest based on the Prime Rate or the 
BOA Canada Cost of Funds shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number 
of days elapsed over a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three 
hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and interest based on the 
Federal Funds Rate, the Adjusted CD Rate, or the Adjusted Libor Rate shall be 
calculated in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 2.6(b) on the basis 
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of three hundred sixty (360) 
days.  For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), in order to effectuate


     


the agreed rates of interest provided herein, (i) the principle of deemed 
reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation under 
this Agreement or the Notes, (ii) the rates of interest stipulated under this 
Agreement and the Notes are intended to be nominal rates and not effective 
rates or yields, and (iii) each rate of interest determined pursuant to such 
calculation expressed as an annual rate is equivalent to such rate as so 
determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in 
which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 365 (for interest based on 
the Prime Rate or the BOA Canada Cost of Funds) or 360 (in the case of 
interest based on the Federal Funds Rate, the Adjusted CD Rate or the Adjusted 
LIBOR Rate).

			(e)	Reserves.  If at any time a Libor Portion, CD Portion 
or Canadian Dollar Portion is outstanding and a Bank is subject to and incurs 
a Reserve, Borrowers hereby agree to pay within five (5) Business Days of 
written demand thereof from time to time, as billed by Agent on behalf of 
itself or a Bank, such additional amount as is necessary to reimburse such 
Bank for its costs in maintaining such Reserve.  Such amount shall be computed 
by taking into account the cost incurred by the Bank in maintaining such 
Reserve in an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share of the Portion on 
which such Reserve is incurred.  The determination by Agent or a Bank of such 
costs incurred and the allocation, if any, of such costs among Borrowers and 
other customers which have similar arrangements with such Bank shall be prima 
facie evidence of the correctness of the fact and the amount of such 
additional costs.

			(f)	Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted CD Rate.

				(i)	Change of CD Rates.  The Adjusted CD Rate may be 
automatically adjusted by Agent on a prospective basis to take into account 
additional or increased costs incurred by Banks due to changes in applicable 
law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest 
Period, including but not limited to changes in tax laws (except changes of 
general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve 
requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(or any successor), including the Reserve Percentage, and assessments imposed 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or any successor), (including 
the Assessment Rate as provided in the definition of "Assessment Rate" above), 
that increase the cost to Banks of funding the Loans or a Portion thereof 
bearing interest at the Adjusted CD Rate.  Agent shall give Borrowers notice 
of such determination and adjustment, and Borrowers may, by notice to Agent, 
require Agent to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the basis for 
adjusting such Adjusted CD Rate and the method for determining the amount of 
such adjustment.  Thereafter, Borrowers shall either pay interest on the 
affected Portion(s) at the increased rate or repay the Portion with respect to 
which such adjustment is made in accordance with Paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 
hereof.


     


			    (ii)	Unavailability of Adjusted CD Rate.  In the 
event that Borrowers shall have requested a quotation of the Adjusted CD Rate 
in accordance with Paragraph 2.6(c) hereof and Agent shall have reasonably 
determined that the Adjusted CD Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect 
the cost of making or maintaining the principal amount of the Loans or a 
Portion thereof specified by Borrowers during the Interest Period selected 
because of the inability of Agent to obtain bids in the amount of a requested 
Advance in accordance with the terms of the definition of Certificate of 
Deposit Rate set forth above, Agent shall promptly give notice of such 
determination to Borrowers.  A determination by such Bank or Agent hereunder 
shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the fact.  Upon such a 
determination, (i) the Banks' obligation to advance or maintain CD Portions 
shall be suspended until Agent shall have notified Borrowers and Banks that 
such conditions shall have ceased to exist, and (ii) Borrowers shall elect the 
Adjusted Libor Rate or Base Rate to be applicable to Portions.

			(g)	Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted Libor Rate.  
The following special provisions shall apply to the Adjusted Libor Rate:  

				(i)	Change of Adjusted Libor Rate.  The Adjusted 
Libor Rate may be automatically adjusted by Agent on a prospective basis to 
take into account the additional or  increased cost of maintaining any 
necessary reserves for Eurocurrency deposits or increased costs due to changes 
in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then 
applicable Interest Period, including but not limited to changes in tax laws 
(except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and 
changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (or any successor), including the Reserve Percentage, 
that increase the cost to Banks of funding the Loans or a Portion thereof 
bearing interest at the Adjusted Libor Rate.  Agent shall give Borrowers 
notice of such a determination and adjustment, and Borrowers may, by notice to 
Agent require Agent to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the 
basis for adjusting such Adjusted Libor Rate and the method for determining 
the amount of such adjustment.  Thereafter, Borrowers shall either pay 
interest on the affected Portion(s) of the increased rate or repay the Portion 
with respect to which such adjustment is made in accordance with 
Paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 hereof.

			    (ii)	Unavailability of Eurocurrency Funds.  In the 
event that Borrowers shall have requested a quotation of the Adjusted Libor 
Rate in accordance with Paragraph 2.6(c) hereof and any Bank shall have 
reasonably determined that Eurocurrency deposits equal to the amount of the 
principal of the Portion and for the Interest Period specified are 
unavailable, or that the Adjusted Libor Rate will not adequately and fairly 
reflect the cost of making or maintaining the principal amount of the Portion 
specified by Borrowers during the Interest Period specified or that by reason 
of circumstances affecting Eurocurrency markets, adequate and reasonable means


     


do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Libor Rate applicable to the 
specified Interest Period, Agent shall promptly give notice of such 
determination to Borrowers that the Adjusted Libor Rate is not available.  A 
determination by any Bank hereunder shall be prima facie evidence of the 
correctness of the fact.  Upon such a determination, (i) the Banks' obligation 
to advance or maintain Portions at the Adjusted Libor Rate shall be suspended 
until Agent shall have notified Borrowers and Banks that such conditions shall 
have ceased to exist, and (ii) Borrowers shall elect the Adjusted CD Rate or 
Base Rate to be applicable to Portions.

			   (iii)	Illegality.  In the event that it becomes 
unlawful for a Bank to maintain Eurocurrency liabilities sufficient to fund 
such Bank's share of any Portion subject to the Adjusted Libor Rate, then such 
Bank shall immediately notify Borrowers thereof (with a copy to Agent) and 
such Bank's obligations hereunder to make or maintain Advances at the Adjusted 
Libor Rate shall be suspended until such time as such Bank may again cause the 
Adjusted Libor Rate to be applicable to its share of any Portion of the 
outstanding principal balance of the Loans and such Bank's share of any 
Portion shall then be subject to the Base Rate or the Adjusted CD Rate, as 
Borrowers may elect in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 2.6.

		2.7.  Advances.
                  --------

			(a)	Borrowers shall give Agent written notice of each 
requested Advance under the Revolving Credit Commitment, specifying the date

least two (2) London Business Days prior to Advances to bear interest based on 
the Adjusted Libor Rate, at least one Business Day prior to Advances to bear 
interest based on the Adjusted CD Rate, and on the date of each requested 
Advance to bear interest based on the Base Rate.  Borrowers shall give BOA 
Canada written notice of each requested Advance under the Canadian Dollar 
Commitment, specifying the date and amount thereof, prior to twelve o'clock 
(12:00) noon Philadelphia time at least one Canada Business Day prior to the 
date of the requested Advance.  Copies of such notices delivered to Agent in 
connection with Advances under the Revolving Credit Commitment shall be sent 
by Borrowers to BOA Canada, and copies of such notices delivered to BOA Canada 
in connection with Advances under the Canadian Dollar Commitment shall be sent 
by Borrowers to Agent (which Agent shall deliver to Banks within one Business 
Day of receipt).  Such notice shall be made by delivery of the Advance Request 
Form and shall contain a statement certified by the chief financial officer or 
other authorized officer of VWR, for itself and on behalf of Borrowers, 
containing the following information and representations, which shall be 
deemed affirmed and true and correct as of the date of the Advance Request 
Form and the date of the requested Advance:



     


				(i)	the aggregate amount of the requested Advance, 
which shall be in multiples of $250,000 but not less than the lesser of 
$1,000,000 or the unborrowed balance of the Revolving Credit Commitment, or, 
in the case of Canadian Dollar Advances, in multiples of CAN$250,000 but not 
less than CAN$1,000,000, or the unborrowed balance of the Canadian Dollar 
Commitment.

			    (ii)	confirmation of the interest rate(s) Borrowers 
have elected to apply to the Advance and, if more than one Portion has been 
elected, the amount of the Portion as to which each interest rate shall apply, 
together with the Interest Period applicable thereto;

			   (iii)	confirmation of Borrowers' compliance with 
Paragraphs 5.12 through 5.18 and 6.1 through 6.5 hereof prior to and following 
such Advance, and calculation of the Borrowing Base as of the most recent 
month end to Funded Debt taking into account the requested Advance and any 
payments to the date of such Advance; and

			    (iv)	statements that the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 3 hereof are true and correct as of the 
applicable dates; that no Event of Default or Default hereunder has occurred 
and is then continuing; and that there has been no Material Adverse Effect 
since the date of this Agreement.

			(b)	The following procedures shall be applicable to any 
Advance other than a Canadian Dollar Advance, which shall be governed by 
subparagraph (c) below:

				(i)	Upon receiving a request for an Advance under 
the Revolving Credit Commitment in accordance with subparagraph (a) above, 
Agent shall send a copy of the Advance Request Form by telecopy to Banks by 
twelve thirty (12:30) p.m. Philadelphia time on such day requesting that each 
Bank advance funds to Agent so that each Bank participates in the requested 
Advance in the same percentage as it participates in the Revolving Credit 
Commitment.  Each Bank shall advance its Participation Percentage of the 
requested Advance to Agent by delivering immediately available funds in United 
States Dollars at Agent's offices prior to two o'clock (2:00) p.m. 
Philadelphia time on the date of the Advance.  Subject to the satisfaction of 
the terms and conditions hereof, Agent shall make the requested Advance 
available to Borrowers by crediting such amount in United States Dollars to 
VWR's deposit account with Agent not later than three o'clock (3:00) p.m. 
Philadelphia time on the day of the requested Advance; provided, however, that 
in the event Agent does not receive a Bank's share of the requested Advance by 
such time as provided above, Agent shall not be obligated to advance such 
Bank's share.



     


			    (ii)	Unless Agent shall have been notified by a Bank 
prior to the date such Bank's share of any such Advance is to be made by such 
Bank that such Bank does not intend to make its share of such requested 
Advance available to Agent, Agent may assume that such Bank has made such 
proceeds available to Agent on such date, and Agent may, in reliance upon such 
assumption (but shall not be obligated to), make available to Borrowers a 
corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made 
available to Agent by such Bank on the date the Advance is made, Agent shall 
be entitled to recover such amount, on demand from such Bank, together with 
interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the 
date such amount was made available to Borrowers and ending on (but excluding) 
the date Agent recovers such amount, from such Bank, at a rate per annum equal 
to the effective rate for overnight federal funds in New York as reported by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for such day or, if such day is not a 
Business Day, for the next preceding Business Day); or, if such Bank fails to 
pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, from Borrowers together with 
interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Revolving Credit Margin.

			   (iii)	Each Bank shall receive interest on its share of 
any Advance from the date on which the amount of its share of such Advance is 
received by Agent and not from the date on which Agent makes such Advance (if 
it elects to do so as permitted in clause (ii) of subparagraph 2.7(b)) unless 
such dates are the same.		

			(c)	Upon receiving a request for a Canadian Dollar Advance 
in accordance with subparagraph (a) above, subject to satisfaction of the 
terms and conditions hereof, BOA Canada shall make the requested Advance 
available to Borrowers by crediting such amount in Canadian Dollars to VWR 
Canada's deposit account with BOA Canada not later than two o'clock (2:00) 
p.m. Philadelphia time on the day of the requested Advance or as otherwise 
directed by Borrowers and agreed to by BOA Canada.

			(d)	Each request for an Advance pursuant to this Paragraph 
2.7 shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers.  In the case of any 
Canadian Dollar Advance and any Advance which is to be based upon the Adjusted 
CD Rate or Adjusted Libor Rate, Borrowers shall indemnify each Bank against 
any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any failure to 
fulfill on or before the date specified in such request for an Advance the 
applicable conditions set forth in Section 4, including, without limitation, 
any loss (including loss of margin), cost or expense incurred by reason of the 
liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank 
to fund the Advance to be made by such Bank when such Advance, as a result of 
such failure, is not made on such date, as calculated by BOA Canada (with 
respect to Canadian Dollar Advances) or Agent (in all other cases) in 
accordance with Exhibit E attached hereto.



     


		2.8.  Reduction and Termination of Commitment. 
                  ---------------------------------------

			(a)  Borrowers.  Borrowers shall have the right at any time 
and from time to time, upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to 
Agent, to reduce the Commitments or either of them in whole or in part without 
penalty or premium, provided that: (i) any such reduction shall be in an 
aggregate amount not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the case 
of either the Revolving Credit Commitment or the Canadian Dollar Commitment; 
(ii) on the effective date of such reduction Borrowers shall make a prepayment 
of the Revolving Credit Loan and the Canadian Dollar Loan, as applicable, in 
an amount, if any, by which the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 
Revolving Credit Loan and the Canadian Dollar Loan, exceed the amount of the 
Revolving Credit Commitment and Canadian Dollar Commitment, respectively, as 
then so reduced, together with accrued interest on the amount so prepaid; and 
(iii) if a Portion is paid prior to the last day of an Interest Period, 
Borrowers shall pay any funding costs and loss of earnings and anticipated 
profits which may arise in connection with such prepayment or repayment, as 
calculated by Agent in accordance with Exhibit E attached hereto.  

			(b)  Banks.  Pursuant to Paragraph 8.2 hereof, Required 
Banks shall have the right to terminate the Revolving Credit Commitment and 
Canadian Dollar Commitment at any time, in their discretion and upon notice to 
Borrowers (except in the case of an Event of Default pursuant to Paragraph 
8.1(i), in which case the Commitments shall terminate without notice), upon 
the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder.  Any payment following the 
occurrence of an Event of Default, acceleration and demand for payment shall 
include the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Paragraph 2.10 hereof.

			(c)	Restoration Only With Consent.  Any termination or 
reduction of the Commitments pursuant to subparagraphs 2.8(a) or (b) shall be 
permanent, and the Commitments cannot thereafter be restored or increased 
without the written consent of all U.S. Banks, in the case of the Revolving 
Credit Commitment, or all Banks, in the case of the Canadian Dollar 
Commitment.

		2.9.  Prepayment; Repayment.
                  ---------------------

			(a)	Upon one (1) Business Day's prior written notice by 
Borrowers to Agent (and to BOA Canada, in the case of the Canadian Dollar 
Loan), Borrowers may prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving 
Credit Loan, the Canadian Dollar Loan or the Term Loan as specified by 
Borrowers at any time without premium or penalty, except as provided in 
Paragraph 2.10 below, provided that repayments of the Revolving Credit Loan or 
the Canadian Dollar Loan prior to the Termination Date shall not reduce the 
applicable Commitment and may be reborrowed and partial prepayments of the


     

Term Loan will be applied first to accrued interest and then to the 
outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan in the inverse order of the 
maturity of the installments thereof.  Any prepayment shall be in an amount 
equal to or in excess of $250,000 (or CAN$250,000, in the case of repayment of 
the Canadian Dollar Loan).

			(b)	In the event that the aggregate U.S. Dollar Equivalent 
of the outstanding principal amount of the Canadian Dollar Loan shall at any 
time exceed (i) the unborrowed balance of the Revolving Credit Commitment, 
(ii) fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 
Revolving Credit Loan or (iii) Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000), the 
Agent shall promptly give notice of such fact to Borrowers and the Banks, and 
Borrowers shall be required to make a payment pursuant to Paragraph 2.9(a) 
hereof such that the aggregate U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount 
of the Canadian Dollar is less than or equal to the limits set forth in 
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above.  Such payment shall be made within five 
Business Days following the date of such notice by Agent.

		2.10.  Funding Costs; Loss of Earnings.  In connection with any 
prepayment or repayment of any Canadian Dollar Portion or any Portion bearing 
interest based on the Adjusted Libor Rate or Adjusted CD Rate made on other 
than the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether such prepayment 
or repayment is voluntary, mandatory, by demand, acceleration or otherwise, 
Borrowers shall pay to Banks all funding costs and loss of margin which may 
arise in connection with such prepayment or repayment, as calculated by Agent 
or the applicable Bank in accordance with Exhibit E attached hereto.  

		2.11.  Payments.
                   --------

			(a)	Except as provided in Paragraph 2.11(b) below, all

including any prepayments thereof, shall be made by Borrowers to Agent in 
immediately available funds before twelve o'clock (12:00) noon Philadelphia 
time on any Business Day at the principal office of Agent set forth at the 
beginning of this Agreement, in U.S. Dollars.

			(b)	All payments on account of the Canadian Dollar Loan

charge any Borrower's account with Agent or such Bank for all payments of 
principal, interest and fees not paid when due hereunder.

		2.12.  Commitment Fee.   Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the 
account of U.S. Banks a non-refundable commitment fee at the rate of (i) one-
eighth of one percent (1/8%) per annum on the unborrowed portion of each 
Bank's Maximum Principal Amount up to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), plus 
(ii) three-eighths of one percent (3/8%) per annum on the unborrowed portion 
of each Bank's Maximum Principal Amount in excess of Five Million Dollars 
($5,000,000) (including in calculating the borrowed portion of Seafirst's 
Maximum Principal Amount the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding 
Canadian Dollar Loan).  Such commitment fee shall be payable at the offices of 
Agent quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each January, April, 
July and October, as billed by Agent.  The commitment fee shall be calculated 
on the daily unborrowed portions of each Bank's Maximum Principal Amount as 
set forth above and on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 
year of three hundred sixty (360) days.

		2.13.  Facility Fee.  On or before the date of this Agreement, 
Borrowers shall have paid to Agent (for the ratable benefit of U.S. Banks) a 
facility fee in the amount of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars 
($125,000).

		2.14.  Agent Fee.  Borrowers will pay to Agent an agent fee in 
accordance with a letter agreement between Borrowers and Agent.

		2.15.  Regulatory Changes in Capital Requirements.  If any Bank 
shall have determined that the adoption after the date hereof of any law, 
rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any 
of the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any of the 
foregoing by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency 
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by 
such Bank (or any lending office of such Bank) or such Bank's holding company 
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not 
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable 
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such 
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Bank's holding company if any, as a 
consequence of this Agreement or the Advances made by such Bank pursuant 
hereto to a level below that which such Bank or its holding company could have 
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into 
consideration such Bank's policies and the policies of such Bank's holding 
company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to 
be material, then from time to time Borrowers shall pay to such Bank on demand 
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or its holding 
company for any such reduction suffered together with interest on each such 
amount from the date demanded until payment in full thereof at the rate 
provided in Paragraph 2.6(b)(iii) hereof with respect to amounts not paid when


     

due.  Such Bank will notify Borrowers of any event occurring after the date of 
this Agreement that will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this 
Paragraph 2.15 as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof 
and determines to request such compensation.

		A certificate of such Bank setting forth such amount or amounts as 
shall be necessary to compensate such Bank or its holding company as specified 
above shall be delivered to Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest 
error.  Borrowers shall pay such Bank the amount shown as due on any such 
certificate delivered by such Bank within five (5) days after its receipt of 
the same.

		Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for 
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reductions 
in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver 
of such Bank's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any 
other period.

		3.18.  Hazardous Wastes, Substances and Petroleum Products.
                   ---------------------------------------------------

			(a)	Each Borrower: (i) has received all permits, licenses, 
authorizations and approvals and filed all notifications and reports necessary 
to carry on its businesses; and (ii) is in compliance with all material 
federal, state or local, foreign or domestic, laws and regulations governing 
the control, removal, spill, release or discharge of hazardous or toxic 
wastes, substances and petroleum products, including without limitation as 
provided in the provisions of and the regulations under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by 
the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and any regulations 
thereunder, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, and the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act (all of the foregoing enumerated and non-enumerated 
statutes, including without limitation any applicable state or local statutes, 
as amended, collectively the "Environmental Control Statutes").

			(b)	Except as set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto, no 
Borrower has given any written or oral notice to the Environmental Protection 
Agency ("EPA") or any state or local or foreign agency or governmental body 
with regard to any actual or imminently threatened removal, spill, release or 
discharge of hazardous or toxic wastes, substances or petroleum products on 
properties owned or leased by such Borrowers or in connection with the conduct 
of its business and operations and, to the best of Borrowers' knowledge, there 
are no circumstances, processes, facilities, operations, equipment or any 
other activities at, on or under any such properties that constitute a 
material breach of or material non-compliance with any of the Environmental 
Control Statutes.



     

			(c)	Except as set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto, no 
Borrower has received notice that it is potentially responsible for costs of 
clean-up of any actual or imminently threatened spill, release or discharge of 
hazardous or toxic wastes or substances or petroleum products pursuant to any 
Environmental Control Statute.  Exhibit F attached hereto does not include 
notice with respect to matters that are no longer pending.

		3.19.  Solvency.  To the best of VWR's knowledge, VWR is, and 
after receipt and application of the first advance will be, solvent such that: 
(i) the fair value of its assets (including without limitation the fair 
salable value of the goodwill and other intangible property of VWR) is greater 
than the total amount of its liabilities, including without limitation, 
contingent liabilities, (ii) the present fair salable value of its assets 
(including without limitation the fair salable value of the goodwill and other 
intangible property of VWR) is not less than the amount that will be required 
to pay the probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and 
matured, and (iii) it is able to realize upon its assets and pay its debts and 
other liabilities, contingent obligations and other commitments as they mature 
in the normal course of business. VWR (i) does not intend to, and does not 
believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as 
such debts and liabilities mature, and (ii) is not engaged in a business or 
transaction, or about to engage in a business or transaction, for which its 
property would constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due 
consideration to the prevailing practice and industry in which it is engaged.  
For purposes of this Paragraph 3.19, in computing the amount of contingent 
liabilities at any time, it is intended that such liabilities will be computed 
at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at 
such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an 
actual mature liability.

		3.20.  Senior Debt Status.  The obligations of Borrowers under 
this Agreement and the Notes do rank and will rank senior in priority of 
payment and lien to all other indebtedness of Borrowers except for any 
indebtedness of Borrowers under the Permitted L/Cs, which shall rank pari 
passu with the indebtedness of Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes, 
and except for indebtedness of Borrowers to the extent secured by liens 
permitted pursuant to Paragraph 6.3 hereof.

		3.21.  No Burdensome Agreements.  No Borrower is a party to or 
bound by any agreement, contract, instrument, understanding or commitment of 
any kind or subject to any corporate or other restriction the performance or 
observance of which now has or, as far as Borrowers can reasonably foresee, 
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

		3.22.  Full Disclosure.  As of the date hereof, neither this

	SECTION 7

	ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AND RIGHT OF SET OFF
      ------------------------------------------

		7.1.  Additional Collateral.  As additional collateral for the 
payment of any and all of Borrowers' indebtedness and obligations to Banks, 
whether matured or unmatured, now existing or hereafter incurred or created 
hereunder or otherwise, Borrowers hereby grant to Banks a security interest in 
and lien upon all funds, balances or other property of any kind of Borrowers, 
or in which any Borrower has an interest, limited to the interest of Borrowers 
therein, but only to the extent such funds, balances or other property are now 
or hereafter in the possession, custody or control of any Bank. 

		7.2.  Right of Set-off.  Each Bank is hereby authorized at any 
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off 
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, 
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time 
owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of each Borrower 
against any and all of the obligations of Borrowers now or hereafter existing 
under this Agreement and the Note held by such Bank, irrespective of whether 
such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Notes and 
although such obligations may be unmatured.  Each Bank agrees promptly to 
notify Borrowers after any such set-off and application made by such Bank; 
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the 
validity of such set-off and application.  The rights of each Bank under this 
Section 7 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without 
limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have.

(20) days after notice thereof to Borrowers given by Agent pursuant to the 
direction of Required Banks; provided, however, that Borrowers shall have up 
to thirty (30) days after notice to Borrowers to cure a default under 
Paragraph 5.19 hereof; provided further, however, that at no time shall less

power in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this subparagraph 
(f) as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, trustee, or holder of revocable 
proxies given in response to a solicitation pursuant to the 1934 Act, for one

stayed within twenty (20) days; or if proceedings under any law related to 
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or the reorganization, readjustment or 
the release of debtors is instituted or commenced by any Borrower; or if any 
order for relief is entered relating to any of the foregoing proceedings; or 
if any Borrower shall call a meeting of its creditors with a view to arranging

shall occur in which case acceleration shall occur automatically without 
notice), Required Banks may declare the entire unpaid balance, principal, 
interest and fees, of all indebtedness of Borrowers to Banks, hereunder or 
otherwise, to be immediately due and payable.  Upon such declaration or deemed 
declaration, the Revolving Credit Commitment shall immediately and 
automatically terminate and Banks shall have no further obligation to make any 
Advances and shall have the immediate right to enforce or realize on any 
collateral security granted therefor, including without limitation pursuant to 
the Collateral Security Documents, in any manner or order they deem expedient 
without regard to any equitable principles of marshalling or otherwise.  In 
addition to any rights granted hereunder or in any documents delivered in 
connection herewith, Banks shall have all the rights and remedies granted by 
any applicable law, all of which shall be cumulative in nature.


     


	SECTION 9

	THE BANKS
      ---------

		This Section sets forth the relative rights and duties of Agent 
and Banks respecting the Loans and does not confer any enforceable rights on 
Borrowers against Banks or create on the part of Banks any duties or 
obligations to Borrowers.

		9.1.  Application of Payments.
                  -----------------------

			(a)	Except as set forth in Paragraph 9.1(c) below (i) 
Agent shall apply all payments of principal and interest made to Agent 
hereunder by or on behalf of Borrowers on account of the Revolving Credit Loan 
or the Term Loan to the U.S. Banks on the basis of their respective Pro Rata 
Shares with respect to such Loans, and (ii) Agent shall apply all payments of 
fees, premiums and expenses made to Agent hereunder by or on behalf of 
Borrowers to the U.S. Banks as provided in this Agreement; provided, however, 
that in the event that Agent shall at any time receive any payments by or on 
behalf of Borrowers in excess of the aggregate outstanding balance of the 
Revolving Credit Loan and the Term Loan and all fees, premiums and expenses 
due to U.S. Banks hereunder, then Agent shall forward the amount of such 
excess to BOA Canada for application to the Canadian Dollar Loan in accordance 
with Paragraph 9.1(b).

			(b)	Except as set forth in Paragraph 9.1(c) below, BOA 
Canada shall apply all payments of principal, interest, fees or other amounts 
made to it by or on behalf of Borrowers to the Canadian Dollar Loan, provided 
however that in the event that BOA Canada shall at any time receive any such 
payments by or on behalf of Borrowers in excess of the aggregate outstanding 
balance of the Canadian Dollar Loan, then BOA Canada shall forward the amount 
of such excess to Agent for application to the Revolving Credit Loan and the 
Term Loan in accordance with Paragraph 9.1(a).

			(c)	Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an 
Event of Default, (i) all amounts received by BOA Canada by or on behalf of 
Borrowers in connection with the Canadian Dollar Loan or otherwise, and all 
amounts received by any U.S. Bank by or on behalf of Borrowers in connection 
with Permitted L/Cs or otherwise, shall be forwarded to Agent for application 
pursuant to clause (ii) following, and (ii) all amounts received by Agent by 
or on behalf of Borrowers (whether voluntary, involuntary, realized from 
Collateral, or otherwise) shall be distributed among CoreStates, BOA Canada 
and the other Banks pro rata on the basis of the ratio which (x) the aggregate 
principal amount of indebtedness to each Bank under the Loans plus the 
aggregate amount available to be drawn under, and all unreimbursed draws 
under, Permitted L/Cs issued or participated in by such Bank, bears to (y) the 
aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness of Borrowers to Banks under the


     


Loans plus the aggregate amount available to be drawn under, and all 
unreimbursed draws under, Permitted L/Cs; provided, however, that in the event 
that any Bank shall have received an allocation of funds hereunder based on 
amounts available to be drawn under any Permitted L/C issued by or 
participated in by such Bank, and such Permitted L/C shall expire without 
being drawn upon, then such Bank shall return such funds to Agent for 
reallocation in accordance herewith.

			(d)	Any distribution of payments by Agent under Paragraphs 
9.1(a) or (c) above shall be made promptly in federal funds immediately 
available at the office of each Bank set forth above.  

		9.2.  Setoff.  In the event that a Bank, by exercise of its right 
of set off, reduces indebtedness owing to it hereunder or under the Permitted 
L/Cs by an amount greater than its pro rata share of such amount based upon 
the Banks' respective shares of principal indebtedness outstanding hereunder 
and of amounts available to be drawn under and unreimbursed draws under the 
Permitted L/Cs immediately before such setoff or other reduction, such Bank 
shall purchase a portion of the indebtedness hereunder owing to each other 
Bank and of amounts available to be drawn under and unreimbursed draws under 
Permitted L/Cs issued or participated in by each other Bank, so that after 
such purchase each Bank shall hold its pro rata share of all the indebtedness 
then outstanding hereunder and of amounts available to be drawn under and 
unreimbursed draws under the Permitted L/Cs, based upon the Banks' respective 
shares of principal indebtedness outstanding and of amounts available to be 
drawn and unreimbursed draws under Permitted L/Cs immediately before such 
setoff or other reduction, provided that if all or any portion of such excess 
payment is thereafter recovered from such Bank, such purchase shall be 
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of any such recovery, 
but without interest.

		9.3.  Modifications and Waivers.  No modification or amendment 
hereof, consent hereunder or waiver of any Event of Default shall be effective 
except by written consent of the Required Banks, provided, however, that the 
written consent of all Banks shall be required to (a) decrease the rate of 
interest, (b) increase the amount of the Term Loan, the Revolving Credit 
Commitment, or the Banks' respective Maximum Principal Amounts, (c) amend the 
definition of Required Banks, (d) amend, modify, waive, discharge or suspend 
compliance with any date of payment hereunder or the definition of the 
Termination Date, (e) amend, modify, waive, discharge or suspend compliance 
with the commitment fee, (f) amend, modify, waive, discharge or suspend 
compliance with Paragraph 6.3 or 6.4 hereof, (g) release any portion of the 
collateral under the Collateral Security Documents valued in excess of 
$200,000 based on a certificate as to the value of the collateral to be 
released provided to Banks by an executive officer of VWR, (h) increase the 
advance rates under the Borrowing Base, or (i) modify, amend, waive, discharge 
or suspend compliance with this Paragraph 9.3 hereof.  Any amendment or waiver 
made pursuant to this Paragraph 9.3 shall apply to and bind all of the Banks 
and any future holder of any Notes.


     


		9.4.  Obligations Several.  The obligations of the Banks hereunder 
are several, and each Bank hereunder shall not be responsible for the 
obligations of the other Banks hereunder, nor, will the failure of one Bank to 
perform any of its obligations hereunder relieve the other Banks from the 
performance of their respective obligations hereunder.  

		9.5.  Banks' Representations.  Each Bank represents and warrants 
to the other Banks that (i) it has been furnished all information it has 
requested for the purpose of evaluating its proposed participation under this 
Agreement; and (ii) it has decided to enter into this Agreement on the basis 
of its independent review and credit analysis of Borrowers, this Agreement and 
the documentation in connection therewith and has not relied for such analysis 
on any information or analysis provided by any other Bank.

		9.6.  Investigation.  No Bank shall have any obligation to the 
others to investigate the condition of Borrowers or any of the Collateral or 
any other matter concerning the Loans.  

		9.7.  Powers of Agent.  Agent shall have and may exercise those 
powers specifically delegated to Agent herein, together with such powers as 
are reasonably incidental thereto.

		9.8.  General Duties of Agent, Immunity and Indemnity.  Agent will 
promptly deliver to Banks financial information and other material information 
regarding Borrowers received by it from Borrowers, and which has not been 
delivered by Borrowers to Banks.  In performing its duties as Agent hereunder, 
Agent will take the same care as it takes in connection with loans in which it 
alone is interested, subject to the limitations on liabilities contained 
herein; provided that Agent shall not be obligated to ascertain or inquire as 
to the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof by 
Borrowers.  Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or 
employees shall be liable for any action or omission by any of them hereunder 
or in connection herewith except for gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
Subject to such exception, each of the Banks hereby indemnifies Agent on the 
basis of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of all Loans, against any such liability, 
claim, loss or expense.  

		9.9.  No Responsibility for Representations or Validity, etc.  
Each Bank agrees that Agent shall not be responsible to any Bank for any 
representations, statements, or warranties of Borrowers herein.  Neither Agent 
nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be responsible 
for the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency, perfection or enforceability of 
this Agreement and any collateral security therefor, or any documents relating 
thereto or for the priority of any of Banks' security interests in any such 
collateral security.  

		9.10.  Action on Instruction of Banks; Right to Indemnity.  Agent 
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting 
hereunder in accordance with written instructions to it signed by Required


     


Banks unless the consent of all the Banks is expressly required hereunder in 
which case Agent shall be so protected when acting in accordance with such 
instructions from all the Banks.  Such instructions and any action taken or 
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Banks, provided 
that except as otherwise provided herein, Agent may act hereunder in its own 
discretion without requesting such instructions.  Agent shall be fully 
justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall 
first be specifically indemnified to its satisfaction by the other Banks on 
the basis of their respective Pro Rata Shares of all Loans, against any and 
all liability and expense which it may incur by reason of taking or continuing 
to take any such action.

		9.11.  Employment of Agents.  In connection with its activities 
hereunder, Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be 
answerable, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized 
agents, for the default or misconduct of agents or attorneys-in-fact selected 
with reasonable care.  

		9.12.  Reliance on Documents.  Agent shall be entitled to rely 
upon (a) any paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to 
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons and (b) upon the 
opinion of its counsel with respect to legal matters.  

		9.13.  Agent's Rights as a Bank.  With respect to its share of the 
indebtedness hereunder, Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder 
as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent.  Each 
of the Banks may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in 
any kind of banking or trust business with Borrowers as if it were not Agent 
or a Bank hereunder.  

		9.14.  Expenses.  Each of the Banks shall reimburse Agent, from 
time to time at the request of Agent, for its share of any expenses incurred 
by Agent, based on such Bank's Pro Rata Share of all Loans, in connection with 
the performance of its functions hereunder (excluding, however, unless an 
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs 
and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder), 
provided however that in the event Banks shall reimburse Agent for expenses 
for which Borrowers subsequently reimburse Agent, Agent shall remit to each 
Bank the respective amount received from such Bank against such expenses, and 
provided further, that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the 
extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent.

		9.15.  Resignation of Agent.  Agent may at any time resign its 
position as Agent, without affecting its position as a Bank, by giving written 
notice to Banks and Borrowers.  The Borrowers and Required Banks may at any 
time request that Agent resign its position as Agent and Agent agrees to so 
resign in accordance with the provisions hereof.  Any such resignation shall 
take effect upon the appointment of a successor agent in accordance with this


     


Paragraph.  In the event Agent shall resign, Banks shall appoint a Bank as 
successor agent, which successor Agent shall be subject to the approval of 
Borrowers.  If within thirty (30) days of the Agent's notice of resignation no 
successor agent shall have been appointed by Banks and approved by Borrowers 
and accepted such appointment, then Agent, in its discretion may appoint any 
other Bank as a successor agent.

		9.16.  Successor Agent.  The successor Agent appointed pursuant to 
Paragraph 9.15 shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and Banks an 
instrument in writing accepting such appointment, and thereupon such 
successor, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully 
vested with all the properties, rights, duties and obligations of its 
predecessor Agent.  The predecessor Agent shall deliver to its successor Agent 
forthwith all collateral security, documents and moneys held by it as Agent, 
if any, whereupon such predecessor Agent shall be discharged from its duties 
and obligations as Agent under this Agreement.  

		9.17.  Collateral Security.  Agent will hold, administer and 
manage any collateral security pledged from time to time hereunder either in 
its own name or as Agent, but each Bank shall hold a direct, undivided 
beneficial interest therein, on the basis of its share of the indebtedness 
outstanding hereunder, by reason of and as evidenced by this Agreement, in 
accordance with Paragraph 9.1 hereof.  

		9.18.  Enforcement by Agent.  All rights of action under this 
Agreement and under the Notes and all rights to the collateral security, if 
any, hereunder may be enforced by Agent and any suit or proceeding instituted 
by Agent in furtherance of such enforcement shall be brought in its name as 
Agent without the necessity of joining as plaintiffs or defendants any other 
Banks, and the recovery of any judgment shall be for the benefit of Banks 
subject to the expenses of Agent.

	SECTION 10

	MISCELLANEOUS
      -------------

		10.1.  Indemnification and Release Provisions.  Borrowers hereby 
agree to defend Agent and each Bank and their respective directors, officers,

any and all losses, liabilities (including without limitation settlement costs 
and amounts, transfer taxes, documentary taxes, or assessments or charges made 
by any governmental authority), claims, damages, interest judgments, costs, or 
expenses, including without limitation fees and disbursements of counsel, 
incurred by any of them arising out of or in connection with or by reason of 
this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitment, or the making of the Loans, 
including without limitation, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, 
damages, interests, judgments, costs or expenses relating to or arising under


     


any Environmental Control Statute or the application of any such Statute to 
any Borrower's or a Subsidiary's properties or assets.  All obligations 
provided for in this Paragraph 10.1 shall survive any termination of this 
Agreement or the Revolving Credit Commitment and the repayment of the Loans.  

		10.2.  Participations and Assignments.  Borrowers hereby 
acknowledge and agree that a Bank may at any time: (a) grant participations in 
all or any portion of the amount of the Loans or any Note or of its right, 
title and interest therein or in or to this Agreement (collectively, 
"Participations") to any other lending office or to any other bank, lending 
institution or other entity which has the requisite sophistication to evaluate 
the merits and risks of investments in Participations ("Participants"); 
provided, however, that:  (i) all amounts payable by Borrowers hereunder shall 
be determined as if such Bank had not granted such Participation; and (ii) any 
agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant a Participation:  (x) shall 
provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to 
enforce the obligations of Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, 
the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provisions 
of this Agreement; (y) may provide that such Bank will not agree to any 
modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement without the consent of the 
Participant if such amendment, modification or waiver would reduce the 
principal of or rate of interest on the Loans or postpone the date fixed for 
any payment of principal of or interest on the Loans; and (z) shall not 
relieve such Bank from its obligations, which shall remain absolute, to make 
Advances hereunder; and (b) assign all or any portion of its rights under the 
Loans with the prior written consent of the Agent and Borrowers together with 
the payment to the Agent of a $2,000 transfer fee.

		10.3.  Binding and Governing Law.  This Agreement and all 
documents executed hereunder shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and 
shall be governed as to their validity, interpretation and effect by the laws 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  

		10.4.  Survival.  All agreements, representations, warranties and 
covenants of Borrowers contained herein or in any documentation required 
hereunder shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the making of the 
Loans hereunder and except for Paragraphs 5.9 and 10.1 which provide 
otherwise, will continue in full force and effect as long as any indebtedness 
or other obligation of Borrowers to any Bank remains outstanding. 

		10.5.  No Waiver; Delay.  If Banks or any of them shall waive any 
power, right or remedy arising hereunder or under any applicable law, such 
waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver upon any other Bank or the later 
occurrence or recurrence of any of said events with respect to any Bank.  No 
delay by Banks in the exercise of any power, right or remedy shall, under any 
circumstances, constitute or be deemed to be a waiver,  express or implied, of


     


the same and no course of dealing between the parties hereto shall constitute 
a waiver of Banks' powers, rights or remedies.  The remedies herein provided 
are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.  

		10.6.  Modification; Waiver.  No modification or waiver of any 
provision of this Agreement or any Note, nor any consent to any departure by 
Borrowers herefrom or therefrom, shall in any case be effective unless the 
same be in writing, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in 
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.  No notice 
to or demand on Borrowers in any case shall entitle Borrowers to any other or 
further notice or demand in any similar or other circumstances.

		10.7.  Headings.  The various headings in this Agreement are 
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or 
interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, 
such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, provided however 
that such extension of time shall be included in the computation of interest 
due in conjunction with such payment or other fees due hereunder, as the case 
may be.  

		10.10.  Time of Day.  All time of day restrictions imposed herein 
shall be calculated using Agent's local time.  

		10.11.  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the 
application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be invalid or 
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the 
application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be 
affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by 
law.  


     


		10.12.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any 
number of counterparts with the same effect as if all the signatures on such 
counterparts appeared on one document, and each such counterpart shall be 
deemed to be an original.

		10.13.  Withholding Taxes Clause.  All amounts payable under this 
Agreement, whether principal, interest or otherwise, shall be paid in full, 
free and clear of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, 
charges, fees or withholdings and without set-off or counterclaim or any 
restriction or condition or deduction whatsoever.  If Borrowers or any of them 
are compelled by law to make any deduction or withholding, it or they will 
ensure that the same does not exceed the minimum liability therefor and will 
promptly pay Agent (for the benefit of Banks) such additional amount as will 
result in the net amount received by Banks being equal to the full amount 
which would have been receivable had there been no deduction or withholding.

		10.14.  Currency Conversion Clause.

			(a)	If any amount due from Borrowers under this Agreement 
or any order or judgment given or made in relation hereto has to be converted 
from United States currency or Canadian currency (as the case may be) (the 
"first currency") in which the same is payable hereunder or under such order 
or judgment into another currency (the "second currency") for the purpose of 
(i) making or filing a claim or proof against Borrowers, (ii) obtaining an 
order or judgment in any court or other tribunal, or (iii) enforcing any order 
or judgment given or made in relation hereto, Borrowers hereby undertake to 
indemnify Banks from and against any loss suffered as a result of any 
discrepancy between (a) the rate of exchange used for such purpose to convert 
the amount in question from the first currency into the second currency and 
(b) the rate or rates of exchange of which Banks may in the ordinary course of 
business purchase the first currency with the second currency upon receipt of 
an amount paid to it in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any such order, 
judgment, claim or proof.

			(b)	Any such conversion shall be made at the buying spot 
rate of exchange at which Banks could purchase the first currency with the 
second currency at the close of business on the day before the day on which 
the judgment is given at the place where such court is located.  If there is a 
change in such rate of exchange prevailing between the day before the judgment 
is given and the date of payment thereof, Borrowers agree to pay such 
additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid 
on such date is the amount in the second currency which, when converted into 
the first currency at such rate of exchange in effect on the date of payment, 
is the amount then due under this Agreement in the first currency.



     


			(c)	Any amount due from Borrowers under this Paragraph 
10.14 will be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by or merged 
into any judgment being obtained for any other amounts due under or in respect 
of this Agreement.  In no event, however, shall Borrowers be required to pay 
more in the first currency at such rate of exchange when payment is made than 
the amount of the first currency stated to be due hereunder, so that in any 
event Borrowers' obligations hereunder will be effectively maintained as 
obligations in the first currency.

		10.15.  Submission to Jurisdiction.
                    --------------------------

			(a)	Borrowers hereby irrevocably submit to the 
jurisdiction of any Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Federal court sitting in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, over any action or proceeding arising out of or 
relating to this Agreement.  VWR Canada, Scientific Holdings and VWR 
International each hereby irrevocably appoint VWR (the "Process Agent"), as 
its agent to receive on its behalf service of copies of summons and complaints 
and any other process which may be served in any action or proceeding arising 
hereunder.  Such service may be made by mailing or delivering a copy of such 
process by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to VWR Canada, 
Scientific Holdings or VWR International, as the case may be, in care of VWR 
at its address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement, and VWR Canada, 
Scientific Holdings and VWR International each hereby irrevocably authorizes 
and directs the Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf.  Borrowers 
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be 
conclusive, subject to appellate relief, and may be enforced in other 
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

			(b)	Nothing in this Paragraph 10.15 shall affect the right 
of Banks to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect 
the right of Banks to bring any action or proceeding against Borrowers or any 
of its or their properties in the courts of other jurisdictions to the extent 
otherwise permitted by law.  

			(c)	To the extent that Borrowers have or hereafter may 
acquire (i) any immunity from jurisdiction of any court of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania or any federal court sitting in Philadelphia, PA or from any 
legal process out of any such court (whether through service or notice, 
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or 
otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, or (ii) any objection to 
the laying of the venue or of an inconvenient forum of any suit, action or 
proceeding, if brought in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Federal court 
sitting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under process served in accordance with 
subparagraph 

(a) above, Borrowers hereby irrevocably waive such immunity or objection in 
respect of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement or the Loans


     

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement the day 
and year first above written.

                                  ----------

                                  AGREEMENT
                                  ---------

	AGREEMENT between VWR Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the 
"Corporation"), and Philip B. Hunsucker ("Vice President") dated as of 
December 13, 1993.

                                  RECITALS
                                  --------

	A.  The Vice President is an executive of the Corporation and an 
integral part of its management.

	B.  The Corporation wishes to assure both itself and the Vice President 
of continuity of management in the event of any actual or threatened change in 
control of the Corporation.

	C.  This Agreement is not intended to alter the compensation and 
benefits that the Vice President could reasonable expect in the absence of the 
occurrence of a Trigger Date as defined in this Agreement; consequently, this 
Agreement will be operative only upon the Vice President's termination during 
the term of this Agreement after the occurrence of a Trigger Date.

	NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:

	1.  Term of Agreement.  The effective date of this Agreement is December 
13, 1993.  This Agreement shall remain in effect until December 13, 1995, 
except that if a Trigger Date, as defined in paragraph 2, occurs prior to 
December 13, 1995, this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to all 
rights accruing as a result of the occurrence of the Trigger Date.

	2.  Operation of Agreement - Trigger Date.  The provisions of this 
Agreement shall become operative the day before each "Trigger Date" which 
occurs during the term of this Agreement. For purposes of defining "Trigger 
Date," the following terms are incorporated by reference to the Corporation's 
Restated Certificate of Incorporation as executed on July 10, 1987 (the 
"Certificate"):  "Affiliate," "Associate," "Board of Directors," "40% 
Shareholder," "Major Transaction," "Person," "Voting Power," and "Voting 
Stock" as well as the other definitions in the Certificate which are utilized 
in defining the foregoing terms.  Any of the following shall constitute a 
Trigger Date:

		a.  the effective date of a "Major Transaction" which is subject 
to and satisfied the special voting requirement set forth in Article VIII, 
Section I, of the Certificate.

		b.  the completion of a tender or exchange offer for Voting Stock 
(other than a tender offer by the Corporation) which is accepted by the 
holders of 51% of the Voting Power of the outstanding Voting Stock


     

		c.  the effective date of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, 
or dissolution in which the Corporation is not the surviving entity; or 

		d.  the date on which there is a "Significant Change" in the 
membership of the Board of Directors occurring by the third annual meeting 
after the effective date of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or a 
Major Transaction or the date on which any Person becomes a 40% Shareholder 
(each of which is referred to as a "Significant Event").  A Significant Change 
in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to have occurred if one-third or 
more of the directors are individuals who (i) are or were Affiliates or 
Associates of the 40% Shareholders or any party to the Significant Event and 
(ii) were not Affiliates or Associates of the Corporation prior to the 
Significant Event.

	3.  Termination of Employment.  If, during the term of this Agreement, 
there is a termination of the Vice President's employment after a Trigger 
Date, the Vice President shall have the right to receive compensation and 
benefits described in paragraphs 4 and 5.  The term "termination of the Vice 
President's employment," for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean 
resignation or termination of the Vice President for any reason other than 
cause, the Vice President has reached age 65, death, or disability if the 
disability is covered by the Corporation's long-term disability plan.  The 
term "cause" shall mean gross misconduct in connection with the Vice  
President's position in the Corporation which results in demonstrably material 
injury to the Corporation.  Bad judgment or negligence shall not constitute 
gross misconduct nor shall any act or omission reasonably believed by the Vice 
President to have been in, or not opposed to, the interests of the 
Corporation.

	4.  Compensation.  Subject to the provisions of Section 8, if there is a 
termination of the Vice President's employment on or before 24 months after a 
Trigger Date, the Vice President shall have the right to receive the 
compensation described in this paragraph during the compensation period even 
if the Vice President is employed by another employer during that period. The 
term "compensation period" shall mean the period between the Vice President's 
termination date and 24 months after such Trigger Date; except if the period 
is less than 12 months, then the compensation period shall be 12 months.  In 
no event shall the compensation period extend beyond the end of the month in 
which the Vice President reaches 65 years of age.  During the compensation 
period, the Vice President shall continue to receive his annual salary, 
payable at the same time and in the same manner as it was paid immediately 
prior to his termination.  The term "annual salary" shall mean the annual 
salary being paid the Vice President immediately before his termination 
determined prior to any deductions from salary:

		a.  for salary reductions or deferrals under any plan of the 
Corporation,

		b.  for payment of employee benefits under any plan of the 
Corporation which are charged to the Vice President, and



     


		c.  for the purchase of stock under any plan of the Corporation.

	In addition, the Vice President shall receive his target bonus (as 
determined under the bonus plan last in effect for the Vice President) for the 
fiscal year in which the Vice President terminated at the time that such bonus 
was paid in the previous year.  The same bonus shall be paid on the same month 
and day in any succeeding year which occurs within the compensation period.  
Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph, if the Vice President's 
annual salary and target bonus is less than the average of the Vice 
President's gross compensation for the three calendar years prior to the Vice 
President's termination date, the Vice President shall receive, in monthly 
payments, such average annual gross compensation during the compensation 
period instead of his salary and target bonus.  The term "gross compensation" 
shall mean compensation as reported on the Vice President's Federal Income Tax 
Withholding Statement (Form W-2) plus (i) any salary reductions or deferrals 
under any plan of the Corporation, (ii) any amounts paid for employee benefits 
under any plan of the Corporation which are charged to the Vice President, and 
(iii) any amounts charged to the Vice President for the purchase of stock 
under any plan of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Agreement, if the aggregate present value of the payments to or for the 
benefit of the Vice President under this Section and Section 5 equals or 
exceeds three times the "base amount," as such term is defined in Internal 
Revenue Code (the "Code") Section 280G, such that no deduction would be 
allowed under that Section, the payments under this Section and Section 5 
shall be reduced so that the aggregate present value of such payments shall 
total $100.00 less than three times the base amount.  The purpose of such 
reduction is to ensure that the payments to the Vice President will not 
constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of the Code Section 
280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) as presently in effect.  The Vice President shall have the 
right (but shall not be required) to receive the benefit of any amendments to 
the Code Section 280G which increase the amount that may be received without 
loss of the deduction to the Corporation.

	5.  Benefits.  Subject to the provision of  Section 8, if there is a 
termination of the Vice President's employment on or before 24 months after a 
Trigger Date, the Vice President shall continue to be treated during the 
compensation period as an "employee" under all stock option, purchase, or 
acquisition plans in effect on his termination date; however, no new stock or 
option awards shall be granted after the Vice President's termination date.  
The Vice President, his dependents, beneficiaries and/or estate shall continue 
to be entitled to all benefits under medical, dental, life insurance, and 
similar plans (except for any disability plan) which are in effect on the Vice 
President's termination date.  If by reason of law or government regulation or 
third-party contractual restriction the Vice President, his dependents, 
beneficiaries, and/or estate cannot receive or participate in a benefit, the 
Corporation shall, to the extent necessary, pay or provide for payment of such 
benefit to the Vice President, his dependents, beneficiaries, and/or estate in 
the same amount and manner as they would have been provided by the plan.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Vice President is employed by another 
employer, the Corporation shall not provide any medical, dental, life 
insurance, and similar benefit to the extent it is provided by the employer. 


     


The Vice President shall not continue to participate in the VWR Corporation 
Retirement Plan, the VWR Tax Savings Plan, or in any other plan described in 
the Code Section 401(a) after his termination date nor shall the Corporation 
provide equivalent benefits.  It is also understood that under present law an 
incentive stock option would have to be exercised no later than three months 
after termination of employment.

	6.  Restricted Stock Award - Indemnification of Vice President.  The 
Board of Directors has determined, in its best judgment, that the receipt of 
stock by the Vice President under a Restricted Stock award or plan sponsored 
by the Corporation, including a stock option plan, will represent "reasonable 
compensation" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) for services rendered 
by the Vice President prior to the Vice President's termination.  The 
foregoing notwithstanding, the Corporation agrees that it shall indemnify the 
Vice President against any excise tax payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the 
Code by reason of his termination and the receipt of stock under a Restricted 
Stock Award.  Such indemnity shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the 
compounding effect of the possible inclusion of the indemnity in any amount 
determined to be an "excess parachute payment."

	7.  Effect of Death.  In the event of the death of the Vice President 
during the Compensation Period, the compensation under paragraph 4 for the 
month in which death occurs shall be paid to the Vice President's estate and 
the Compensation Period shall be deemed to have ended as of the close of 
business on the last day of the month in which the death occurred.  Coverage 
of the Vice President and any dependents under any plan described in paragraph 
5 shall also end on such date.  Nothing in this paragraph shall affect 
payments due in respect of the 
Vice President's death.

	8.  Non-Competition and Confidentiality.  The Vice President agrees 
that:

		a.  There shall be no obligation on the part of the Corporation to 
provide any further payments or benefits (other than benefits or payments 
already earned or accrued) described in Sections 4 and 5 if, during the 
compensation period, the Vice President shall be employed by or otherwise 
engage or be interested in any business which is competitive with any business 
of the Corporation or of any of its subsidiaries in which the Vice President 
was engaged during his employment prior to a termination and if, but only if, 
such employment or activity is likely to cause or causes serious damage to the 
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; and

		b.  During and after the compensation period, the Vice President 
will not divulge or appropriate to the Vice President's own use or the use of 
others any secret or confidential information or knowledge pertaining to the 
business of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries obtained during his 
employment by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.



     


	The Board of Directors has determined, in its best judgment, that the 
payments to the Vice President under Sections 4 and 5 are reasonable 
consideration for not competing as defined in paragraph a and for maintaining 
the confidentiality of information as provided in paragraph b.

	9.  Arbitration of All Disputes.  Any controversy or claim arising out 
of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by 
arbitration in the City of Philadelphia in accordance with the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by three arbitrators, one of whom shall be 
appointed by the Corporation, one by the Vice President, and the third of whom 
shall be appointed by the first two arbitrators.  The arbitration shall be 
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration 
Association, except with respect to the selection of arbitrators which shall 
be as provided in this Section 9.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the 
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  In the 
event it shall be necessary or desirable for the Vice President to retain 
legal counsel and/or incur other costs and expenses in connection with the 
enforcement of any and all of the Vice President's rights under this 
Agreement, the Corporation shall pay the Vice President's reasonable 
attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the enforcement of his 
said rights (including the enforcement of any arbitration award in court) 
regardless of the final outcome, unless the arbitrators shall determine that 
under the circumstances recovery by the Vice President of all or part of any 
such fees, costs, and expenses would be unjust.

	10.  Notices.  Any notices, requests, demands, and other communications 
provided by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if sent by 
registered or certified mail to the Vice President at the last address he has 
filed in writing with the Corporation or, in the case of the Corporation, at 
its principal executive offices.

	11.  Non-Alienation.  The Vice President shall not have any right to 
pledge, hypothecate, anticipate, or in any way create a lien upon any amounts 
provided under this Agreement; and no benefits payable hereunder shall be 
assignable in anticipation of payment either by voluntary or involuntary acts 
or by operations of law.

	12.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed 
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

	13.  Amendments.  This Agreement may not be changed, waived, or 
discharged orally but only by an instrument in writing, signed by the party 
against which enforcement of such change, waiver, or discharge is sought.

	14.  Successors.  This Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the 
Corporation, its successors, and assigns.  For purposes of this Agreement, 
unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Corporation 
shall include its subsidiaries and affiliated persons.



     


	15.  Severability.  In the event that any provision or portion of this 
Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, 
the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and 
shall remain in full force and effect.

	16.  Headings.  The headings of the paragraphs in this Agreement are 
solely for convenience or reference and shall not control the meaning or 
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.
