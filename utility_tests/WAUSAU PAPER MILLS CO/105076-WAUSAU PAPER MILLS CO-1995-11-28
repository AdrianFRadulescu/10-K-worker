 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

 NATURE OF THE BUSINESS

 The company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin in 1899,
 manufactures and sells paper.  The company is organized into a small corporate
 staff consisting of principal executive officers and two operating divisions:
 the Printing and Writing Division consisting of a paper and pulp mill in
 Brokaw, Wisconsin and Wausau Papers of New Hampshire, Inc., a wholly-owned
 subsidiary which operates a paper mill in Groveton, New Hampshire; and the
 Rhinelander Division which consists of Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc., a
 wholly-owned subsidiary operating a paper mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.  The
 company's executive offices are located in Wausau, Wisconsin.

 The company's export sales are administered through Wausau Papers
 International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary which acts as a foreign sales
 corporation (FSC).

 Unless stated otherwise, the terms "company" and "Wausau Papers" mean the
 company and its subsidiaries.

 SEGMENT INFORMATION

 Paper manufacturing is the company's only line of business.

 PRINTING AND WRITING DIVISION

 The Printing and Writing Division manufactures fine printing, writing and
 specialty papers at the Brokaw, Wisconsin and Groveton, New Hampshire mills.
 The division's product lines include recycled products made with 20% of the
 total fiber content from post-consumer waste.  These papers are sold to paper
 distributors and converters throughout the United States and Canada.  Typical
 end uses for these fine papers include printed advertising, corporate external
 reports, office papers and converted products such as announcements and
 greeting card envelopes.

 The Printing and Writing Division was formed in 1993 by combining the
 operations of the company's Brokaw Division and the manufacturing facilities
 at Groveton, New Hampshire.  The Groveton facilities were purchased from James
 River Corporation on April 1, 1993, by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary,
 Wausau Papers of New Hampshire, Inc.


 RHINELANDER DIVISION

 The Rhinelander Division, located in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, manufactures
 lightweight, dense, technical specialty papers which are sold directly to
 converters and end users throughout the United States.  International markets
 for Rhinelander's products include Canada, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Mexico,
 Central and South America.  Typical end uses for these papers are pressure
 sensitive products, silicone coated products, medical packaging, food
 packaging and multiple laminated products.  Small volumes of yeast and
 lignosulfonates are also manufactured.  These products are sold for use as
 food additives, pet food ingredients and for other end uses.
 <PAGE>
 EXPORT SALES

 Wausau Papers International, Inc. has been the commissioned sales agent for
 the export sales of the company since September 1, 1992.  Wausau Papers
 International, Inc. has elected to be treated as a FSC for federal income tax
 purposes.

 RAW MATERIALS

 Pulp is the basic raw material for paper production.  Approximately 60% of the
 pulp consumed by the Brokaw mill is manufactured internally from aspen, which
 is in abundant supply.  The remaining 40% of required pulp at Brokaw and all
 of the required pulp at the Rhinelander and Groveton mills is purchased from
 pulp mills throughout the United States and Canada.  Although pulp prices
 increased approximately 70% in 1995 due to strong demand, purchased pulp is in
 adequate supply and readily obtained from both domestic and foreign sources.

 Recycled, de-inked fiber with a high content of post-consumer waste is also
 purchased from domestic suppliers as part of the fiber requirements for the
 Printing and Writing Division's recycled products.  Recycled fiber is also in
 adequate supply and readily obtained.

 Various chemicals are used in the pulping and papermaking processes.  These
 industrial chemicals are all available from a number of suppliers and are
 purchased at current market prices.

 ENERGY

 The company's paper mills require large amounts of electrical energy and steam
 which are adequately supplied by public utilities or generated at company
 operated facilities.  The Brokaw mill operates a power plant which provides
 all of the mill's steam requirements.  The power plant is fueled by natural
 gas, which is in adequate supply, with fuel oil being an alternate energy
 source.  The Brokaw mill purchases 100% of its electrical requirements from a
 public utility company.  The Groveton mill operates a power plant which
 provides 100% of the mill's steam requirements and a portion of its electrical
 needs.  The primary fuels burned at Groveton are wood chips and fuel oil.  The
 Rhinelander Division maintains a coal burning plant capable of generating the
 mill's steam needs and nearly half of its electrical needs.  The Groveton and
 Rhinelander mills purchase nearly 85% and 60% of their electrical needs,
 respectively, from public utility companies.  The fuels used at each mill are
 all available on a contract basis at prevailing market prices.

 On July 21, 1995, Rhinelander Paper Company and Wisconsin Public Service
 Corporation (WPS) issued a joint press release announcing cancellation of
 plans to build the Rhinelander Energy Center cogeneration power plant in the
 City of Rhinelander.  The two companies were unable to agree upon several
 fundamental issues arising during the regulatory approval process.  As stated
 in the joint announcement, "following an in-depth financial analysis and a
 lengthy negotiation process, Rhinelander Paper Company decided it was not
 feasible to continue and decided to terminate the negotiations."  The company
 has purchased a 200,000 pound per hour natural gas and oil-fired boiler which
 is scheduled for installation in December 1995 as part of a paper production
 capacity expansion.  Rhinelander's existing coal-fired boilers together with
 the new gas and oil-fired boiler are expected to meet the mill's energy
 requirements for the next several years.  The company is developing a plan for
 meeting the long range energy needs of the Rhinelander mill.
 <PAGE>
 PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

 The company develops and files trademarks and patents, as appropriate.  The
 company does not own or hold material licenses, franchises or concessions.

 SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
 The markets for some of the grades of paper produced by the company tend to be
 somewhat seasonal.  However, the marketing seasons for these grades are not
 necessarily the same.  Overall, the company generally experiences lower sales
 in the second fiscal quarter, in comparison to the rest of the year, primarily
 due to downtime typically taken by its customers during the holiday season.

 WORKING CAPITAL

 As is customary in the paper industry, the company carries adequate amounts of
 raw materials and finished goods inventory to facilitate the manufacture and
 rapid delivery of paper products to its customers.

 MAJOR CUSTOMERS

 Avery Dennison Corporation accounted for 12.0% of consolidated net sales in
 fiscal 1995.  The loss of this customer could have an initial material adverse
 effect; however, the company believes that satisfactory alternative marketing
 arrangements could be made.

 BACKLOG

 Order backlog of the company's products at August 31, 1995 amounted to
 approximately $24,981,000, or approximately 2 weeks of operation.  This is 16%
 lower on a tonnage basis than the backlog of orders of approximately
 $25,672,000 or nearly 3 weeks of operation at August 31, 1994.  The backlog
 decrease is due to reduced demand for the company's technical specialty
 grades.  Customer demand improved somewhat at the end of fiscal 1995, which
 the company expects to continue in fiscal 1996.

 Backlog totals are not a true indicator of the strength of the company's
 business activity.  A significant and growing volume of orders are shipped out
 of inventory promptly upon order receipt.  This portion of the business is not
 reflected in the company's backlog totals.  The entire August 31, 1995 backlog
 is expected to be shipped during fiscal 1996.

 COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

 The company competes in different markets within the paper industry.  Each of
 its two divisions serves distinct market niches.  The Printing and Writing
 Division produces fine printing and writing papers, of which over 60% are
 colored papers.  Fine printing and writing sales are estimated to be less than
 3% of the total market.  The division's competitors range from small to large
 paper manufacturers and represent many different product lines.  The division
 distributes its products primarily through paper wholesalers.  The Rhinelander
 Division produces technical specialty papers and is a leader in its markets.
 Rhinelander's market position varies by product segment and, thus, competition
 also includes small to large paper manufacturers.  Rhinelander sells its
 products directly to converters and end users.  The various markets for the
 products of the company are highly competitive, with competition based on
 service, quality and price.
 <PAGE>
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 Expenditures for product development were approximately $1,219,000 in 1995,
 $1,158,000 in 1994, and $957,000 in 1993.

 ENVIRONMENT

 Wausau Papers, like its competitors in the paper industry, is subject to
 increasingly stringent environmental regulations.  The company has made
 substantial capital investments and operating expenditures in order to
 construct, maintain and operate the facilities necessary to maintain
 compliance with environmental regulations.  The company is currently
 rebuilding and expanding the wastewater treatment plant for the Brokaw mill
 and expects to complete the project in fiscal 1997 at a total cost of $14.5
 million.  The company estimates that its capital expenditures for other
 environmental purposes will be less than $5 million per year in fiscal 1996
 and 1997.

 The company has not been identified as a potentially responsible party at any
 site designated for remedial action under the federal Superfund law.  The
 company is required to monitor conditions relative to its past waste disposal
 activities and may be required to take remedial action if conditions are
 discovered which warrant such action.

 The United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed air and
 water pollution reduction standards which could require significant
 expenditures by the pulp and paper industry.  The final rules are expected to
 be promulgated within the next calendar year and to require compliance three
 years after promulgation.  One major aspect of the proposed new regulations is
 extremely stringent standards for the discharge of chlorinated organics that
 are produced as byproducts of pulp bleaching processes that use elemental
 chlorine or chlorine compounds.  The company maintains pulp bleaching
 operations only at its Brokaw mill.  In 1988, the company installed an oxygen
 delignification system which eliminated the use of elemental chlorine;
 however, chlorine compounds are used in other stages of the bleaching process.
 The company is unable to predict with certainty the amount of capital
 expenditures and operating costs that it will incur in the future in order to
 comply with the proposed new EPA rules and other environmental regulations but
 it believes that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on its
 financial position or results of operations.

 EMPLOYEES

 The company had 1,722 employees at August 31, 1995.  The company has
 collective bargaining contracts with the United Paperworkers International
 Union covering approximately 1,335 employees.  These contracts expire in
 December 1995, May 1996 and March 1997 at the Rhinelander, Brokaw and Groveton
 mills, respectively.  The company considers its relationship with its
 employees to be excellent.  Eligible employees participate in retirement plans
 and group life, disability and medical insurance programs.

 ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

 The company's executive offices are located in Wausau, Wisconsin on property
 leased to the company under a lease which expires on December 31, 2005.  There
 are renewal options for another 25 years.

 The company's Brokaw, Wisconsin mill operated at 2% below capacity during
 fiscal 1995 as a result of capital improvement related outages, producing
 approximately 450 tons of finished paper per day.  The mill facility provides
 approximately 60% of its pulp requirements from its own hardwood sulphite pulp
 mill.  Brokaw mill facilities are situated on approximately 270 acres of land,
 all owned by the company.

 The Groveton, New Hampshire mill operated at 96% of capacity in fiscal 1995,
 producing approximately 276 tons of finished paper per day.  At capacity, the
 Groveton mill can produce over 100,000 tons of finished paper annually.  The
 <PAGE> company's facilities occupy 124 acres of land all owned by the company's
 wholly-owned subsidiary, Wausau Papers of New Hampshire, Inc.

 The company's mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin operated at 95% of capacity in
 fiscal 1995, producing an average of 385 tons of finished paper per day.  Some
 extended downtime was taken on the four paper machines during the third and
 fourth quarters of fiscal 1995 due to market weakness in its product lines.
 Its facilities, which include a yeast and lignosulfonate processing plant
 capable of producing 21,000 pounds of torula yeast per day, occupy 72 acres of
 land, all owned by Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc.

 The company owns approximately 43,500 acres of timberland in Wisconsin.  The
 company believes the market value of these lands exceeds the August 31, 1995
 book value of $1,494,000.

 Legal proceedings are discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements on page 32 of this report.


 ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

 ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     OVERVIEW

 The company achieved record sales and shipments in fiscal 1995, while earnings
 were lower compared to the prior year.  Net sales were $515.7 million in
 fiscal 1995, up 21% from 1994.  Shipments of 399,300 tons were ahead of last
 year's level by 12%.  Fiscal 1995 net earnings declined 26% to $31.3 million
 compared to fiscal 1994 earnings, before an accounting change, due to higher
 pulp costs and a slowdown in demand for the company's technical specialty
 products.

 The pulp and paper industry experienced continued strong demand throughout
 most of fiscal 1995.  Favorable market conditions and successful marketing of
 the company's printing and writing grades supported full operations at the
 Groveton mill since October 1994.  Strong demand for the company's technical
 specialty grades during the first half of fiscal 1995 was followed by a
 slowdown in demand during the second half of the year, requiring the company
 to take extended downtime at its Rhinelander mill.

 Strong world-wide demand for paper caused continued strong demand for pulp in
 fiscal 1995.  Market pulp prices increased approximately 70% on average in
 1995 over the prior year.  The company was able to implement several paper
 price increases during the year; however, market pressures prevented the
 company from recovering all of the increased pulp costs through higher paper
 prices.  Higher paper prices, increased volume, production improvements and
 cost reduction efforts were not of sufficient magnitude to totally offset the
 negative effect of higher pulp costs on earnings.

     NET SALES

 Net sales for fiscal 1995 were a record $515.7 million, up 20.9% over fiscal
 1994 net sales of $426.5 million.  Fiscal 1993 net sales were $381.8 million.
 Shipments were a record 399,300 tons in 1995, an increase of 12.4% over the
 355,100 tons shipped in 1994.  Shipments were 310,600 tons in 1993.  The
 shipment growth experienced in fiscal 1995 was mainly due to successfully
 marketing the production capacity of the Groveton, New Hampshire mill.
 <PAGE>
 Demand for the company's printing and writing grades was strong in fiscal
 1995, supporting the October 1994 start-up and continued operation of the
 second paper machine at the Groveton mill.  Shipments at the Printing and
 Writing Division increased 23.2% in fiscal 1995 over prior year results.
 Continued growth of the company's printing and writing products is expected in
 fiscal 1996.  The company's Rhinelander Division experienced strong demand for
 its technical specialty products during the first half of fiscal 1995,
 followed by softer customer demand across all of its product lines during the
 second half of the year.  Downtime was taken on all paper machines at the
 Rhinelander mill in the last four months of the fiscal year as a result of the
 market weakness and the need to reduce paper inventories.  Shipments of
 Rhinelander's products were down 3.8% in fiscal 1995 compared to the previous
 year.  Shipments of pressure sensitive products, its largest product segment,
 were down 6.1% over 1994 results.  Some improvement in demand was experienced
 at the end of fiscal 1995 which the company expects to continue in fiscal
 1996.

 Order backlog at August 31, 1995 was $25.0 million, compared to order backlogs
 of $25.7 million and $22.3 million at August 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 The order backlog at August 31, 1995, on a tonnage basis, is 16% lower than at
 the end of fiscal 1994 and 5% below the order backlog at the end of fiscal
 1993.  Order backlog at the end of fiscal 1995 is lower than a year ago due to
 the reduced demand for the company's technical specialty grades.  Backlog
 totals are not an accurate indicator of the company's business strength,
 however, as a significant and growing volume of orders are shipped out of
 inventory promptly upon order receipt.

     GROSS PROFIT

 Gross profit decreased to 15.7% of net sales for fiscal 1995 compared to 22.8%
 for the previous year.  The gross profit margin was 23.3% in fiscal 1993.  The
 reduced gross profit margin in fiscal 1995 compared to the previous year is
 due primarily to higher prices for purchased pulp, the main raw material in
 manufacturing paper, and downtime taken on the paper machines at the
 Rhinelander mill during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1995, due to
 market softness in its product lines.

 In fiscal 1995, market prices for pulp continued their upward spiral, which
 began in January 1994.  Market pulp prices increased approximately 70% on
 average in fiscal 1995.  The average list price of northern bleached softwood
 kraft, a commonly used benchmark pulp grade, increased 55% in 1995, following
 a 4% decline in 1994 and a 5% decrease in 1993.  Price discounting from list
 was experienced in 1995, but to a much lesser extent than in 1994 and 1993.
 The company implemented several paper price increases during fiscal 1995,
 however, market pressures prevented the company from completely offsetting the
 pulp cost increases through higher selling prices.  Despite increased paper
 prices, improved productivity from paper and pulp mill operations and cost
 reduction efforts, including Total Quality Process generated improvements, the
 company was not able to offset the effect of increased pulp costs.

 In October 1995, further pulp price increases took effect, but in varying
 amounts across pulp grades, as demand for pulp may be leveling off due to an
 overall slowing in the paper industry.  As of October 27, 1995, the company
 had not announced any further price increases for its paper products in
 response to the October pulp price increase.   Although pulp and paper price
 increases may not coincide and, historically, paper price increases have
 generally lagged behind pulp price increases, management continues to expect,
 in the longer term, to return to historical per ton margins and renewed profit
 growth momentum.
 <PAGE>
 Production of the company's printing and writing grades increased 22.5% in
 fiscal 1995 over the previous year as the Groveton mill had full production on
 both of its paper machines since October 1994 as compared to operating one
 machine for all of fiscal 1994.  The Brokaw mill operated at 2% below capacity
 in fiscal 1995 as a result of capital improvement related outages while the
 Groveton mill  operated at 96% of capacity.  Production for the Printing and
 Writing Division in 1994 was 12.7% higher than in 1993.

 The Rhinelander mill operated at 83% of capacity in the fourth quarter of
 fiscal 1995 and 95% for the year.  Some extended downtime was taken on all
 paper machines due to market softness in the second half of fiscal 1995.
 Production in 1995 was flat compared to the prior year as productivity gains
 from capital improvements offset the negative impact of the extended machine
 downtime.  Rhinelander's production in 1994 was 5.1% higher than 1993 results.

 Maintenance and repair costs increased $.6 million to $30.2 million in 1995
 from $29.6 million in 1994.  The increase is primarily attributable to the
 operation of the second paper machine at the Groveton mill.  Maintenance and
 repair costs were $28.8 million in 1993.

     LABOR

 The company is currently in the final year of a four-year labor agreement with
 the United Paperworkers International Union at the Rhinelander Division.  The
 agreement expires in December 1995.  The company is also in the final year of
 a five-year labor agreement with the United Paperworkers International Union
 at the Brokaw mill.  This agreement expires in May 1996.   The company is
 currently in the third year of a four-year labor agreement with the United
 Paperworkers International Union at the Groveton mill.  The agreement, which
 expires in March 1997, includes a general wage increase of 2.0% in 1996 and
 increases in employee benefits as part of the agreement.

 The company considers its relationship with its employees to be excellent and
 is of the opinion that it will be able to successfully negotiate new labor
 agreements at the Rhinelander and Brokaw mills in fiscal 1996.

     SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH EXPENSES

 Fiscal 1995 selling, administrative and research expenses were $28.0 million,
 compared to $27.3 million in fiscal 1994 and $26.0 million in fiscal 1993.
 Increased marketing costs associated with new product offerings and full
 operations at the Printing and Writing Division, along with higher expense for
 stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and stock option expenses
 accounted for the increase in fiscal 1995 over the prior year.  Stock
 appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and stock option expense was $.1
 million in 1995, compared to income of $.3 million in 1994 and expense of $1.9
 million in 1993.

     INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME

 Interest income was $.2 million in fiscal 1995, compared to $.1 million in
 fiscal 1994 and less than $.1 million in fiscal 1993.  Interest expense in
 fiscal 1995 totalled $1.7 million, compared to $2.0 million in 1994 and $1.3
 million in 1993.  Lower interest expense in fiscal 1995 is due to higher
 capitalized interest compared to the prior year.  Capitalized interest was $.7
 million in fiscal 1995, $.2 million in 1994, and was $.1 million in 1993.  The
 increase in capitalized interest in fiscal 1995 was due to several major
 capital projects in process, including the capacity expansion project at the
 Rhinelander mill, installation of a fiber handling and processing system at
 <PAGE> the Brokaw mill and upgrades to the wastewater treatment plant at both
 Wisconsin mills.  Other income and expense was $.5 million expense in 1995,
 compared to $.1 million expense in 1994 and $.1 million income in 1993.
 Capital asset disposal losses are the primary reasons for the increase in
 other expense in fiscal 1995.

     INCOME TAXES

 The fiscal 1995 income tax provision was $19.6 million, for an effective tax
 rate of 38.5%.  The effective tax rates for fiscal years 1994 and 1993 were
 38.2% and 37.9%, respectively.

 In fiscal 1994, the company adopted Statement of Accounting Standard (SFAS)
 No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The adoption was reflected as a one-
 time cumulative reduction in the net deferred tax liability resulting in a
 $1.0 million increase in fiscal 1994 net earnings.

     NET EARNINGS

 Net earnings in fiscal 1995 were $31.3 million, compared to fiscal 1994
 earnings of $42.1 million before the cumulative effect of an accounting
 change.  Fiscal 1993 earnings were $38.4 million before the cumulative effect
 of an accounting change.  After including the impact of accounting changes,
 net earnings were $43.1 million in fiscal 1994 and were $22.6 million in
 fiscal 1993.

 In fiscal 1994, the company adopted Statement of Accounting Standard (SFAS)
 No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  This change in accounting resulted in
 a one-time cumulative benefit of $1.0 million in fiscal 1994.  In fiscal 1993,
 the company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
 Benefits Other Than Pensions," resulting in a one-time cumulative reduction to
 net earnings of $15.8 million.


     CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

     LONG-TERM DEBT

 Long-term debt increased $38.3 million in fiscal 1995 to $68.6 million at
 August 31, 1995.  This compares with long-term debt of $30.3 million and $42.7
 million at August 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The increase in long-term
 debt in fiscal 1995 was due mainly to reduced cash flow from operations and
 increased capital spending.  The decrease in long-term debt in fiscal 1994 was
 due primarily to improved cash flow from operations.  Long-term debt as a
 percent of capital increased to 18.0% in 1995, compared to 9.6% in 1994 and
 14.8% in 1993.

 In August 1995, the company obtained $19.0 million in additional financing
 from the issuance of variable rate demand sewage and solid waste revenue bonds
 by a local governmental unit.  This additional borrowing will be used to fund
 the upgrade of the Brokaw mill wastewater treatment plant, the construction of
 a new landfill and several other projects which qualify for this type of
 financing.  Proceeds relating to the bond issuance are held in a trust fund
 until they are drawn upon by the company as spending occurs on these projects.
 At August 31, 1995, the industrial development bond trust fund totalled $14.7
 million.

 Long-term debt at August 31, 1995 consisted primarily of $30.0 million in
 senior promissory notes (less current portion), $14.2 million outstanding
 under the company's revolving credit facility, $8.3 million in commercial
 <PAGE> 
 paper and $19.0 million in industrial development bonds.  This compares with
 borrowings of $30.0 million in senior promissory notes at August 31, 1994.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS

 Cash provided by operations in fiscal 1995 was $47.5 million or 26.6% below
 1994 results of $64.7 million. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 1993 was
 $34.4 million.  The lower operating cash flow in fiscal 1995 compared to the
 prior year was due to higher unit production costs and increased working
 capital needs.  Lower unit production costs in fiscal 1994 and lower working
 capital requirements associated with the Groveton mill accounted for the
 improved operating cash flow in 1994 over the previous year.

     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

 Fiscal 1995 capital expenditures totalled $66.1 million, compared to $43.8
 million in 1994 and $51.3 million in 1993.  Capital expenditures in fiscal
 1993 include the purchase of manufacturing facilities in Groveton, New
 Hampshire for $20.2 million.

 Rhinelander's new $12 million silicone coater commenced operation in the third
 quarter of fiscal 1995.  This solventless coater has the capacity to produce
 15,000 tons of coated release papers for the pressure sensitive label industry
 as well as other end users.  A $46 million expansion project was approved for
 the Rhinelander mill in December 1994 to increase its pressure sensitive
 papermaking capacity.  Work is proceeding on this project, which will include
 a new state-of-the-art supercalender, a duplex rewinder and a major rebuild of
 No. 7 paper machine.  The project will add nearly 38,000 tons of annual
 pressure sensitive backing paper capacity while improving quality.  In
 connection with mix changes, the mill's total annual capacity is expected to
 increase by over 26,000 tons.  This project is expected to be completed in
 early calendar 1996.  Other major projects in process at the Rhinelander mill
 include an upgrade to the mill's wastewater treatment plant and modifications
 to enable the mill to handle, wrap and ship larger diameter rolls.

 Several major projects were completed at the Brokaw mill in fiscal 1995
 including installation of a new gas-fired boiler and feedwater system, a
 rebuild to No. 3 paper machine and improvements to No. 2 paper machine to
 increase productivity and enhance product quality.  Work continues on a $16.4
 million fiber handling and processing project.  This project includes a
 building expansion, additional pulping capacity and a new fiber handling
 system to process more recycled post consumer fiber.  This project is expected
 to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 1996.  In addition, work is
 underway to upgrade the mill's wastewater treatment plant at a cost of over
 $14 million.

 A softwood kraft refining system was installed at the Groveton mill in fiscal
 1995 to improve long fiber refining capabilities, improve sheet formation and
 reduce fiber costs.  Work is underway to add a shrink wrap packaging line and
 install a new centralized starch kitchen.

 At the end of fiscal 1995, the company was committed to spend approximately
 $62 million to complete capital projects currently under construction.
 Capital commitments at the end of 1994 and 1993 were $30 million and $32
 million, respectively.  The majority of the committed spending going into
 fiscal 1996 will be on the Rhinelander expansion project, the fiber handling
 and processing project at the Brokaw mill and upgrades to the wastewater
 treatment plant at both of these mills.
 <PAGE>
 Capital expenditures are expected to increase in fiscal 1996 primarily due to
 spending on these projects currently in process.  The company expects capital
 expenditures to be in excess of $150 million over the next three years,
 including approximately $70 million in fiscal 1996.

     FINANCING

 The company maintains a revolving credit facility agreement with two banks to
 provide loans up to $35 million.  The credit facility will permit the company
 to borrow $35 million through August 1, 1997, at which time, or earlier at the
 company's option, the agreement converts to a four-year term loan, requiring
 equal annual payments of principal.  Interest rates on these borrowings are
 based on bank offered rates, the prime lending rate, certificate of deposit
 rate, treasury rate, or a eurodollar rate.  The credit agreement provides the
 back-up line of credit necessary for the issuance of commercial paper.  The
 company's commercial paper placement agreement, with one of its two major
 banks, provides for the issuance of up to $40 million of unsecured debt
 obligations.  The company had $8.3 million in commercial paper outstanding at
 year end.  On August 31, 1995, a combined total of $12.5 million was available
 for borrowing under the company's credit and commercial paper placement
 agreements.  In a separate agreement, the banks participating in the revolving
 credit facility have provided a $30 million uncommitted line of credit to the
 company.  The company also has available a $2 million short-term line of
 credit.  There was no borrowing against these lines at August 31, 1995.

 In June 1993, the company borrowed $30 million through the issuance of notes
 to Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.  The loan was
 in the form of senior unsecured term notes bearing a fixed interest rate of
 6.03%.  Principal is payable in ten equal semi-annual installments beginning
 in December 1995, with the final payment due in June 2000.  Proceeds from the
 notes were used to reduce borrowings from the revolving credit facility.

 In August 1995, the company obtained $19 million in industrial development
 bond financing to fund the upgrade of the Brokaw mill wastewater treatment
 plant, the construction of a new landfill and several other projects which
 qualify for this type of financing.  The bonds, which were issued by a local
 governmental unit, mature on July 1, 2023 and have a floating interest rate
 commensurate with short-term municipal bond rates on similar issues.  The
 interest rate can be converted to a fixed rate at the option of the company.
 Principal is due upon maturity or earlier at the company's option.  Proceeds
 relating to the bond issuance are held in a trust fund until they are drawn
 upon by the company as spending occurs on these projects.  As of August 31,
 1995, the company utilized $4.3 million from the bond proceeds.

 Cash provided by operations, industrial development bond proceeds and the
 revolving credit facility are expected to meet working capital needs and
 dividend requirements, as well as fund the company's stock repurchase program
 and planned capital expenditure requirements.  The company believes additional
 financing is readily available, should it be needed, to fund a major expansion
 or acquisition.

     COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

 On June 30, 1994, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
 1,485,000 shares of the company's common stock, from time-to-time in the open
 market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market
 prices.  In fiscal 1995, the company repurchased 247,150 shares at market
 prices ranging from $20.688 per share to $21.364 per share.  In fiscal 1994,
 <PAGE>  
 the company repurchased 99,000 shares at market prices ranging from $21.705
 per share to $22.386 per share.  Shares and per share data have been restated
 to reflect the January 1995 10% stock dividend.

     DIVIDENDS

 In fiscal 1995, the Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $.25 per
 share, a 14.6% increase over the $.218 per share declared in fiscal 1994.

          MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING


 The management of Wausau Paper Mills Company is responsible for the integrity
 and objectivity of the financial data contained in the financial statements
 and supporting schedule.  The financial statements and supporting schedule
 have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
 appropriate under the circumstances and, where necessary, reflect informed
 judgments and estimates of the effects of certain events and transactions
 based on currently available information at the date the financial statements
 were prepared.

 The company's management depends on the company's system of internal
 accounting controls to assure itself of the reliability of the financial
 statements.  The internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
 assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are safeguarded and transactions
 are executed in accordance with management's authorizations and recorded
 properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles.  Periodic reviews are made of
 internal controls by management and corrective action is taken if needed.

 The Board of Directors reviews and monitors financial statements through its
 audit committee.  The audit committee meets with the independent public
 accountants and management to review internal accounting controls, auditing
 and financial reporting matters.

 The independent public accountants are engaged to provide an objective and
 independent review of the company's financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted auditing standards and to express an opinion thereon.  The
 report of the company's independent public accountants is included in this
 annual report.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


 NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
 the company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions,
 balances and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

 REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods and
 transfer of title to the customer.  The company grants credit to customers in
 the ordinary course of business.  A substantial portion of the company's
 accounts receivable is with customers in various paper converting industries
 or the paper merchant business.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
 trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their
 geographic dispersion.

 CASH EQUIVALENTS - The company defines cash equivalents as highly liquid,
 short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

 INVENTORIES - Pulpwood, finished paper products and the majority of raw
 materials are valued at the lower of cost, determined on the last-in, first-
 out (LIFO) method, or market.  All other inventories are valued at the lower
 of average cost or market.

 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Plant and equipment are stated at cost and are
 depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-
 line method for financial statement purposes.  The cost and related
 accumulated depreciation of all plant and equipment retired or otherwise
 disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses
 are included in the statements of income.

 Buildings are depreciated over a 25- to 45-year period; machinery and
 equipment over a 4- to 16-year period.  Maintenance and repair costs are
 charged to expense as incurred.  Renewals and improvements which extend the
 useful lives of the assets are added to the plant and equipment accounts.

 Equipment financed by long-term leases, which in effect are installment
 purchases, have been recorded as assets and the related obligations as debt.

 Land is stated at cost.  Timberlands are at cost less the pro rata cost of
 timber harvested since acquisition.  Depletion expense is calculated using the
 block method.

 INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes have been provided under the liability
 method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the
 estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement
 and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the current enacted
 tax rates.  Deferred tax expense is the result of changes in the deferred tax
 asset and liability.  See Note 8 for change in accounting principle in 1994.

 EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per common share are based on the weighted
 average number of common shares outstanding.  Dilution of earnings per common
 share due to common stock equivalents (stock options) is negligible and,
 accordingly, no dilution has been reported.

 Totals                                 $ 68,623   $ 30,270
 </TABLE>
 The company has outstanding $30 million in unsecured senior promissory notes.
 Interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding balance at a rate of 6.03%
 per annum.  Principal is payable in ten equal semi-annual installments
 beginning December 18, 1995, with the final payment due June 16, 2000.

 During 1995, the company borrowed $19 million related to industrial
 development bonds issued by a local governmental unit.  The variable rate
 bonds require quarterly interest payments and had an interest rate of 3.85% at
 August 31, 1995.  The company also pays fees for a bank letter of credit and
 remarketing services related to the bonds which it includes in net interest
<PAGE>
 expense.  The interest rate can be converted to a fixed rate, at the company's
 option, after which semi-annual interest payments will be required.  The bonds
 mature on July 1, 2023.  At August 31, 1995, bond proceeds of $14,732,000 were
 not disbursed and are reflected as an asset on the balance sheet.
 The company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility of $35 million
 with two banks which continues through August 1, 1997 at which time, or
 earlier at the company's option, the revolving credit converts to a term loan
 facility, and the loans then outstanding are payable in four equal annual
 installments.  The company may elect the base for interest from either
 domestic rate loans, eurodollar loans, adjusted CD rate loans, offered loans
 or treasury rate loans.  The weighted average interest rate on borrowings
 under the revolving credit facility was 6.21% at August 31, 1995.  There were
 no borrowings against this agreement at August 31, 1994.  The credit agreement
 provides for commitment fees during the revolving loan period.  Fees are based
 on .125% per annum on the unused portions of the commitment, payable monthly.

 Consistent with the classification of the revolving credit agreement, fixed
 asset payables that will be financed through the agreement are classified as
 long-term debt.

 The senior promissory notes and the revolving credit facility agreement
 require the company to comply with certain covenants, one of which requires
 the company maintain minimum net worth.  At August 31, 1995, $69,950,000 of
 retained earnings was available for payment of cash dividends without
 violation of the minimum net worth covenant related to the senior promissory
 notes.

 The company maintains a commercial paper placement agreement with a bank to
 issue up to $40 million of unsecured debt obligations which requires unused
 credit availability under its revolving credit agreement equal to the amount
 of outstanding commercial paper.  The weighted average interest rate on
 outstanding commercial paper was 6.20% at August 31, 1995.  There were no
 amounts outstanding at August 31, 1994.

 The difference between the book and the fair market value of the long-term
 debt is not material.

 The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are:

 </TABLE>
 Annual maturities will be affected by future borrowings.

 The banks participating in the revolving credit agreement have provided
 separate uncommitted revolving lines of credit to the company in an aggregate
 amount of up to $30 million.  The specific terms of any revolving loans
 borrowed pursuant to these lines of credit will be negotiated at the time of
 the borrowing and any revolving loans so borrowed will be payable on demand.
 In addition, the company has a $2 million line of credit with interest payable
 at the prime rate.  The line does not require a compensating balance or a
 commitment fee.  There was no borrowing against these lines at August 31,
 1995.

 NOTE 5.  LEASE COMMITMENTS

 The company has various leases for real estate, mobile equipment and machinery
 which generally provide for renewal privileges or for purchase at option

 </TABLE>
 Projected benefit obligations were determined using an assumed discount rate
 of 7.5% and an assumed rate of increases in future compensation levels of
 5.0%.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.0%.  Plan
 assets consist principally of publicly traded stocks and fixed income
 securities and include Wausau Paper Mills Company common stock with a market
 value of $1,377,000 in 1995 and $1,854,000 in 1994.

 The company's defined contribution pension plan provides for company
 contributions based on a percentage of employee contributions.  The cost of
 such plans totaled $232,000 in 1995 and $445,000 in 1994, and $420,000 in
 1993.

 The company has deferred compensation or supplemental retirement agreements
 with certain present and past key officers and employees.  The principal cost
 of such plans is being or has been accrued over the period of active
 employment to the full eligibility date.  The annual cost of the deferred
 compensation and supplemental retirement agreements does not represent a
 material amount.

<PAGE>
 In fiscal 1993, the company adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial
 Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
 Benefits Other than Pensions," effective as of September 1, 1992.

 SFAS 106 requires the estimated cost of retiree benefit payments, primarily
 health and life insurance, to be accrued during the employees' active service
 period.  Previously, the cost of these benefits was expensed as paid.  The
 company elected to immediately recognize the accumulated liability as of
 September 1, 1992, which resulted in a one-time noncash charge against
 earnings of $25,000,000 before taxes and $15,750,000 after taxes, or $.53 per
 share (as restated).  In addition, the effect of this change on 1993 operating
 results was to recognize an additional pre-tax expense of $1,590,000 and
 after-tax expense of $987,000, or $.03 per share (as restated).
 <TABLE>

 </TABLE>
 For 1995, the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 11% declining by 1% annually
 for six years to an ultimate rate of 5%.  The weighted average discount rate
 was 7.5%.

 For 1994, the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 12% declining by 1% annually
 for seven years to an ultimate rate of 5%.  The weighted average discount rate
 was 7.5%.

 A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates
 would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
 August 31, by approximately $3,779,000 or 13.1% in 1995 and $3,541,000 or
 12.9% in 1994.  The effect of this change on the aggregate of the service and
 interest cost would be an increase of $416,000 or 14.3% in 1995 and $451,000
 or 14.6% for 1994.

 NOTE 8.  INCOME TAXES

 Effective September 1, 1993, the company adopted the liability method of
 accounting for income taxes prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standard (SFAS) No. 109.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
 based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the
 financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by
 the current enacted tax rates.  Deferred tax expense is the result of changes
 in the deferred tax asset and liability.  Previously, the company used the
 deferral method which provided for deferred income taxes  on the basis of
 income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in
 different periods.

 The company elected to recognize the cumulative effect of the change as of
 September 1, 1993, totaling $1,000,000, as a credit to income in 1994.  The
 effect of the change in method did not have a material effect in 1994.

 NOTE 9.  STOCK OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS

 The company maintains the 1981 and 1991 Employee Stock Option Plans.  Each
 plan specifies purchase price, time and method of exercise.  Payment of the
 option price may be made in cash or by tendering an amount of common stock
 having a fair market value equal to the option price.

 Options are granted for terms up to 20 years, the option price being equal to
 the fair market value of the company's common stock at the date of grant under
 the 1981 plan and for incentive options granted under the 1991 plan.  The
 option price for non-qualified options under the 1991 plan may not be less
<PAGE> 
 than 50% of the fair market value of the company's common stock at the date of
 grant.

 During 1995, 36,850 options were granted under the 1991 Employee Stock Option
 Plan to be earned based upon the satisfaction of operating goals set forth in
 the agreement.  The options terminated when 1995 operating goals were not met.

 During 1992, options were granted under the 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan.
 The options were to be earned over a three-year period based upon the
 satisfaction of operating goals set forth in the agreement.  A total of 97,783
 and 72,358 options terminated in 1994 and 1993, respectively, when operating
 goals were not met.

 The 1988 Management Incentive Plan entitles certain management employees the
 right to receive cash equal to the sum of the appreciation in value of the
 stock and the hypothetical value of cash dividends which would have been paid
 on the stock covered by the grant assuming reinvestment in company stock.  The
 stock appreciation rights granted may be exercised in whole or in such
 installments and at such times as specified in the grant.  In all instances,
 the rights lapse if not exercised within 20 years of the grant date.
 Compensation expense is recorded with respect to the rights based upon the
 quoted market value of the shares and the exercise provisions.

 The company maintains the 1991 Dividend Equivalent Plan.  Participants are
 entitled to receive cash based on the hypothetical value of cash dividends
 which would have been paid on the stock covered by the grant assuming
 reinvestment in company stock.  During 1995, 36,850 dividend equivalents were
 granted under the plan.  The dividend equivalents are earned in the current
 year based upon the satisfaction of operating goals set forth in the
 agreement.  All dividend equivalents granted in 1995 terminated when operating
 goals were not met.

 During 1992, 196,534 dividend equivalents were granted under the plan.  The
 dividend equivalents granted in 1992 and 26,400 of the dividend equivalents
 granted in 1993 were to be earned over a three-year period based upon the
 satisfaction of operating goals set forth in the agreement.  A total of 89,956
 and 72,358 dividend equivalents terminated in 1994 and 1993, respectively,
 when operating goals were not met.

 The pre-tax impact on earnings of all stock options, dividend equivalents and
 stock appreciation rights for the years ended August 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
<PAGE> was expense of $79,000, income of $283,000 and expense of $1,934,000,
 respectively.

 NOTE 10.  RESEARCH EXPENSES

 Research expenses charged to operations were $1,219,000 in 1995, $1,158,000 in
 1994 and $957,000 in 1993.

 NOTE 11.  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 The company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of
 business.  It is the opinion of management that any judgment or settlement
 resulting from pending or threatened litigation would not have a material
 adverse effect on the financial position or on the operations of the company.

 As of August 31, 1995, the company was committed to spend approximately $62
 million to complete capital projects which were in various stages of
 completion.

 In 1993, Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc., a subsidiary of the company, signed
 an agreement with Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) under which
 Rhinelander Paper would become the exclusive steam customer of a high-
 efficiency cogeneration power plant to be constructed, owned and operated by
 WPS.  The arrangement for ownership and operation by WPS was altered during
 the regulatory approval process, making it necessary to negotiate a new
 agreement between WPS and Rhinelander Paper if the project were to proceed.
 The two companies were unable to agree upon several fundamental issues and
 after lengthy negotiations, Rhinelander Paper Company decided it was not
 feasible to continue and terminated further negotiations.  WPS and Rhinelander
 Paper issued a joint press release on July 21, 1995, announcing the
 cancellation of plans to build the cogeneration power plant.

 During fiscal 1994, the company purchased 100,000 shares of the company's no-
 par value common stock from a director in a private transaction at $27.625 per
 share, the average market price on the day of the transaction.

 NOTE 12.  MAJOR CUSTOMERS

 One customer accounted for 12.0% of net sales aggregating $61,732,000, 12.3%
 of net sales aggregating $52,313,000, and 11.2% of net sales aggregating
 $42,812,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
