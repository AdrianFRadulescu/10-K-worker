ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

NATURE OF THE BUSINESS

The company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin in 1899,
manufactures and sells paper.  The company is presently organized into a small
corporate staff consisting of principal executive officers and two operating
divisions:  the Printing and Writing Division consisting of a paper and pulp
mill in Brokaw, Wisconsin and Wausau Papers of New Hampshire, Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary which operates a paper mill in Groveton, New Hampshire; and
the Rhinelander Division which consists of Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary operating a paper mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.  The
company's executive offices are located in Wausau, Wisconsin.

Export sales of the company are administered through Wausau Papers
International, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary which acts as a foreign sales
corporation (FSC).  Wausau Papers Export Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, acted as a domestic international sales corporation (DISC) until
September 1, 1992.

Unless stated otherwise, the terms "company" and "Wausau Papers" mean the
company and its subsidiaries.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Paper manufacturing is the company's only line of business.

PRINTING AND WRITING DIVISION

The Printing and Writing Division manufactures fine printing, writing and
specialty papers at the Brokaw, Wisconsin and Groveton, New Hampshire mills. 
The division's product lines include recycled products made from 50% recycled
fibers, with 10-20% of the total fiber content from post-consumer waste. 
These papers are sold to paper distributors and converters throughout the
United States and Canada.  Typical end uses for these fine papers include
printed advertising, corporate external reports, office papers and converted
products including such items as announcements and greeting card envelopes.

The Printing and Writing Division was created in 1993 by combining the
operations of the company's Brokaw division and the manufacturing facilities
at Groveton, New Hampshire.  The Groveton facilities were purchased from the
James River Corporation on April 1, 1993, by the company's newly formed
wholly-owned subsidiary, Wausau Papers of New Hampshire, Inc.  This purchase
expanded the company's annual printing and writing paper capacity by over
90,000 tons.

RHINELANDER DIVISION

The Rhinelander Division, located in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, manufactures
lightweight, dense, technical specialty papers which are sold directly to
converters and end users.  Typical end uses are pressure-sensitive products,
medical packaging, food packaging
<PAGE>
and multiple laminated products.  Small volumes of yeast and lignosulfonates
are also manufactured.  These products are sold for use as food additives, pet
food ingredients and for other end uses.

EXPORT SALES

Since September 1, 1992, Wausau Papers International, Inc. has acted as the
commissioned sales agent for the export sales of the company.  Wausau Papers
International, Inc. has elected to be treated as a FSC for federal income tax
purposes.

Wausau Papers Export Corporation formerly acted as a commissioned sales agent
for the export sales of the company through August 31, 1992.  Wausau Papers
Export Corporation has elected to be treated as a DISC for federal income tax
purposes.

RAW MATERIALS

The basic raw material for paper is pulp.  Approximately 55% of the pulp
consumed by the Brokaw mill is manufactured internally from aspen, which is in
abundant supply.  The remaining 45% of required pulp at Brokaw and 100% of the
required pulp at the Rhinelander and Groveton mills is purchased from pulp
mills throughout the United States and Canada.  Although prices for purchased
pulp began to increase in fiscal 1994 as market demand for pulp increased,
purchased pulp is in adequate supply and readily obtained from both domestic
and foreign sources.

Recycled, de-inked fiber with a high content of post-consumer waste is also
purchased from domestic suppliers as part of the fiber requirements for the
Printing and Writing Division's recycled products.  Recycled fiber is also in
adequate supply and readily obtained.

Various chemicals are also used in the pulping and papermaking processes. 
These industrial chemicals are all available from a number of suppliers and
are purchased at current market prices.

ENERGY

The company's paper mills require large amounts of electrical energy and steam
which are adequately supplied by public utilities or generated at company
operated facilities.  During fiscal 1994, the natural gas supply to Brokaw,
which fuels the power plant that provides the mill with all its steam
requirements, was available for all operating days, with the exception of a
one week period in January where gas was curtailed due to severe cold weather. 
During this period, the mill fueled its power plant with oil, resulting in
minimal disruption to the mill.  The Brokaw mill purchases 100% of its
electrical requirements from a public utility company.  The Groveton mill
operates a power plant which provides 100% of the mill's steam requirements
and a portion of its electrical needs.  The primary fuels burned at Groveton
are wood chips and fuel oil.  The Rhinelander Division maintains a coal
burning plant capable of generating the mill's steam needs and nearly half of
its electrical needs.  The Groveton and Rhinelander mills purchase
approximately 80% and 55% of their electrical needs, respectively, from public
utility companies.  <PAGE>
The fuels used at each mill are all available on a contract basis at
prevailing market prices.

In August 1993, Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc. and Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation (WPS) entered into a contract under which WPS would own, operate
and fund a high-efficiency cogeneration power plant and Rhinelander would
become the plant's exclusive steam customer for a minimum of 35 years. 
Construction of the 116-mega watt plant requires approval by the Wisconsin
Public Service Commission (the "Commission").  WPS submitted its application
in October 1993.  The Commission subsequently requested competing proposals
from other electrical generation developers and utilities for satisfying the
projected demand for additional electrical energy in the state.  A decision on
project selection, the first phase in the approval process, is expected from
the Commission in November 1994.  If the proposed WPS Rhinelander plant is
selected in the first phase of the process and receives approval to construct
and operate in the second phase, it is anticipated that the project would be
completed and that steam would be available to the company's Rhinelander mill
in 1998.  The power plant is expected to reduce energy costs for Rhinelander
while eliminating the paper mill's need to maintain and replace boiler
equipment in the future.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

The company develops and files trademarks and patents, as appropriate.  The
company does not own or hold material licenses, franchises or concessions.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS

The markets for some of the grades of paper produced by the company tend to be
somewhat seasonal.  However, the marketing seasons for these grades are not
necessarily the same.  Overall, the company generally experiences lower sales
in the second fiscal quarter, in comparison to the rest of the year, primarily
due to downtime typically taken by converters and customers during the holiday
season.  

WORKING CAPITAL

As is customary in the paper industry, the company carries adequate amounts of
raw materials and finished goods inventory to facilitate the manufacture and
rapid delivery of paper products to its customers.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Avery Dennison Corporation accounted for 12.3% of fiscal 1994 consolidated net
sales.  The loss of this customer could have an initial material adverse
effect; however, the company believes that satisfactory alternative marketing
arrangements could be made.

BACKLOG

Order backlog of the company's products amounted to approximately $25,672,000,
representing nearly 3 weeks of operation as of 
<PAGE>
August 31, 1994.  This total is 15.1% higher than the backlog of orders of
approximately $22,307,000 or nearly 3 weeks of operation at August 31, 1993. 
The backlog increase is primarily due to increased demand for the company's
printing and writing and technical specialty grades.

Backlog totals have become a less accurate indicator of the strength of the
company's business activity.  A significant volume of orders at both divisions
are shipped out of inventory promptly upon receipt of the order.  This portion
of the business is not reflected in the backlog totals.  The entire August 31,
1994 backlog is expected to be shipped during fiscal 1995.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

The company competes in different markets within the paper industry.  Each
division serves distinct market niches.  The Printing and Writing Division
produces fine printing and writing papers, of which approximately 70% are
colored papers.  Fine printing and writing sales are estimated to be less than
3% of the total market.  The division's competitors range from small to large
paper manufacturers and represent many different product lines.  The division
distributes its products primarily through paper wholesalers.  Rhinelander
produces technical specialty papers and is a leader in its markets. 
Rhinelander's market position varies by product segment and, thus, competition
also includes small to large paper manufacturers.  Rhinelander sells its
products directly to converters and end users.  The various markets for the
products of the company are highly competitive, with competition based on
service, quality and price.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Expenditures for product development were approximately $1,158,000 in 1994,
$957,000 in 1993 and $868,000 in 1992.

ENVIRONMENT

Wausau Papers, like its competitors in the paper industry, is subject to
increasingly stringent environmental regulations.  The company has made
substantial capital investments and operating expenditures in order to
construct, maintain and operate the facilities necessary to maintain
compliance with environmental regulations.  The company intends to spend $14.5
million over fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997 to rebuild, modernize and expand
the wastewater treatment plant for the Brokaw mill.  The company estimates
that its capital expenditures for other environmental purposes will be
approximately $5 million in each of these fiscal years.

The company has not been identified as a potentially responsible party at any
site designated for remedial action under the federal Superfund law.  The
company is required to monitor conditions relative to its past waste disposal
activities and may be required to take remedial action if conditions are
discovered which warrant such action.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed
regulations which could require significant expenditures by the pulp and paper
industry.  The final rules are expected to <PAGE>
be issued in 1995 and to require compliance in 1998.  One major aspect of the
proposed new rules is extremely stringent standards for the discharge of
chlorinated organics that are produced as byproducts of pulp bleaching
processes that use elemental chlorine or chlorine compounds.  The company
maintains pulp bleaching operations only at its Brokaw mill.  In 1988 the
company installed an oxygen delignification system which eliminated the use of
elemental chlorine; however, chlorine compounds are used in other stages of
the bleaching process.  The company is unable to predict with certainty the
amount of capital expenditures and operating costs that it will incur in the
future in order to comply with the proposed new EPA rules and other
environmental regulations but it believes that such costs will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

The company had 1,695 employees at August 31, 1994.  The company has
collective bargaining contracts with the United Paperworkers International
Union covering approximately 1,314 employees.  These contracts expire in
December 1995, May 1996 and March 1997 at the Rhinelander, Brokaw and Groveton
mills, respectively.  The company considers its relationship with its
employees to be excellent.  Eligible employees participate in retirement plans
and group life, disability and medical insurance programs.

The company's executive offices are located in Wausau, Wisconsin on property
leased to the company under a lease which expires on December 31, 2005.  There
are renewal options for another 25 years.

The company's Brokaw, Wisconsin mill operated at capacity during fiscal 1994,
producing approximately 465 tons of finished paper per day.  The mill facility
provides approximately 55% of its pulp requirements from its own hardwood
sulphite pulp mill.  Brokaw mill facilities are situated on approximately 270
acres of land, all owned by the company.

The company's manufacturing facility in Groveton, New Hampshire was acquired
from James River Corporation on April 1, 1993.  The mill operated at 55% of
capacity in fiscal 1994, producing approximately 140 tons of finished paper
per day.  At capacity, the Groveton mill can produce over 90,000 tons of
finished paper per year.  The company's facilities occupy 124 acres of land
all owned by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Wausau Papers of New
Hampshire, Inc.

Rhinelander's paper mill in Rhinelander, Wisconsin operated at 99% of capacity
in fiscal 1994, producing an average of 384 tons of finished paper per day. 
Its facilities, which include a yeast and lignosulfonate processing plant
capable of producing 21,000 pounds of torula yeast per day, occupy 72 acres of
land, all owned by Rhinelander Paper Company, Inc.

The company owns approximately 43,500 acres of timberland in Wisconsin.  The
company believes the market value of these lands exceeds the August 31, 1994
book value of $1,541,000.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     OVERVIEW

The company achieved record sales, earnings and shipments in
fiscal 1994.  Although the U.S. economy showed gradual improvement
during the year, market conditions in the pulp and paper industry
were mixed.  While the market for printing and writing grades
showed modest growth in fiscal 1994, the company made significant
progress in expanding its marketing presence in the East Coast and
Canada with the first full year of operation of the Groveton, New
Hampshire mill.  Although there was not sufficient market strength
to support the operation of the second of the two paper machines
at Groveton in fiscal 1994, the company's Printing and Writing
Division experienced a 17.7% volume gain over the previous year. 
Strong demand at Rhinelander for its technical specialty grades
resulted in a 9.7% volume increase in fiscal 1994 over the
previous year's results.

For much of fiscal 1994, the company experienced rising pulp
prices as market demand for pulp increased.  The company announced
several paper price increases during the year, but competitive
pressures prevented price increases on many grades.  Price
increases were not sufficient to completely offset the higher pulp
costs.  Improved production levels and cost reduction efforts
helped to minimize the impact of the rising pulp costs.  As pulp
prices continued to rise in early fiscal 1995, the company
implemented additional selling price increases on most of its
products in September and carried out further price increases on a
portion of its technical specialty product line in October.  

     NET SALES

Fiscal 1994 net sales were a record $426.5 million, an increase of
11.7% over fiscal 1993 net sales of $381.8 million.  Net sales in
fiscal 1992 were $370.9 million.  Shipments were a record 355,100
tons, exceeding 1993 shipments of 310,600 tons by 14.3%.  Fiscal
1992 shipments were 296,600 tons.  The growth in shipments in
fiscal 1994 was primarily the result of successfully marketing
part of the added production capacity of the Groveton, New
Hampshire mill and strong demand at the Rhinelander Division.

Despite very competitive market conditions, demand for the
company's products continued to remain strong in fiscal 1994.  At
the Printing and Writing Division, 1994 shipments outpaced the
previous year by 17.7%.  However, market conditions did not 
<PAGE>
support the operation of the second of the two paper machines at
Groveton.  Continued growth of the company's printing and writing
products is expected in fiscal 1995.  Strong demand for the
Rhinelander Division's technical specialty products resulted in
record shipments in 1994.  Shipments of Rhinelander's products
increased 9.7% compared to 1993 results.  Shipments of pressure
sensitive products, its largest product segment, were up 11.5%
over 1993 results.  Some brief downtime was taken early in the
year as a result of isolated market weakness in certain product
segments.

Order backlog at August 31, 1994 was $25.7 million, an increase of
$3.4 million or 15.1% from the August 31, 1993 backlog of $22.3
million.  The order backlog at August 31, 1992 was $20.9 million. 
Order backlog at the end of fiscal 1994 is higher than a year ago
primarily due to increased demand for both printing and writing
and technical specialty grades.  Backlog totals are not an
accurate indicator of the strength of the company's business as a
significant volume of orders are shipped out of inventory promptly
upon receipt of the order. 

     GROSS PROFIT

The gross profit margin decreased in fiscal 1994 to 22.8% of net
sales.  The gross profit margin was 23.3% in fiscal 1993 and 23.1%
in fiscal 1992.  Market pressures in the printing and writing and
technical specialty grades resulted in slightly lower average
selling prices in fiscal 1994 compared to the previous year. 
Market pulp prices declined until January 1994.  Since January,
the company has experienced steadily rising prices for pulp.  For
fiscal 1994, pulp costs, on average, were slightly below the
fiscal 1993 average.  The company announced paper price increases
for certain paper grades during this period of rising pulp costs,
however, market pressures prevented implementation of price
increases on several product lines.  The company was able to
offset part of the negative effect of rising pulp prices through
some price increases, improved productivity from paper mill and
pulp mill operations and cost reduction efforts, including Total
Quality Process generated improvements.  

In early fiscal 1995, the company experienced further pulp price
increases.  The company implemented price increases on many of its
paper grades in September and on a portion of its technical
specialty product line in October.  Although the rate of each
increase in the prices of pulp and paper may not coincide and
paper price increases will generally lag behind pulp price
increases in the short-term, management believes the company will
have sufficient pricing flexibility with its product lines to help
maintain profit margins on a long-term basis.  The prices of most
other raw materials consumed in production have generally
increased at or below the rate of general inflation.

Production of the company's printing and writing grades increased
12.7% over fiscal 1993.  This was achieved primarily as a result
of the first full year of operation at the Groveton mill.  The
Brokaw mill operated at capacity in 1994, while the Groveton mill
operated at 55% of capacity.  Production in 1993 was 14.0% higher
than 1992 results.
<PAGE>
The Rhinelander mill operated at 99% of capacity in 1994.  Brief
downtime was taken on two of Rhinelander's smaller paper machines
early in the year.  Despite this downtime, capital improvements
yielded a production increase of 5.1% compared to 1993 results. 
Rhinelander's production in 1993 was 3.2% better than 1992 levels.

Maintenance and repair costs increased to $29.6 million in fiscal
1994 from $28.8 million in 1993 and $26.4 million in 1992.  The
increase is mainly attributable to maintenance and repair costs
associated with a full year of operation at the Groveton mill.

     LABOR

The company is currently in the fourth year of a five-year labor
agreement with the United Paperworkers International Union at the
Brokaw mill.  The agreement, which expires in May 1996, includes a
general wage increase of 3.5% in 1995.  The contract includes
increases in employee benefits and several changes in work rules
to provide greater operating efficiencies.

The company is currently in the second year of a four-year labor
agreement with the United Paperworkers International Union at the
Groveton mill.  The agreement, which expires in March 1997,
includes general wage increases of 3.0% in 1995 and 2.0% in 1996. 
The contract includes increases in employee benefits as part of
the agreement.

The company is currently in the third year of a four-year labor
agreement with the United Paperworkers International Union at the
Rhinelander division.  The agreement, which expires in December
1995, includes a general wage increase of 3.0% in 1995.  Increases
in employee benefits each year of the contract and changes in work
rules for improved operating efficiencies are also part of the
agreement.

The company is of the opinion that all three labor agreements
provide competitive labor costs over the contract periods.  The
company considers its relationship with its employees to be
excellent.

     SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH EXPENSES

Selling, administrative and research expenses in fiscal 1994 were
$27.3 million, compared to $26.0 million in fiscal 1993 and $23.1
million in fiscal 1992.  Higher marketing and administrative costs
in fiscal 1994 over the prior year are attributable to a full year
of operation at the Groveton mill, increased marketing costs to
promote new product offerings of printing and writing grades and
higher professional fees.  Stock appreciation rights, dividend
equivalents and stock option income was $.3 million in 1994,
compared to expense of $1.9 million in 1993 and $1.2 million in
1992.

     INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME

Interest income was $.1 million in fiscal 1994 and was less than
$.1 million in both fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1992.  Interest expense
totaled $2.0 million in fiscal 1994, compared to $1.3 million in
1993 and $1.1 million in 1992.  Additional debt from the purchase
 <PAGE>
of the manufacturing facilities in Groveton, New Hampshire,
accounts for the higher interest expense in fiscal 1994. 
Capitalized interest was $.2 million in fiscal 1994 and was $.1
million in 1993 and 1992.  Other income and expense was $.1
million expense in 1994, compared to $.1 million income in both
1993 and 1992.

     INCOME TAXES

The income tax provision for fiscal 1994 was $26.0 million, for an
effective tax rate of 38.2%.  The effective tax rates for fiscal
years 1993 and 1992 were 37.9% and 34.7%, respectively.  The
fiscal 1994 and 1993 tax rates were effected by the 1% increase in
federal tax rates which became effective on January 1, 1993.  The
1992 tax rate was favorably impacted by research and development
credits and state tax credit carryforwards.

On September 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
adoption was reflected as a one-time cumulative reduction in the
net deferred tax liability resulting in a $1.0 million increase in
fiscal 1994 net earnings.

     NET EARNINGS

Fiscal 1994 earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting
changes were $42.1 million, compared to fiscal 1993 earnings of
$38.4 million.  After including the impact of the accounting
changes, net earnings were $43.1 million in fiscal 1994, compared
to net earnings of $22.6 million for fiscal 1993.  Fiscal 1992 net
earnings were $40.0 million.  

On September 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109
requires deferred income taxes be determined based on the
estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by
the current enacted tax rates.  This change in accounting, while
not affecting cash flow, resulted in a one-time cumulative benefit
of $1.0 million in fiscal 1994.  In fiscal 1993, the company
adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," resulting in a one-time cumulative
reduction to net earnings of $15.8 million.


     CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

     LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt decreased $12.4 million in fiscal 1994 as cash
provided by operations was sufficient to fund the 1994 capital
expenditure program, meet working capital and dividend
requirements, reduce debt and repurchase company stock.  At August
31, 1994, long-term debt was $30.3 million compared to $42.7
million at August 31, 1993.  Long-term debt at August 31, 1992 was
$22.7 million.  The increase in long-term debt in fiscal 1993 was
due primarily to the purchase of manufacturing facilities in
Groveton, New Hampshire.  Long-term debt as a percent of capital
decreased to 9.6% in 1994, compared to 14.8% in 1993 and 9.9% in
1992.
<PAGE>
At August 31, 1994, $30.0 million was outstanding under the senior
promissory notes.  This compares with borrowings of $12.0 million
under the credit agreement and $30.0 million in senior promissory
notes at August 31, 1993.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS

For fiscal 1994, cash provided by operations was $64.7 million or
88.3% above 1993 results of $34.4 million. Cash provided by
operations in fiscal 1992 was $45.9 million.  Operating cash flow
was lower in 1993 than 1994 due to funding the working capital
requirements associated with the addition of the Groveton mill. 
Increased shipments, along with lower unit costs in fiscal 1994,
also accounted for part of the improved operating cash flow in
1994 over the previous year.  The decline in operating cash flow
in 1993 compared to 1992 was driven mainly by increased working
capital requirements associated with the Groveton mill. 

     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Capital expenditures totaled $43.8 million in fiscal 1994,
compared to $51.3 million in 1993 and $31.8 million in 1992.  The
fiscal 1993 expenditures include the purchase of manufacturing
facilities in Groveton, New Hampshire for $20.2 million.  At the
Brokaw mill, work is continuing on a new boiler and feedwater
system, with start-up expected by the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 1995.  Work was completed on Brokaw's largest paper
machine, which was converted to produce paper using an alkaline
process for increased whiteness and brightness.  A machine rebuild
was also completed, increasing production and reliability, with a
second rebuild scheduled for completion in early fiscal 1995.  A
new water marking system for No. 4 paper machine was installed to
improve quality and increase production  and a new sizing system
was installed to reduce operating costs.  At Groveton, a state-of-
the-art color process control system was completed, which reduced
production costs and gave both Groveton paper making machines
color production capabilities equal to the Brokaw mill.  

At the Rhinelander Division, a new $14.5 million silicone coater
was approved.  The project includes a building expansion and
additional rewinding capacity.  The new solventless silicone
coater will be capable of producing 15,000 tons of coated release
papers for the pressure sensitive label industry enabling the mill
to expand its RHI-lease product lines.  The new coater is expected
to start-up in the spring of 1995.  An upgrade to No. 9 paper
machine at Rhinelander was completed in June 1994, increasing
capacity and improving quality on this machine which produces
backing paper for the pressure sensitive label industry.  Also
begun are improvements totaling over $1 million for No. 6 paper
machine, which produces mostly packaging and technical grade
papers, as well as $1.9 million for an upgrade to Rhinelander's
wastewater treatment facility.

As of August 31, 1994, the company was committed to spend
approximately $30 million to complete capital projects under
construction.  These projects include the new silicone coater
project, completion of the power distribution system, improvements
to No. 6 paper machine and an upgrade to the wastewater treatment
plant at Rhinelander; completion of the boiler and feedwater
<PAGE>
system and the second machine rebuild at Brokaw; and completion of
a machine chest at Groveton.  Capital commitments at the end of
1993 and 1992 were $32.0 million and $21.5 million, respectively.

In early fiscal 1995, the company's Board of Directors approved
over $35 million in capital improvements for the Brokaw mill.  In
keeping with the Printing and Writing Division's commitment to
expand its recycled capabilities, $16.4 million was approved for a
secondary fiber system.  The project includes a building expansion
and additional pulping capacity and a new fiber handling system to
process increased recycled and post consumer fiber.  In addition,
$14.5 million was approved to rebuild, modernize and expand
Brokaw's wastewater treatment facility.  The company will also
invest over $4.5 million for improvements to No. 2 paper machine
to increase productivity and enhance product quality.

The company expects capital expenditures to be in excess of $150
million over the next three years.

     FINANCING

The company maintains a revolving credit facility agreement with
two banks to provide loans up to $35 million.  This credit
facility was reduced at the company's request from $65 million in
November 1993.  On July 19, 1994, the company renewed its $35
million revolving credit facility.  The credit facility will
permit the company to borrow $35 million through August 1, 1997,
at which time, or earlier at the company's option, the agreement
converts to a four-year term loan, requiring equal annual payments
of principal.  Interest rates on these borrowings are based on
bank offered rates, the prime lending rate, certificate of deposit
rate, treasury rate, or a eurodollar rate.  The credit agreement
provides the back-up line of credit necessary for the issuance of
commercial paper.  The company's commercial paper placement
agreement, with one of its two major banks, provides for the
issuance of up to $40 million of unsecured debt obligations.  The
company had no commercial paper outstanding at year end.  On
August 31, 1994, a combined total of $35.0 million was available
for borrowing under the company's credit and commercial paper
placement agreements.  In a separate agreement, the banks
participating in the revolving credit facility have provided a $30
million uncommitted line of credit to the company.  The company
also has available a $2 million short-term line of credit.  There
was no borrowing against these lines at August 31, 1994.

In June 1993, the company borrowed $30.0 million through the
issuance of notes to Prudential Insurance Company of America and
its subsidiaries.  The loan was in the form of senior unsecured
term notes maturing in three to seven years, bearing a fixed
interest rate of 6.03%.  Proceeds from the notes were used to
reduce borrowings from the revolving credit facility.

Cash provided by operations, the revolving credit facility
agreement, and the Prudential notes are expected to fund the
company's planned capital expenditure requirements, except those
that may be required to fund a major expansion or acquisition. 
The company is of the opinion that sufficient amounts of capital
resources are available to achieve both short-term and long-term
goals.
<PAGE>
     COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

On April 21, 1994, the company purchased, with authorization from
the Board of Directors, 100,000 shares of the company's no par
value common stock from a director in a private transaction at the
average market price on the day of the transaction.

On June 30, 1994, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to 1,350,000 shares of the company's common stock from time
to time in the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions at prevailing market prices.  As of August 31, 1994,
the company had repurchased 90,000 shares at market prices ranging
from $23.875 per share to $24.625 per share.

     DIVIDENDS

During 1994, the Board of Directors declared cash dividends of
$.24 per share, an increase of 14.3% over the $.21 per share
declared in 1993.

WAUSAU PAPER MILLS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany transactions, balances and profits have been
eliminated in consolidation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods
and transfer of title to the customer.  The company grants credit
to customers in the ordinary course of business.  A substantial
portion of the company's accounts receivable is with customers in
various paper converting industries or the paper merchant
business.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and
their geographic dispersion.

CASH EQUIVALENTS - The company defines cash equivalents as highly
liquid, short-term investments with an original maturity of three
months or less.

INVENTORIES - Pulpwood, finished paper products and selected raw
materials are valued at the lower of cost, determined on the last-
in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.  All other inventories are
valued at the lower of average cost or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Plant and equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method for financial statement
purposes.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of all
plant and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are removed
from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are included
in the statements of income.

Buildings are depreciated over a 25- to 45-year period; machinery
and equipment over a 4- to 16-year period.  Maintenance and repair
costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Renewals and
improvements which extend the useful lives of the assets are added
to the plant and equipment accounts.

Equipment financed by long-term leases, which in effect are
installment purchases, have been recorded as assets and the
related obligations as debt.

Land is stated at cost.  Timberlands are at cost less the pro rata
cost of timber harvested since acquisition.  Depletion expense is
calculated using the block method.

INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes have been provided under the
liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon the estimated future tax effects of
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, as measured by the current enacted tax
rates.  Deferred tax expense is the result of changes in the
deferred tax asset and liability.  See Note 8 for change in
accounting principle in 1994.

<PAGE>
EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per common share are based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Dilution of
earnings per common share due to common stock equivalents (stock
options) is negligible and, accordingly, no dilution has been
reported.

and work in process.

                                            ========    ========
</TABLE>
The company has outstanding $30 million in unsecured senior
promissory notes.  Interest is payable quarterly on the
outstanding balance at a rate of 6.03% per annum.  Principal is
payable in ten equal semi-annual installments beginning
December 18, 1995, with the final payment due June 16, 2000.
<PAGE>

During 1994, the company amended its revolving credit agreement it
had previously established.  The amended agreement grants the
company an unsecured revolving credit facility of $35 million with
two banks which continues through August 1, 1997 at which time, or
earlier at the company's option, the revolving credit converts to
a term loan facility, and the loans then outstanding are payable
in four equal annual installments.  There were no borrowings
against this agreement at August 31, 1994.  The company may elect
the base for interest from either domestic rate loans, eurodollar
loans, adjusted CD rate loans, offered loans or treasury rate
loans.  The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings under the
revolving credit facility was 3.58% at August 31, 1993.  The
credit agreement provides for commitment fees during the revolving
loan period.  Fees are based on .125% per annum on the unused
portions of the commitment, payable monthly.

The senior promissory notes and the revolving credit facility
agreement require the company to comply with certain covenants,
one of which requires the company maintain minimum net worth.  At
August 31, 1994, $63,704,000 of retained earnings was available
for payment of cash dividends without violation of the minimum net
worth covenant related to the senior promissory notes.

The company maintains a commercial paper placement agreement with
a bank to issue up to $40 million of unsecured debt obligations
which requires unused credit availability under its revolving
credit agreement equal to the amount of outstanding commercial
paper.


The difference between the book and the fair market value of the
long-term debt is not material.
<TABLE>
The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for the next
five years are:

</TABLE>
Annual maturities will be affected by future borrowing under the
revolving credit facility agreement.

The banks participating in the revolving credit agreement have
provided separate uncommitted revolving lines of credit to the
company in an aggregate amount of up to $30 million.  The specific
terms of any revolving loans borrowed pursuant to these lines of
credit will be negotiated at the time of the borrowing and any
revolving loans so borrowed will be payable on demand.  In
addition, the company has a $2 million line of credit with
interest payable at the prime rate.  The line does not require a
compensating balance or a commitment fee.  There was no borrowing
against these lines at August 31, 1994.

Projected benefit obligations were determined using an assumed
discount rate of 7.5% and 8.0% and assumed rates of increases in
future compensation levels of 5.0% and 5.5% in 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets
was 8.0%.  Plan assets consist principally of publicly traded
stocks and fixed income securities.

The company's defined contribution pension plan provides for
company contributions based on a percentage of employee
contributions.  The cost of such plans totaled $445,000 in 1994,
$420,000 in 1993 and $637,000 in 1992.

The company has deferred compensation or supplemental retirement
agreements with certain present and past key officers and
<PAGE>
employees.  The principal cost of such plans is being or has been
accrued over the period of active employment to the full
eligibility date.  The annual cost of the deferred compensation
and supplemental retirement agreements does not represent a
material amount.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, the company adopted the
provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
than Pensions," effective as of September 1, 1992.

SFAS 106 requires the estimated cost of retiree benefit payments,
primarily health and life insurance, to be accrued during the
employees' active service period.  Previously, the cost of these
benefits was expensed as paid.  The company elected to immediately
recognize the accumulated liability as of September 1, 1992, which
resulted in a one-time noncash charge against earnings of
$25,000,000 before taxes and $15,750,000 after taxes, or $.58 per
share (as restated).  In addition, the effect of this change on
1993 operating results was to recognize an additional pretax
expense of $1,590,000 and after-tax expense of $987,000, or $.04
per share (as restated).  Previously reported quarterly earnings
for 1993 have been restated for the effect of this change, as if
it had been adopted on September 1, 1992, as presented on page 41.

For 1994, the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
12% declining by 1% annually for seven years to an ultimate rate
of 5%.  The weighted average discount rate was 7.5%.
<PAGE>

For 1993, the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
13.0% declining by 1.0% annually for seven years to an ultimate
rate of 6.0%.  The weighted average discount rate used was 8.0%.

A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of August 31, by approximately $3,541,000 or 12.9%
in 1994 and $3,358,000, or 12.6% in 1993.  The effect of this
change on the aggregate of the service and interest cost would be
an increase of $451,000 or 14.6% in 1994 and $593,000, or 22.6%
for 1993.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGE:  Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," effective September 1, 1994, is not expected to have a
material impact on the company's financial position or results of
operations.

NOTE 8.  INCOME TAXES

Effective September 1, 1993, the company adopted the liability
method of accounting for income taxes prescribed by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109.  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the
current enacted tax rates.  Deferred tax expense is the result of
changes in the deferred tax assets and liability.  Previously, the
company used the deferral method which provided for deferred
income taxes  on the basis of income and expense items reported
for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.

The company elected to recognize the cumulative effect of the
change as of September 1, 1993, totaling $1,000,000, as a credit
to income in the current year.  The effect of the change in method
did not have a material effect in 1994.

NOTE 9.  STOCK OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS

The company maintains the 1981 and 1991 Employee Stock Option
Plans.  Each plan specifies purchase price, time and method of
exercise.  Payment of the option price may be made in cash or by
tendering an amount of common stock having a fair market value
equal to the option price.

Options are granted for terms of 10 to 20 years, the option price
being equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock
at the date of grant under the 1981 plan and for incentive options
granted under the 1991 plan.  The option price for non-qualified
options under the 1991 plan may not be less than 50% of the fair
market value of the company's common stock at the date of grant.

During 1992, options were granted under the 1991 Employee Stock
Option Plan.  The options are earned over a three-year period
based upon the satisfaction of operating goals set forth in the
agreement.  A total of 88,894 and 65,780 options terminated in
1994 and 1993, respectively, when operating goals were not met.

The 1990 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan entitles certain officers
and key employees the right to receive cash equal to the sum of
the appreciation in value of the stock and the hypothetical value
of cash dividends which would have been paid on the stock covered
by the grant assuming reinvestment in company stock.  The 1988
Management Incentive Plan entitles certain management employees
the right to receive similar cash payments.  The stock
appreciation rights granted under both plans may be exercised in
whole or in such installments and at such times as specified in
the grant.  In all instances, the rights lapse if not exercised
within 20 years of the grant date.  Compensation expense is
recorded with respect to the rights based upon the quoted market
value of the shares and the exercise provisions.

NOTE 10.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On December 16, 1991, the shareholders of the company approved a
resolution which amended the company's Restated Articles of
Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 12,000,000 shares, par value $.50 (stated value
$1.40), to 36,000,000 shares, without par value.  The authorized
shares of preferred stock were changed from $1.00 par value to
shares without par value.  The additional paid-in capital account
has been combined with common stock as presented in the
Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.

NOTE 11.  RESEARCH EXPENSES

Research expenses charged to operations were $1,158,000 in 1994,
$957,000 in 1993 and $868,000 in 1992.
<PAGE>

NOTE 12.  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS

The company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal
course of business.  It is the opinion of management that any
judgment or settlement resulting from pending or threatened
litigation would not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or on the operations of the company.

As of August 31, 1994, the company was committed to spend
approximately $30 million to complete capital projects which were
in various stages of completion.

Rhinelander Paper Company Inc., a subsidiary of the company, has
signed an agreement with Wisconsin Public Service Corporation. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation will fund, construct, own and operate a high-
efficiency cogeneration power plant.  The Rhinelander division
will become the plant's exclusive steam customer.  The agreement
has a term of 35 years from the initial date of commercial
operation, which is projected to be in 1998.  Upon start up of the
project and delivery of steam, the company will incur fixed and
variable charges under the agreement.  Fixed charges will be
subject to certain force majeure and payment deferral provisions,
and, unless the utility company fails to supply steam, such fixed
costs are approximately $7 million annually.  In addition, the
variable cost of steam and electricity purchased is determined by
a formula based on the operating and maintenance costs of the
facility determined on a monthly basis.

During fiscal 1994, the company purchased 100,000 shares of the
company's no-par value common stock from a director in a private
transaction at $27.625 per share, the average market price on the
day of the transaction.

NOTE 13.  MAJOR CUSTOMERS

One customer accounted for 12.3% of net sales aggregating
$52,313,000, 11.2% of net sales aggregating $42,812,000 and 10.4%
of net sales aggregating $38,482,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

               DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT


     THIS AGREEMENT, dated July 1, 1994, by and between WAUSAU
PAPER MILLS COMPANY (herein referred to as the "Corporation") and
SAN W. ORR, JR., an individual (herein referred to as
"Executive").


                       W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Corporation and Executive entered into a
deferred compensation agreement dated March 2, 1990 and now desire
to amend and clarify certain provisions of that agreement;

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

     1.     ELECTION TO DEFER.  Executive may, in his discretion,
elect to defer all or any cash compensation (specified by amount
or percentage of such compensation) payable to him by the
Corporation from time to time for service to the Corporation as an
employee by executing an election in the form set forth in Exhibit
A hereto (herein referred to as an "Election") and filing such
Election with the secretary of the Corporation (herein referred to
as the "Secretary").  An Election shall be effective with respect
to all cash compensation specified on the election form filed with
the Secretary by Executive which is accrued and payable after the
date the Election is received by the Secretary and until the
Election is amended or revoked.  An Election hereunder may be
amended or revoked at any time by filing a subsequent Election
with the Secretary.  Such amendment or revocation shall be
effective with respect to cash compensation accrued and payable on
and after receipt of such new Election by the Secretary.

     2.     DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT.  The Corporation shall
maintain upon its corporate books a deferred compensation account
(herein referred to as the "Account") with respect to any
compensation deferred under this agreement.  As of the first day
of each calendar month, the Corporation shall make the following
adjustments to the Account:  (a) Subtract amounts paid from the
Account during the immediately preceding month; and (b) Add the
amount of compensation Executive has elected to defer under
paragraph 1 which was otherwise payable to Executive during the
immediately preceding month.  As of the first day of each calendar
year, the Corporation shall add to the Account simple interest,
calculated at a rate equal to average of the prime rate published
in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on the first business day of each
calendar quarter in the preceding calendar year, minus one
percentage point, on the average daily balance in the Account
during the preceding year.  The Account created hereunder shall
not represent any specific assets of the Corporation, and the
Corporation is not obligated by this provision to set aside any
assets in respect of the Account.

     3.     DISTRIBUTION.  Distribution of the amount reflected in
the Account shall be made in 5 annual installments with the first
installment payment to be made within the 60 day period following
the date on which Executive ceases to be a member of the Board of
<PAGE>
Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that in the event
of a "Change in Control" (defined below) or Executive's death, the
remaining balance in the Account shall be distributed within the
60 day period following the date of such event in a single lump
sum payment.  The amount of each annual installment distribution
shall equal the balance in the Account on the date set for payment
of such installment divided by the number of installment
distributions remaining within the distribution period (including
such installment).  Interest shall continue to be credited under
paragraph 2 during the installment distribution period.  For
purposes of this paragraph 3, a "Change in Control" shall be
deemed to have occurred if:

          (a)     any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
     13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
     amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than (i) the Corporation
     or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) a trustee or other fiduciary
     holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the
     Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) an underwriter
     temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of
     such securities, or (iv) a corporation owned, directly or
     indirectly, by the stockholders of the Corporation in
     substantially the same proportions as their ownership of
     stock of the Corporation, is or becomes the "beneficial
     owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation (not
     including in the securities beneficially owned by such
     persons any securities acquired directly from the Corporation
     or its affiliates) representing more than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding
     securities;

          (b)      the stockholders of the Corporation approve a
     merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other 
     corporation, other than a merger or consolidation or share 
     exchange which would result in the voting securities of the
     Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing
     to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
     converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) in
     combination with the ownership of any trustee or other
     fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan
     of the Corporation, at least 50% of the combined voting power
     of the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving
     entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
     consolidation or share exchange, or a merger or 
     consolidation or share exchange effected to implement a
     recapitalization of the Corporation (or similar transaction)
     in which no person acquires more than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding
     securities; or

          (c)  the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan
     of complete liquidation of the Corporation or an agreement
     for the sale or disposition by the Corporation of all or
     substantially all of the Corporation's assets.
<PAGE>

     4.     RECIPIENT OF DISTRIBUTION.  Each payment to be made by
the Corporation hereunder shall be made to Executive if he is
living on the date such payment is made, and, if he is not, to
such person or persons (the "Beneficiary" or "Beneficiaries") as
Executive shall designate on the form set forth in Exhibit A or in
such other writing signed by the Executive.  Executive may change
or revoke any such designation previously made by filing a new
designation with the Secretary.  Such new designation shall be
effective for purposes of this paragraph immediately upon filing. 
If no designation hereunder is in effect or no designated
Beneficiary is living when payment is to be made, payment shall be
made to the estate of the last to die of Executive or, if a
Beneficiary has been designated and such designation has not been
