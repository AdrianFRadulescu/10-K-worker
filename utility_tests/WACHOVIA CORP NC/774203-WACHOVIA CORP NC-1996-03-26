                              WACHOVIA CORPORATION
                     INCENTIVE PLAN DEFERRAL ARRANGEMENT
 
                                    PREAMBLE
 
Pursuant to the terms of an Incentive Plan as hereinafter defined, a select
group of management employees of Wachovia Corporation (the "Corporation") and
its affiliates may become eligible to receive incentive compensation. The
Corporation desires to permit each such employee to elect to defer receipt of a
portion of such incentive compensation, if deferral is deemed by such employee
to be desirable.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation hereby adopts this Wachovia Corporation
Incentive Plan Deferral Arrangement (the "Plan") as follows:
 
                            ARTICLE I -- DEFINITIONS
 
1.1   "Account" means the book-entry account established by the
      Corporation for each Participant as described in Article IV.
 
1.2   "Committee" means the Management Resources and Compensation
      Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any successor
      thereto. The Committee is responsible for the administration and
      interpretation of the Plan in accordance with its terms, and its
      determinations shall be binding and conclusive on all persons affected
      thereby.
 
1.3   "Deferred Compensation" means the portion of a Participant's award
      (if any) under an Incentive Plan that is deferred pursuant to the Plan.
 
1.4   "Deferring Participant" means, with respect to any Plan Year, an
      Eligible Employee who files the election described in Article III.
 
1.5   "Effective Date" means July 1, 1995. An election made by a
      Deferring Participant prior to the Effective Date to defer compensation
      under an Incentive Plan shall remain in effect following the Effective
      Date until terminated by the Deferring Participant as provided in Article
      III. Any reference in such prior election to a deferral arrangement under
      an Incentive Plan shall be deemed as of the Effective Date to refer to
      this Plan.
 
1.6   "Eligible Employee" means an employee who complies with the
      eligibility criteria in Article II.
 
1.7   "Incentive Plan" means any one or more of the Wachovia Corporation
      Senior Management Incentive Plan, the Wachovia Corporation Bond and Money
      Market Group Variable Compensation Plan, the Trust Investment Management
      Incentive Plan, the South Carolina National Corporation Executive
      Incentive Compensation Plan, and any other similar incentive compensation
      arrangement as may be adopted or amended by the Committee and which
      permits deferral of compensation pursuant to this Plan.

1.8   "Participant" means any present or Deferring Participant who has a
      balance in his or her Account under the Plan.
 

<PAGE>   2
 
1.9   "Plan Year" means the twelve-month period ending on December 31
      of each year, commencing with December 31, 1995.
 
                           ARTICLE II -- ELIGIBILITY
 
Any management employee of the Corporation or any of its affiliates who is
potentially eligible to receive a payment under an Incentive Plan for any
calendar year is an Eligible Employee for the Plan year coinciding with such
calendar year.
 
            ARTICLE III -- ELECTION TO DEFER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
 
Any Eligible Employee with respect to any Plan Year may become a Deferring
Participant for such Plan Year by filing an election to defer receipt of a
percentage (not to exceed 50%) of the incentive pay, if any, earned by him for
such Plan Year under an Incentive Plan. Such election shall be filed in writing
with the Committee on a form provided by the Committee prior to the first day of
the Plan Year for which such election is to be effective. An election, once
filed, shall continue in effect until the first day of the Plan Year next
following receipt by the Committee of a written revocation of such election, or
until the Deferring Participant's earlier termination of employment or
termination of participation in an Incentive Plan. No amount shall be deferred
with respect to any Eligible Employee for any Plan Year for which there is no
election in effect, and no election for any Plan Year may be revoked after the
beginning of such Plan Year. The amount of the incentive pay which can be
deferred for any Plan Year pursuant to the Plan shall not be less than $1,000.
If the amount to be deferred pursuant to any election for a Plan Year shall be
less than $1,000, such election shall be null and void and of no force and
effect. An Eligible Employee who has revoked an election to defer may file a new
election for any Plan Year (including the first Plan Year for which such
election would have been effective) at any time prior to such Plan Year.
 
                             ARTICLE IV -- ACCOUNTS
 
4.1   The Committee shall establish an Account for each Deferring
      Participant to which shall be credited Deferred Compensation hereunder
      and amounts equivalent to interest as provided in Section 4.2, and to
      which shall be debited all distributions pursuant to Article V. Amounts
      of Deferred Compensation shall be credited to the Account of a Deferring
      Participant as of the date that such amounts would have been paid to the
      Deferring Participant were it not for the deferral.
 
4.2   As of the last day of each calendar month (including after payments
      commence as provided in Article V), there shall be credited to the
      Account of each Participant an amount equivalent to interest at the rate
      determined as of such last day pursuant to Exhibit A. Such rate shall be
      applied to the average daily balance in the Account for such month.
 
                     ARTICLE V -- DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS
 
A Participant's Account shall be paid in cash 180 substantially equal
consecutive monthly installments on the first day of each calendar month
commencing with the month next following the Participant's termination of
employment for any reason; provided, that the Participant may


                                    - 2 -
<PAGE>   3
 
elect prior to the date the Participant terminates employment, with the consent
of the Committee, for the Participant's Account to be distributed in a lump sum
or in substantially equal consecutive monthly installments for a period of less
than 180 months.
 
                             ARTICLE VI -- DEATH
 
6.1   Each Participant may designate a beneficiary (which may include
      more than one person, natural or otherwise, and one or more secondary or
      contingent beneficiaries) to receive the amount in the Account, if any,
      following death of the Participant. In the event that a Participant shall
      die without any designated beneficiary surviving or then in existence, 
      the beneficiary shall be the Participant's surviving spouse, if any. If 
      there shall be no surviving spouse, the beneficiary shall be the 
      Participant's estate.
 
6.2   If a Participant shall die while employed by the Corporation, the
      Corporation shall distribute the Account to the Participant's beneficiary
      in cash in 180 substantially equal consecutive monthly installments on
      the first day of each calendar month commencing with the month next
      following the Participant's death; provided, that the Committee may, with
      the consent of the beneficiary, distribute the Participant's Account in a
      lump sum or in a lesser number of consecutive monthly installments than
      would have been made to the Participant.
 
6.3   If a Participant shall die while receiving payments pursuant to
      Article V, but before receiving all such payments to which he is
      entitled, the Account will continue to be distributed to the
      Participant's beneficiary in the same manner as such payments would have
      been made to the Participant.
 
6.4   If a beneficiary shall commence receiving payments hereunder, and
      shall die or otherwise cease to exist before receiving distribution of
      the full amount in the Account, the then amount in the Account shall be
      paid as soon as practicable in a lump sum to the person or persons then
      in existence who would receive the property of the Participant under the
      intestate succession laws then in effect in the state in which the
      Participant was a resident at the time of death.
 
                           ARTICLE VII -- ASSIGNMENT
 
No rights of a Participant or any other person in the Account or to the
payment of benefits hereunder shall be assigned, transferred, pledged or
encumbered, except for transfers on account of death of the recipient thereof.
 
                  ARTICLE VIII -- NO TRUST; UNSECURED INTEREST
 
Nothing contained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant to the provisions of 
the Plan shall create or be construed as creating a trust of any kind, or a 
fiduciary relationship between the Corporation and any Participant or other 
person. Any funds which are or may be set aside under the provisions of the 
Plan shall continue for all purposes to be a part of the general funds of the 
Corporation and no person other than the Corporation shall, by virtue of the
provisions of the Plan, have any interest in such funds. To the extent that any
person acquires a right to 


                                    - 3 -
<PAGE>   4

receive payments from the Corporation under the Plan, such rights shall be 
no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.
 
                       ARTICLE IX -- FACILITY OF PAYMENT
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, if a Participant or any other
person entitled to receive payments under the Plan shall be physically or
mentally or legally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
benefit payable hereunder, the Corporation, upon the receipt of satisfactory
evidence that another person or institution is maintaining the recipient and
that no guardian or committee has been appointed for the recipient, may cause
such benefit otherwise payable to the recipient to be made to such person or
institution so maintaining the recipient.
 
                         ARTICLE X -- CLAIMS PROCEDURE
 
     In the event any Participant or other person shall file a claim for
payments hereunder which shall be denied by the Corporation, the Corporation
shall comply with the claims procedure set forth in Section 503 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Committee shall act as the named fiduciary
responsible for review of any decision denying a claim.
 
                      ARTICLE XI -- AMENDMENT; TERMINATION
 
     The Committee may amend the Plan from time to time in any respect, or may
terminate the Plan, except that no amendment or termination shall affect rights

                            WACHOVIA CORPORATION
                          EXECUTIVE INSURANCE PLAN



GENERAL OVERVIEW

o    The purpose of the Executive Insurance Plan is to provide permanent life
     insurance coverage more commensurate with the pay levels of the eligible
     executives.

o    Eligible executives who elect to participate under the Executive Insurance
     Plan will be afforded with an individual universal life insurance policy 
     currently issued by New York Life Insurance Company.  The amount of 
     pre-retirement coverage provided to an executive who participates under 
     the plan will be based on the base pay of the individual as indicated on 
     the accompanying schedule.  The amount of post-retirement coverage paid 
     for by Wachovia will equal 25% of the amount of pre-retirement coverage, 
     with the exception of the coverage for the Chief Executive Officer, which
     will be 50%.

o    The executive may elect additional post-retirement coverage in increments
     of 25% of pre-retirement coverage at his/her expense.  This election may
     be made at any time, but will be available on a guaranteed issue basis 
     only if the post-retirement coverage does not exceed the pre-retirement 
     coverage.

o    Eligible executives who elect to participate in the plan will be provided
     with $50,000 life insurance coverage under the Choice Benefits Plan and be
     provided with Choice credits to purchase the $50,000 worth of coverage.  
     If an executive chooses not to participate, then his/her participation 
     with respect to life insurance under the Choice Benefits Plan will 
     continue as before.  Should an individual decline to participate, he/she 
     will only be able to join the plan at the next enrollment date, which may 
     occur as frequent as annually, and may be subject to some underwriting 
     requirements.


SPECIFIC INFORMATION


o     ELIGIBILITY

     - Executives whose base pay rate equals or exceeds $100,000 for the first
       time will be presented for eligibility consideration to the Management
       Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") periodically for
       confirmation.  It is anticipated that this periodic review will occur 
       annually, but the Committee reserves the right to request less frequent 
       updates.

     - Executives who are offered participation and elect to participate would
       be eligible to participate effective the first of the next calendar 
       year.  At that time, the executive's term life insurance coverage under 
       the Choice Benefits Plan would be reduced to $50,000 along with a 
       corresponding reduction in Choice credits.  The Committee reserves the 
       right to permit an earlier effective date for participation under the 
       plan; however, any changes to Choice Benefits Plan participation must 
       occur as of the beginning of the next calendar year.

     - If an executive declines to participate, his/her Choice Benefits life
       insurance coverage will continue unchanged.  If at a future time the 
       executive wishes to participate, he/she will have to wait until the next
       enrollment opportunity.


<PAGE>   2

o    COVERAGE

     - Pursuant to the attached schedule, executives who elect to participate
       under the Executive Insurance Plan will be afforded a fixed dollar 
       amount of pre-retirement coverage predicated on the current base pay 
       rate.  In addition, Wachovia will provide for 25% of this pre-retirement
       coverage as a post-retirement death benefit within the policy.

     - The executive may elect to purchase additional post-retirement coverage,
       on a guaranteed issue basis, in increments of 25% of pre-retirement 
       coverage provided the post-retirement coverage does not exceed the 
       pre-retirement coverage. Also, the executive may elect additional 
       pre-retirement coverage subject to the underwriting requirements of the 
       policy.  Any additional coverage elected by the participant will be at 
       his/her expense.

     - If an executive's base pay would warrant the movement into a category
       with a higher amount of coverage, such a change would be considered at 
       the next enrollment opportunity, but only with the confirmation of the 
       Committee.

     - For executives who are provided coverage within the Category I indicated
       on the attached, an additional option exists to reconfigure the policy 
       death benefit into a death benefit payable on a joint and last survivor 
       basis provided the level of premiums payable by Wachovia on behalf of 
       the executive remains the same.

o    PREMIUM PAYMENTS

     - Wachovia is scheduled to pay premiums on behalf of the executive for the
       amount of coverage indicated on the attached schedule.  These annual
       premiums would be payable while the executive is employed by Wachovia
       and are scheduled to be payable until the executive reaches insurance age
       62 or for at least 10 years if the executive is older than insurance 
       age 53.

     - The scheduled coverage and corresponding premiums are based on the
       assumption of retirement at age 62.  If the executive retires prior to 
       that time, he/she would be responsible for the payment of premiums at 
       the same level for the same amount of coverage as illustrated or could 
       lower the premiums corresponding to a reduction in coverage.  If the 
       executive works beyond age 62, additional premiums may be necessary to 
       continue the same pre-retirement level of coverage.

      -The premium amounts are also predicated on conservative illustrations of
       future policy performance.  Should actual policy performance be worse
       than that illustrated, the premiums, which are scheduled to vanish after
       insurance age 62 or 10 policy years (if longer), may not in fact vanish.
       Wachovia has currently made no commitment to pay additional premiums
       beyond those illustrated should actual performance warrant additional
       premiums.  However, the Committee reserves the right to consider the
       additional payment of premiums if circumstances warrant such 
       consideration.

      -If an executive leaves Wachovia, he/she will be responsible for the
       ongoing payment of premiums.  Wachovia's commitment will cease at
       that time.  However, the Committee reserves the right to consider the
       payment of premiums for individuals who retire (under the provision of
       the Wachovia Corporation Retirement Income Plan), prior to insurance
       age 62 or 10 policy years, if longer.

      -All premiums paid by Wachovia will be considered as taxable income, and
       as such, will be subject to withholding throughout the executive's tax
       year. The premiums associated with any additional coverage elected by the
       executive can be paid on a payroll deduction basis.

<PAGE>   3

o    POLICY OWNERSHIP

     - The executive will be the owner of the policy and may select any
       beneficiary he/she chooses.

     - As a result of this ownership, the executive may exercise all options
       afforded him/her under the policy, inclusive of a policy loan or 
       withdrawal.

     - However, if any action taken by the executive causes the policy to be
       suspended or terminated due to failure to pay any additional premiums 
       due, failure to pay any interest on a policy loan or withdrawal of too
       much cash value (which will cause the policy to violate its cash value
       requirements to be deemed life insurance), Wachovia reserves the right to
       suspend or cease its premium payments.

o    UNDERWRITING

     - The plan, as designed, is configured for guaranteed issue on a
       unisex,  smoker distinct basis.  Provided the executive's elections
       remain within the confines of the plan design, guaranteed issue will be
       available.  If the executive wishes to increase pre-retirement coverage,
       the underwriting requirements of the policy would need to be satisfied.

     - However, if an executive declines coverage and later wishes to
       participate, it is possible that guaranteed issue may not be available
       and some underwriting may be required.  If any additional cost is
       incurred, as a result of such circumstances, Wachovia reserves the right
       to only pay for the cost of the policy on a guaranteed issue basis.

o    LIBERTY LIFE COVERAGE

     - Any executive, who becomes eligible to participate in the Executive
       Insurance Plan and who also has a Liberty Life Insurance Company policy
       paid for by Wachovia, will only be able to participate in the Executive
       Insurance Plan if he/she elects to relinquish Wachovia from the
       continued payment of premiums.

     - A variety of options exist on behalf of the Liberty Life policy,
       including the executive's continued payment of the full or a reduced
       premium amount, the cashing-in of the policy, the conversion to a lesser
       death benefit within the policy whose premium is illustrated to vanish,
       or the tax-free exchange with the New York Life policy.

o    PLAN CHANGES

     - The commmittee reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the
       commitment by Wachovia to continue payment of premiums as described
       above with at least 30 days notice to the affected participants.

                                      
       Effective Date - June 1, 1995.

                             LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Wachovia Shareholder:

Wachovia completed a very productive year in 1995, achieving good earnings
growth while moving forward with the implementation of major strategic
initiatives. Net income per fully diluted share was $3.49, up 11.7 percent from
$3.12 in 1994. Net income totaled $602.5 million compared with $539.1 million,
a gain of 11.8 percent. Strong loan expansion and good growth in other
operating revenue, particularly from more nontraditional sources, accounted for
the earnings increase. A higher credit loss provision and a rise in noninterest
expense tempered the results.

Profitability remained strong with returns of 17.7 percent on shareholders'
equity and 1.45 percent on assets compared with longer-term five-year averages
of 15.6 percent and 1.29 percent, respectively. The total return on Wachovia
common stock, including price appreciation and reinvested dividends, was 47.1
percent for the year compared with 60.2 percent for the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Index of 50 money center and regional banks and 37.6 percent for the S&P 500
Index.

The results for 1995 and the corporation's financial condition at year-end
compare most favorably with other banking peers. Return on common shareholders'
equity ranked seventh among the nation's 25 largest bank holding companies.
Return on assets was sixth although the corporation ranked 20th in asset size
at December 31. Average common equity to assets of 8.22 percent was fifth
strongest among the top 25 banking companies.

At year-end, nonperforming assets of .24 percent of loans and foreclosed
property represented the lowest level of problem assets among this peer group,
while the corporation had the second strongest reserve coverage of
nonperforming loans at 763 percent. Expense management remained excellent with
an overhead cost ratio of 54.2 percent, second best among these large banking
companies. Graphs depicting several comparative measures for Wachovia and
industry peers since 1990 are on page 74 of this report.

The banking industry's financial condition improved during the first half of
this decade. A nicely growing economy, favorable interest rates and a healthier
credit cycle were the principal factors elevating results of other banks closer
to Wachovia's traditional long-term performance. Conditions for the financial
services industry in the remainder of the decade will be more challenging.

The economy is likely to be slower growing. Traditional and nontraditional
banking competition will be more intense.  Profitability pressures will be
evident as loan growth moderates, margins remain under pressure, easy expense
savings have been achieved, loan losses rise and technology investing becomes
more strategically critical.  Despite these complexities, excellent
opportunities exist for good companies in this business to succeed and generate
high performance over time.

Addressing the reality of the financial services marketplace, Wachovia's
management conducted an unrestrained strategic assessment of the corporation. 
The findings of this comprehensive review were outlined in the 1994 Annual
Report.  A considerable portion of my time and that of other managers during
1995 was spent with groups of employees across our franchise.  These sessions
were designed to heighten understanding of the need for change, solicit
comments and suggestions, express appreciation for the extra effort required by
Wachovians and encourage dedicated implementation of these initiatives.

I met with thousands of employees and was impressed by how well they are
embracing these changes.  Past investments are producing dividends as evidenced
by our stronger sales force, broader product inventory and robust technology. 
Business volumes are increasing and revenue sources are becoming more
diversified.  I encourage you to read the "Strategic Review - An Update"
beginning on page 6 which profiles some of the progress made so far.  More
changes will occur as investment spending and organizational refinements
continue at a deliberate pace.

The convergence of environmental forces and the resulting impact on banking
performance has been a major impetus for recent banking consolidation. Wachovia
remains open to mergers with or acquisitions of other banks.  Mergers

<PAGE>   6


in 1985 with First Atlanta and in 1991 with South Carolina National created a
stronger franchise and demonstrated the corporation's commitment to seek
combinations which contribute to solid long-term performance. Wachovia will
continue to look for opportunities which enhance business growth and build
shareholder value over time. Additional information about Wachovia's merger,
acquisition and alliance strategy is included in the special section following
this letter.

During 1995, Wachovia continued to be a dependable partner with the communities
it is privileged to serve. Mortgage lending providing affordable housing for
low income and minority customers grew, substantial contributions were made for
community economic development and educational improvement, and thousands of
Wachovians served as volunteers in nonprofit organizations. I was particularly
pleased that all Wachovia subsidiaries subject to the Community Reinvestment
Act of 1977 received "outstanding" ratings, the highest available from federal
regulators.

As 1996 got under way, the economy's rate of growth continued to moderate. In
this environment, Wachovia is fortunate to have the three southeastern states
of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina as our primary market. The
states' combined population totals 17.8 million and has been growing faster
than both the nation and southeast as a whole. Other economic measures such as
personal income, retail sales, residential building and corporate investment
compare exceptionally well with other states and regions. Wachovia's market
penetration in these states is complemented by our attractive national book of
business principally in corporate banking services.

As Wachovia moves ahead, we will not lose sight of the foundation for past
accomplishments. There is in our organization an unwavering dedication to the
time-honored priorities of being a sound, profitable and growing organization.
In today's difficult earnings climate, banks can little afford to hamper
performance as a result of poor credit risk management, unanticipated risks
associated with operations or unbridled expense growth.

As we enter 1996, the challenges confronting banking and financial services
providers remain great. However, for strong institutions with a clear vision of
the future, aggressive strategies and ample resources, the future is bright.
Wachovia is committed to maintaining and building shareholder value in the
challenging environment which lies ahead. Your continued confidence and support
are appreciated.

Sincerely,

/s/ L. M. Baker, Jr.

<PAGE>   8
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During 1995, Wachovia moved forward with a major strengthening of the
organization based on the findings of a strategic assessment conducted in 1994.
Management teams have been implementing actions in five critical and
interrelated areas designed to build shareholder value. These areas are:

- -    Raising Wachovia's effectiveness as a growth culture which includes selling
     products and services through a variety of traditional and nontraditional
     delivery channels

- -    Redirecting technology investment to support sales and service efforts

- -    More effectively managing key lines of businesses to achieve profitable 
     growth

- -    Using mergers, acquisitions and alliances to complement business 
     development strategies

- -    Assessing and managing the prudent use of capital


This process is designed to take what has been an historically successful
organization and make it even more effective. Significant progress has been
made and this section presents a summary of the major developments.

Initiatives moving Wachovia's growth culture to a higher level were well under
way during 1995 in the General Banking and Corporate Services divisions.
General Banking is responsible for a strategic direction for Wachovia's banks
and coordination of consumer market products including investment services and
personal trust activities. The Corporate Services Division manages, sells and
delivers all credit and noncredit corporate banking services in addition to
corporate trust, employee benefit and charitable trust services.

The primary marketing and service distribution channel for the consumer market
has been the branch network. Careful customer analysis demonstrates that
Wachovia's customer base is more upscale than might be expected for a
traditional branch distribution system. This reflects the effectiveness of
Wachovia's relationship-based Personal Banker program. Introduced in 1973, it
has served Wachovia well, continues to be fine-tuned and future strategies will
include significant leveraging of this resource.

                         PROFITABLE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

The analysis also indicated the major product offerings sold to each meaningful
customer segment through branches currently are profitable. This is true despite
earnings challenges branches have faced with the onset of deposit deregulation
in the early 1980s. This knowledge suggests product line development and
distribution initiatives can be accomplished at Wachovia without severe pressure
to prematurely dismantle the existing delivery system.

The branch system is undergoing tremendous change. A branch standardization
project spanning 18 months resulted in the redeployment of about 700 positions.
Most of these were assigned more profitably in card services, investment sales
and telephone banking. Surveys indicate the standardization project was
completed without sacrificing customer service.

The year-end network of 489 banking offices was down from its peak of 519 at
the end of 1991. An in-depth analysis of Wachovia's markets is under way to
develop specific recommendations for each city's optimum distribution network.
The review is expected to be completed in 1996.

An experiment in March 1995 showed how effectively


     Plans for the construction of Wachovia Corporation's North Carolina
     headquarters building in Winston-Salem were announced in July 1992.

customers can be served in a downsized network as long as they perceive real
value. On a Saturday, 200 branches were opened, about 41 percent of the
three-state total, for a special one-day sale on 10-month and three-year CDs.
Additionally, the Wachovia Premiere money market account was actively promoted.

It was a successful marketing event, demonstrating the power of Wachovia's
franchise. More than $1 billion in CDs was generated, 86 percent of which was
new money. About 77,000 accounts were opened, 28,000 of which represented new
relationships. The Premiere account enjoyed strong growth during 1995 with
deposits totaling $3 billion at December 31, 1995.

                            SALES FORCE INCREASED

In addition to branch-based bankers, Wachovia has been expanding its consumer
sales force throughout the three states. During 1995, Wachovia increased the
number of investment counselors deployed in its primary markets to 150, up from
115 at the end of 1994. These Series 7 registered representatives sell a full
range of investment products and handled sales volume in excess of $2 billion
during the year. Net assets of one of their major product lines, Wachovia's
Biltmore family of 15 mutual funds, grew to $2.9 billion from $2.2 billion at
the end of 1994.

Investment counselors, who employ a needs-oriented sales strategy, are equipped
with laptop personal computers. Additionally, a telephone-based sales and
service delivery channel for investment services, Wachovia Investor Center, was
opened in Columbia, South Carolina. With the consolidation of investment
counselors, Wachovia Brokerage and personal trust services into one area known
as Personal Financial Services, Wachovia is fully organized to focus on
increasing its share of the affluent market.

Wachovia has approximately 165 mortgage loan originators who handled 13,000
home mortgage loans totaling about $1.3 billion in 1995. Wachovia Mortgage
Origination System (WMOS), the corporation's automated mortgage application
system introduced in late 1994, is delivered through laptop personal computers.
The system has been enhanced to accommodate FHA and VA loans in addition to
conventional loans. The increased functionality of WMOS strengthens the
mortgage bankers' ability to provide a broad range of mortgage loan financing
options and meet with customers and prospects where they want to be served.

Sales Finance, the area responsible for Wachovia's participation in indirect
automobile and consumer goods financing, had a very productive year. During
1995, Sales Finance received and made credit decisions on about a quarter of a
million loan applications. Loans purchased increased 19 percent from the
year-earlier volume in an automobile financing market which grew only
moderately. It has completed the consolidation of all contract buying offices
into one center at Greenville, North Carolina, where 28 credit managers do
buying for the three states. Sales management activity is conducted by 36
territory managers.

Sales Finance celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1995. At December 31, it was
doing business with more than 1,000 active dealers, primarily located in North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia with approximately 275,000 active consumer
loans and leases totaling $2.5 billion.

Wachovia's consumer market is growing nationally through the continued
attractiveness of Bank Card Services' competitively priced Visa(R) and
MasterCard(R)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>   10
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            CONSUMER MARKET GROWING
credit cards. At the end of 1995, the number of active accounts totaled 1.8
million, an increase of 7.2 percent, and managed loans outstanding reached $4.5
billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier. Approximately 61 percent of the
accounts and 66 percent of loans were to customers outside the corporation's
three home states.

During 1995, Bank Card Services added a no annual fee product to its low rate
product line, further enhancing consumer value. Also, a commercial card
division was established to support the offering of business, purchasing and
travel and entertainment cards for corporate customers broadening Wachovia's
cash management product line.

In the fourth quarter of 1995, $500 million of credit card loans were removed
from the corporation's balance sheet and sold to investors through a
securitization. With this activity, Wachovia creates additional funding
diversification to support increased loan growth. Information about this
program is included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Excellent sales potential also exists among the 400,000 businesses in the three
home states with revenues of $10 million or less. To help increase an
approximately 25 percent penetration of this market, The Wachovia Business
Choice Account(SM) was created and has been selling well. The product packages
commonly used business services with optional features. Pricing is based on a
point system which makes customer bank charges more predictable and easier to
understand.

To deliver even better marketing, servicing and productivity tools to bankers,
Wachovia is investing $53 million in Next Generation Branch Automation (NGBA).
It is the most significant technology investment in the branch system since the
early 1980s when Wachovia introduced its first branch on-line information
system. Three initial phases are involved.

The first phase, completed in December, was the rollout of new hardware and a
software enhancement on a six-branch per night basis. The initial software
release is helping bankers streamline deposit account openings with
electronically stored forms.

Phase II focuses on loan processing, enabling 90 percent of consumer loans to
be originated on line. This should shave 30 to 50 percent off the processing
time required to make a loan. The system will help bankers make better lending
decisions by evaluating and scoring many credit applications or by analyzing
and summarizing debt ratios, disposable income and liquidity for complex loan
requests. Loan processing documents will be maintained electronically, along
with financial statements and credit procedures. The system is so effective at
automating compliance with Wachovia's credit standards, customer sales
representatives will open many credit services without referral to a banker,
effectively increasing the sales force without adding staff. Deployment of this
phase is expected to begin during the first half of 1996.

NGBA's phase III will provide a comprehensive sales automation system organized
around relationship information and customer needs. Bankers will work with
customer-friendly sales screens, multimedia sales presentations, "what-if"
product comparisons and an automated tickler file to follow up on future
customer needs. The sales staff will be alerted to cross-sell opportunities
through prompts suggesting possible product

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                                                               9

needs based on an automated review of a customer's profile. Release dates for
various components of this phase are expected to begin in late 1996.

                         ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS EXPANDED
Nontraditional channels for financial services also are being expanded.
Wachovia On-Call(SM), reached by calling 1-800-WACHOVIA, is promising to become
an important one. The 24-hour, 7-days-a-week telephone sales and service center
is staffed by about 300 experienced bankers. It opened in June 1994 and handled
more than 4 million calls in 1995. On-Call complements the automated Wachovia
Phone Access(R) system, which accommodated an additional 17 million calls
during 1995.

As branch standardization was implemented in the three states, On-Call was
helping to displace branch-based service delivery. However, the menu of
products available through On-Call's telephone bankers is growing and includes
loan origination and deposit account opening. Plans call for greater marketing
of the telephone center in 1996 now that its functionality compares favorably
with branch-based delivery. Wachovia On-Call's servicing proficiency also is
giving branch-based bankers additional time to sell.

Another successful alternative delivery strategy is the workplace deployment of
ATMs. Out of 712 ATMs at the end of 1995, Wachovia had installed 104 in
workplace sites for 84 corporate clients. This has encouraged the movement of
customer relationships to Wachovia. With growing and relevant functionality,
ATM deployment will become even more aggressive.

Wachovia will participate with Visa in a stored-value card pilot program during
the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. These cards can be used in place of
cash at participating merchants and discarded when their value is depleted.
Wachovia's long-term strategy for smart cards also includes the use of this
technology with proprietary debit and credit cards to provide reloading
capability for cards with a stored value feature.

Wachovia is an investor in Security First Network Bank, which made history on
October 18 by becoming the first bank to open on the Internet. Customers can
balance checkbooks, get account information, view images of canceled checks and
pay bills by computer. Through this investment, Wachovia can learn more about
security issues regarding banking on the Internet and gauge customer acceptance
of on-line banking. Wachovia employees also are helping to pilot a home banking
product. Testing with a limited group of customers will occur before offering
the service more widely.

                         COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCT ARSENAL
In the corporate market, Wachovia also has been aggressive in building sales
through its relationship-based strategy. Corporate Services' arsenal of
products, deployed by 1,450 Wachovians, is comprehensive and growing. For
example, a major corporate banking capability is the integration of information
delivery products so customers can receive extensive on-line information from
Wachovia through a single electronic channel called Wachovia Connection(SM).

This Microsoft Windows(TM)-based system is being strengthened to give access to
document images and traditional cash management products on the same platform.
Combined with improved electronic funds transfer capabilities, information and
service delivery products will provide highly integrated, effective solutions
accessed by large and small corporate customers through personal computers,
phone, fax and e-mail.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1995, Wachovia introduced CD-ROM delivery of check images. This innovative
product has been a major success with customers who find the Windows-based
check archive service boosts efficiency and saves cost. On-line access to
intramonth check images, as well as a number of other refinements, are expected
during 1996 to make this attractive product more valuable to customers.

A new wholesale lockbox system will enhance Treasury Services' receivable
processing capabilities. The new system incorporates image technology and a
reengineered work flow to improve service offerings quality and reduce costs.
Customer conversion is under way and should be completed in late 1996. For two
consecutive years, a nationally recognized cash management research
organization has given Wachovia its highest rating in all facets of wholesale
lockbox processing and ranked the corporation's overall treasury services
number one in quality among banks.

An expanded Capital Markets Division is offering a wide array of specialized
corporate finance, international banking, financial institutions and foreign
exchange services. During 1995, Wachovia bankers arranged structured leveraged
lease transactions for municipalities as part of a growing leasing program.
Wachovia is the leading bank distributor of small-issue variable rate demand
bonds and has the largest foreign exchange trading room in the Southeast.

To further bolster marketing and sales efforts and provide management with
comprehensive and precise performance information, Wachovia is redirecting
technology investments into three other critical initiatives. They are the $30
million Consolidated Customer Information File (CCIF), a $20 million new trust
system and the $15 million Performance Measurement System.

                              ROBUST CUSTOMER FILE
Wachovia regularly has been improving a customer information file it introduced
in the 1970s. Looking forward, it was evident that to gain full marketing and
sales value a much different structure and a more robust engine was needed to
help analyze and understand market segments. The assessment led to the
development of the Consolidated Customer Information File.

Good progress has been made in the design of massive relational data bases,
high speed search approaches and data base content capability. This new system
will provide critical information for market segmentation analysis and will be
updated and available continuously for bankers. Real time information will
allow each contact with Wachovia to be tailored to each customer based on all
the institutional knowledge available.

The prospects for this new capability are exciting. An important step toward
developing CCIF and Next Generation Branch Automation was a "share of wallet"
pilot project conducted in Cobb County, Georgia, a fast-growing market in north
Atlanta. In this project, a manual review of customer wallet share information
was correlated to likely product needs. Bankers then met with customers and
through a relationship review process identified and sold appropriate services.

Of the customers contacted, 82 percent agreed to a relationship review with 54
percent purchasing additional services. Wallet share for this group increased
from 10 to 40 percent. These results confirmed the attractive revenue
opportunities available from existing customers through improved automation,
more focused marketing and sales and better use of information. Wachovia plans
to mine its expanded customer data warehouse to better anticipate consumer
demand

for financial services and maximize its effectiveness with targeted segments.

The trust system project is designed to help Wachovia compete more effectively
in wealth management as more Americans move into age groups which tend to save.
Wachovia has been working with Financial Technologies, Inc., and a group of
banks to develop a powerful system to better serve customers and prospects and
the benefit plans offered by employers. Conversion is expected to begin in late
1996.

                      PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT ENHANCEMENT
The corporate wide performance measurement system will provide enhanced
customer, product and organization profitability information. This will assist
business units and product managers in making effective decisions. Both
financial and nonfinancial measures will be utilized to support new and
changing strategies, delivery channels and customer trends.

In addition, investments are being made in Wachovia's credit card technology
platform. Advanced fraud detection and a new payment processing system have
been installed and conversion to new software for basic accounting and
reporting functions is planned.

While Wachovia has an attractive business franchise, it will be alert for
strategic acquisitions, alliances or combinations which broaden product
capability, increase the scale of existing businesses, provide access to a
larger base of customers and increase shareholder value. For example, in
December, Wachovia announced strategic alliances involving its credit card and
corporate trust operations.

Wachovia Bank Card Services and First Data Corporation's Card Establishment
Services consummated a joint venture through which Wachovia will provide
merchant processing services using First Data's advanced technology and greater
product offerings. An alliance with Boston EquiServe Limited Partnership will
give stock transfer customers access to strong operating systems, software and
more service features. Wachovia will continue to maintain all contact with its
trust clients and their shareholders.

Alliances also were formed with two highly regarded international banking
institutions -- The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Bank Mendes
Gans of Amsterdam -- increasing services worldwide for Wachovia's global trade
customers.

At the same time, Wachovia will exit businesses which are not a strategic fit.
In December, Wachovia announced the sale of its bond trustee business to The
Bank of New York with the transaction to be completed in the 1996 second
quarter. The $9 billion residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio was sold
in April 1995 to GE Capital Mortgage Services with proceeds being invested in
various corporate initiatives.

Mergers with other banks have been used by Wachovia in the past as an
opportunity for growth. This option will continue to be carefully evaluated.

                            STRONG CAPITAL POSITION
The ability to grow is directly related to capital. Wachovia remains committed
to the maintenance of a strong capital position which is one of the
organization's greatest strengths. As Wachovia moves ahead with its corporate
strategies and planned investments, the internal capital generation rate may
exceed the needs of its business activities.

Wachovia has authorization to repurchase up to 5

million shares of its common stock not to exceed an investment of $200 million.
As of January 31, 1996, slightly more than one million shares had been
repurchased under this authorization. Repurchase activity is likely to increase
depending on market conditions and other factors related to the corporation's
capital management strategy. Wachovia is dedicated to managing and deploying
capital in a prudent, competent manner designed to enhance shareholder value
over time.

Banking companies face sobering issues and exciting prospects as the financial
services industry continues to evolve. Wachovia is committed to embracing this
period of change, making it work to its advantage and to remaining among the
ranks of leading financial companies. Adjusting to the shifting realities of
the marketplace is not new to Wachovia. Throughout its 116-year history of
excellence, Wachovia has trod new ground while adhering to its fundamental
values and high principles. The people of Wachovia approach the future with
considerable optimism bolstered by a proud history, tactical flexibility,
enviable financial strength, modern technology and strong leadership.


The 28-story Wachovia Center opened in October 1995. The building has
approximately 535,000 square feet of office space and is located within a block
from where Wachovia Bank was founded in 1879.

Results of Operations

1995 vs. 1994

Overview

                           The economy grew at a modest pace in 1995, with
                     inflationary pressures remaining low while consumer
                     spending softened, particularly in the final quarter of
                     the year. Short-term interest rates were reduced twice by
                     Federal Reserve actions in response to the low
                     inflationary environment and slower economic growth.
                     Unemployment for the nation, based on preliminary data,
                     fell to 5.6 percent from 6.1 percent in 1994. Within
                     Wachovia Corporation's primary operating states of
                     Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, economic
                     activity continued to remain relatively strong. Based on
                     preliminary data, unemployment rates for the year were 4.8
                     percent in Georgia, 4.4 percent in North Carolina and 5.1
                     percent in South Carolina.
                           Wachovia Corporation's consolidated net income for
                     1995 totaled $602.543 million or $3.49 per fully diluted
                     share compared with $539.058 million or $3.12 per fully
                     diluted share in 1994. Good growth in net interest income,
                     along with solid gains in other operating revenue,
                     accounted for the earnings increase which was tempered by
                     a higher credit loss provision and a rise in noninterest
                     expense. Net income represented returns of 17.67 percent
                     on shareholders' equity and 1.45 percent on assets
                     compared with 17.41 percent and 1.46 percent,
                     respectively, in 1994. The equity and assets used in
                     calculating these ratios include unrealized gains or
                     losses, net of taxes, on securities available-for-sale.
                           Expanded discussion of operating results and the
                     corporation's financial condition are presented in the
                     following narrative, tables and charts. Interest income is
                     stated on a taxable equivalent basis which is adjusted for
                     the tax-favored status of earnings from certain loans and
                     investments. References to changes in assets and
                     liabilities represent daily average balances unless
                     otherwise noted. The narrative should be read in
                     conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
                     Notes on pages 44 through 63. Expanded six-year financial
                     data appears on pages 64 through 71.

Net Interest Income

                           Taxable equivalent net interest income, the primary
                     source of the corporation's earnings, rose $115.330
                     million or 8.1 percent in 1995 compared with a $41.340
                     million or 3 percent increase in 1994. Strong growth in
                     interest-earning assets, primarily loans, and a higher
                     average rate earned accounted for the earnings gain which
                     was moderated principally by an increase in the average
                     rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The average
                     rate earned on loans, while up in 1995, remained
                     constrained by competitive pricing pressures, particularly
                     in the latter half of the year.
                           The net yield on interest-earning assets (taxable
                     equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average
                     interest-earning assets) declined 18 basis points to 4.16
                     percent, principally reflecting pricing pressure on loan
                     yields as the year progressed, as well as a higher average
                     rate paid on funds. The corporation anticipates pricing
                     pressure on loans to continue in 1996.

Interest Income

                    Taxable equivalent interest income increased $656.049
               million or 26.6 percent, fueled by strong gains in
               interest-earning assets, as well as by a higher average rate
               earned. Average interest-earning assets were up $4.203 billion
               or 12.8 percent, led principally by loans, while the average
               yield rose 92 basis points. In 1994, average interest-earning
               assets increased $3.014 billion or 10.1 percent with the average
               rate earned higher by 5 basis points.
                    Loan growth accelerated in 1995, rising $3.292 billion or
               13.6 percent compared with a gain of $2.667 billion or 12.4
               percent in 1994. Loans were up in both the commercial and retail
               portfolios with commercial activity continuing to account for
               the majority of the increase. Offsetting loan growth for the
               year in the retail sector was the securitization of $500 million
               in credit card receivables in the fourth quarter.
                    Commercial loans, including related real estate categories,
               grew $2.547 billion or 18.9 percent. Gains were led by regular
               commercial loans, associated largely with capital spending and
               inventory building, and by commercial mortgages, with increases
               of $1.787 billion or 24.3 percent and $320 million or 9.5
               percent, respectively. Good gains also occurred in foreign
               loans, reflecting short-term trade financing in Latin America,
               in construction loans for apartments, shopping centers and
               office buildings primarily in Georgia, North Carolina and South
               Carolina, and in lease financing, reflecting some structured
               leverage lease transactions for municipalities.
                    Based on regulatory definitions, commercial real estate
               loans totaled $4.601 billion at December 31, 1995, representing
               15.7 percent of the corporation's loan portfolio. Regulatory
               definitions for commercial real estate include loans which have
               real estate as the collateral but not the primary consideration
               in a credit risk evaluation. Commercial mortgages were $3.855
               billion or 13.2 percent of total loans, and construction loans
               were $746 million or 2.5 percent. Comparable amounts a year 
               earlier were $4.037 billion in commercial real estate loans, 
               representing 15.6 percent of the loan portfolio, with $3.484 
               billion in commercial mortgages and $553 million in construction 
               loans, representing 13.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, 
               of total loans at year-end 1994. The corporation also had 
               cross-border commitments, consisting primarily of loans, of 
               $406 million or .9 percent of total assets at December 31, 1995
               versus $275 million or .7 percent a year earlier. Included in
               the corporation's cross-border commitments were loans and 
               commitments to foreign financial institutions and corporations. 
               There were no loans and commitments to foreign governments at 
               year-end 1995 or 1994.
                    Retail loans, including residential mortgages, expanded
               $745 million or 6.9 percent from 1994 with credit card loans and
               residential mortgages accounting for substantially all the
               increase. Credit card loans were up $423 million or 12 percent.
               Good growth occurred particularly in Wachovia's no annual fee
               credit cards following a national solicitation in the fourth
               quarter. Residential mortgages were higher by $319 million or
               8.6 percent, largely reflecting increased demand in variable
               rate financing. Indirect retail loans,

               which consists primarily of automobile sales financing,
               remained largely unchanged for the year, although moderate gains
               occurred in the latter half of 1995.
                    In the fourth quarter, the corporation securitized $500
               million in credit card receivables. The action was taken to
               further diversify funding sources and as part of overall balance
               sheet management for the corporation. Securitization involves
               the transfer of a pool of assets from the balance sheet to a
               master trust which then issues and sells to investors
               certificates representing a pro rata interest in the underlying
               assets. Interest income is reduced by the removal of the
               securitized receivables from the balance sheet, while interest
               expense associated with their funding also is lowered. The
               provision for loan losses no longer includes amounts associated
               with potential charge-offs for the securitized loans, while
               noninterest income is increased in the form of servicing fees
               and other excess revenue associated with the securitized assets.
               See Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
               additional information.
                    At December 31, 1995, the corporation's managed credit card
               receivables totaled $4.543 billion, including $625 million in
               net securitized loans. Approximately 91 percent of the portfolio
               was variable rate. At year-end 1994, managed credit card
               outstandings were $4.094 billion, which included $125 million in
               net securitized loans, with approximately 90 percent of the
               portfolio variable rate. Managed credit card receivables
               averaged $4.168 billion for the year versus $3.549 billion in
               1994.
                    Investment securities, the second largest category of
               interest-earning assets, increased $657 million or 8.5 percent.
               In the second quarter, the corporation sold $1.950 billion of
               securities available-for-sale at a loss, reinvesting the
               proceeds in higher-yielding investments to enhance the overall
               yield of the portfolio. Also in the fourth quarter, securities
               held-to-maturity with a book value of $2.720 billion and a
               market value of $2.774 billion were reclassified as securities
               available-for-sale following issuance by the Financial
               Accounting Standards Board of "A Guide to Implementation of 
               Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt 
               and Equity Securities." Under the implementation guide, 
               business entities were allowed a one-time opportunity
               to reclassify investment securities effective for year-end 1995
               financial statements. The corporation took the reclassification
               action primarily to provide additional flexibility in managing
               the investment securities portfolio.
                    At December 31, 1995, securities available-for-sale totaled
               $7.410 billion and securities held-to-maturity were $1.619
               billion. Average securities available-for-sale marked to fair
               market value had an unrealized gain of $34.248 million, pretax,
               and $21.021 million, net of tax, from changes in market value.
               The unrealized gain is reported, net of tax, as part of
               shareholders' equity. The investment grade of the corporation's
               municipal portfolio remained good with 94.7 percent of the
               portfolio rated A or better by Moody's at year-end 1995 compared
               with 96.6 percent at the close of 1994.

Interest Expense

                    Interest expense for the year was higher by $540.719
               million or 52.1 percent, principally reflecting the impact of a
               122 basis point rise in the average cost of funds. Higher levels
               of interest-bearing liabilities, up $4.149 billion or 15.1
               percent, also contributed to the expense increase. Growth in
               interest-bearing liabilities occurred primarily in
               interest-bearing time deposits and in short-term bank notes,
               which are classified as part of other short-term borrowings.
               Largely reflecting this growth, funding from additional
               short-term sources and from long-term debt rose more moderately
               in 1995.
                    Interest-bearing time deposits expanded $2.029 billion or
               12 percent. Savings certificates led the increase, rising $1.156
               billion or 21.7 percent. Good growth, particularly in the latter
               half of the year, also occurred in savings and money market
               savings, in foreign time deposits and in large denomination
               certificates, which partially reflected more attractive pricing 
               due to a reduction in associated deposit insurance premiums. 
               The increase in savings certificates and in savings and money 
               market savings reflected both the success of a sale in March of 
               10-month and three-year certificates of deposit and of growth 
               in Wachovia's Premier money market account. The one-day 
               certificate sale, offered at limited branches in the 
               corporation's primary markets, attracted over $1 billion in
               deposits, with approximately 86 percent representing new money.
               About 28,000 new account relationships were generated from the
               approximately 77,000 accounts participating in the sale.
                    Short-term borrowings for the year increased $1.568 billion
               or 25.1 percent with other short-term borrowings, principally
               short-term bank notes, accounting for most of the growth.

               and securities sold under repurchase agreements expanded
               modestly, while commercial paper borrowings were unchanged.
               Short-term bank notes are part of Wachovia Bank of North
               Carolina's ongoing bank note program. Under the program, which
               was revised in the fourth quarter of 1995, the bank can issue
               and have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of up to $6
               billion of notes with maturities of 270 days or less and can
               issue an aggregate principal amount of up to $10 billion of
               notes with maturities longer than 270 days. Note terms may range
               from 30 days to 15 years. Bank notes with original maturities of
               one year or less are included in other short-term borrowings and
               were issued beginning in the fourth quarter of 1994. Notes with
               maturities greater than one year are medium-term bank notes,
               classified as part of long-term debt. At December 31, 1995,
               short-term bank notes outstanding totaled $1.413 billion with an
               average cost of 5.86 percent and an average maturity of 1.04
               months. This compared with outstandings of $456 million with an
               average cost of 6.13 percent and an average maturity of 4.15
               months at fourth quarter-close 1994.
                    Long-term debt rose $552 million or 12.7 percent.
               Medium-term bank notes were higher by $341 million or 9.7
               percent, while other long-term debt increased $211 million or
               25.5 percent. Medium-term bank notes totaled $4.088 billion at
               December 31, 1995 with an average cost of 5.77 percent and an
               average maturity of 1.23 years versus $3.953 billion in
               outstandings with an average cost of 5.31 percent and an average
               maturity of 1.73 years at year-end 1994. Other long-term debt
               includes the issuance in the fourth quarter of $250 million in
               30-year subordinated debentures. The notes have a 10-year put
               option and were priced at par to yield 6.605 percent or 47.5
               basis points above comparable 10-year Treasuries.
                    Gross deposits averaged $24.262 billion versus $22.315
               billion in 1994, an increase of $1.947 billion or 8.7 percent.
               Collected deposits, net of float, averaged $22.498 billion, up
               $1.807 billion or 8.7 percent from $20.691 billion in the year
               earlier.

Asset and Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity
Management

                    The goal of asset and liability management is to maintain
               high quality and consistent growth of net interest income with
               acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates. The
               corporation seeks to meet this goal by influencing the maturity
               and repricing characteristics of the various lending and deposit
               taking lines of business, by managing discretionary balance
               sheet asset and liability portfolios and by utilizing
               off-balance sheet financial instruments.
                    Interest rate risk management is carried out by Funds
               Management which operates under policies established by the
               Finance Committee of the corporation's board of directors and
               the guidance of the Management Finance Committee. Rate risk,
               liquidity, capital positions and discretionary on- and
               off-balance sheet activity is reviewed quarterly by the Board
               Finance Committee. Interim oversight of the asset and liability
               function is provided through regular bimonthly meetings of Funds
               Management managers and the Chief Financial Officer. Funds
               Management personnel carry out day-to-day activity within
               approved risk management guidelines and strategies.
                    The corporation uses a number of tools to measure interest
               rate risk, including monitoring the difference or gap between
               rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods,
               monitoring the change in present value of the asset and
               liability portfolios under various rate scenarios and simulating
               net interest income under the same rate scenarios. The rate
               sensitivity gap table on page 22 sets forth the volume of
               interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
               outstanding as of year-ends 1995 and 1994, which mature or are
               projected to reprice in each of the future time periods shown.
               The projected asset repricing volumes include management
               assumptions of prepayments of mortgage related assets and
               automobile financing. Also, the projected interest checking and
               savings repricing volumes are based on management's assumptions
               of the expected rate sensitivity of these accounts in
               relationship to the prime rate. The sensitivity assumptions for
               these two deposit accounts were reduced somewhat in 1995 
               compared with 1994. Inclusion of the impact of these management
               assumptions in the gap analysis table presents a more accurate 
               view of the corporation's rate risk position. The section on 
               nonsensitive and maturities beyond one year includes bank 
               credit card loans of $447 million in 1995 and $404 million in 
               1994, savings balances of $850 million in 1995 and $676 million
               in 1994 and interest-bearing checking balances of $2.399 
               billion in 1995 and $2.115 billion in 1994.

              Management believes that rate risk is best measured by            
         simulation modeling which calculates expected net interest            
         income based on projected interest-earning assets,                    
         interest-bearing liabilities, off-balance sheet financial             
         instruments and interest rates. The                                   
         corporation monitors exposure to a gradual change in rates of         
         200 basis points up or down over a rolling 12-month period and    
         an interest rate shock of an instantaneous change in rates of
         200 basis points up or down over the same period. From time to    
         time, the model horizon is expanded to a 24-month period. The     
         corporation policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net   
         interest income from a gradual change in interest rates of 2      
         percentage points over 12 months is 7.5 percent. Management       
         generally has maintained a risk position well within the policy   
         guideline level. As of December 31, 1995, the model indicated     
         the impact of a 2 percentage point gradual rise in rates over 12  
         months would approximate a .25 percent increase in net interest   
         income, while a 2 percentage point decline in rates over the      
         same period would approximate a .55 percent decrease from an      
         unchanged rate environment.                                       
              In addition to on-balance sheet instruments such as          
         investment securities and purchased funds, the corporation uses   
         off-balance sheet derivative instruments to manage interest rate  
         risk, liquidity and net interest

                    income. Off-balance sheet instruments include interest rate
               swaps, futures and options with indices that directly correlate
               to on-balance sheet instruments. The corporation has used
               off-balance sheet financial instruments, principally interest
               rate swaps, over a number of years and believes their use on a
               sound basis enhances the effectiveness of asset and liability
               and interest rate sensitivity management.
                    Off-balance sheet asset and liability derivative
               transactions are based on referenced or notional amounts.
               Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119, "Disclosure
               about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of
               Financial Instruments" (FASB 119), distinguishes between
               derivative financial instruments held or issued for trading
               purposes and those held or issued for purposes other than
               trading, including risk management. Note J in Notes to
               Consolidated Financial Statements contains disclosures regarding
               off-balance sheet financial instruments held for risk management
               purposes, while disclosures regarding instruments held for
               trading are included in Note I.
                    At December 31, 1995, the corporation had $2.345 billion
               notional amount of derivatives outstanding for asset and
               liability management purposes. Interest rate swaps were $1.320
               billion or 56 percent of the total notional amount, while
               futures represented the remaining amount. Details on the
               maturity schedule on asset and liability management derivatives

                    Credit risk of off-balance sheet derivative financial
               instruments is equal to the fair value gain of the instrument if
               a counterparty fails to perform. The credit risk is normally a
               small percentage of the notional amount and fluctuates as
               interest rates move up or down. The corporation mitigates this
               risk by subjecting the transactions to the same rigorous
               approval and monitoring process as is used for on-balance sheet
               credit transactions, by dealing in the national market with
               highly rated counterparties, by executing all transactions under
               International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master
               Agreements and by using collateral instruments to reduce
               exposure. Collateral is delivered by either party when the fair
               value of a particular transaction or


                                                                              23

               group of transactions with the same counterparty on a net
               basis exceeds an acceptable threshold of exposure. The threshold
               level is determined based on the strength of the individual
               counterparty.
                    The fair value of all asset and liability derivative
               positions for which the corporation was exposed to
               counterparties totaled $21.284 million at December 31, 1995. The
               fair value of all asset and liability derivative positions for
               which counterparties were exposed to the corporation amounted to
               $14.411 million on the same date. Details of the net fair value
               gain of $6.873 million are included in Note J of Notes to
               Consolidated Financial Statements.
                    Asset and liability derivative transactions are accounted
               for following hedge accounting rules. Accordingly, gains and
               losses related to the fair value of derivative contracts used
               for asset and liability management purposes are not immediately
               recognized in earnings. If the hedged or altered balance sheet
               amounts were marked to market, the resulting unrealized balance
               sheet gains or losses could be expected to offset unrealized
               derivatives gains and losses.
                    The corporation uses derivative financial contracts to (1)
               swap floating rate assets or liabilities to fixed rate; (2)
               convert fixed rate assets or liabilities to floating rate; (3)
               hedge the interest rate spread between assets and liabilities;
               and (4) hedge the yield or rate on future transactions. These
               transactions serve to better match the repricing characteristics
               of various assets and liabilities, reduce spread risk, adjust
               overall rate sensitivity and enhance net interest income.

                    Changing the repricing characteristics of liabilities to
               match the assets they support generally is accomplished through
               an interest rate swap whereby the corporation pays a fixed rate
               and receives a floating rate. This allows the corporation to
               acquire fixed rate assets without increasing exposure to rising
               interest rates. Converting fixed rate debt to a floating rate is
               accomplished generally by receiving fixed on an interest rate
               swap and paying floating. The corporation has used this type of
               transaction to convert long-term subordinated debt to a floating
               rate. This transaction increases liquidity by allowing a
               long-term liability to replace a short-term liability, yet have
               a rate that is consistent with and fluctuates with short-term
               rates. Receiving a fixed rate on an interest rate swap and
               paying a floating rate has the effect of converting floating
               rate assets to fixed rate assets. The results are essentially
               the same as acquiring a fixed rate security funded with a
               floating rate liability. Both transactions reduce asset
               sensitivity. The corporation has used this type of transaction
               to convert a portion of the floating rate credit card portfolio
               to fixed rates.
                    Hedging the spread between the rate received and the rate
               paid on certain assets and liabilities can be achieved by the
               use of options contracts such as caps and floors. Changes in the
               yield or rate on anticipated future transactions can be hedged
               by purchasing or selling futures contracts on which change in
               price is highly correlated with the anticipated transaction. The
               corporation has used both futures contracts and options
               contracts to hedge spreads and anticipated transactions.
                    The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the
               corporation is positioned to meet all immediate and future
               demands for cash. Liquidity management relies upon liquidity
               analysis, knowledge of historical trends over past credit and
               business cycles and forecasts of future conditions to achieve
               its objectives. The two broad-based sources of liquidity which
               exist for the corporation are its high quality marketable or
               securitizable assets, along with liabilities which are readily
               accepted in the marketplace. Asset liquidity is provided by
               securities which, by their maturity structure or marketability,
               can produce cash flows that result in enhanced liquidity and by
               loans which may be securitized. The corporation generates
               additional cash through the liability side of the balance 
               sheet from the growth of deposits and the issuance of bank notes
               and other forms of debt securities.
                    Wachovia's ability to attract a variety of funds rests on
               the corporation's strength of capital, reputation, credit
               ratings, high quality assets and diverse statewide banking
               networks. At December 31, 1995, Wachovia's common equity
               represented 8.39 percent of assets, 5th highest among the 25
               largest U.S. banking companies. Wachovia's strong capital
               position is reflected in its credit ratings and remains central
               to its ability to raise additional funds at attractive rates
               through short-term borrowings and long-term debt. At year-end
               1995, the corporation's senior debt was rated (P)Aa3 by Moody's
               and (P)AA by Standard & Poor's. Subordinated debt was rated A1
               and AA- by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively.
               Commercial paper was rated P-1 by Moody's and A-1+ by Standard &
               Poor's.
                    In addition to seeking to maintain liquidity through a
               strong balance sheet and performance that assures market
               acceptance, the corporation limits, through policy and internal
               guidelines which are subject to periodic review and revision,
               the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance
               sheet and the concentrations of funding from noncore sources.
               Purchased funds currently are limited to 40 percent of total
               assets by policy. Internal management guidelines currently are
               substantially below the policy limit. To insure against
               concentrations by maturity or type of funding source, the
               corporation also has established policy limits for the
               percentage of purchased funds from individual categories of
               liabilities to no more than 20 percent of assets. The percentage
               of purchased funds maturing overnight, within 30 days, within 90
               days and within 180 days also are limited by policy. In
               addition, management monitors significant concentrations of
               funds from single deposit or borrowing sources. Asset liquidity
               is assured through maintaining significant amounts of investment
               securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. These securities
               may be sold at any time to provide needed liquidity or for other
               reasons. Liquidity also is available from loan assets which are
               readily securitizable.
                    Management regularly reviews the liquidity position under
               normal business conditions and under significant market
               disruption or stress conditions. Results of these reviews are 
               presented to the Management Finance Committee and Board Finance
               Committee quarterly.


                                                                              25

Nonperforming Assets

                    Nonperforming assets were $69.364 million or .24 percent of
               loans and foreclosed property at December 31, 1995. The total
               was lower by $31.153 million or 31 percent from a year earlier.
               Declines occurred in each quarter throughout the year primarily
               due to paydowns by borrowers, the return of cash-basis assets to
               accrual status and sales of foreclosed property. The corporation
               historically has maintained relatively low levels of problem
               assets reflecting its strong underwriting standards, consistent
               credit reviews and aggressive loan charge-off policy.
                    Real estate nonperforming assets, the largest category of
               total nonperforming assets, were $55.181 million or .63 percent
               of real estate loans and foreclosed real estate at December 31,
               1995. This compared with $68.353 million or .87 percent at
               year-end 1994, a decrease of $13.172 million or 19.3 percent.
               The total at December 31, 1995 included $43.576 million of real
               estate nonperforming loans versus $49.479 million at fourth
               quarter-close 1994.
                    Commercial real estate nonperforming assets were $30.910
               million or .67 percent of related loans and foreclosed real
               estate, down $12.489 million or 28.8 percent from $43.399
               million or 1.07 percent at year-end 1994. Commercial real estate
               nonperforming loans included in these totals were $27.163
               million at December 31, 1995 and $35.885 million a year earlier.

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

                    The provision for loan losses was $103.791 million, higher
               by $32.028 million or 44.6 percent from $71.763 million in 1994.
               The provision reflects management's assessment of the adequacy
               of the allowance for loan losses to absorb potential write-offs
               in the loan portfolio due to a deterioration in credit
               conditions or change in risk profile. Factors considered in this
               assessment include growth and mix of the loan portfolio, current
               and anticipated economic conditions, historical credit loss
               experience and changes in borrowers' financial positions. The
               provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs in 1995 by
               $2.676 million.
                    Net loan losses for the year totaled $101.115 million or
               .37 percent of average loans, an increase of $30.686 million or
               43.6 percent from $70.429 million or .29 percent of average
               loans in 1994. The rise primarily reflected higher charge-offs
               in consumer lending, particularly credit cards and other retail
               loans, as well as a more moderate increase in loan recoveries.
               Loan recoveries represented 24.8 percent of gross charge-offs
               versus 31.4 percent in 1994. Excluding credit cards, net loan
               losses totaled $12.100 million or .05 percent of average related
               loans for the year compared with $11.995 million or .06 percent
               in 1994, an increase of $105 thousand or less than 1 percent.
                    Credit card net charge-offs were $89.015 million or 2.25
               percent of average credit card loans, higher by $30.581 million
               or 52.3 percent from $58.434 million or 1.66 percent of average
               loans in 1994. Managed credit card loan losses, including
               securitized credit card outstandings, totaled $93.372 million or
               2.24 percent of average managed receivables. This compared with
               $58.485 million in managed net charge-offs or 1.65 percent of
               average managed outstandings in 1994.
                    Other retail loans, consisting of direct and indirect
               retail lending, had net loan losses of $11.336 million or .36
               percent of average related loans, an increase of $3.883 million
               or 52.1 percent from $7.453 million or .23 percent a year
               earlier. Real estate loans had net recoveries of $1.875 million
               or .02 percent of average real estate loans compared with net 
               recoveries of $5.310 million or .07 percent in 1994, a decrease 
               of $3.435 million or 64.7 percent.
                    At December 31, 1995, the allowance for loan losses totaled
               $408.808 million, representing 1.40 percent of year-end loans
               and 763 percent coverage of nonperforming loans. Comparable
               amounts a year earlier were $406.132 million, 1.57 percent and
               516 percent, respectively.
                    The corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
               Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors
               for Impairment of a Loan" (FASB 114) on January 1, 1995. The
               standard requires that a loan meeting the definition of
               impairment be measured at the present value of expected future
               cash flows using the loan's effective interest rate, or as a
               practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or
               the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
               dependent. A loan is impaired when, based on current information
               and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to
               collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
               the loan agreement. At December 31, 1995, the portion of the
               allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans as defined
               by FASB 114 was $916 thousand.

  *Includes the related allowance for credit losses for impaired loans as defined in FASB 114, "Accounting
   by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," of $916 at December 31, 1995
 **Earnings before income taxes and provision for loan losses excluding mortgage servicing portfolio sale, 
   subsidiary sale and securities transactions
***The allocation of the allowance for loan losses above represents an estimate based on historical loss 
   experience, individual credits, economic conditions and other judgmental factors. Since any allocation 
   is judgmental and involves consideration of many factors, the allocation may be more or less than the 
   charge-offs that may ultimately occur. The entire allowance is available for charge-offs in any 
   category of loans.  See page 71 for percentages of loan categories to total loans.

Noninterest Income

                    Total other operating revenue, which excludes the gain from
               the sale of the corporation's mortgage servicing portfolio as
               well as sales of investment securities and subsidiaries, rose
               $75.669 million or 12.5 percent for the year. The increase was
               fueled primarily by good gains in deposit account service
               charges and credit card fee income, expanded trading account
               profits and solid growth in investment fee income, electronic
               banking services and other income, including revenues from the
               Capital Markets Group. In the fourth quarter of 1995, the
               corporation reclassified foreign exchange income from other
               income to trading account profits. The corporation also restated
               other service charges and fees to separately identify revenues
               generated from electronic banking services and investment fee
               income. Prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the
               reclassifications.
                    Service charges on deposit accounts were up $12.964 million
               or 6.6 percent. Higher revenues from overdraft and insufficient
               fund charges largely accounted for the increase. Gains also
               occurred in savings account service charges and in commercial
               account analysis fees, particularly in the closing months of the
               year. The level of corporate service activities expanded in
               1995, however, most of the gains were compensated by increased
               credit given for commercial deposit account balances.
                    Credit card fee income rose $12.357 million or 11 percent.
               Gains reflected excess revenues received from cardholder
               payments on the corporation's securitized loans along with
               higher levels of cardholder interchange income, net merchant
               discount income and overlimit charges. At year-end 1995,
               Wachovia had 1.805 million active credit card accounts,
               including those under management, an increase of 122 thousand or
               7.2 percent from 1.683 million a year earlier.
                    Trading account profits were up $16.196 million. Gains
               reflected stronger profits from foreign exchange trading as well
               as improved bond market conditions with lower yields on
               government and municipal securities resulting in favorable
               pricing. For the year 1995, trading account profits were
               comprised of trading profits of $11.209 million,
               foreign exchange income of $12.416 million and derivatives
               valuation of $2.073 million.
                    Investment fee income, consisting primarily of fees from
               mutual funds, variable rate demand bonds, brokerage commissions,
               private placements and loan syndications, rose $12.861 million
               or 91.3 percent. Good gains in mutual fund activities, loan
               syndications, brokerage commissions and public finance fees
               largely accounted for the increase. At December 31, 1995, the
               corporation's Biltmore family of mutual funds totaled $2.905
               billion compared with $2.209 billion at year-end 1994.
                    Electronic banking service revenues, comprised principally
               of fees from ATM and debit card usage, expanded $9.796 million
               or 39.7 percent, reflecting greater usage of these cards.

                    Trust service fees rose modestly by $2.421 million or
               slightly under 2 percent for the year. Moderate gains in
               personal trust fees helped to offset softness in corporate trust
               revenues. Trust assets at December 31, 1995 totaled $90.144
               billion, including $20.226 billion under management. At year-end
               1994, total trust assets were $78.972 billion, including $17.084
               billion under management.
                    Mortgage fee income decreased $9.904 million or 29.8
               percent, principally reflecting the loss of servicing fee income
               due to the sale of the corporation's $9 billion residential
               mortgage servicing portfolio in April. The corporation sold its
               mortgage servicing portfolio based on a strategic analysis of
               the future of the servicing business, competitive industry
               trends and the long-term needs for technology investments.
               Proceeds from the sale are being invested in programs to enhance
               future growth and productivity including the corporation's Next
               Generation Branch Automation, upgrades to customer information
               databases and major refinements to financial systems for
               performance measurement. Lower origination fees also accounted
               for the decline in mortgage fee income. Loan originations in
               1995 totaled $1.316 billion compared with $1.429 billion in
               1994.
                    Remaining combined categories of other operating revenue
               increased $18.978 million or 21.9 percent. Insurance premiums
               and commissions were higher by $1.485 million or 12.7 percent,
               while bankers' acceptance and letter of credit fees remained
               largely unchanged. Other income rose $10.898 million or 32.2
               percent, largely reflecting higher revenues from Wachovia's
               Capital Markets Group. Other income also included contractual
               servicing revenue from the corporation's securitized credit card
               portfolio of $3.350 million in 1995 versus $257 thousand in
               1994.
                    Including the sale of the corporation's mortgage servicing
               portfolio and sales of investment securities, total noninterest
               income was up $127.880 million or 21 percent. The second quarter
               sale of the mortgage servicing portfolio resulted in a pretax
               gain of $79.025 million or $47.385 million, aftertax. Investment
               securities sales had a net loss of $23.494 million for the year,
               resulting largely from the corporation's decision to restructure
               its securities portfolio in the second quarter by selling $1.950
               billion of securities available-for-sale at a loss and 
               reinvesting the proceeds in higher yielding investments.

Noninterest Expense

                    Total noninterest expense was up $105.183 million or 9.6
               percent for the year, reflecting moderate increases in personnel
               expense and combined net occupancy and equipment expense along
               with higher spending associated primarily with the corporation's
               ongoing strategic initiatives. Measured as a percentage of total
               adjusted revenues (taxable equivalent net interest income and
               total other operating revenue), noninterest spending in 1995
               remained essentially flat with 1994 with an overhead ratio of
               54.2 percent versus 54.1 percent in the prior year.
                    Total personnel expense grew $36.819 million or 6.5
               percent. Salaries expense increased $33.940 million or 7.3
               percent due largely to higher base salaries and greater use of
               incentive pay for increased sales efforts, as well as to
               severance compensation for continued consolidation efforts.
               Employee benefits expense was up $2.879 million or 2.9 percent,
               with increases in line with growth in salaries.
                    Combined net occupancy and equipment expense climbed $9.387
               million or 5 percent. Net occupancy expense was up $6.194
               million or 7.7 percent due largely to higher maintenance,
               renovation and operating premise lease expenses. Equipment
               expense grew $3.193 million or 3 percent, in large part
               reflecting increases in depreciation expense for the rollout of
               the corporation's Next Generation Branch Automation equipment.
                    Remaining combined categories of noninterest expense rose
               $58.977 million or 17 percent. Expenses for professional
               services increased $18.990 million or 92.7 percent, driven
               principally by consulting fees associated

               with the corporation's strategic initiatives. Advertising
               and sales promotion expense was up $16.295 million or 47.8
               percent primarily reflecting costs for expanded credit card
               solicitations. Outside data processing, programming and software
               expense grew $7.275 million or 20.7 percent due largely to
               increased costs for external programming services, higher volume
               of treasury cash services operations and amortization of
               externally purchased software. The corporation's foreclosed
               property expense totaled $920 thousand for the year versus a net
               gain of $4.288 million in 1994.
                    In the third quarter of 1995, the Federal Deposit Insurance
               Corporation reduced deposit insurance premiums paid by banking
               companies retroactive to June 1, 1995. The rate assessed for
               well-capitalized banks decreased from $.23 to $.04 per $100 of
               deposits resulting in a refund of $13.173 million to the
               corporation. In the same quarter, the corporation made an
               accrual of $8.581 million for a probable one-time Savings
               Association Insurance Fund assessment.


Income Taxes

                    Applicable income taxes for the year were up $43.901 
               million or 19.7 percent. Income taxes computed at the statutory
               rate are reduced primarily by the interest earned on state and 
               municipal debt securities and industrial revenue obligations.  
               Also, within certain limitations, one-half of the interest 
               income on qualifying employee stock ownership plan loans is 
               exempt from federal taxes. The interest earned on state and 
               municipal debt instruments is exempt from federal taxes and, 
               except for out-of-state issues, from Georgia and North Carolina 
               taxes as well, and results in substantial interest savings for 
               local governments and their constituents.

Shareholders' Equity and Capital Ratios

                    At December 31, 1995, shareholders' equity was $3.774
               billion, higher by $487 million or 14.8 percent from $3.287
               billion at year-end 1994. Included in the December 31, 1995
               total was $116.113 million, net of tax, of unrealized gains on
               securities available-for-sale marked to fair market value under
               Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting
               for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB
               115) versus $37.635 million, net of tax, of unrealized losses at
               year-end 1994. Shareholders' equity for the year averaged $3.410
               billion compared with $3.096 billion in 1994, an increase of
               $314 million or 10.1 percent with unrealized gains of $21.021
               million, net of tax, included in the 1995 average versus
               unrealized losses of $7.561 million, net of tax, for 1994.
               Wachovia's book value at December 31, 1995 was $22.15, an
               increase of 15.2 percent from $19.23 per share at year-end 1994.
               The corporation's internal capital generation rate (net income
               less dividends as a percentage of average equity) increased to
               10.8 percent from 10.6 percent in 1994.
                    The corporation was authorized by the board of directors on
               July 28, 1995 to repurchase up to 5 million shares of its common
               stock. The authorization replaced an earlier action on July 22,
               1994 to repurchase the same number of shares. Repurchased shares
               will be used for various corporate purposes, including share
               issuance for the corporation's employee stock plans and dividend
               reinvestment plan. In 1995, the corporation repurchased a total
               of 1,755,500 shares under the new and previous authorizations at
               an average price of $36.745 per share for a total cost of
               $64.506 million. As of December 31, 1995, a total of 4,600,000
               shares remained available for repurchase under the new
               authorization. On January 26, 1996, the corporation announced
               that, depending on market conditions and other factors related
               to management of its capital, share repurchase activity may
               increase significantly in 1996. This possibly could result in
               approximately 3 million fewer average shares outstanding for the
               year than in 1995.  Share repurchase activity will remain
               governed by the corporation's capital management strategy to
               deploy capital in a prudent and competent manner designed to 
               enhance shareholder value over the long-term.

                           Intangible assets totaled $39.093 million at
                     December 31, 1995, consisting of $29.472 million in
                     goodwill, $6.932 million in deposit base intangibles,
                     $1.422 million in purchased credit card intangibles and
                     $1.267 million in other intangible assets. In April, the
                     corporation sold its mortgage servicing portfolio with
                     associated mortgage servicing rights of $31.903 million at
                     March 31, 1995. At year-end 1994, intangible assets were
                     $78.408 million, with $34.477 million in mortgage
                     servicing rights, $30.961 million in goodwill, $8.574
                     million in deposit base intangibles, $2.712 million in
                     purchased credit card intangibles and $1.684 million in
                     other intangibles.
                           Regulatory agencies divide capital into Tier I
                     (consisting of shareholders' equity less ineligible
                     intangible assets) and Tier II (consisting of the
                     allowable portion of the reserve for loan losses and
                     certain long-term debt) and measure capital adequacy by
                     applying both capital levels to a banking company's
                     risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items.
                     Regulatory requirements presently specify that Tier I
                     capital should exclude the market appreciation or
                     depreciation of securities available-for-sale arising from
                     valuation adjustments under FASB 115. In addition to these
                     capital ratios, regulatory agencies have established a
                     Tier I leverage ratio which measures Tier I capital to
                     average assets less ineligible intangible assets.
                           Regulatory guidelines require a minimum of total
                     capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 8 percent with
                     one-half consisting of tangible common shareholders'
                     equity and a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 3 percent.
                     Banks which meet or exceed a Tier I ratio of 6 percent, a
                     total capital ratio of 10 percent and a Tier I leverage
                     ratio of 5 percent are considered well capitalized by
                     regulatory standards.
                           At December 31, 1995, Wachovia's Tier I to
                     risk-adjusted assets ratio was 9.43 percent with total
                     capital 13.64 percent of risk-adjusted assets. The
                     corporation's Tier I leverage ratio was 8.36 percent.

Dividends

                           Cash dividends paid in 1995 totaled $235.495
                     million, an increase of $24.992 million or 11.9 percent
                     from $210.503 million paid in 1994. The payout ratio of
                     cash dividends paid to net income was 39.1 percent in both
                     1995 and 1994. Cash dividends paid per common share
                     totaled $1.38, up 12.2 percent from $1.23 per common share
                     paid in 1994.
                           At its meeting on January 26, 1996, the
                     corporation's board of directors declared a first quarter
                     dividend of $.36 per share, payable March 1 to
                     shareholders of record on February 6, 1996. The dividend
                     represents an increase of 9.1 percent from $.33 per share
                     paid in the same period of 1995.

Fourth Quarter Analysis

                           The corporation's net income per fully diluted share
                     was $.85 in the fourth quarter of 1995, a gain of 2.7
                     percent from $.82 in the same three months a year earlier.
                     Net income totaled $146.198 million, up $4.072 million or
                     2.9 percent from $142.126 million, and represented
                     annualized returns of 16.36 percent on shareholders'
                     equity and 1.35 percent on assets.
                           Taxable equivalent net interest income rose $19.737
                     million or 5.3 percent largely reflecting good gains in
                     interest-earning assets moderated by increased funding
                     costs and higher levels of interest-bearing liabilities.
                     Average loans grew $3.180 billion or 12.6 percent and
                     included the impact of a $500 million credit card
                     securitization. Gains were led by regular commercial
                     loans, up $1.469 billion or 18.6 percent, residential
                     mortgages, higher by $406 million or 10.8 percent, and
                     commercial mortgages, which increased $342 million or 9.9
                     percent. Average investment securities expanded $1.094
                     billion or 14.4 percent. The corporation

                     reclassified $2.720 billion of securities held-to-maturity 
                     as securities available-for-sale under a one-time 
                     allowance permitted by the Financial Accounting Standards 
                     Board for year-end 1995 financial statements.
                           The provision for loan losses was $30.172 million,
                     an increase of $10.633 million or 54.4 percent from
                     $19.539 million a year earlier. Net loan loses were
                     $30.048 million or .42 percent of average loans annualized
                     compared with $19.412 million or .31 percent in the same
                     three months of 1994. The rise reflected higher
                     charge-offs, principally in credit cards and other retail
                     loans, as well as more moderate loan recoveries. Excluding
                     credit cards, net charge-offs for the fourth period
                     totaled $4.121 million or .07 percent of average related
                     loans compared with $2.656 million or .05 percent in 1994.
                           Credit card net loan losses were $25.927 million or
                     2.73 percent of average credit card loans for the period
                     versus $16.756 million or 1.76 percent in the 1994 fourth
                     quarter. On a managed basis credit card net charge-offs,
                     including securitized loans, were $29.164 million or 2.72
                     percent compared with $16.799 million or 1.73 percent a
                     year earlier. Other retail loans, consisting of direct and
                     indirect retail lending, had net loan losses of $3.834
                     million or .47 percent of average related loans versus
                     $2.289 million or .29 percent in the same three months of
                     1994.
                           Other operating revenue expanded $31.566 million or
                     20.4 percent. Solid growth occurred in all major
                     categories except mortgage fee income which declined from
                     the prior year primarily due to the April sale of the
                     corporation's mortgage servicing portfolio and loss of
                     associated servicing income. Deposit account service
                     charges were up $6.958 million or 14.4 percent, while
                     trust fee revenues increased $3.404 million or 10.9
                     percent. Credit card fee income was higher by $2.091
                     million or 6.9 percent and included excess revenues
                     received from cardholder payments on the corporation's
                     securitized loan portfolio. Investment fee income,
                     consisting of fees from mutual funds, loan syndications,
                     brokerage commissions, variable rate demand bonds and
                     private placements, rose $4.127 million or 116.1 percent.

                     million and include foreign exchange revenue, classified
                     prior to year-end 1995 financial statements as part of
                     other income. Prior period amounts have been restated for
                     the reclassification.
                           Total noninterest expense was higher by $32.540
                     million or 11.5 percent, primarily reflecting investment
                     spending associated with the corporation's ongoing
                     strategic initiatives. Total personnel expense rose
                     $10.512 million or 7.4 percent with increases in salaries
                     expense moderated by lower employee benefit costs.
                     Combined net occupancy and equipment expense was up $3.846
                     million or 7.9 percent, principally due to renovations and
                     continued rollout of Next Generation Branch Automation
                     equipment. Remaining combined categories of noninterest
                     expense grew $18.182 million or 19.7 percent. Advertising
                     and sales promotion expense increased $9.920 million or
                     142.8 percent, reflecting costs for expanded national
                     credit card solicitations in the period. Expenses for
                     professional services were higher by $8.383 million or
                     128.2 percent, primarily due to consulting fees for
                     ongoing strategic initiatives.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1994 vs. 1993

                           Consolidated net income for 1994 was $539.058
                     million or $3.12 per fully diluted share compared with
                     $492.095 million or $2.81 per fully diluted share in 1993.
                     The earnings gain reflected strong loan growth, good
                     expense control and lower credit loss costs, along with a
                     modest increase in other operating revenue. Net income
                     represented returns of 17.41 percent on shareholders'
                     equity and 1.46 percent on assets versus 17.13 percent and
                     1.46 percent, respectively, in 1993.
                           Taxable equivalent net interest income increased
                     $41.340 million or 3 percent. Growth in interest-earning
                     assets primarily fueled the gain which was offset
                     partially by higher levels of interest-bearing liabilities
                     and an increase in the average cost of funds. The net
                     yield on interest-earning assets declined 30 basis points.
                           Taxable equivalent interest income rose $240.716
                     million or 10.8 percent. Average interest-earning assets
                     were higher by $3.014 billion or 10.1 percent led by
                     loans, which expanded $2.667 billion or 12.4 percent for
                     the year. The commercial loan portfolio, including related
                     real estate categories, grew $1.549 billion or 13 percent,
                     reflecting gains largely in regular commercial loans and
                     commercial mortgages. Retail loans,


                                                                              39

                     including residential mortgages, were higher by
                     $1.118 billion or 11.6 percent, with credit cards and
                     indirect retail loans accounting for the majority of the
                     growth.
                           Interest expense increased $199.376 million or 23.8
                     percent. Average interest-bearing liabilities were up
                     $3.016 billion or 12.3 percent while the average rate paid
                     rose 34 basis points. Growth in interest-bearing
                     liabilities occurred primarily in long-term debt and in
                     short-term borrowings, up $2.277 billion or 109.8 percent
                     and $827 million or 15.3 percent, respectively. Total
                     interest-bearing time deposits were largely unchanged. The
                     increase in long-term debt principally was due to
                     continued expansion of medium-term bank notes. The notes
                     are part of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina's ongoing bank
                     note program, consisting of short- and medium-term bank
                     notes, which provide additional funding for the
                     corporation at attractive rates.
                           The following table summarizes the changes in
                     taxable equivalent interest income and interest expense
                     due to changes in rates and volumes between 1994 and 1993.
                     Changes which are not solely due to rate or volume are
                     allocated proportionately to rate and volume.

</TABLE>

                           At December 31, 1994, nonperforming assets were
                     $100.517 million or .39 percent of loans and foreclosed
                     property, down $54.384 million or 35.1 percent from a year
                     earlier. The provision for loan losses totaled $71.763
                     million in 1994, lower by $20.889 million or 22.5 percent
                     from $92.652 million in 1993, but exceeded net loan losses
                     by $1.334 million. Net charge-offs were $70.429 million or
                     .29 percent of average loans compared with $67.411 million
                     or .31 percent in 1993. The allowance for loan losses at
                     December 31, 1994 was $406.132 million, representing 1.57
                     percent of loans and 516 percent coverage of nonperforming
                     loans versus $404.798 million, 1.76 percent and 372
                     percent, respectively, at year-end 1993.
                           Total other operating revenue rose $4.253 million or
                     slightly under 1 percent. Good gains in credit card fee
                     income, trust service fees, and electronic banking service
                     revenues largely were offset by reduced levels of deposit
                     account service charges, mortgage fee income and trading
                     account profits. Credit card fee income increased $10.145
                     million or 10 percent, while trust service fees were
                     higher by $8.070 million or 6.7 percent. Electronic
                     banking service revenues grew $9.843 million or 66.3
                     percent. Service charges on deposit accounts were lower by
                     $6.736 million or 3.3 percent, with mortgage fee income
                     decreasing $5.877 million or 15 percent. Trading account
                     profits were down $12.943 million or 57.7 percent.
                           Total noninterest expense decreased $32.823 million
                     or 2.9 percent. Total personnel expense was lower by
                     $5.173 million or under 1 percent with increases in
                     salaries expense offset by reduced employee benefits
                     expense. Combined net occupancy and equipment expense rose
                     $3.103 million or 1.7 percent, reflecting a rise in
                     equipment expense moderated partially by lower net
                     occupancy expense. Remaining combined categories of
                     noninterest expense spending were down $30.753 million or
                     8.1 percent.

                     ---------------------------------------------------------

                           Wachovia Corporation is a registered bank holding
                     company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC
                     Act) and is subject to the supervision of, and regulation
                     by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
                     (FRB). South Carolina National Corporation is likewise
                     subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, which requires
                     prior Board approval for bank acquisitions and prohibits a
                     bank holding company from engaging in any business other
                     than banking or bank-related activities. On December 1,
                     1995, South Carolina National, the mid-tier holding
                     company remaining after Wachovia's 1991 acquisition of
                     South Carolina National Corporation, was merged into
                     Wachovia Corporation to simplify organizational structure.
                     In addition to the provisions of the BHC Act, state
                     banking commissions serve in a supervisory and regulatory
                     capacity with respect to the bank holding company
                     activities. Wachovia Corporation is also a savings and
                     loan holding company registered under the Home Owners'
                     Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), as amended by the Financial
                     Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
                     (FIRREA), and is subject to examination, supervision and
                     reporting requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision
                     (OTS).
                           Various state and federal laws govern the activities
                     of the Corporation's banking affiliates. As federally
                     insured national banks, Wachovia Bank of North Carolina,
                     N.A., Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., Wachovia Bank of
                     South Carolina, N.A., and The First National Bank of
                     Atlanta are subject to the regulation, supervision and
                     reporting requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of
                     the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
                     Corporation (FDIC). The banking subsidiaries are directly
                     affected by the actions of the FRB as it attempts to
                     manage the money supply and credit availability in the
                     economy.
                           The Corporation's nonbanking subsidiaries are
                     subject to a variety of state and federal laws. For
                     example, the Corporation's discount brokerage and
                     investment advisory subsidiary is subject to supervision
                     and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
                     (SEC), the National Association of Securities Dealers,
                     Inc., state securities regulators and the various
                     exchanges through which it conducts business. The
                     Corporation's insurance subsidiaries are subject to the
                     insurance laws of the states in which they are active. All
                     nonbanking subsidiaries are supervised by the FRB.
                           Federal law regulates transactions among Wachovia
                     Corporation and its affiliates, including the amount of
                     banking affiliates' loans to or investments in nonbank
                     affiliates and the amount of advances to third parties
                     collateralized by securities of the affiliate. In
                     addition, various requirements and restrictions under
                     federal and state laws regulate the operations of the
                     Corporation's banking affiliates, requiring the
                     maintenance of reserves against deposits, limiting the
                     nature of loans and interest that may be charged thereon,
                     restricting investments, and other activities.
                           Under FRB policy, the Corporation is expected to act
                     as a source of financial strength to, and commit resources
                     to support, each of its subsidiary banks. In addition,
                     FIRREA provides that a depository institution insured by
                     the FDIC can be held liable by the FDIC for any loss
                     incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in
                     connection with the default of a commonly controlled FDIC
                     insured depository institution. Under the Federal Deposit
                     Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA),
                     federal banking regulators are required to take prompt
                     corrective action in respect of depository institutions
                     that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA also
                     imposes substantial examination, audit and reporting
                     requirements on insured depository institutions. Among
                     other requirements, the regulation requires a revision of
                     risk-based capital standards. These standards are required
                     to incorporate interest rate risk, concentration of credit
                     risk and the risks of nontraditional activities and to
                     reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss
                     of multifamily mortgages. See Shareholders' Equity and
                     Capital Ratios on pages 32 and 33.
                           The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
                     Efficiency Act of 1994 (the Act) has introduced a process
                     that will enable nationwide interstate banking through
                     bank subsidiaries and interstate bank mergers. Effective
                     September 29, 1995, the bill allows adequately capitalized
                     and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of a
                     bank in any state subject to concentration limits.
                     Beginning June 1, 1997,


                                                                             41

                     banks will be permitted to merge with one another
                     across state lines. A state could authorize such mergers
                     earlier than June 1, 1997. In contrast, a state also could
                     choose to opt-out of interstate branching by enacting
                     legislation before June 1, 1997. The legislation preserves
                     state laws which require that a bank must be in existence
                     for a minimum period of time before being acquired as long
                     as the requirement is five years or less. The legislation
                     has immediate relevance for the banking industry due to
                     increased competitive forces from institutions which may
                     consolidate through mergers and those which may move into
                     new markets through enhanced opportunities to branch
                     across state lines.
                           Separately the Act also permits bank subsidiaries to
                     act as agents for certain purposes for each other across
                     state lines. These agency powers became available on
                     September 29, 1995. Effective January 2, 1996, Wachovia
                     Bank of Georgia, Wachovia Bank of North Carolina and
                     Wachovia Bank of South Carolina entered into a mutual
                     agreement to act as agents for each other, thereby making
                     significant interstate banking services available to all
                     customers in their three states.
                           There have been a number of legislative and
                     regulatory proposals that would have an impact on the
                     operation of bank holding companies and their banks. Due
                     to continued changes in the regulatory environment,
                     additional legislation aimed at banking industry reform is
                     likely to continue. While the potential effects of
                     legislation currently under consideration cannot be
                     measured with any degree of certainty, the Corporation is
                     unaware of any pending legislative reforms or regulatory
                     activities which would materially affect its financial
                     position or operating results in the foreseeable future.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY
FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Wachovia Corporation is responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements, related financial data and other information in this
annual report. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on
management's estimates and judgment where appropriate. Financial information
appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial
statements.

In meeting its responsibility both for the integrity and fairness of these
statements and information, management depends on the accounting system and
related internal control structures that are designed to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are authorized and recorded in accordance with
established procedures and that assets are safeguarded and proper and reliable
records are maintained.

The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost
of an internal control structure should not exceed the related benefits. As an
integral part of the internal control structure, the corporation maintains a
professional staff of internal auditors who monitor compliance with and assess
the effectiveness of the internal control structure and coordinate audit
coverage with the independent auditors.

The Audit Committee of Wachovia's Board of Directors, composed solely of outside
directors, meets regularly with the corporation's management, internal auditors,
independent auditors and regulatory examiners to review matters relating to
financial reporting, internal control structure and the nature, extent and
results of the audit effort. The independent auditors, internal auditors and
banking regulators have direct access to the Audit Committee with or without
management present.

The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent
auditors, who render an independent professional opinion on management's
financial statements. Their appointment was recommended by the Audit Committee,
approved by the Board of Directors and ratified by the shareholders. Their
examination provides an objective assessment of the degree to which the
corporation's management meets its responsibility for financial reporting. Their
opinion on the financial statements is based on auditing procedures which
include reviewing internal control structures and performing selected tests of
transactions and records as they deem appropriate. These auditing procedures are
designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial
statements are fairly presented in all material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
Wachovia Corporation

We have audited the consolidated statements of condition of Wachovia
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wachovia
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note C to the financial statements, in 1994, the Corporation
changed its method of accounting for certain investment securities. As
discussed in Notes A and M to the financial statements, in 1993, the company
changed its methods of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits.

WACHOVIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
$ in thousands
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations -- The Corporation is a southeastern interstate bank
holding company maintaining dual headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Principal banking subsidiaries are Wachovia Bank
of Georgia, N.A., Atlanta; Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A.,
Winston-Salem; and Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A., Columbia. The First
National Bank of Atlanta in Wilmington, Delaware, provides credit card services
for Wachovia's affiliated banks. In addition to general commercial banking, the
Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged in trust and investment
management, residential mortgage origination, leasing, state and local
government securities underwriting, foreign exchange, corporate finance and
other money market services.

Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Wachovia Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
all material intercompany balances and transactions.

Use of Estimates -- The financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and Due From Banks -- The Corporation considers cash and due from banks,
all of which are maintained in financial institutions, as cash and cash
equivalents for purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Trading Instruments -- The Corporation maintains trading positions in both
derivative and nonderivative (or cash) financial instruments. Trading cash
instruments are held for distribution through retail sales or in anticipation
of market movements and are carried at fair value. Gains and losses, both
realized and unrealized, are included in trading account profits (losses).
Interest revenue arising from cash financial instruments is included in
interest income-trading account assets. Trading cash instruments are comprised
primarily of securities backed by the U.S. Treasury and various federal
agencies and state and local governmental bodies.

Trading derivative financial instruments are customer oriented, and trading
positions are established as necessary to accommodate customers' requirements.
Gains and losses from securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange
activities are included in trading account profits (losses), while gains and
losses from interest rate derivatives are included in other operating income.

Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity and Available-for-Sale -- Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of
purchase. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the
Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to
maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost.

Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, and marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale
securities are recorded in shareholders' equity.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage backed securities, over the
estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest
income from investments. The specific identification method is used to
determine realized gains and losses on sales of securities, which are reported
as investment securities gains and losses.

Risk Management Instruments -- Interest rate swaps and options (caps and
floors) are used as part of the Corporation's overall interest rate risk
management and are designated as hedges of interest-bearing assets and
liabilities. Amounts receivable or payable under interest rate swap and option
agreements are recognized in interest income. If a derivative financial
instrument designated as a hedge is terminated early, any resulting gain or
loss is deferred and amortized to net interest income over the remaining
periods originally covered by the instrument.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses -- Loans are carried at their principal
amount outstanding, except for loans held for resale which are carried at the
lower of cost or market. Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as interest
income based upon the principal amount outstanding. Except for revolving credit
loans, the recognition of interest income is discontinued when a loan becomes
90 days past due as to principal and interest or when, in management's
judgment, the interest will not be collectible in the normal course of
business. When interest accruals are discontinued, the balance of accrued
interest is reversed. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest
when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover
the principal balance and accrued interest and the loan is in the process of
collection. Interest is accrued on revolving credit loans until payments become
120 days delinquent, at which time the outstanding principal balance and
accrued unpaid interest is charged off. See Note D for the discussion of the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."

The allowance is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by management to
absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of
the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio, past
loan loss experience, current domestic and international economic conditions,
volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and other risks inherent
in the portfolio.

Premises and Equipment -- Premises, equipment and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. For financial
reporting purposes, the provision for depreciation is computed by the
straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the life of the leasehold asset or the lease term.

Intangible Assets -- The excess of cost over net assets and identifiable
intangible assets, including deposit base intangibles, of acquired businesses
is amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated periods benefited.
Premiums paid to purchase servicing rights of mortgage loans are amortized over
the aggregate estimated remaining servicing life of the loans.

NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Concluded

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of" was issued in March 1995. This standard will be
adopted as of January 1, 1996 and is not expected to have a material impact on
financial position or results of operations.

Income Taxes -- Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" (FASB 109), which requires an asset and liability approach to
accounting for income taxes. The cumulative impact of adopting FASB 109 was a
tax benefit of $2,700 or $.02 per fully diluted share, which is reflected in
income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 1993. Under FASB 109,
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Corporation and its
subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Each subsidiary provides for
income taxes based on its contribution to income taxes (benefit) of the
consolidated group.

Stock-Based Compensation -- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" was issued in October 1995 and
encourages, but does not require, adoption of a fair value method of accounting
for employee stock-based compensation plans. As permitted by the new standard,
management intends to elect disclosure of the Corporation's pro forma net
income and net income per share as if the fair value method had been applied in
measuring compensation cost.

Reclassifications -- Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE B -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates
and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in
many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.
The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may
have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Also, the fair
value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available
to management as of December 31, 1995 and 1994. Such amounts have not been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those
dates and therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein.

Trading Account Assets -- Fair values for the Corporation's trading account
assets, which also are the amounts recognized in the statements of condition,
are based on quoted market prices.

Investment Securities -- Fair values for investment securities are based on
quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is
estimated using market prices for similar securities. Investment securities are
classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon management's
determination at the time of purchase and periodic reevaluation.

Loans -- For credit card, equity lines and other loans with short-term or
variable rate characteristics, the carrying value reduced by an estimate of
credit losses inherent in the portfolio is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The fair values of residential mortgage loans are estimated using quoted market
prices for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences between
the market for the securities and the loans being valued and an estimate of
credit losses in the portfolio. The fair value of all other loans is estimated
by discounting their future cash flows using interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms, reduced by an estimate of credit losses
inherent in the portfolio. The discount rates used are commensurate with the
interest rate and prepayment risks involved for the various types of loans.

Deposits -- The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest- and
noninterest-bearing demand, savings and money market savings) are equal to the
amounts payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).
Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash
flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
certificates to a schedule of aggregated monthly maturities.

Long-Term Debt -- Fair values of long-term debt are based on market prices
where available. When quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Corporation's
current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements.

Many of the Corporation's assets and liabilities are short-term financial
instruments whose carrying amounts reported in the statement of condition
approximate fair value. These items include cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing bank balances, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, due from customers on acceptances, short-term borrowed
funds, acceptances outstanding, and the financial

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments -- Fair values for the Corporation's off-balance
sheet instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar
agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the
counterparties' credit standing for loan commitments and letters of credit, and
the estimated amount the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate or
replace the contract at current market rates for the remainder of the
off-balance sheet instruments. See Notes I and J for additional information
about off-balance sheet financial instruments.

The estimated fair values of the Corporation's off-balance sheet financial
instruments as of December 31 are summarized below. The amounts for commitments
and letters of credit are presented negative in order to represent the
approximate cost the Corporation would incur to pay third parties to assume
these commitments. Interest rate contract fair values and other off-balance
sheet financial instruments represent the fair value gain or loss of the
contracts.

cost of $2,720,000 (fair value $2,774,000) from held-to-maturity to

the investment securities portfolio based on the issuance of a special report
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board "A Guide to Implementation of
Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." In accordance with the report, business entities were allowed a
one time reclassification of the investment securities portfolio between
November 15, 1995 and December 31, 1995. There were no transfers of
held-to-maturity securities during 1994, nor were there any sales of
held-to-maturity securities in 1995 or 1994.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115).

</TABLE>

Loans totaling $4,678, $13,051 and $42,256 were transferred to foreclosed real
estate during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

It is the policy of the Corporation to review each prospective credit in order
to determine an adequate level of security or collateral to obtain prior to
making the loan. The type of collateral will vary and ranges from liquid assets
to real estate. The Corporation's access to collateral, in the event of
borrower default, is assured through adherence to state lending laws and the
Corporation's sound lending standards and credit monitoring procedures. The
Corporation regularly monitors its credit concentrations on loan purpose,
industry and customer bases. At year-end, there were no significant credit
concentrations within these categories. See Note I for discussion of
off-balance sheet credit risk.

The Corporation's subsidiaries have granted loans and extended letters of
credit to certain directors and executive officers of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries and to their associates. The aggregate amount of loans was
$489,303 and $399,023 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. During 1995,
$824,461 in new loans were made, and repayments totaled $734,181. Outstanding
standby letters of credit to related parties totaled $22,531 and $34,934 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Related party loans are made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated transactions
with unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of
collectibility.

Loans held for sale at December 31 along with activity during the period are
summarized as follows:

At December 31, 1995, impaired loans totaled $12,260, comprised of $9,014 of
loans with no allowance for loan losses and $3,246 of loans with a related
allowance of $916. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during the
year ended December 31, 1995 was approximately $7,228. The Corporation
recognized $58 of cash-basis interest income on impaired loans during 1995.

Effective January 1, 1995, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" (FASB 114). This standard defines a loan as impaired when, based on
current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future
cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value
of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. The adoption of FASB
114 did not have a material impact on the Corporation's financial position or
results of operations.

During 1995, the Corporation securitized $500 million of credit card
receivables. A securitization involves the transfer of a pool of assets to a
master trust which issues and sells certificates to investors representing a
pro rata interest in the underlying assets. The securitization has been
recorded as a sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 77, "Reporting by Transferors for Transfers of Receivables with
Recourse." The Corporation recorded no gain or loss at the time of sale, due to
the relatively short average life of the credit card loans. As a result of this
transaction, amounts that would have been a component of net interest income
and the provision for loan losses are instead recorded, net of the interest
expense on the trust certificates, as credit card income.

    at any one time ($7 billion at December 31, 1994). The notes can be issued
    as fixed or floating rate notes and with terms of 30 days to 15 years. Bank
    notes with original maturities of one year or less are included in other
    short-term borrowed funds in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Bank
    notes with original maturities greater than one year are classified as
    long-term debt. Interest rates on the long-term notes ranged from 4.44% to
    7.75% and 4.0% to 7.50% with maturities ranging from 1996 to 2002 and 1995
    to 1999 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The average rates were
    5.77% and 5.31% with average maturities of 1.23 years and 1.73 years at
    December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
(b) Debt qualifies for inclusion in the determination of total capital under
    the Risk-Based Capital guidelines.
(c) The debentures are redeemable under certain conditions and are convertible
    into common stock of the Corporation at a conversion price of $19.29 per
    share. At December 31, 1995, $28,800 of these notes had been converted.

NOTE H -- CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Corporation consists of 500,000,000 common
shares and 50,000,000 preferred shares. At December 31, 1995, 24,314,246 common
shares were reserved for the conversion of notes and issuance for employee
benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan.

On July 28, 1995, the Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 5 million shares of common stock. Repurchased shares will
be used for various corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for
employee benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan. During the year, the
Corporation repurchased 1,755,500 shares pursuant to stock repurchase
authorizations. At December 31, 1995, the number of shares available for
possible repurchase totaled 4,600,000.

During 1994, the new Wachovia Corporation Stock Plan was approved, authorizing
up to 6 million shares of common stock to be granted to selected key employees
and nonemployee directors in the form of incentive and nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted
units. Since the inception of the new plan, a total of 1,845,620 options and
173,750 awards were granted.

In the aggregate, the Corporation's stock option and incentive plans provide
for the granting of options or awards for the purchase or issuance of 9,758,493
shares at 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant.

period (not to exceed ten years). The 1994 officer plan awards shares of stock
earned contingent upon both a performance requirement and time period
requirement (5 years). Under the 1994 Plan, newly elected nonemployee directors
are granted a one-time award of 1,000 shares of restricted stock to be earned
over a three year period. Additionally, nonemployee directors are awarded 250
shares of restricted stock annually which are earned over a one year period.

Recipients of awards under the Predecessor Plan are entitled to compensation
equivalent to the dividends that would have been payable on the proportion of
the awards reserved but not yet fully earned based on the years of service
since the date of grant divided by the number of years over which the award is
deemed to be fully earned. Compensation equivalent to dividends totaled $72 in
1995, $86 in 1994, and $54 in 1993. At December 31, 1995, and 1994, deferred
compensation related to director and management awards was $4,781 and $3,025,

NOTE I -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRADING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES

The Corporation maintains positions in a variety of financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. Financial
instruments issued or held to accommodate customer lending activities include
unfunded commitments to extend credit, standby, commercial and similar letters
of credit, securities lending, participations in bankers' acceptances and
mortgage loans sold with recourse. In order to accommodate customer capital
management, interest rate risk management and international transaction
requirements, the Corporation engages in dealer trading activities by
structuring and executing over-the-counter interest rate contracts, commitments
to purchase or sell securities, and foreign exchange contracts. The Corporation
maintains active trading positions in foreign exchange forward contracts and
manages credit risk through the establishment of offsetting sell positions, as
well as standard limit and monitoring procedures. The Corporation maintains a
trading portfolio of interest rate swap and option (caps and floors) contracts
and foreign exchange options consisting of generally matched, offsetting
contracts with customers and market counterparties.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure
to credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
statements of financial condition. The Corporation follows the same credit
policies and careful underwriting practices in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. In those
instances where collateral is necessary to support financial instrument credit
risk, the Corporation assures its ability to access borrower's collateral, in
the event of default, through strict adherence to corporate lending policy and
applicable state lending laws.

Derivative Financial Instruments Held or Issued for Trading Purposes -- The
amounts disclosed below represent the year end fair value of derivative
financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes and the average fair
value during the year. The Corporation's credit exposure to off-balance sheet
derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value gain of the
instrument if a counterparty fails to perform. Options written do not expose
the Corporation to credit risk, except to the extent of the underlying risk in
the debt instrument that the Corporation may be obligated to acquire under
certain written put options. Caps and floors written do not expose the
Corporation to credit risk.

Interest Rate Swaps -- These transactions generally involve the exchange of
fixed and floating rate payments without the exchange of the underlying
principal amounts. Payments made or received under swap contracts are accrued
based on contractual terms and are reported as other operating income. The
related accrued amounts receivable or payable to customers or counterparties
are included in other assets or liabilities. Revenues from the customer
portfolio represent a small profit margin on intermediated transactions. The
difference in the fair value of the offsetting contracts is not material.

The Corporation acts as principal in the exchange of interest payments between
parties and is exposed to loss should one of the parties default. The
Corporation controls the credit risk of these instruments through adherence to
credit approval policies, monetary limits and monitoring procedures. Entering
into interest rate swap agreements involves not only credit risk but also
interest rate risk associated with unmatched positions. Notional principal
amounts are often used to express the volume of these transactions but do not
represent the much smaller amounts potentially subject to credit risk. These
amounts are derived by estimating the cost, on a present value basis, of
replacing outstanding agreements at current market rates. Contracts whose
present value estimates indicate fair value gains are those which customers and
market counterparties are exposed to the Corporation and for which the
Corporation has potential credit risk. The Corporation controls interest rate
risk inherent in the derivative trading portfolio by entering into offsetting
swap positions or by using other hedging techniques to manage risk.

At December 31, 1995, the weighted average maturity of pay-fixed swaps held in
the customer portfolio was .39 years and .37 years for receive-fixed swaps.
Under pay-fixed swap agreements, the Corporation paid interest at a weighted
average fixed rate of 6.53% and received interest at a weighted average
floating rate of 5.02% (based on year-end rates). Under receive-fixed swap
agreements, the Corporation received interest at a weighted average fixed rate
of 6.56% and paid interest at a weighted average floating rate of 5.07% (based
on year-end rates). 

Interest Rate Caps and Floors -- These instruments are written by the
Corporation to enable its customers to transfer, modify, or reduce their
interest rate risk exposure. In a cap or floor contract, the purchaser pays a
premium at the initiation of the contract for the right to receive payments if
market interest rates are greater than the strike price of a cap or less than
the strike price of a floor. Payments made or received under cap or floor
contracts are accrued based on contractual terms and are reported as other
operating income. Credit risk and interest rate risk are managed through the
oversight procedures applied to other interest rate contracts, as well as
through the purchase of offsetting cap and floor positions. The present value of
purchased caps and floors in a gain position represent the potential credit risk
to the Corporation.

Commitments to Purchase and Sell Securities, Futures and Forward Contracts --
These instruments are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money
market instruments in which the seller agrees to deliver a specified instrument
at a specified price or yield at a specified date. Commitments to purchase and
sell securities, futures and forward contracts used in securities trading
operations are recognized currently at market value and are reported as trading
account profits (losses). Risks arise in these transactions through the
possible inability of one of the counterparties to meet the terms of the
contracts and from movements in interest rates or securities values. Risks
associated with these instruments are mitigated through offsetting purchase and
sell positions, as well as oversight provided by organized exchanges, which
determine who may buy and sell such instruments.

Net Options Written to Purchase and Sell Foreign Exchange -- Forward
commitments involve the purchase or sale of foreign currency amounts for
delivery at a specified future date. Payments on forward commitments are
exchanged on the delivery date based upon the exchange rate in the contract.
Forward commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange are recognized at
market value and are reported as other operating income. The potential risks
associated with these obligations arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates, as well as potential inability of the counterparty to perform under the
contract. These risks are mitigated through the

establishment of offsetting sell positions, as well as standard limit and
monitoring procedures.

Foreign Exchange Options -- These agreements represent rights to purchase or
sell foreign currency at a predetermined price at a future date. The purchaser
pays a premium at the initiation of the contract for the right to exchange a
specified amount at the contract's exchange rate at the maturity of the option.
The Corporation maintains a portfolio of generally matched offsetting foreign
exchange options. Fluctuations in foreign currency markets, as well as the
potential default of the counterparty to an option contract, represent the
risks associated with these instruments. Limit and monitoring procedures along
with offsetting positions serve to control the risk associated with these
items. The fair value of foreign exchange options purchased serves to offset
the fair value of written options.

Revenues from the derivative trading portfolio are shown below.

Commitments to Extend Credit -- These are legally binding contracts to lend to
a customer, provided there is no contract violation. These commitments have
fixed termination dates and generally require payment of a fee. As most
commitments expire prior to being drawn, the amounts shown do not necessarily
represent the future cash requirements of the contracts. Credit worthiness is
evaluated and in some instances collateral is obtained to support the
borrowing. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, approximately 13% and 12%,
respectively, of unfunded commitments to extend credit were supported by
collateral. Of the total unfunded commitment amounts presented, approximately
27% in 1995 and 22% in 1994 were comprised of cancelable credit card
commitments, and approximately 5% in 1995 and 9% in 1994 were represented by
real estate commitments. Also included in total unfunded commitments were
securities underwriting commitments of $0 in 1995 and $880 in 1994.

Standby, Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit -- These instruments are
conditional commitments issued by the Corporation guaranteeing the performance
of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are issued primarily to
support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
credit to customers and is subject to the Corporation's underwriting process.
At December 31, 1995 and 1994, approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of these
instruments were supported by collateral. There were no significant
concentrations of letters of credit to any one group of borrowers at either
year-end.

Securities Lent -- These are securities of the Corporation and its customers
lent to third parties. Credit risk arises in these transactions through the
possible failure of the borrower to return the securities.  To minimize risk
the Corporation evaluates the credit worthiness of the borrower, and obtains
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the contract amount.

Participation in Bankers' Acceptances -- These instruments represent risk
participation in time drafts drawn by customers under a committed multibank
credit facility. These drafts have been accepted and remarketed by other
financial institutions. Under the terms of these arrangements, the Corporation
may be required to reimburse the accepting financial institution for the
Corporation's pro rata share of any payment default by the customer. The
Corporation applies the same underwriting standards in evaluating the credit
risk associated with these instruments as it does in evaluating on-balance
sheet instruments.

Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse -- The Corporation is obligated under
recourse provisions related to the sale of residential mortgages to the Federal
National Mortgage Association. These mortgages are collateralized by 1-4 family
residential homes. All mortgage loans with original loan-to-value ratios
exceeding 80% (up to a maximum of 95%) have private mortgage insurance
coverage.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE J -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The Corporation manages its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates by
entering into interest rate swap and option contracts with financial
institution counterparties. The Corporation's operations are subject to a risk
in interest rate fluctuations to the extent of a difference between the amount
of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that mature or
reprice in specified periods. The Corporation's principal objective of
asset/liability management activities is to provide maximum levels of net
interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and
liquidity risk and facilitating the Corporation's funding needs. Accordingly,
the Corporation uses a combination of derivative financial instruments,
including interest rate swaps, futures and options with indices that correlate
to on-balance sheet instruments to modify the repricing characteristics of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

NOTE J -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES -- Concluded

In anticipation of the maturity of certificiates of deposit that were issued in
connection with a one-day sale held in 1995, the Corporation offered customers
favorable renewal terms. The Corporation entered into financial futures
contracts to mitigate the risk of falling interest rates during the term of the
renewal offer (October 1995 through January 1996). These futures contracts are
accounted for as a hedge of anticipated transactions; accordingly, the
resulting gain or loss is deferred and recognized as an adjustment of interest
expense over the term of the renewed certificates.

The amounts disclosed below represent the end of period notional and fair value
of derivative financial instruments held for risk management purposes. The
Corporation's credit exposure to off-balance sheet derivative financial
instruments is represented by the fair value gain of the instrument if a
counterparty fails to perform.

Management believes that the Corporation will fully realize the net deferred
tax asset as of December 31, 1995 based on the Corporation's refundable taxes
from carryback years, as well as its current level of operating income.

NOTE L -- CASH, DIVIDEND, LOAN RESTRICTIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries enter
into agreements, or are subject to regulatory requirements, that result in
cash, debt and dividend restrictions. A summary of the most restrictive items
follows.

The Corporation's banking subsidiaries are required to maintain average reserve
balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve
balances for the year ended December 31, 1995 was approximately $374,119.

Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the banking subsidiaries also are
limited in the amount they may loan to their affiliates, including the
Corporation. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 10% and loans to all
affiliates may not exceed 20% of the bank's capital, surplus and undivided
profits plus the allowance for loan losses. Based on these limitations,
approximately $343,898 was available for loans to the Corporation at December
31, 1995.

The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of all
dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank's
net profits, as defined, for that year combined with its retained net profits
for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the banking
subsidiaries cannot distribute as dividends to the Corporation in 1996, 
without the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, more than $532,099 
plus an additional amount equal to the banks' retained net profits for 1996 up 
to the date of any dividend declaration.

As a result of the above dividend and loan restrictions, approximately
$2,746,813 of consolidated net assets of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries
at December 31, 1995 was restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the
form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in certain legal
proceedings arising in connection with their business. In the opinion of
management and general counsel, the ultimate resolution of those proceedings
will result in no material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial
position and results of operations. There are no known situations where the
Corporation has an environmental liability that will materially affect the
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE M -- PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Corporation maintains a defined benefit pension plan which covers
substantially all employees. The plan provides pension benefits that are based
on the employee's length of credited service and final average compensation as
defined in the plan. The pension expense of the plan is determined using the
projected unit credit method. The Corporation's policy is to fund amounts
allowable for federal income tax purposes. The following table sets forth the
funded status of the Corporation's defined benefit pension plan and the amounts
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at December 31.

NOTE M -- PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS -- Concluded

The Corporation also provides supplemental benefits to substantially all
employees through defined contribution plans designed to encourage participants
to save on a regular basis and to provide such participants with deferred
compensation and additional performance incentive. Total expense relating to
these plans, which represented the Corporation's matching and discretionary
contributions, was $16,478 in 1995, $16,131 in 1994 and $22,767 in 1993.
Employee participants may elect to contribute from 1% to 10% of base salary,
with the Corporation matching 50% of each participant's contribution up to a
maximum employer contribution of 3% of base salary. The plans provide for
additional contributions of up to 3% of salary in accordance with a
preestablished formula based on certain earnings performance criteria and also
for special discretionary employer contributions of up to 4% of each eligible
employee's base salary as approved annually by the Board of Directors.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide certain health care benefits for
retired employees. Substantially all of the employees may become eligible for
these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the
Corporation or its subsidiaries. The benefits are provided through self-insured
plans administered by insurance companies whose premiums are based on the
claims paid during the year.

On January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (FASB 106), which requires the
accrual of nonpension benefits as employees render service. Adoption of FASB
106 increased postretirement benefits expense in 1993 by $5,210 and, on an
after-tax basis, reduced net income by $3,235 or $.02 per fully diluted share.

During 1995, the Corporation contributed assets to fund the postretirement
benefit obligation. The following table presents the status of the plan as of
December 31.

</TABLE>

The annual assumed rate of increase in health care costs used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic
postretirement benefit costs for 1995 and 1994 were 8% for retirees under age
65 and 6% for retirees age 65 and over. These rates are assumed to remain
constant for each of these categories of retirees. For 1993 reported figures,
the annual rate of increase in health care costs was assumed to be 16%
initially, decreasing to 14% for 1994, and gradually to 7% by 2007 and
remaining at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by one percentage point would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for the plan as of December 31, 1995 and 1994
by $1,372 and $1,746, respectively, and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1995, 1994
and 1993 by $117, $131 and $291, respectively. The discount rates used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at December 31,
1995 and 1994 were 7.25% and 8.5%, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Six-year historical comparative data for Wachovia Corporation
             and the median of the 25 largest U.S. bank holding companies based
             on assets as of each year-end is presented in the following
             charts. The median is representative of the typical bank holding
             company within the comparison group. All data is as originally
             reported, not restated for pooling-of-interest mergers or
             acquisitions. The 25 largest U.S. banking companies is used as a
             current peer comparison for Wachovia although the corporation was
             not among this group in 1990.
