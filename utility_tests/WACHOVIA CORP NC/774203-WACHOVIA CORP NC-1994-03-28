ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed to be adequate
by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio.  Management's
determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the
portfolio, past loan loss experience, current domestic and international
economic conditions, volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and
other risks inherent in the portfolio.  A provision for loan losses is charged
to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of these risks.  A
reconcilement of the allowance for loan losses and the net loan losses for the
six years ended December 31, 1993 is shown in Table 9 on page 22 of the 1993
Annual Report.

The allowance for loan losses is allocated among major loan categories based on
management's best estimate of relevant risk factors from time to time.

The allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the six years ended
December 31, 1993 is shown on page 61 of the 1993 Annual Report.  The
allocation of the allowance for loan losses represents only an estimate for
each category of loans based upon historical loss experience and management
judgment.  As of December 31, 1993, approximately 21 percent remains
unallocated as a general valuation reserve for the entire portfolio to cover
unpredictable variations from historical experience in individual loan
categories.  The table below shows the percentage of loans in each category to
total loans outstanding at December 31 for the last six years.

On March 31, 1993, Wachovia Corporation of North Carolina and Wachovia
Corporation of Georgia were merged into Wachovia Corporation.  The subsidiaries
of these two second tier holding companies became direct subsidiaries of
Wachovia Corporation, the surviving Corporation in the merger.


SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

As a bank holding company, Wachovia is subject to regulation under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and its examination and
reporting requirements.  South Carolina National Corporation is likewise
subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, which imposes certain limitations
and restrictions on the level of interstate banking in which Wachovia may
engage, the degree to which Wachovia may conduct non-banking related
activities, and the extent to which Wachovia may engage in interstate merger
and acquisition activities.  In addition to the provisions of the BHC Act,
state banking commissions serve in a supervisory and regulatory capacity with
respect to bank holding company activities.

Wachovia is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home
Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), as amended by the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA).  HOLA places certain
restrictions on the conduct of unrelated business activities of the
subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies which are not themselves
savings and loans.  Wachovia is registered with the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and is subject to the examination, supervision and reporting
requirements of this agency.

Various state and federal laws govern the activities of Wachovia's banking
affiliates.  As federally insured national banks, Wachovia Bank of North
Carolina, N.A., Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., The South Carolina National
Bank and The First National Bank of Atlanta are subject to the regulation,
supervision and reporting requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  As a
whole, the banking industry is directly affected by the fiscal and monetary
policies of government agencies, including the Federal Reserve System.





                                   7                              
<PAGE>   9
Item 1.  Business (Continued)
- -----------------------------

Through its conduct of open market securities transactions and control over the
discount rate and reserve requirements, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) exerts
considerable influence on the cost and availability of funds used in lending
and investment activities.

Wachovia's non-banking subsidiaries are subject to a variety of state and
federal laws.  As mentioned previously, the savings and loan subsidiary is
subject to the regulation and supervision of the OTS.  Wachovia's brokerage
subsidiary is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, and the various exchanges through which it
conducts business.  Additionally, it is registered in all states and is thus
subject to corresponding state securities laws and regulations.  Wachovia's 
insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws of the states in which
they are active.  All non-banking subsidiaries are supervised by the Federal 
Reserve System.

Federal law regulates transactions among Wachovia and its affiliates, including
the amount of banking affiliate's loans to, or investments in, nonbank
affiliates and the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by
securities of an affiliate.  In addition, various requirements and restrictions
under federal and state laws regulate the operations of Wachovia's banking
affiliates, requiring the maintenance of reserves against deposits, limiting
the nature of loans and interest that may be charged thereon, restricting
investments and other activities, and subjecting the banking affiliates to
regulation and examination by the OCC or state banking authorities and the
FDIC.

There are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which Wachovia's
subsidiary banks may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Wachovia.  In
addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also have the authority to
prevent a bank or bank holding company from paying a dividend or engaging in
any other activity that, in the opinion of the agency, would constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice.  See Note L of the notes to consolidated financial
statements on pages 49 and 50 of the 1993 Annual Report.

Under FRB policy, Wachovia is expected to act as a source of financial strength
to, and commit resources to support, each of its subsidiary banks.  In
addition, FIRREA provides that a depository institution insured by the FDIC can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred
by, the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled FDIC
insured depository institution.  Under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) federal banking regulators are
required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions
that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  FDICIA generally prohibits a
depository institution from making any capital distribution or paying
management fees to its holding company if the depository institution would
thereafter be undercapitalized.  In addition, undercapitalized institutions
will be subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System,
to growth limitations and to obligations to submit capital restoration plans.
In order for a capital restoration to be acceptable, the depository
institution's parent holding company must guarantee the institution's
compliance with the capital restoration plan up to an amount not exceeding 5%
of the depository institution's total assets.  Significantly undercapitalized
institutions are subject to greater restrictions, and critically
undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver.  See
Shareholder's Equity and Capital Ratios on pages 26 and 27 of the 1993 Annual
Report.

FDICIA also substantially revises the bank regulatory insurance coverage and
funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and makes revisions to
several other federal banking statutes.  FDICIA imposes substantial new
examination, audit and reporting requirements on insured depository
institutions.  Under FDICIA, each federal banking agency must prescribe

- -----------------------------

standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding
companies relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit
systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset
growth, compensation, a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum
earnings sufficient to absorb losses and other standards as the agency deems
appropriate.

The FDIC has adopted or currently proposes to adopt rules pursuant to FDICIA
that include: (a) real estate lending standards for banks; (b) revision to the
risk-based capital rules; (c) rules requiring depository institutions to
develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and
settlement exposure to their correspondent banks; (d) a rule restricting the
ability of depository institutions that are not well capitalized from accepting
brokered deposits; (e) rules addressing various "safety and soundness" issues,
including operations and managerial standards for asset quality, earnings and
stock valuations, and compensation standards for the officers, directors,
employees and principal shareholders of the depository institution; and (f)
rules mandating enhanced financial reporting and audit requirements.

Due to continued changes in the regulatory environment, additional legislation 
aimed at banking industry reform is likely to continue.  While the potential 
effects of legislation currently under consideration cannot be measured with 
any degree of certainty, Wachovia is unaware of any pending legislative reforms
or regulatory activities which would materially affect its financial position 
or operating results in the foreseeable future.


Item 2.  Properties
- -------------------

Wachovia's principal executive offices are located at 301 North Main Street,
Winston-Salem, North Carolina and 191 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia
in buildings leased by its subsidiaries.

The principal offices of Wachovia and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A.,
are located in The Wachovia Building, 301 North Main Street, Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, where the company occupies approximately 378,000 square feet of
office space under a lease expiring December, 1995.  Wachovia Bank of Georgia,
N.A., occupies approximately 380,000 square feet of an office tower at 191
Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia under a lease expiring December, 2008.
South Carolina National Corporation and The South Carolina National Bank have
their main offices located in the Palmetto Center, 1426 Main Street, Columbia,
South Carolina, where they occupy approximately 18,000 square feet of the
office building under a lease expiring November, 2003.

At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had 509 banking offices with 223 of these
located in North Carolina, 129 in Georgia and 157 in South Carolina.  The
Corporation's banking subsidiaries own in fee 341 of these offices while the
others are leased or are located on leased land.  The approximate lease terms
range from one to thirty years on these properties.  In addition, the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries own in fee or lease a number of multi-story
office buildings which house supporting services.  The other subsidiaries of
Wachovia maintain leased office space in cities in which they conduct their
respective operations.

Construction began in January 1994 on an office building in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, which will serve as the new North Carolina headquarters for the
holding company and principal office of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A.
The building will be a 28 story office tower with 525,000 usable square feet,
all or most of which is expected to be occupied by the Corporation.
Construction is expected to be completed by late 1995.

                              WACHOVIA CORPORATION


        Pursuant to Section 55-10-07 of the General Statutes of North Carolina,
Wachovia Corporation hereby submits the following for the purpose of amending
and restating its articles of incorporation.

                                       I.

        The name of the corporation is Wachovia Corporation.

                                      II.

        The period of duration of the corporation shall be perpetual.

                                      III.

        The purpose or purposes for which the corporation is organized are:

        (1)  To exercise all of the powers of a general business corporation
under the laws of North Carolina, including but not limited to the powers
specifically described in (2) and (3) below.

        (2)  To operate as a one bank or multi-bank holding company and in
general to act as a holding company and to acquire and own stock or other
interests in other businesses of any lawful character and, as shareholder or as
owner of other interests in such businesses, to exercise all rights incident
thereto.

        (3)  In furtherance of any of these purposes, the corporation shall
have power to execute contracts of guaranty and to issue bonds or other
evidences of indebtedness which may be secured or unsecured and which may be
convertible into Common Stock of the corporation.





<PAGE>   3
                                      IV.

        The corporation shall have authority to issue Five Hundred Million
(500,000,000) shares of Common Stock with par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per
share and Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock with par value
of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share.

        The Board of Directors of the corporation shall have authority to fix
the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Preferred Stock with
par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share, and to establish series of such
Preferred Stock and determine the variations between series.

                                       V.

        The address of the registered office of the corporation is Wachovia
Building, 301 North Main Street, Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North Carolina
27101, and the name of its registered agent at such address is Kenneth W.
McAllister.

                                      VI.

        The name and address of the incorporator is John G. Medlin, Jr., 301
North Main Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101.

                                      VII.

        The number of the directors of the corporation may be fixed by the
bylaws but shall not be less than nine (9).

        The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as equal in
number as may be feasible, with the term of office of one class expiring each
year.  The members of the initial Board of Directors shall be divided into
three classes as hereinafter provided in Article VIII, with directors of the
first class to hold office for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of
shareholders, directors of the second class to hold office for a term expiring
at the second





                                      -2-
<PAGE>   4
annual meeting of shareholders and directors of the third class to hold office
for the term expiring at the third annual meeting of shareholders.  At each
annual meeting of shareholders, successors to the directors whose terms shall
then expire shall be elected to hold office for terms expiring at the third
succeeding annual meeting.  In case of any vacancies, by reason of an increase
in the number of directors or otherwise, each additional director may be
elected by the Board of Directors to hold office until the end of the term he
is elected to fill and until his successor shall have been elected and
qualified in the class to which such director is assigned and for the term or
remainder of the term of such class.  Directors shall continue in office until
others are chosen and qualified in their stead.  When the number of directors
is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships
shall be so assigned among the classes by a majority of the directors then in
office, though less than a quorum, as to make all classes as equal in number as
may be feasible.  No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term
of any incumbent director.

        Any director may be removed from office as a director, but only for
cause, by the affirmative vote, at a meeting called as provided in the bylaws
for that purpose, of at least 66-2/3% in interest of the holders of voting
stock of the corporation issued and outstanding, including a majority in
interest of the holders of issued and outstanding voting stock of the
corporation held by persons other than any person who is an Interested
Shareholder (as defined in paragraph (3) of Section D of Article X hereof).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more
classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the corporation may have the
right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or
special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of
vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by





                                      -3-
<PAGE>   5
the terms of such Preferred Stock applicable thereto, and such directors so
elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article unless
expressly provided by such terms.

                                     VIII.

        The number of directors constituting the initial Board of Directors
shall be thirteen (13) and the names and addresses of the persons who are to
serve as directors until the first, second, and third annual meetings of
shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified are:

        No holder of stock of the corporation shall be entitled as of right to
subscribe for or purchase any additional or increased stock of the corporation
of any class, whether now or hereafter authorized, including obligations
convertible into any class of stock, or stock of any class convertible into
stock of any other class, or obligations, stock or other securities carrying
warrants or rights to subscribe to stock of the corporation of any class,
whether now or hereafter authorized, but any and all shares of stock, bonds,
debentures or other securities or obligations, whether or not convertible into
stock or carrying warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe to stock,
may be issued, sold or disposed of from time to time by authority of the Board
of Directors of the corporation to such persons, firms or corporations and for
such consideration, as far as it may be permitted by law, as the Board of
Directors shall from time to time determine.

                                       X.

        A.  Any Business Combination (as defined in paragraph (1) of Section D
of this Article) shall require only such affirmative vote as is required by law
and any other provision of these Articles if either all of the conditions set

        behalf of any Interested Shareholder (as defined in paragraph (3) of
        Section D of this Article) in connection with its direct or indirect
        acquisition of beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock.  If
        the consideration paid by or on behalf of the Interested Shareholder
        for shares of Common Stock varied as to form, the form

<PAGE>   7
        of consideration to be received by holders of Common Stock shall be
        either cash or the form used to acquire beneficial ownership of the
        largest number of shares of Common Stock previously acquired by the
        Interested Shareholder;

           (ii)  The aggregate amount of the cash and the Fair Market Value (as
        defined in paragraph (9) of Section D of this Article) of consideration
        other than cash to be received per share by holders of Common Stock in
        any Business Combination shall be at least equal to the greater of (a)
        the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of the
        first public announcement of the proposal of a Business Combination
        (the "Announcement Date") or on the date on which the Interested
        Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, whichever is higher,
        multiplied by the ratio of (1) the highest per share price (including
        any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees)
        paid by the Interested Shareholder for any shares of Common Stock
        acquired by it within the two-year period immediately prior to the
        Announcement Date to (2) the Fair Market Value per share of Common
        Stock on the first day in such two-year period on which the Interested
        Shareholder acquired any shares of Common Stock or (b) the highest per
        share price (including brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and
        soliciting dealers' fees) paid by such Interested Shareholder in
        acquiring any of the corporation's Common Stock;

           (iii)  After becoming an Interested Shareholder and prior to the
        consummation of any Business Combination, (A) such Interested
        Shareholder shall not have acquired any newly issued shares of capital
        stock, directly or indirectly, from the corporation (except upon
        conversion of convertible securities





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   8
        acquired by it prior to becoming an Interested Shareholder or upon
        compliance with the provisions of this Article or as a result of a pro
        rata stock dividend or stock split) and (B) such Interested Shareholder
        shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except
        proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees,
        pledges or other financial assistance or tax credits provided by the
        corporation, or made any major changes in the corporation's business or
        equity capital structure;

           (iv)  The Business Combination shall have been approved by at least
        66-2/3% of the Continuing Directors (as defined in paragraph (8) of
        Section D of this Article) and, if deemed advisable by a majority of
        the Continuing Directors, the Board of Directors shall have obtained an
        opinion of a reputable investment banking firm to the effect that the
        financial terms of such Business Combination are fair from the point of
        view of the holders of Voting Shares (as defined in paragraph (5) of
        Section D of this Article) other than the Interested Shareholder (such
        investment banking firm to be selected by a majority of the Continuing
        Directors, to be furnished with all information it reasonably requests,
        and to be paid a reasonable fee or its services upon receipt by the
        corporation of such opinion).

        B. If the provisions of Section A of this Article have not been
satisfied, any Business Combination shall require the affirmative vote, in
person or by proxy, at any meeting called as provided in the bylaws, of the
holders of at least 66-2/3% in interest of the Voting Shares of the corporation
issued and outstanding, including a majority in interest of the holders of
issued and outstanding Voting Shares of the corporation held by persons other
than an





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   9
Interested Shareholder or any Affiliate or Associate of any Interested
Shareholder.  Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact
that no vote may be required, or that some lesser percentage may be specified
by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise.

        C. The provisions of Sections A and B of this Article shall not be
applicable to any particular Business Combination, and such Business
Combination shall require only such affirmative vote, if any, as is required by
law and any other provision of these Articles, if such Business Combination
constitutes a merger or consolidation of the corporation with, or any sale or
lease to the corporation or any Subsidiary (as defined in paragraph (7) of
Section D of this Article) of any assets of, or any sale or lease by the
corporation or any Subsidiary of any of its assets to, any corporation of which
a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote
in elections of directors is owned of record or beneficially by the corporation
or its Subsidiaries, provided that this Section C shall not apply to any

        or

            (c)  The issuance or transfer to any Interested Shareholder or any

        consolidation of the corporation with any of its Subsidiaries or any
        similar transaction (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving
        an Interested Shareholder) which has the effect, directly or
        indirectly, of increasing the percentage of the outstanding shares of
        any class of equity or convertible securities of the corporation or any

            (f)  Any agreement, contract or other arrangement providing for any
        of the transactions described in this definition of "Business
        Combination."

        (2) A "person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or other
     entity.

        (3) "Interested Shareholder" shall mean any person (other than the
     corporation or any Subsidiary) who or which, along with its Affiliates and
     Associates (as defined in paragraph (6) of this Section D) as of the
     record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of
     and to vote on any Business Combination or any proposed amendment,
     alteration or repeal of any provision of these Articles or any bylaw of
     the corporation, or immediately prior to the consummation of any such
     Business Combination:

            (i)   Is the beneficial owner (as defined in paragraph (4) of this
        Section D), directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of the Voting
        Shares of the corporation or a Subsidiary, or

        capital stock of the corporation or a Subsidiary which was at any time
        within two years prior thereto beneficially owed by any Interested
        Shareholder, and such assignment or succession shall have occurred in
        the course of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a
        public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933.

             (4)  A person shall be the "beneficial owner" of any Voting Shares:

                  (a)  Which such person or any of its Affiliates and
        Associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, or





                                      -10-
<PAGE>   12
                  (b)  Which such person or any of its Affiliates or Associates
            has (A) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable
            immediately or only after the passage of time), pursuant to any
            agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of
            conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or
            otherwise or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement,
            arrangement or understanding, or

                  (c)  Which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by
            any other person with which such first-mentioned person or any of
            its Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement or
            understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
            disposing of any shares of capital stock of the corporation or a
            Subsidiary, as the case may be.

            (5) "Voting Shares" when used with respect to the corporation or a
     Subsidiary shall mean shares of such corporation having general voting
     power.  For the purpose of determining whether a person is an Interested
     Shareholder pursuant to paragraph (3) of this Section D, the outstanding
     Voting Shares shall include shares deemed owned by a beneficial owner
     through application of paragraph (4) of this Section D but shall not
     include any other Voting Shares which may be issuable to any other person
     pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants
     or options, or otherwise.

            (6) "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings
     given those terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on December 31, 1984.

            (7) "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation of which a majority of 
     any class of equity security (as defined in Rule 3a11-1 of the General 
     Rules and Regulations under





                                      -11-
<PAGE>   13
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on December 31, 1984) is
     owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation; provided, however, that
     for the purposes of the definition of Interested Shareholder set forth in
     paragraph (3) of this Section D, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean only a
     corporation of which a majority of each class of equity security is owned,
     directly or indirectly, by the corporation.

        (8) "Continuing Director" shall mean a person who was a member of the
     Board of Directors of the corporation elected by the shareholders prior to
     the date as of which an Interested Shareholder acquired in excess of 10%
     of the Voting Shares of the corporation or a Subsidiary, or a director who
     has been recommended to directly succeed a Continuing Director or to join
     the Board of Directors by a majority of the remaining Continuing
     Directors.

        (9) "Fair Market Value" shall mean (i) in the case of stock, the
     highest closing sales price during the 30-day period immediately preceding
     the date in question of a share of such stock on the Composite Tape for
     New York Stock Exchange -- Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not quoted
     on the Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock
     is not listed on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities
     exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on which
     such stock is listed, or, if such stock is not listed on any such
     exchange, the highest closing bid quotation with respect to a share of
     such stock during the 30-day period preceding the date in question on the
     National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations
     Systems or any system then in use, or, if such quotations are not
     available, the fair market value on the date in question of a share of
     such stock as determined in good faith by a majority of Continuing
     Directors, and (ii) in the case of property other





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   14
     than cash or stock, the fair market value of such property on the date in
     question as determined in good faith by a majority of Continuing
     Directors.

        E.  The Continuing Directors, by a majority vote, shall have the power
and duty to determine for the purposes of this Article on the basis of
information known to them (a) the number of Voting Shares beneficially owned by
any person, (b) whether a person is an Affiliate or Associate of another, (c)
whether a person has an agreement, arrangement or understanding with another as
to the matters referred to in paragraph (4) of Section D of this Article, (d)
whether the assets of the corporation or any Subsidiary have an aggregate fair
market value of $25,000,000 or more, or (e) whether the consideration received
for the issuance or transfer of securities by the corporation or any Subsidiary
has an aggregate fair market value of $10,000,000 or more.

        F.  Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to relieve any
Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.

                                      XI.

        Except as otherwise provided herein (and in addition to any other vote
that may be required by law, these Articles or the bylaws of the corporation),
the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, at any meeting called as provided
in the bylaws, of the holders of at least 66-2/3% in interest of the voting
stock of the corporation issued and outstanding, including a majority in
interest of the holders of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the
corporation held by persons other than an Interested Shareholder, shall be
required to amend, alter or repeal Articles II, IV, VII, IX, X or XI or to
adopt any new provision inconsistent with such Articles, provided, however,
that if at the time of any such proposed amendment, alteration, repeal or
adoption, (a) there shall exist one or more Interested Shareholders and at
least 66-2/3% of the





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   15
Continuing Directors approve such proposed amendment, alteration, repeal or
adoption, or (b) no such Interested Shareholder exists, and a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors approve such proposed amendment, alteration,
repeal or adoption, then the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, at any
meeting called as provided in the bylaws, of the holders of a majority in
interest of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the corporation shall be
required to approve such amendment, alteration, repeal or adoption.

                                      XII.

     To the full extent from time to time permitted by law, no person who is
serving or who has served as a director of the corporation shall be personally
liable in any action for monetary damages for breach of his or her duty as a
director, whether such action is brought by or in the right of the corporation
or otherwise.  Neither the amendment or repeal of this Article, nor the
adoption of any provision of these Articles inconsistent with this Article,
shall eliminate or reduce the protection afforded by this Article to a director
of the corporation with respect to any matter which occurred, or any cause of
action, suit or claim which but for this Article would have accrued or arisen,
prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

                            MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

                 Section 1.1.  Place of Meeting.  Meetings of shareholders
                 -----------   ----------------
shall be held at the principal office of the corporation in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina or Atlanta, Georgia, or at such other place, either within or
without the States of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, as shall be
fixed by the board of directors or the chief executive officer and designated
in the notice of the meeting.

                 Section 1.2.  Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of
                 -----------   --------------
shareholders shall be held at 10:30 a.m. on the fourth Friday in April of each
year, if not a legal holiday, but if a legal holiday, then on the preceding
business day which is not a legal holiday, or at such other hour and date as
the board of directors, the chief executive officer or secretary may designate,
for the purpose of electing directors of the corporation and the transaction of
such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting.

                 Section 1.3.  Substitute Annual Meeting.  If the annual
                 -----------   -------------------------
meeting is not held on the day designated or provided for in these bylaws, a
substitute annual meeting may be called in accordance with Section 1.4.  A
meeting so called shall be designated and treated for all purposes as the
annual meeting.

                 Section 1.4.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the
                 -----------   ----------------
shareholders may be called at any time by the chief executive officer or the
board of directors.

                 Section 1.5.  Notice of Meetings.  At least 10 and no more
                 -----------   ------------------
than 60 days prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders, the
corporation shall notify shareholders of the date, time and place of the
meeting and, in the case of a special or substitute annual meeting or where
otherwise required by law, shall briefly describe the purpose or purposes of
the meeting.  Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the
notice may be conducted at a special meeting.  Unless otherwise required by law
or by the articles of incorporation (including, but not limited to, in the
event of a meeting to consider the adoption of a plan of merger or share
exchange, a sale of assets other than in the ordinary course of business or a
voluntary dissolution), the corporation shall be required to give notice only
to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.  If an annual or special
shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice
thereof need not be given if the new date, time or place is announced at the
meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is
fixed pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.  It shall be
the primary responsibility of the secretary to give the notice, but notice may
be given by or at the direction of the chief executive officer or other person
or persons calling the meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
effective when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon
prepaid, correctly addressed to the shareholder's address shown in the
corporation's current record of shareholders.

                 Section 1.6.  Quorum.  A majority of the votes entitled to be
                 -----------   ------
cast by a voting group on a matter, represented in person or by proxy at a
meeting of shareholders, shall constitute a quorum for that voting group for
any action on that matter, unless the articles of incorporation provide
otherwise or other quorum requirements are fixed by law, including by a court
of competent jurisdiction acting pursuant to Section 55-7-03 of the General
Statutes of North Carolina.  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a
meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the
meeting and any adjournment thereof, unless a new record date is or must be set
for the adjournment.  Action may be taken by a voting group at any meeting at
which a quorum of that voting group is represented, regardless of whether
action is taken at that meeting by any other voting group.  In the absence of a
quorum at the opening of any meeting of shareholders, such meeting may be
adjourned from time to time, subject to Section 6.5, by a vote of the majority
of the shares voting on the motion to adjourn.

                 Section 1.7.  Shareholders' List.  After a record date is
                 -----------   ------------------
fixed for a meeting, the secretary of the corporation shall prepare an
alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to
notice of the shareholders' meeting.  Such list shall be arranged by voting
group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares) and shall
show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.  The
shareholders' list shall be made available for inspection by any shareholder
beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the
list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's
principal office or at such other place identified in the meeting notice in the
city where the meeting will be held.  The corporation shall make the
shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder or his agent
or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or
any adjournment.

                 Section 1.8.  Voting of Shares.  Except as otherwise provided
                 -----------   ----------------
by the articles of incorporation or by law, each outstanding share of voting
capital stock of the corporation shall be entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders.  Unless otherwise
provided in the articles of incorporation, cumulative voting for directors
shall not be allowed.  Action on a matter by a voting group for which a quorum
is present is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the
action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the vote of a greater
number is required by law or by the articles of incorporation.  Absent special
circumstances, the shares of the corporation are not entitled to vote if they
are owned, directly or indirectly, by a second corporation, domestic or
foreign, and the corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
shares entitled to vote for directors of the second corporation, except that
this provision shall not limit the power of the corporation to vote shares held
by it in a fiduciary capacity.

                 Section 1.9.  Conduct of Meeting and Order of Business.  The
                 -----------   ----------------------------------------
chairman of the board of directors shall act as chairman at all meetings of
shareholders and the secretary of the corporation or, in his absence, an
assistant secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of shareholders.
The chairman shall have the right and authority to determine and maintain the
rules, regulations and procedures for the proper conduct of the meeting,
including but not limited to restricting entry to the meeting after it has
commenced, maintaining order and the safety of those in attendance, opening and
closing the polls for voting, dismissing business not properly submitted, and
limiting time allowed for discussion of the business of the meeting.

                 Business to be conducted at meetings of shareholders shall be
limited to that properly submitted to the meeting either by or at the direction
of the board of directors or by any holder of voting securities of the
corporation who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with
the





                                     -2-
<PAGE>   7
notice requirements of applicable law or as otherwise set forth in the articles
of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation.  If the chairman of the
meeting shall determine that any business was not properly submitted, he shall
declare to the meeting that such business was not properly submitted and would
not be transacted at that meeting.



                                   ARTICLE 2

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                 Section 2.1.  General Powers.  All corporate powers shall be
                 -----------   --------------
exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the
corporation shall be managed under the direction of, the board of directors.

                 Section 2.2.  Number, Term, Qualification and Nomination.  The
                 -----------   ------------------------------------------
number of directors constituting the board of directors shall be not less than
nine nor more than 25 as may be fixed by resolution duly adopted by the board
of directors prior to the annual meeting at which such directors are to be
elected or by the shareholders, but in the absence of such resolution, the
number of directors elected at the meeting shall constitute the number of
directors of the corporation until the next annual meeting of shareholders.

                 The board of directors shall be divided into three classes as
equal in number as may be feasible, with the term of office of one class
expiring each year.  The members of the initial board of directors shall be
divided into three classes as hereinafter provided, with directors of the first
class to hold office for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of
shareholders, directors of the second class to hold office for a term expiring
at the second annual meeting of shareholders and directors of the third class
to hold office for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of shareholders.
At each annual meeting of shareholders, successors to the directors whose terms
shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for terms expiring at the
third succeeding annual meeting.  In case of any vacancies, by reason of an
increase in the number of directors or otherwise, each additional director may
be elected by the board of directors to hold office until the end of the term
he is elected to fill and until his successor shall have been elected and
qualified in the class to which such director is assigned and for the term or
remainder of the term of such class.  Directors shall continue in office until
others are chosen and qualified in their stead.  When the number of directors
is changed, any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships
shall be so assigned among the classes by a majority of the directors then in
office, though less than a quorum, as to make all classes as equal in number as
may be feasible.  No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term
of any incumbent director.

                 No person shall be elected nor shall continue to serve as a
director past the annual meeting if such person has, as of the date of the
annual meeting, reached the age of 70 years or has retired from active
participation in his principal business or from the active practice of his
principal profession; provided, however, that a person who has served for five
or more years as Chief Executive Officer of the corporation may complete an
unexpired term and may be re-elected a director for up to three years after
retirement from active service with the corporation.  Each director nominee
must be the owner in his or her own right of shares of stock of the corporation
having a par value of not less





                                     -3-
<PAGE>   8
than $1,000.  Other qualifications which shall be considered in the selection
of director nominees are the extent of experience in business, finance or
management; the extent of knowledge in regional, national or international
business and finance; and the overall capacity to advise and direct the
corporation in meeting its responsibilities to shareholders, customers,
employees and the public.

                 Nominations for election as a director by the board of
directors in connection with any annual meeting or substitute annual meeting of
shareholders shall include the chairman and the president if such person is not
then a director or if his term as a director will expire at such meeting.
Nominations for election as a director by a holder of any outstanding class of
shares of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors shall
specify the class of directors to which each person is nominated, be made in
writing and be delivered or mailed to the chief executive officer of the
corporation not less than 14 days or more than 50 days prior to any meeting of
shareholders called for the election of directors; provided, if less than 21
days' notice of the meeting is given to shareholders, such notification of
nomination shall be mailed or delivered to the chief executive officer of the
corporation not later than the close of business on the seventh day following
the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed.  Such notification shall
contain the following information to the extent known by the notifying
shareholder:  (a) the name, age and address of each proposed nominee; (b) the
principal occupation of each proposed nominee; (c) the total number of shares
that will be voted for each proposed nominee; (d) the name and residence
address of the notifying shareholder; (e) the number of shares owned by the
notifying shareholder; and (f) a biographical profile of the individual with a
statement of his or her qualifications.  Nominations not made in accordance
herewith may be disregarded by the chairman of the meeting in his discretion,
and upon his instructions the voting inspectors or tabulators may disregard all
votes cast for each such nominee.

                 Section 2.3.  Removal.  Any director may be removed from
                 -----------   -------
office as a director, but only for cause, by the affirmative vote at a meeting
called as provided herein for that purpose, of at least 66-2/3% in interest of
the holders of voting stock of the corporation issued and outstanding,
including a majority in interest of the holders of issued and outstanding
voting stock of the corporation held by persons other than any person who is an
"Interested Shareholder" as defined in paragraph (3) of Article X.D of the
corporation's articles of incorporation; provided, the notice of the
shareholders' meeting at which such action is to be taken states that a purpose
of the meeting is removal of the director and the number of votes cast to
remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove him.

                 Section 2.4.  Vacancies.  Except as otherwise provided in the
                 -----------   ---------
articles of incorporation or these bylaws, a vacancy occurring in the board of
directors, including, without limitation, a vacancy resulting from an increase
in the number of directors or from the failure by the shareholders to elect the
full authorized number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the
remaining directors or by the sole director remaining in office.  The
shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a vacancy not filled by
the directors.  A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
unexpired term of his predecessor in office.

                 Section 2.5.  Compensation.  The directors shall have
                 -----------   ------------
authority to vote themselves reasonable compensation for their services as
directors.  The directors may provide for their own indemnification and for the
indemnification of others, in accordance with these bylaws or as otherwise
authorized by law, and the directors may authorize the purchase of insurance in
connection therewith.  Any director may serve the corporation in any other
capacity and receive compensation therefor.

                 Section 2.6.  Directors Emeritus.  Upon retiring from the
                 -----------   ------------------
board of directors, a director may be elected a director emeritus by the board
of directors.  A director emeritus shall not have the right to vote and shall
not be charged with the responsibilities or be subject to the liabilities of
directors.  A director emeritus may attend meetings of the board only upon
invitation of the directors.

                             MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS

                 -----------   ----------------
of directors shall be held on the fourth Friday of January, April, July and
October of each year at the principal offices of the Company in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina or Atlanta, Georgia, unless the board of directors fixes some
other place or time for the holding of such meetings.  If any date for which a
regular meeting is scheduled shall be a legal holiday, the meeting shall be
held on such other date as is designated in a notice of the meeting.

                 If possible, the directors, including directors-elect, shall
meet following each annual meeting of shareholders for the purpose of
organizing the board and electing officers for the succeeding year; provided,
in any event the new board shall be organized and officers elected no later
than at the next regular meeting of the directors.

                 Section 3.2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the board
                 -----------   ----------------
of directors may be called by or at the request of the chief executive officer
or any three directors.  Such meetings may be held at the time and place
designated in the notice of the meeting.

                 Section 3.3.  Notice of Meetings.  Unless the articles of
                 -----------   ------------------
incorporation provide otherwise, regular meetings of the board of directors
held on a date specified in or pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.1
may be held without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting.
The secretary giving notice of a regular meeting to be held on a date other
than a date specified in or pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.1, and
the secretary or other person calling a special meeting, shall give notice by
any usual means of communication to be sent at least 24 hours before the
meeting if notice is sent by means of telephone, telecopy or personal delivery
and at least five days before the meeting if notice is sent by mail.

                 Section 3.4.  Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided in the
                 -----------   ------
articles of incorporation, a majority of the directors in office shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a meeting of the board
of directors, provided a majority of the directors present are not also
officers of the corporation.  Less than a quorum may adjourn any meeting from
time to time, and the meeting as adjourned may be held without further notice.
In the event of the death, disability or other absence of directors due to war
or other catastrophe, reducing the number of directors able to attend a meeting
to less than that required for a quorum, a majority of the remaining directors
shall constitute a quorum.

                 Section 3.5.  Manner of Acting.  Except as otherwise provided

                 -----------   ---------------------
corporation who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which
action on any corporate matter is taken is deemed to have assented to the
action taken unless he objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly
upon arrival) to holding, or transacting business at, the meeting, or unless
his dissent or abstention is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he
shall file written notice of his dissent or abstention to such action with the
presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or with the corporation
immediately after adjournment of the meeting.  The right of dissent or
abstention shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

                 -----------   ----------------------
provided in the articles of incorporation, action required or permitted to be
taken at a meeting of the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if
the action is taken by all members of the board.  The action must be evidenced
by one or more written consents signed by each director before or after such
action, describing the action taken, and included in the minutes or filed with

effective date.

                 Section 3.8.  Meeting by Communications Device.  Unless
                 -----------   --------------------------------
otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, the board of directors may
permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by,

                   INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

                 Section 7.1.  Indemnification Provisions.  Any person who at
                 -----------   --------------------------
any time serves or has served as a director, officer or employee of the

or in such capacity at the request of the corporation for any other foreign or
domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
as a trustee or administrator under any employee benefit plan of the
corporation or of any wholly owned subsidiary thereof (a "Claimant"), shall
have the right to be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the
fullest extent from time to time permitted by law against all liabilities and
litigation expenses (as





                                     -11-

hereinafter defined) in the event a claim shall be made or threatened against
that person in, or that person is made or threatened to be made a party to, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether or not brought by or on
behalf of the corporation, including all appeals therefrom (a "proceeding"),
seeking to hold the Claimant liable by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was serving in such capacity (whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
action in such official capacity or in any other capacity while serving in such
official capacity); provided, such indemnification shall not be effective with
respect to (a) that portion of any liabilities or litigation expenses with
respect to which the Claimant is entitled to receive payment under any
insurance policy other than a directors' and officers' insurance policy
maintained by the Company or (b) any liabilities or litigation expenses
incurred on account of any of the Claimant's activities which were at the time
taken known or believed by the Claimant to be clearly in conflict with the best
interests of the corporation.

                 Section 7.2.  Definitions.  As used in this Article, (a)
                 -----------   -----------
"liabilities" shall include, without limitation, (1) payments in satisfaction
of any judgment, money decree, excise tax, fine or penalty for which the
Claimant had become liable in any proceeding and (2) payments in settlement of
any such proceeding subject, however, to Section 7.3; (b) "litigation expenses"
shall include, without limitation, (1) reasonable costs and expenses and
attorneys' fees and expenses actually and necessarily incurred by the Claimant
in connection with any proceeding and (2) reasonable costs and expenses and
attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of rights to
the indemnification granted hereby or by applicable law, if such enforcement is
successful in whole or in part; and (c) "disinterested directors" shall mean
directors who are not party to the proceeding in question.

                 Section 7.3.  Settlements.  The corporation shall not be
                 -----------   -----------
liable to indemnify the Claimant for any amounts paid in settlement of any
proceeding effected without the corporation's written consent.  The corporation
will not unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed settlement.

                 Section 7.4.  Litigation Expense Advances.
                 -----------   ---------------------------
                 (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c)
below, any litigation expenses shall be advanced to any Claimant within 60 days
of receipt by the General Counsel or secretary of the corporation of a demand
therefor, together with an undertaking (in such form as the corporation may
prescribe from time to time) by or on behalf of the Claimant to repay to the
corporation such amount unless it is ultimately determined that the Claimant is
entitled to be indemnified by the corporation against such expenses.  The
Claimant shall also forward to the General Counsel or secretary a statement as
to any insurance in effect of the type described in Section 7.1, together with
any information which the Claimant wishes to have considered in determining
whether the standards set forth below have been met.  The General Counsel or
secretary shall promptly forward notice of the demand and undertaking
immediately to all directors of the corporation.

                 (b)      In the event a demand for an advance of litigation
expenses is received from a Claimant who is or was a director or the chief
executive of the corporation, the General Counsel or secretary shall call a
meeting of a special committee (the "Special Committee"), the membership of
which shall include only disinterested directors, and such Special Committee
shall determine within 30 days thereafter, based upon the facts and information
then available to them, whether the Claimant's activities were at the time
taken known or believed by the Claimant to be clearly in conflict with the best
interests of the corporation.  In making such determination, the Special
Committee shall consult with





                                     -12-
<PAGE>   17
representatives of any insurance carrier having a directors' and officers'
liability policy in effect which covers the Claimant, where such insurance has
been purchased by the corporation.  No such advance shall be made if a majority
of the Special Committee determines that the litigation expenses have been
incurred on account of activities which at the time taken by such Claimant were
known or believed by him to be clearly in conflict with the best interests of
the corporation.  To the extent that any Claimant shall be entitled to an
advance under this Section, it shall be a further condition to such advance
that counsel selected by a Claimant be approved by the corporation and to the
extent deemed necessary by the corporation the selection of such counsel shall
also be approved by the carrier of any directors' and officer's liability
insurance then in effect.  The corporation also reserves the right, in the
instance of multiple Claimants, to require, if appropriate, the consolidation
of the defense of Claimants with counsel chosen by the corporation.  No such
advance of any particular items of litigation expenses shall be made if a
majority of the Special Committee affirmatively determines that such particular
items are unreasonable and/or excessive.  In any such case, the Special
Committee must determine the unreasonable or excessive amount, and the Company
shall withhold advances of expenses only in the dollar amount so determined as
excessive and/or unreasonable.

                 (c)      In the discretion of the chief executive officer or
his designee, the Special Committee procedures set forth in Section 7.4(b) may
be deemed to apply to a demand for an advance of litigation expenses received
from a Claimant not referred to in the first sentence of Section 7.4(b)
(including but not limited to a Claimant who is or was an officer (other than
the chief executive officer) or employee of the corporation or a director,
officer or employee of a subsidiary of the corporation).  Alternatively, the
chief executive officer or his designee may cause the Special Committee
procedures set forth in subsection (b) to be waived and, in lieu thereof, the
chief executive officer or his designee may determine whether the applicable
standard of conduct required by Section 7.4(b) has been met, whether the amount
of such expenses is reasonable and the amount of such expenses, if any, that
are unreasonable or excessive and consequently are to be withheld.

                 Section 7.5.  Approval of Indemnification Payments.  Except as
                 -----------   ------------------------------------
may be determined in an action brought pursuant to Section 7.6 below,
indemnification payments by the corporation for liabilities and litigation
expenses (or a termination of the undertaking required under Section 7.4 above
with respect to advanced expenses) may be made only following a determination
that the activities of the Claimant (if the Claimant is or was a director of
the corporation) were not of the kind described in Section 7.4(b), which
determination shall be made (a) by a majority of the disinterested directors
(if there are at least two such directors), or (b) if there are not two such
directors, or if a majority of the disinterested directors so directs, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by a majority of the
shareholders or (d) in accordance with any other reasonable procedures
prescribed by the board of directors prior to the assertion of the claim for
which indemnification is sought.  The reasonableness of amounts of settlements
and litigation expenses may be approved by a majority of the disinterested
members of the board of directors.  If the Claimant is an officer or employee
of the corporation, the determination required by this paragraph may be made by
the chief executive officer of the corporation or his designee.

                 Section 7.6.  Suits by Claimant.  If a claim under Section 7.1
                 -----------   -----------------
is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after a written claim has
been received by the corporation, or a demand for advances is not paid within
60 days of receipt by the corporation of such demand accompanied by an
undertaking as described in Section 7.4, the Claimant may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim or demand.  It shall be a defense to any such





                                     -13-
<PAGE>   18
action that the Claimant's liabilities or litigation expenses were incurred on
account of activities which were at the time taken known or believed by the
Claimant to be clearly in conflict with the best interests of the corporation,
or were unreasonable, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its
disinterested directors, independent legal counsel, shareholders or the chief
executive officer or his designee, if applicable) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the Claimant
is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the corporation
(including its disinterested directors, independent legal counsel, shareholders
or the chief executive officer or his designee, if applicable) that the
Claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct shall be a defense to
the action or create a presumption that Claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

             1993 DECLARATION OF AMENDMENT TO WACHOVIA CORPORATION
        RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND PROFIT-SHARING BENEFIT EQUALIZATION PLAN


                 THIS DECLARATION OF AMENDMENT, made the 22nd day of October,
1993, by WACHOVIA CORPORATION (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation
with its principal office at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to the Wachovia
Corporation Retirement Savings and Profit-Sharing Benefit Equalization Plan
(the "plan").

                                R E C I T A L S:
                                ----------------

                 It is deemed advisable to amend the plan to allow a
participant to elect, with the consent of the Committee which administers the
plan, for his benefit under the plan to be paid to him or applied for his
benefit in installments over a period not in excess of 15 years or in a single
lump sum payment.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, it is declared that the plan shall be and
hereby is amended, effective as of October 22, 1993, by deleting Section 6 in
its entirety and substituting therefor the following:

                          "Section 6.      Payment of Benefits.  The amount in
                          ----------       -------------------
                 the Benefit Equalization Account of a Participant (the
                 `Participant's Benefit') shall be paid to the same person or
                 persons as the Participant's benefit under the RSPSP (the
                 "RSPSP Beneficiaries") under one of the following options as
                 elected by the Participant, with the consent of the Committee,
                 prior to the date the Participant's Benefit becomes payable
                 under the Plan:

                                  (i)      Installments:  Payment in cash in
                                           -------------
                          approximately equal monthly installments over a term
                          certain not exceeding 15 years.

                                  (ii)     Lump Sum:  Payment in cash in a
                                           ---------
                          single lump sum payment.
<PAGE>   2
                 The Participant's Benefit shall become payable at the same
                 time his benefit under the RSPSP becomes payable on account of
                 retirement, termination of service or death.  In no event
                 shall a Participant's Benefit be subject to withdrawal while
                 the Participant is in service.   A Participant's election as
                 to the form of the payment of the Participant's Benefit shall
                 be made in the same manner and at the same time as his
                 election is made as to the form of the payment of benefits
                 under the RSPSP.  If a Participant fails to elect one of the
                 foregoing distribution options, the Participant's Benefit
                 shall be paid in the same manner as his benefit under the
                 RSPSP.  At any time prior to the death of a Participant, the
                 Participant may elect (which election shall be subject to
                 change at any time upon notice in writing by the Participant
                 to the Committee) for any payments hereunder following his
                 death to be made to a person or persons other than the RSPSP
                 Beneficiaries, in which event such payments shall be made to
                 such other person or persons in the same manner and at the
                 same time as such payments would have been made to the RSPSP
                 Beneficiaries pursuant to this Section 6.  Such election shall
                 be made by the Participant in writing on a form provided by
                 the Committee."

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Declaration of Amendment has been
executed in behalf of the Company on the day and year first above stated.

                                   AGREEMENT


                 THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this the 22nd day of
October, 1993, by and between WACHOVIA CORPORATION ("Wachovia") and JOHN G.
MEDLIN, JR. ("Medlin").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

                 John G. Medlin, Jr. presently serves as the chief executive
officer of Wachovia, a position he has held since July of 1985.  He also has
served as chairman of the board of Wachovia since May of 1987.  Medlin will
retire as chief executive officer effective December 31, 1993, in accordance
with the Executive Retirement Agreement under date of December 31, 1987, as
amended, between him and Wachovia.  After that date, he will no longer be an
employee of Wachovia or any of its subsidiary companies.

                 Medlin has been an active employee of Wachovia since 1959,
during which time he has acquired special competence in and intimate knowledge
of the business of the Company and of financial institutions in general.  He
has held many executive positions with the Wachovia organization, including
service as chief executive officer of The Wachovia Corporation and Wachovia
Bank and Trust Company, N.A. from 1977 until the merger with First Atlanta
Corporation to form Wachovia in 1985.  He is one of the most highly respected
chief executive officers in the United States and has received national
recognition on many occasions for his management and professional skills.

                 Because of his intimate knowledge of the Wachovia
organization, his exceptional skills in banking, his proven record of
leadership and knowledge of the industry, and the significant contributions
which he has made and can continue to make to Wachovia and to its board of
directors, the board has unanimously requested that he continue to serve as
chairman of the board of directors of Wachovia until he resigns as chairman or
his chairmanship otherwise terminates as provided herein.

                 The board believes that at this time it is in the best
interest of Wachovia to have Medlin continue to serve as chairman of the board
after his retirement as chief executive officer and as an employee of the
Company on December 31, 1993, and to provide herein for expanded
responsibilities and services to Wachovia by Medlin as chairman.

                 The Wachovia Bylaws vest the board of directors with the
authority to confer upon the chairman of the board added responsibilities and
duties, and to establish reasonable compensation for the services of the
chairman as set forth by the board of directors.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants hereinafter set forth, Wachovia, through the action of its board of
directors, and Medlin mutually agree as follows:

its subsidiaries in maintaining and developing relationships with customers.
To that end, Medlin as chairman will perform the following services, subject to

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA   )                THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE
                          )                SOUTH CAROLINA NATIONAL
COUNTY OF RICHLAND        )                CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL
                                           EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN


                 WHEREAS, South Carolina National Corporation ("SCNC")
previously established the South Carolina National Corporation Executive
Retirement Plan (the "Plan") for the benefit of certain key management
employees of SCNC and its affiliated corporations; and

                 WHEREAS, SCNC desires to amend the Plan to condition the
election of a participant to receive benefits under the Plan in a single lump
sum payment on obtaining the consent of the Committee, to eliminate the
condition that such election be made at least two (2) years prior to the
relevant distribution date, and to make certain other changes that are deemed
necessary and appropriate.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Article IX of the Plan, effective
as of October 18, 1993, Article IV, Section 4.06 Lump Sum Payment Option is
                                                 -----------------------
amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                 "4.06 Lump Sum Payment Option.  Notwithstanding anything in
                       -----------------------
         this Article IV to the contrary, in lieu of the installment payment
         methods for distribution of benefits outlined in this Article IV, a
         Vested Participant entitled to a distribution of benefits under this
         Article IV (including Vested Participants entitled to benefits under
         Articles V and VI) may elect, with the consent of the Committee, to
         receive the present value of that benefit in one lump sum payment.
         For purposes of this Section 4.06, the present value of any SERP
         Normal Retirement Benefit or SERP Early Retirement Benefit shall be
         determined by discounting the installment payments at the rate in
         effect on the date the lump sum payment is to be made that would be
         used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for purposes of
         determining the present value of a lump sum distribution on a plan
         termination.  All lump sum payments under this Section 4.06 shall be
         made as soon as is administratively feasible after the Vested
         Participant's Normal Retirement Date, Early Retirement Date, or other
         relevant distribution date, as the case may be, but not later than
         ninety (90) days after such date.  Any election by a Vested
         Participant to receive his benefits under the Plan in one lump sum
         payment shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to his Normal
         Retirement Date, Early Retirement Date or other relevant distribution
         date, as the

         case may be.  Such election shall be made on the form and in the
         manner specified by the Committee."

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, South Carolina National Corporation has
caused this Third Amendment to the South Carolina National Corporation
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan to be adopted and executed this 18th day
of October, 1993.

COUNTY OF RICHLAND        )                        CORPORATION DEFERRED
                                                   COMPENSATION PLAN

                 WHEREAS, South Carolina National Corporation ("SCNC")
previously established the South Carolina National Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the benefit of certain key employees of SCNC
and its affiliated corporations; and

                 WHEREAS, SCNC desires to amend the Plan to condition the
election of a participating employee as to the form and timing of the payment
of benefits under the Plan on obtaining the consent of the Committee, to
eliminate the condition that such election be made at least two (2) years prior
to the date on which the participating employee becomes entitled to receive
benefits under the Plan, and to make certain other changes that are deemed
necessary and appropriate.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Article II, Section 22 of the
Plan, the Plan is amended as follows:

                 1.       Article II, Section 8 is amended in its entirety to
                          read as follows:

                 "SECTION 8.  BENEFIT PAYMENTS AT TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
                 ----------   ---------------------------------------------
         Upon a Participating Employee's termination of employment with SCN for
         any reason other than death, the Participating Employee shall be
         entitled to receive deferred compensation in the amount determined
         under Article II, Section 7.  The Participating Employee may elect,
         with the consent of the Committee, to receive deferred compensation in
         either (i) a lump sum, or (ii) equal monthly payments over a fifteen
         (15) year period; with the amount of payments under either method
         determined in accordance with the appropriate column on the schedule
         of benefits provided for in Article II, Section 7.  Payments of
         deferred compensation shall be made to a Participant (in the case of a
         lump sum), or commence (in the case of installment payments) during
         the January immediately following the Participating Employee's
         termination of employment with SCN.  Any election as to the form of
         the payment of benefits under this Plan shall be made at least sixty
         (60) days prior to the date on which the Participating Employee
         becomes entitled to benefits under this Section 8.  Such election
         shall be made on the form provided by the Committee for such purpose.
         In the event that a participating employee shall fail to make such an
         election, benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid in equal
         monthly installments over a fifteen (15) year period."

<PAGE>   2

                 2.       Article II, Section 9 is amended in its entirety to
                          read as follows:

                 "SECTION 9.  BENEFIT PAYMENT WHEN TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
                 ----------   ----------------------------------------------
         OCCURS BETWEEN AGE 60 AND 65.  If a Participating Employee terminates
         ----------------------------
         employment with SCN after attaining age sixty (60), but prior to age
         sixty-five (65), the Participating Employee may elect, with the
         consent of the Committee, to delay the payment of, or commencement of
         payments in the event installments are elected, his deferred
         compensation under this Plan until the January immediately following
         the date on which he attains age sixty-five (65).  A Participating
         Employee's election to delay the commencement of his benefits under
         this Section must be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the
         Participating Employee's termination of employment with SCN.  Such
         election shall be made on the form provided by the Committee for such
         purpose.  If a Participating Employee makes a valid election to delay
         the commencement of his benefits until the January immediately
         following the date he attains age sixty-five (65) and dies prior to
         attaining such age, his date of death shall be deemed to be the date
         of his termination of employment with SCN and his benefits shall be
         paid in the form elected by the Participating Employee."
         
                  3.      The effective date of this Third Amendment shall be 
                          October 18, 1993.

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, South Carolina National Corporation has
caused this Third Amendment to the South Carolina National Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan to be adopted and executed this 18th day of October, 1993.

                     NEWS DEVELOPMENTS

- - L.M. Baker, Jr., 51, became chief executive officer of
Wachovia Corporation on January 1, 1994 succeeding John G. Medlin,
Jr., 60, who served in that position for the previous 17 years. Mr.
Baker remains president of the corporation and a director. Mr. Medlin
continues to serve as chairman of the board. The appointment was made
by the corporation's directors in October 1993.

Mr. Medlin said, "The exceptional skills and experience of Bud
Baker and the executives who head the major business units and
administrative functions, allow me to retire from management
responsibilities with full confidence in Wachovia's future."  Mr.
Baker joined Wachovia in 1969. He has held the positions of president
of the North Carolina bank, chief credit officer of the corporation,
executive in charge of the Administrative Services Division and head
of the International Group. He became president, chief operating
officer and a director of the parent company in February 1993.

During Mr. Medlin's 17-year tenure as chief executive officer,
Wachovia expanded to a multistate company by adding leading banks in
Georgia and South Carolina, with assets growing from $3.6 billion to
$36.5 billion. The originally reported net income per fully diluted
share of Wachovia grew at a compound annual rate of around 12 percent
over the 17 years. For a Wachovia common share increased for stock
splits, the market value rose from $21 on December 31, 1976 to $160.80
on December 31, 1993 and the dividend grew from $.63 in 1976 to $5.328
in 1993. During that period, the compound annual rate of total return
on the stock was 17 percent.

- - Three other members of executive management retired from
Wachovia. Retiring on December 31 were Thomas E. Boland, 59, as
executive vice president for consumer credit services after nearly 40
years of service with Wachovia Bank of Georgia and its predecessor,
First Atlanta, and James T. Brewer, 59, as executive vice president
and head of the Administrative Services Division after 33 years of
service. David L. Cotterill, 56, retired on January 31, 1994 as head
of Wachovia Trust Services following 30 years of service with
Wachovia.

- - Wachovia Corporation joined the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
of stocks and the Major Regional Banks S&P 500 Industry Group on
October 1, 1993. The addition removed Wachovia from the S&P MidCap 400
Index to which it was added in 1991.

- - The North Carolina and Georgia banks successfully launched
the Visa Check debit card beginning last summer, capitalizing on the
previous experience of South Carolina National Bank. Wachovia also
became the first bank nationwide to have Visa Check appear on its
automated banking machine cards. Visa Check allows authorized purchase
transactions to be debited automatically from customers' available
checking account balances. At year-end, Wachovia had more than 770,000
debit card customers and ranked as one of the largest debit card
issuers in the country.

- - In November 1993, Wachovia's Treasury Services Group began
offering Integrated Payables, a disbursing service that is part of its
cash management product line. The service outsources companies'
accounts payable functions, enabling them to streamline activities,
reduce costs and enhance internal controls.

Also, Wachovia Connection PC, an automated banking service for
small to medium-size businesses, was introduced in 1993. The service
enables smaller businesses to have on-line access to their deposit
accounts and to perform a variety of functions at their convenience
using personal computers and special software.

- - Wachovia Trust Services celebrated the 100th anniversary of
its business which began with the opening of the Wachovia Loan and
Trust Company on June 15, 1893. Today, Wachovia's trust function
provides services across the nation and has under administration
assets totaling more than $92 billion. During 1993, Wachovia Trust
Services expanded its mutual funds investment choices to include
stocks and bonds, as well as money market securities with the addition
of six new Biltmore Funds. The funds had total assets amounting to
$1.285 billion at year-end 1993.

- - Wachovia's Brokerage Service celebrated its 10th year of
operation in October 1993. The group provides brokerage services,
including buying and selling of stocks, corporate bonds, mutual funds
and options to more than 80,000 clients. Customers also may select the
Wachovia Investor's Account which automatically sweeps cash from a
checking account into a selected money market investment.

- - South Carolina National Bank, a member company of Wachovia
Corporation since 1991, plans to change its name to Wachovia Bank of
South Carolina, N.A., in May 1994. The action was approved by its
board of directors in October 1993.

- - John G. Medlin, Jr., was selected as the nation's best chief
executive for banking in 1993 as part of Financial World magazine's
20th annual chief executive officer of the year competition. Mr.
Medlin was one of 12 silver award winners chosen from more than 3,000
chief executives originally nominated in the contest. Judging is done
by senior securities analysts for each business category. Earlier, the
magazine ranked Wachovia as the best performing bank among the 25
largest U.S. banks for the 12-month period ending September 30, 1993.
The publication cited Wachovia's credit quality and return on assets
as key factors in the top rating.

                            LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS


Dear Wachovia Shareholder:

The economy improved during 1993, but growth was uneven and moderate on
balance. The stimulation of low interest rates and a large budget deficit was
tempered by slow employment gains, fragile consumer confidence and concerns
about heavier tax and regulatory burdens. Loan demand increased somewhat and
credit problems declined, but net interest spreads narrowed. In this climate,   
Wachovia's performance was excellent.

Net income per fully diluted share was $2.81, an increase of 13.5 percent from
$2.48 per share in 1992. Net income totaled $492.1 million, up 13.6 percent
from $433.2 million in the prior year, and represented strong returns of 17.1
percent on shareholders' equity and 1.46 percent on assets.

These excellent earnings resulted from higher levels of net interest income,
good growth of other operating revenues, careful control of operating
costs and reduced provisions for credit losses. The earnings performance
reflects the diligent and determined efforts of Wachovians to secure and
develop enduring business relationships, while maintaining high standards of
credit quality and expense management.

Average interest-earning assets for the year were up $1.683 billion or 6
percent from 1992. Loans grew $1.514 billion or 7.6 percent with the consumer
category, primarily credit card and automobile financing, accounting for the
majority of the increase. Wachovia's popular Prime Plus credit card pricing
options continued to generate strong growth. Investment securities increased
$838 million or 13.5 percent.

Average interest-bearing liabilities rose $1.201 billion or 5.2 percent from
the prior year. A moderate decrease in total time deposits was offset by higher 
levels of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the issuance of
notes by Wachovia Bank of North Carolina to supplement funding at attractive
rates.

Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $48.4 million or 3.6 percent,
reflecting the combination of growth in earning assets and a narrowing of net
interest spreads. The net yield on interest-earning assets decreased 11 basis
points for 1993, as the drop in funding costs slowed in the last half of the
year, while asset yields continued a steady decline.

Other operating revenue grew $64.9 million or 12.1 percent. Good gains were
achieved in fees from credit card, deposit account and trust services. Gains on
the sale of investment securities and subsidiary sales totaled $27.4 million
in 1993 versus $21 million for 1992, resulting in total noninterest income
growth of $71.4 million or 12.8 percent.

Noninterest expense rose a more moderate $35.6 million or 3.2 percent.
Personnel expense increased $28.9 million or 5.3 percent, largely reflecting
higher employee benefits expense. Net occupancy and equipment expense was
up by $2.7 million or 1.5 percent with remaining categories of noninterest
expense growing a combined $4 million or 1.1 percent.

Wachovia's exceptional credit quality was even better as nonperforming assets
declined to $155 million or .67 percent of loans and foreclosed property at
December 31, 1993 from  $265 million or 1.25 percent a year earlier. Net loan
losses totaled $67.4 million or .31 percent of average loans, a reduction of
$27.8 million or 29.2 percent from $95.2 million or .48 percent of average
loans in 1992.

The provision for loan losses was $92.7 million, exceeding net charge-offs by
$25.2 million, and down $26.8 million or 22.4 percent from $119.4 million in
1992. The allowance for loan losses totaled $405 million at year-end 1993,
representing 1.76 percent of loans and 372 percent coverage of nonperforming
loans compared with $380 million or 1.80 percent of loans and 218 percent
coverage a year earlier.

At December 31, 1993, shareholders' equity was $3.018 billion and represented
8.26 percent of assets. The Tier I and total risk-based capital ratios were
9.72 percent and 12.88 percent, respectively. Wachovia continues to be a leader
in financial strength and earnings quality among the major banking companies of
the nation and world.

Dividends totaled $1.11 per share in 1993, up 11 percent from $1.00 per share
paid in 1992. The total return for 1993 on Wachovia common stock,
including dividend reinvestment, was 1.3 percent compared with 10.1 percent for
the S&P 500 Index, reflecting market weakness in bank stocks as a group. At
December 31, 1993, Wachovia's assets of $36.526 billion ranked 22nd among U.S.
banking companies, while net income of $492.1 million for the year was 16th.
Wachovia's market capitalization of $5.741 billion ranked 13th.

More detailed financial information for 1993 and the previous five years is

section beginning on page 8. Highlights for the period include:

- - Net income per fully diluted share grew at a compound annual rate of 9.7
percent from 1989 to 1993. Returns on shareholders' equity and assets averaged
14.9 percent and 1.17 percent, respectively, for the past five years, while
common equity to assets averaged 7.79 percent.

- - Average major balance sheet categories increased at the following five-year
compound annual rates: interest-earning assets, 6.4 percent; loans, 5.7
percent; interest-bearing liabilities, 6 percent; total deposits, 3.5 percent;
total assets, 5.9 percent; and shareholders' equity, 9.9 percent.

- - Other operating revenue, which excludes gains from investment securities
and subsidiary sales, grew at a compound annual rate of 10.4 percent for
the period, while noninterest expense advanced a slower 5.5 percent.

- - Net loan losses averaged .52 percent of loans for the past five years and
nonperforming assets to loans and foreclosed property averaged 1.06 percent.
Reserve coverage of nonperforming loans averaged 212 percent for the period.

- - Common dividends paid increased at a compound annual rate of 13.7 percent for
the years 1989 through 1993. The five-year compound annual rate of total
return on Wachovia common stock, including dividend reinvestment, was 20.4
percent compared with 14.5 percent for the S&P 500 Index.

These excellent results were achieved during a treacherous period for
banking, while investing heavily in people, technology and interstate
expansion. They are a tribute to the leadership of John Medlin, who served with
distinction as chief executive officer for the past 17 years and retired from
that position on December 31 after 34 years of service.

Thanks to John's passion for excellence, Wachovia avoided most of the
pitfalls of banking and faces the remainder of this decade from a unique and
coveted position of strength. He also had the vision to plan and guide top
management succession through a smooth and gradual transition over recent
years. We are fortunate to have him continue as chairman, a director and an
active ambassador for the company.

Personal profiles of the talented executives who now head major business units
and administrative functions are on pages 6 and 7. Together, we are proud to
lead your company. Our sacred mission is to continue providing exceptional
protection and growth of your investment.

Sincerely,


/s/  L. M. Baker, Jr.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Summary

                Wachovia Corporation's primary markets within the Southeast are
          Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The combined population
          of the three states totaled 17.502 million in 1993, up 305 thousand
          or 1.8 percent from 17.197 million in 1992. The three-state
          population represented 6.8 percent of the total U.S. population.
                Economic activity in all three states has shown general
          improvement since the recession of 1991. An index of business
          activity composed of nonagricultural employment, average
          manufacturing workweek, building permits and initial claims for
          unemployment has shown consecutive quarterly gains since the second
          quarter of 1991.
                For example, on a combined basis using most currently available
          data, nonagricultural employment for the three states averaged 7.875
          million during 1993, up 208 thousand or 2.7 percent from 1992.
          Building permits for the three states averaged $638.672 million
          during 1993, an increase of $120 million or 23.2 percent from
          $518.206 million in 1992.
                Wachovia Corporation's consolidated operating results and
          financial condition are presented and analyzed in the following
          narrative, tables and charts. The narrative should be read in
          conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
          pages 40 through 53. Expanded six-year financial data appears on
          pages 54 through 61. References to changes in the corporation's
          assets and liabilities refer to daily average levels unless otherwise
          noted.
                Net income for 1993 totaled $492.095 million compared with
          $433.225 million in 1992. On a fully diluted basis, net income per
          share was $2.81 for the year versus $2.48 per share in 1992. Return
          on shareholders' equity was 17.1 percent and return on assets 1.46
          percent for 1993 compared with 16.7 percent and 1.36 percent,
          respectively, in the prior year.

Net Interest Income

                Taxable equivalent net interest income (which is adjusted for
          the tax-favored status of earnings from certain loans and
          investments) rose $48.429 million or 3.6 percent in 1993. The
          increase primarily reflected growth in interest-earning assets
          partially offset by the effects of narrowing of the net yield on
          interest-earning assets.
                The net yield on interest-earning assets (taxable equivalent
          net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning
          assets) decreased 11 basis points for the year in comparison with
          1992. A continued drop in yields on assets, which are supported
          partially by noninterest-bearing funds, accounted for the decrease. 
          Asset yields fell in line with a declining interest rate environment
          with higher-yielding assets replaced by lower-yielding loans and
          investments. Funding rates declined by approximately the same amount
          as asset yields but would have declined further if the corporation
          had not lengthened maturities of its borrowings to take advantage of
          favorable longer-term interest rates.
                Interest income and yields for 1993 are stated on a fully
          taxable equivalent basis using both the federal income tax rate of 35
          percent and state tax rates, as applicable, reduced by the
          nondeductible portion of interest expense. The taxable equivalent
          adjustment for 1992 is based on only the federal income tax rate of
          34 percent. The 1993 presentation better reflects the current
          economic benefit of certain categories of tax-favored income.

Interest Income

                Taxable equivalent interest income decreased $79.587 million or
           3.5 percent in 1993, although gains occurred in the latter months of
           the year. Lower yields earned were offset only partially by higher
           levels of interest-earning assets. The average rate earned dropped
           73 basis points, reflecting, in part, shifts in the credit card
           portfolio from higher fixed rates to lower variable rates,
           prepayments of higher rate residential mortgages, lower rates on
           investment securities and intensely competitive market pricing for
           loans. Average interest-earning assets rose $1.683 billion or 6
           percent with better growth in the second half and especially the
           latter months of the year.
                Despite soft demand, the corporation's average loans were
           higher by $1.514 billion or 7.6 percent for the year. Good gains
           occurred in retail loans with commercial outstandings rising
           modestly.
                Retail loans, including residential mortgages, increased $1.236
           billion or 14.7 percent, reflecting good growth primarily in the
           credit card and automobile categories. Credit card outstandings
           gained $817 million or 46.1 percent. At December 31, 1993, the
           credit card portfolio totaled $3.123 billion compared with $2.216
           billion a year earlier. Approximately 84 percent of the total was
           variable rate versus approximately 61 percent at year-end 1992.
           Borrowers continued to be attracted to the corporation's low
           variable rate pricing option.  In 1993, Wachovia introduced a
           First-Year Prime Visa and MasterCard option to complement its
           popular Prime Plus 2.9 percent card, which is offered with a $39
           annual fee. The new pricing option carries an interest rate of prime
           for the first year and is 3.9 percent above prime thereafter, with
           an $18 annual fee.
                Indirect retail loans, primarily consisting of automobile sales
           financing in the three home states, grew $239 million or 11.9
           percent. Residential mortgages and other revolving credit also were
           higher for the year. The home equity portion of residential
           mortgages averaged $768 million compared with $805 million in 1992.
           Direct retail loans declined modestly.
                Commercial loans, including related real estate categories,
           increased $278 million or 2.4 percent, reflecting continued
           softness in demand due to slow economic growth and alternative
           funding from public debt and equity markets for large corporate
           borrowers. Regular commercial loans, up $331 million or 5.6 percent,
           and commercial mortgages, higher by $83 million or 2.7 percent, had
           the strongest gains for the year. Lease financing and foreign loans
           rose slightly, while construction loans and tax-exempt borrowings
           declined.
                Commercial real estate outstandings at December 31, 1993 were
           $3.693 billion, representing 16.1 percent of total loans versus
           $3.583 billion or 17 percent at year-end 1992. Based on regulatory
           definitions, commercial mortgages were $3.199 billion or 13.9
           percent of total loans and construction loans were $494 million or
           2.2 percent. Comparable amounts a year earlier were $3.119 billion
           or 14.8 percent and $464 million or 2.2 percent, respectively.
                The $3.693 billion of commercial real estate outstandings at
           year-end 1993 included $2.088 billion in commercial real estate
           loans, representing 9.1 percent of total loans, originated through
           the corporation's Commercial Mortgage Group. Loans in this group are
           dependent primarily on the income stream, refinancing or resale
           value of the property mortgaged for repayment and are segregated
           from other commercial real estate

to recognize and define HLTs in accordance with the previously existing

           will be required to adopt by 1995. This standard modifies the
           accounting for certain loans where it is probable that the
           corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
           the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The corporation is in
           the process of evaluating the timing of adoption and the effect that
           implementation of the standard will have on its financial
           statements, but does not expect it to have a material impact.  Note
           E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional
           information about FASB 114.
                During a period when loan growth expectations have been modest,
           the corporation added significantly to its investment securities,
           the second largest category of interest-earning assets. They
           expanded $838 million or 13.5 percent during the year. U.S. Treasury
           securities accounted for all the increase, rising $1.462 billion or
           73.4 percent. At year-end 1993, 95.6 percent of the corporation's
           municipal portfolio was rated A or higher by Moody's. At December
           31, 1993, the market value of the total investment securities
           portfolio was $8.157 billion, representing a $278 million
           appreciation over book value. This compared with a $6.793 billion
           market value and a $307 million appreciation at year-end 1992.
                The corporation has elected to adopt Statement of Financial
           Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
           in Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115), as of January 1, 1994.
           FASB 115 requires that investment securities be classified as either
           "held to maturity" or "available for sale." "Held to maturity"
           securities will be carried at amortized cost which is the accounting
           method currently used for the investment securities account.
           Securities classified as "available for sale" will be accounted
           for at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported
           as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Under FASB 115,
           trading account securities will continue to be carried in a separate
           account at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in the
           income statement. If the corporation had adopted FASB 115 at
           December 31, 1993, the impact on shareholders' equity would have
           been an increase of $24.368 million. Note D of Notes to Consolidated
           Financial Statements contains additional information regarding FASB
           115.

Interest Expense

                Interest expense for 1993 decreased $128.016 million or 13.2
           percent as the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities
           dropped 72 basis points. Partially reducing the impact of the rate
           decline was a $1.201 billion or 5.2 percent increase in average
           interest-bearing liabilities for the year.
                Total interest-bearing deposits were lower by $865 million or
           4.8 percent. Interest-bearing demand and savings and money market
           savings were up a combined $548 million or 6.3 percent. This was
           offset by the outflow of longer-term consumer deposits seeking
           higher yields as they matured. Savings certificates declined $603
           million or 9.7 percent. Large denomination certificates decreased
           $854 million or 32.9 percent. The corporation allowed its large
           denomination certificates to roll off as it continued to grow its
           medium-term bank note program.
                Total short-term borrowings rose $442 million or 8.9 percent
           led by growth in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.
           Other short-term borrowings, which primarily consists of term
           federal funds, decreased.
                Long-term debt rose $1.624 billion, primarily reflecting the
           growth of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina's medium-term bank note
           program begun in the second quarter of 1992. At December 31, 1993,
           Wachovia Bank of North Carolina had a total of $2.370 billion of
           these notes outstanding with an average cost of 4.54 percent and an
           average maturity of 1.8 years versus $758 million, 4.59 percent and
           1.8 years, respectively, a year earlier. These notes had been
           classified under short-term borrowed funds but have been
           reclassified as long-term debt to more accurately reflect the
           weighted average maturity of these instruments, and prior periods
           have been restated. The bank notes issued during 1993 generally had
           maturities of two to five years but can be issued for maturities up
           to 10 years.
                The corporation also issued $250 million of ten-year
           subordinated notes in April 1993. They were priced at a spread of 60
           basis points above the yield on U.S. Treasury notes of comparable
           maturity at the time of sale to yield 6.481 percent. The corporation
           redeemed $79 million of floating rate subordinated capital notes in
           March 1993.
                Gross deposits for 1993 averaged $22.373 billion, down $458
           million or 2 percent compared with $22.831 billion in the prior
           year. Collected deposits, net of float, averaged $20.762 billion,
           lower by $373 million or 1.8 percent from $21.135 billion in 1992.
           Demand and noninterest-bearing time deposits averaged $5.355 billion
           compared with $4.947 billion in the previous year.

Asset and Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity
Management

                Changes in interest rates can substantially impact the
           corporation's net interest income and profitability.  The goal of
           asset/liability management is to maximize net interest income while
           mitigating negative impacts of interest rate changes.
                The corporation seeks to meet this goal by managing
           discretionary investments and funding sources, by product pricing
           and structuring strategies and by utilizing off-balance sheet
           instruments when appropriate.  In addition to monitoring the
           relationship between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
           liabilities, this process is facilitated by the application of
           simulation models which are the principal tools employed for
           interest rate management. Information provided by the
           multidimensional models portrays the results of changes in interest
           rates which are analyzed with the objective of identifying potential
           adverse performance situations.  If such a condition should occur,
           the immediate goal is to construct a strategy to neutralize, as much
           as possible, the impact.
                Additionally, the corporation monitors the difference or gap
           between the corporation's rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive
           liabilities over various time periods. The gap may be either
           positive (rate sensitive assets exceed liabilities) or negative
           (rate sensitive liabilities exceed assets).
                The table on page 17 sets forth the volume of interest-earning
           assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding as of December
           31, 1993 and 1992, which mature or are projected to reprice in each
           of the future time periods shown.
                The projected asset repricing volumes include anticipated
           prepayments of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. The
           projected interest checking and savings repricing volumes are based
           on the expected rate sensitivity of these accounts in relationship
           to the prime rate.
                Prepayment assumptions and the distribution of these deposit
           liabilities based on management's assumptions present a more
           accurate view of the corporation's rate risk position. The
           nonsensitive and maturing beyond one year section of the table
           includes bank credit card loans of $499 million in 1993 and $860
           million in 1992, savings balances of $577 million in 1993 and $852
           million in 1992 and interest-bearing

           checking balances of $2.222 billion in 1993 and $1.767 billion in 
           1992.

                The corporation uses off-balance sheet or "derivative"
           instruments to change the structure of both assets and liabilities to
           help manage the interest rate sensitivity of its balance sheet and
           also as a product to assist corporate and other customers manage
           their interest rate risk. The primary instruments used have been
           interest rate swaps, caps and floors. As of December 31, 1993, the
           corporation had $3.387 billion in notional amount

                                      17
<PAGE>   20
           of these transactions outstanding as compared with $1.915
           billion a year ago with 37 percent related to its balance sheet
           management versus 34 percent a year earlier.
                The ability of counterparties to perform under the terms of
           these transactions is the primary risk of this activity. The
           corporation mitigates this risk by subjecting the transactions to a
           similar approval process as is used for on-balance sheet credit
           transactions, by dealing in the national market with a few highly
           rated counterparties and by using collateral agreements to reduce
           exposure when appropriate. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated
           Financial Statements for additional information.
                The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that the
           corporation is positioned to meet all immediate and future demands
           for cash. There are multiple requirements for cash placed on a
           financial intermediary. Consequently, the process for liability
           planning must include, but not be limited to, considerations of
           credit demand, deposit flows and corporate operating expenses and
           revenues. Not only are contractual cash flows such as loan
           repayments and deposit maturities and withdrawals factored into this
           process, but economic events also must be considered. Liquidity
           management relies upon liquidity analysis and knowledge of
           historical trends over past credit and business cycles and forecasts
           of future conditions to achieve its objectives.
                The two broad-based sources of liquidity which exist for the
           corporation are its high quality marketable assets, and liabilities
           which are readily acceptable by providers of funds. Asset liquidity
           primarily is provided

           by securities which by their maturity structure or
           marketability can produce cash flows that result in enhanced
           liquidity. The ability to generate additional cash through the
           liability side of the balance sheet focuses on the growth of
           deposits, the issuance of bank notes and other forms of debt
           securities.
                Wachovia's ability to attract a variety of funds rests on the
           corporation's strength of capital, reputation, credit ratings and
           diverse statewide banking networks. At December 31, 1993, Wachovia's
           common equity to assets ratio was 8.26 percent, 4th highest among
           the 25 largest U.S. banks. Wachovia's strong capital position is
           reflected in its credit ratings and remains central to its ability
           to raise additional funds at attractive rates through short-term
           borrowings and long-term debt.
                At year-end 1993, Wachovia Corporation's senior debt was rated
           (P) Aa3 by Moody's and (P)AA by Standard & Poor's. The corporation's
           subordinated debt was rated A1 and AA- by Moody's and Standard &
           Poor's, respectively. Commercial paper was rated P-1 by Moody's and
           A-1+ by Standard & Poor's.
                All of the corporation's asset/liability strategies are
           conducted under policies and guidelines established by the
           corporation's Finance Committee. The committee monitors interest
           rate risk, liquidity and capital. Committee guidelines limit the
           acceptable negative change in forecasted net interest income from
           assumed movements in interest rates. Funding guidelines include
           limits on concentrations of maturities and funding categories, and
           funding exposure to single outside sources. Guidelines for capital
           require maintenance of sufficient capital to be classified a
           well-capitalized banking organization under regulatory capital
           guidelines and definitions.

Nonperforming Assets

                Nonperforming assets were $154.901 million or .67 percent of
           loans and foreclosed property at December 31, 1993, a decline of
           $110.508 million or 41.6 percent from year-end 1992. The decrease
           resulted principally from paydowns, property sales and the return of
           cash-basis assets to accrual status, reflecting continued sound loan
           administration and active management of credit, combined with lower
           interest rates and generally improving real estate market conditions
           in the corporation's primary states.
                Real estate nonperforming assets, the largest segment of total
           nonperforming assets, were $123.595 million or 1.65 percent of real
           estate loans and foreclosed real estate at December 31, 1993. This
           compared with $228.714 million or 3.12 percent a year earlier, a
           decline of $105.119 million or 46 percent. Although the real estate
           markets in which Wachovia operates maintained stronger values
           relative to norms in the national market, overbuilding resulted in
           elevated levels of foreclosed property each year between 1987 and
           1992. This

          trend has been reversed in 1993 with foreclosed property of
          $45.939 million at year-end, a decline of $45.376 million or 49.7
          percent since year-end 1992.
                Commercial real estate nonperforming assets totaled $98.014
          million or 2.63 percent of related loans and foreclosed property, a
          drop of $99.208 million or 50.3 percent from $197.222 million or 5.39
          percent at year-end 1992. Within the Commercial Mortgage Group
          described on page 12, nonperforming assets were $70.461 million or
          3.33 percent of its loans and foreclosed real estate, down $77.799
          million or 52.5 percent from $148.260 million or 7.24 percent at
          December 31, 1992.
                No HLTs were nonperforming at year-end 1993 or 1992.

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

                The provision for loan losses totaled $92.652 million in 1993,
          exceeding net credit losses by $25.241 million. The provision was
          lower by $26.768 million or 22.4 percent from the $119.420 million
          taken in 1992. The corporation maintains, through its provision, an
          allowance for loan losses believed by management to be adequate to
          absorb potential credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Improved
          conditions within the corporation's loan and commitments portfolio,
          including better payment experience, reduced delinquencies and more
          favorable expectations of collectibility, as well as continued
          gradual economic recovery in 1993 led to the reduced provision for
          the year.
                Net loan losses totaled $67.411 million or .31 percent of
          average loans, a decrease of $27.834 million or 29.2 percent from
          $95.245 million or .48 percent of average loans in 1992. Recoveries
          represented 30.6 percent of gross loan charge-offs versus 27.6
          percent in 1992.
                Credit card net charge-offs for the year declined $4.120
          million or 7.3 percent to $52.675 million or 2.03 percent of average
          credit card loans. Credit card loans delinquent 30 days or more at
          December 31, 1993 totaled $41.434 million, representing 1.33 percent
          of the period-end portfolio. This compared with $46.870 million or
          2.11 percent a year earlier.
                Net loan losses for other revolving credit were lower by $710
          thousand or 19.7 percent and totaled $2.893 million or .88 percent of
          average related loans for the year versus $3.603 million or 1.12
          percent in 1992. Other retail net loan losses, consisting of direct
          and indirect retail net credit losses, decreased $7.100 million or
          60.5 percent to $4.640 million or .16 percent of average related
          loans.
                Real estate net charge-offs totaled $5.821 million or .08
          percent of average real estate loans, down $15.428 million or 72.6
          percent from $21.249 million or .30 percent of related loans in 1992.
                No HLTs were charged-off in 1993 or 1992.
                At December 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses totaled
          $404.798 million, representing 1.76 percent of year-end loans and 372
          percent coverage of nonperforming loans. Comparable amounts a year
          earlier were $379.557 million or 1.80 percent of loans and 218
          percent coverage of nonperforming loans.

Noninterest Income

                Other operating revenue rose $64.937 million or 12.1 percent
          for the year. Good growth was achieved in most major categories
          of noninterest income.
                Credit card fee income increased $23.712 million or 30.4
          percent in 1993, reflecting both good growth in new accounts and
          increased sales volume. During the year, the corporation introduced a
          First-Year Prime pricing option on its Visa and MasterCard credit
          cards. This is in addition to Wachovia's popular Prime Plus and No
          Fee pricing options. Annual credit card fees and cardholder
          interchange income represented 76 percent of credit card fee income.
          Income on cash advances and late charge fees are recorded as part of
          credit card interest income.
                Deposit account service revenues rose $13.348 million or 7
          percent due to growth in commercial analysis fees, consumer demand
          deposit charges and overdraft fees. Trading account activities
          recorded gains of $13.103 million for the year compared with losses
          of $11.542 million in 1992 which stemmed from hedging in
          mortgage-backed securities. This portfolio was affected adversely in
          1992 by prepayment experience substantially above historical norms,
          as well as abnormal changes in historical rate relationships between
          mortgage-backed securities and hedging instruments. This was offset
          by the net interest income earned on the inventory of mortgage-backed
          trading securities during the year.
                Trust fees grew $10.526 million or 9.6 percent, as a result of
          increased volumes of personal and institutional business combined
          with improved portfolio valuations associated with rising prices in
          the stock and bond markets. In the second quarter of the year, the
          corporation expanded its Biltmore Funds, a proprietary family of
          mutual funds, from five to eleven investment portfolios. The funds
          had assets totaling $1.285 billion at year-end. At December 31, 1993,
          trust assets totaled $92.287 billion with $17.950 billion under
          management. This compared with $85.806 billion a year earlier with
          $16.147 billion under management.
                Mortgage fee income, which primarily includes servicing and
          origination fees and revenues from mortgage loan sales, decreased
          $977 thousand or 2.4 percent for the year. Combined servicing and
          origination fees were up $6.035 million or 13.7 percent. However,
          increased mortgage prepayments in a lower interest rate environment
          resulted in write-offs of excess servicing fees amounting to $1.554
          million. At year-end 1993, the mortgage portfolio serviced totaled
          $9.007 billion, representing 135,637 loans compared with $8.591
          billion and 135,068 loans a year earlier. Remaining categories of
          noninterest income, excluding revenues from student loan servicing
          and gains from securities and subsidiary sales, rose $21.398 million
          or 22.2 percent.
                In February of 1993, the corporation sold its student loan
          services subsidiary. Consequently, revenue comparisons between 1993
          and 1992 for student loan servicing are not meaningful. The sale
          resulted in a pretax gain of $8.030 million. This subsidiary's net
          income for 1992 was less than 1 percent of the corporation's
          consolidated net income. In the 1992 third quarter, a consumer
          finance subsidiary was sold resulting in a pretax gain of $19.486
          million. The net income of this subsidiary for the first six months
          of 1992

                Noninterest expense increased $35.584 million or 3.2 percent
          for the year. Careful expense control remains an important operating
          principle with management. The corporation's overhead ratio measuring
          noninterest expense to taxable equivalent net interest income and
          noninterest income, excluding securities and subsidiary sales,
          dropped to 57 percent from 58.6 percent in 1992. This compared with a
          median overhead ratio of 62.5 percent in 1993 for the 25 largest U.S.
          banks, as shown in the accompanying chart.
                Total personnel expense rose $28.857 million or 5.3 percent.
          Salaries expense edged up $4.428 million or 1 percent. Employee
          benefits expense rose $24.429 million or 27.6 percent. This primarily
          reflected a special contribution to the retirement savings and profit
          sharing plan for employees in recognition of the corporation's 1993
          earnings results and the impact of a new accounting change for
          postretirement expenses.  The corporation adopted Statement of
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for
          Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (FASB 106), on January
          1, 1993, which requires the accrual of nonpension benefits as
          employees render service. The corporation has elected, under the
          transitional method of adoption, to amortize the accumulated
          postretirement benefits obligation of $63.041 million over 20 years.

          For 1993, postretirement benefits expense was approximately
          $5.210 million higher under FASB 106 than would have been recorded
          under the previous accounting method.
                Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $2.727 million or
          1.5 percent. Other combined categories of noninterest expense were
          higher by $4 million or 1.1 percent. Total foreclosed property
          expense included write-downs of $8.317 million in 1993 versus $6.032
          million in 1992.

Income Taxes

                Applicable income taxes rose $32.467 million or 19.9 percent in
          1993, reflecting increased federal tax rates and higher levels of
          pretax income. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are
          reduced primarily by the interest earned on state and municipal debt
          securities and industrial revenue obligations. Also, within certain
          limitations, one-half of the interest income of qualifying employee
          stock ownership plan loans is exempt from federal taxes. The interest
          earned on state and municipal debt instruments is exempt from federal
          taxes and, except for out-of-state issues, from North Carolina and
          Georgia taxes as well, and results in substantial interest savings
          for local governments and their constituents.
                During the first quarter of 1993, the corporation prospectively
          adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
          "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB 109). The adoption changes the
          corporation's method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred
          method previously required to an asset and liability approach to
          accounting for income taxes. The cumulative impact of this change in
          accounting principle was a tax benefit of $2.700 million, which was
          included in income tax expense for 1993.
                The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of
          deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
          consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
          and the tax base of assets and liabilities. Since FASB 109 requires
          deferred tax assets and liabilities to be adjusted to reflect the
          effect of enacted tax law or rate changes, future tax legislation
          will have an impact on deferred income tax expense.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL RATIOS

                Shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993 totaled $3.018
          billion, an increase of $243 million or 8.8 percent from $2.775
          billion a year earlier. Equity averaged $2.872 billion for the year,
          higher by $276 million or 10.6 percent from $2.596 billion in 1992.
          Wachovia's book value at December 31, 1993 was $17.61 per share, up
          8.8 percent from $16.18 per share at year-end 1992.
                Wachovia's internal capital generation rate (net income less
          dividends as a percentage of average equity) was 10.5 percent in 1993
          versus 10.1 percent in 1992.
                The corporation's board of directors has authorized the
          repurchase of up to 5 million shares of Wachovia common stock for
          various corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for the
          corporation's employee stock plans and dividend reinvestment plan.
          Share repurchase began on July 1, 1993. During 1993, 2,730,200 shares
          were repurchased at an average price of $35.35 per share for a total
          cost of $96.511 million. The number of shares available for possible
          repurchase at year-end 1993 totaled 2,269,800.
                Intangible assets totaled $90.118 million at December 31, 1993,
          a decrease of $12.919 million or 12.5 percent from $103.037 million a
          year earlier. The decline reflected both normal amortization of
          intangibles and $6.966 million of accelerated write-downs of mortgage
          servicing rights and credit card premiums. These write-downs took
          place during a period of sharply declining interest rates, resulting
          in the refinancing of large numbers of mortgages serviced and a
          runoff of high rate cardholder balances from purchased portfolios.
          The 1993 year-end total consisted of $40.875 million in mortgage
          servicing rights, $32.451 million in goodwill, $10.647 million in
          deposit base intangibles and $6.145 million in other intangibles.
          Comparable amounts at year-end 1992 were $45.443 million in mortgage
          servicing rights, $33.941 million in goodwill, $13.984 million in
          deposit base intangibles and $9.669 million in other intangibles.
                Regulatory agencies divide capital into Tier I (consisting of
          shareholders' equity less ineligible intangible assets) and Tier II
          (consisting of the allowable portion of the reserve for loan losses
          and certain long-term debt) and measure capital adequacy by applying
          both capital levels to a banking company's risk-adjusted assets and
          off-balance sheet items. In addition, regulatory agencies have
          established a Tier I leverage ratio which measures Tier I capital to
          average assets less ineligible intangible assets.
                Regulatory guidelines require a minimum total capital ratio to
          risk-adjusted assets ratio of 8 percent with one-half consisting of
          tangible common shareholders' equity and a minimum Tier I leverage
          ratio of 3 percent. Banks which meet or exceed a Tier I ratio of 6
          percent, a total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 10 percent
          and a Tier I leverage ratio of 5 percent are considered well
          capitalized by regulatory standards.

                At December 31, 1993, Wachovia's Tier I to risk-adjusted assets
          ratio was 9.72 percent and including Tier II was 12.88 percent. The
          corporation's Tier I leverage ratio was 8.44 percent. These capital
          ratios remain well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements.

Dividends

                The corporation paid cash dividends of $191.488 million for
          1993, an increase of $20.732 million or 12.1 percent from the
          $170.756 million paid in 1992. This represents a payout of net income
          amounting to 38.9 percent versus 39.4 percent a year ago. Wachovia's
          payout ratio ranks among the highest of the 25 largest U.S. banks.
          Cash dividends per share totaled $1.11, up 11 percent from $1.00 per 
          share paid in the prior year. 
                At its meeting on January 28, 1994, the board of directors
          declared a first quarter dividend of $.30 per share, which is 11.1
          percent higher than the $.27 per share paid in the same period of
          1993. The dividend is payable on March 1 to shareholders of record on
          February 8, 1994. 
                Additional dividend information is presented on pages 62 and 63.

FOURTH QUARTER ANALYSIS

                Net income per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of
          1993 was $.71, an increase of 12.9 percent from $.63 per share earned
          in the same period of 1992. Net income totaled $122.997 million,
          up $13.326 million or 12.2 percent from $109.671 million and
          represented returns of 16.8 percent on shareholders' equity and 1.39
          percent on assets.
                Taxable equivalent net interest income rose $11.028 million or
          3.2 percent. Higher volume of interest-earning assets accounted for
          the increase, which was offset partially by the impact of reduced
          rates. Loans grew $1.573 billion or 7.6 percent led by credit cards,
          automobile financing, residential mortgages and regular commercial
          loans. Investment securities increased $1.513 billion or 23.3 percent.
          The net yield on interest-earning assets decreased 29 basis points,
          reflecting both a slower decline in funding costs and higher levels of
          interest-earning assets with lower yields.
                The provision for loan losses was $18.013 million, down $10.551
          million or 36.9 percent from $28.564 million taken in the final period
          of 1992, but exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter by $707
          thousand. Net loan losses totaled $17.306 million or .31 percent of
          average loans, lower by $10.995 million or 38.9 percent from the
          year-earlier quarter. Real estate net loan losses had the greatest
          improvement, dropping to $1.156 million or .06 percent of average real
          estate loans from $12.306 million or .68 percent of related loans in
          the 1992 fourth period. Net loan losses on other retail loans
          decreased $613 thousand or 25.3 percent to $1.812 million or .23
          percent of average related loans. Credit card net charge-offs
          increased slightly but dropped as a percentage of average credit card
          loans to 1.74 percent versus 2.48 percent in the same period of 1992.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1992 vs. 1991             Net income for 1992 totaled $433.225 million and      
                     represented returns of 16.7 percent on shareholders'
                     equity and 1.36 percent on assets versus net income of
                     $229.540 million and returns of 9.3 percent and .72
                     percent, respectively, in 1991.  Comparisons with 1991
                     results were distorted by special charges related to
                     Wachovia's merger with South Carolina National
                     Corporation.  During the fourth quarter of 1991, South
                     Carolina National took $138.5 million of special charges,
                     including $97.8 million to conform litigation, real estate
                     and loan valuation policies and practices; $23.9 million
                     to write down the book value of intangible assets; and 
                     $16.8 million of merger related expenses, including 
                     consolidation expenses, software write-offs, insurance
                     expense, debt issuance cost, employment contracts and 
                     transaction costs (such as legal, investment bankers and 
                     trustee fees) necessary to effect the acquisition. 
                          Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 5.6 
                     percent, the result of improved rate spreads. The net 
                     yield on interest-earning assets rose 29 basis points. 
                          Taxable equivalent interest income declined 15.8
                     percent,  reflecting a 144 basis point drop in the average 
                     rate earned and a slight decrease in average 
                     interest-earning assets.  Loans were down 2.7 percent 
                     with gains in retail loans offset by lower overall 
                     commercial borrowings.  Credit card loans and other 
                     revolving credit led


                                      33

          the growth in consumer loans, rising 13.8 percent and 7.8
          percent, respectively, while commercial mortgages increased 5.2
          percent. Investment securities were higher by 7.2 percent.
                Interest expense decreased 34.1 percent, primarily the result
          of a 192 basis point decline in the average rate paid. Average
          interest-bearing liabilities were lower by 3.7 percent, also
          contributing to the expense decrease. Total interest-bearing deposits
          declined less than 1 percent with savings certificates and large
          denomination certificates down a combined 11.8 percent, while
          interest-bearing demand and savings and money-market savings rose a
          combined 13 percent. Short-term borrowed funds decreased 18.4 percent
          and long-term debt grew by $271 million due to the introduction of
          the medium-term bank note program by Wachovia Bank of North Carolina
          in the second quarter of 1992.
                Nonperforming assets at year-end 1992 dropped 14.6 percent from
          a year earlier to $265.409 million or 1.25 percent of loans and
          foreclosed property. Net loan losses were lower by 53.1 percent and
          totaled $95.245 million or .48 percent of loans compared with
          $202.999 million or .99 percent of loans in 1991.  The provision for
          loan losses declined 59.2 percent to $119.420 million and exceeded
          net charge-offs by $24.175 million. The allowance for loan losses at
          December 31, 1992 totaled $379.557 million or 1.80 percent of loans
          and 218 percent coverage of nonperforming loans versus $360.193
          million or 1.75 percent of loans and 149 percent coverage a year
          earlier.
                Higher levels of provision and charge-offs in 1991 relative to
          1992 were related primarily to adjustments made at the time of
          Wachovia Corporation's merger with South Carolina National to ensure
          that South Carolina National's loan and real estate valuation
          policies and practices were applied consistently on a mutually
          satisfactory basis with those of Wachovia. In addition, recession and
          general softness in commercial real estate markets during 1991
          resulted in increased charge-offs and provision to rebuild the loan
          loss reserve to a level considered adequate. Moderate economic
          recovery, while less robust than in previous business cycles, gave
          some relief to troubled borrowers in 1992 and losses declined.
                Other operating revenue grew 9.2 percent. Credit card fee
          income rose 24.3 percent, led by growth in new accounts and higher
          business volume. Deposit account service revenues were up 11 percent.
          Mortgage fee income increased 40.1 percent, prompted by heavier
          refinancing as interest rates declined. Trading account activities
          resulted in a net loss of $11.542 million related to mortgage-backed
          securities hedging compared with income of $11.541 million in 1991.
                Noninterest expense for the year decreased less than 1 percent
          from 1991. Total personnel expense increased 2.9 percent, primarily
          reflecting higher health care benefits. Combined net occupancy and
          equipment expense rose 3.6 percent, while other remaining
          categories of noninterest expense were down 5.7 percent. The
          corporation's overhead ratio measuring noninterest expense to taxable
          equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, excluding
          securities and subsidiary sales, dropped to 58.6 percent from 62.5
          percent in 1991.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY
FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

      The management of Wachovia Corporation is responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements, related financial data and
other information in this annual report. The financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and include amounts based on management's estimates and judgment
where appropriate. Financial information appearing throughout this
annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

      In meeting its responsibility both for the integrity and
fairness of these statements and information, management depends on
the accounting system and related internal control structures that
are designed to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
authorized and recorded in accordance with established procedures and
that assets are safeguarded and proper and reliable records are
maintained.

      The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that the cost of an internal control structure should not exceed the
related benefits. As an integral part of the internal control
structure, the corporation maintains a professional staff of internal
auditors who monitor compliance with and assess the effectiveness of
the internal control structure and coordinate audit coverage with the
independent auditors.

      The Audit Committee of Wachovia's Board of Directors, composed
solely of outside directors, meets regularly with the corporation's
management, internal auditors, independent auditors and regulatory
examiners to review matters relating to financial reporting, internal
control structure and the nature, extent and results of the audit
effort. The independent auditors, internal auditors and banking
regulators have direct access to the Audit Committee with or without
management present.

      The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young,
independent auditors, who render an independent professional opinion
on management's financial statements. Their appointment was
recommended by the Audit Committee, approved by the Board of
Directors and ratified by the shareholders. Their examination
provides an objective assessment of the degree to which the
corporation's management meets its responsibility for financial
reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements is based on
auditing procedures which include reviewing internal control
structures and performing selected tests of transactions and records
as they deem appropriate. These auditing procedures are designed to
provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial statements
are fairly presented in all material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
Wachovia Corporation

      We have audited the consolidated statements of condition of
Wachovia Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We did not audit the 1991 financial statements
of South Carolina National Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary,
which statements reflect net interest income constituting 23% of
consolidated net interest income in 1991. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and
our opinion, as it relates to data included for South Carolina
National Corporation, is based solely on the report of the other
auditors.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 1991, the report
of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Wachovia Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

      As discussed in Notes K and M to the financial statements, in
1993 the company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes
and postretirement benefits.

WACHOVIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Wachovia Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Corporation) follow generally accepted accounting principles
and policies within the financial services industry. The following is a summary
of the more significant policies:

Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Wachovia Corporation and its subsidiaries after
elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions.

Cash and Due from Banks -- The Corporation considers cash and due from
banks, all of which are maintained in financial institutions, as cash and
cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Investment Securities -- Investment securities are acquired with the
intent and ability to hold on a long-term basis and are carried at cost
adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, each computed
by the interest method. The adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used
to compute gains or losses on the sale of investment securities. Investment
securities are concentrated in a variety of state and municipal, U.S. Treasury
and federal agency securities.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation prospectively adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115), which requires that
securities be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading
securities. Further discussion of FASB 115 is included in Note D.

Trading Account Assets -- Trading account assets are held with the
intent of selling them at a profit and are carried at market. Adjustments to
market value are included in "trading account profits" in the consolidated
statement of income. Trading account assets are comprised primarily of
securities backed by the U.S. Treasury and various federal agencies.

Financial Instruments -- Financial instruments are defined as cash,
evidence of ownership in an entity, contracts that convey either a right to
receive cash or other financial instruments or an obligation to deliver cash or
other financial instruments, or contracts that convey the right or obligation
to exchange financial instruments on potentially favorable or unfavorable
terms. The Corporation has a variety of financial instruments which include
items recorded on the statement of condition and items which, by their nature,
are not recorded on the statement of condition. The body of the financial
statements, as well as the accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, include discussion of specific
financial instruments and their related market and credit risks, as well as
applicable discussion of significant credit concentrations and collateral
policies. Financial instruments not specifically discussed elsewhere include
Interest-bearing bank balances, Federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and Other borrowed funds. These financial instruments
carry no risk of accounting loss in excess of the recorded asset or liability
amounts, and no significant credit concentrations exist outside of
Interest-bearing bank balances, Federal funds sold and Federal funds purchased,
which are maintained with other financial institutions.

Interest Rate Futures and Swaps -- Interest rate futures and swaps are
used as part of the Corporation's overall interest rate risk management. Gains
and losses on futures contracts used in securities trading operations are
recognized currently by the mark-to-market method of accounting and included in
"other operating income" in the consolidated statement of income. The
Corporation maintains a portfolio of generally matched offsetting swap
agreements as an intermediary for customers; payments made or received under
these interest rate swaps are recognized as received and included in "other
operating income" in the consolidated statement of income. Income or expense
associated with open futures and interest rate swap contracts used in
asset/liability management is accrued over the life of the contracts and
included in "net interest income" in the consolidated statement of income.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses -- Loans are carried at their
principal amount outstanding, except for loans held for resale which are
carried at the lower of cost or market. Interest on commercial, mortgage and
installment loans is accrued and credited to operating income based upon the
principal amount outstanding. Except for revolving credit loans, the
recognition of interest income is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past
due as to principal and interest or when, in management's judgment, the
interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. When
interest accruals are discontinued, the balance of accrued interest is
reversed. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the
estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the
principal balance and accrued interest. The banking subsidiaries accrue
interest on revolving credit loans until payments become 120 days delinquent,
at which time the outstanding principal balance and accrued unpaid interest is
charged off.

The allowance is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by
management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. Management's
determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the
portfolio, past loan loss experience, current domestic and international
economic conditions, volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and
other risks inherent in the portfolio.

Premises and Equipment -- Premises, equipment and leasehold improvements 
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
For financial reporting purposes, the provision for depreciation is computed by
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the life of the leasehold asset or the lease term.

Intangible Assets -- Premiums paid to purchase servicing rights of
mortgage loans are amortized over the aggregate estimated remaining servicing
life of the loans. The excess of cost over net assets and identifiable
intangible assets, including deposit base intangibles, of acquired businesses
is amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated periods benefited.

NOTE A -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Concluded

Pension Plan -- The Corporation maintains a pension plan which covers
substantially all employees. The pension expense of the plan is determined
using the projected unit credit method. The Corporation's policy is to fund
amounts allowable for federal income tax purposes.

Income Taxes -- Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation
prospectively adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB 109), which requires an asset and
liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Under FASB 109, deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. Financial statements for prior years
reflect income taxes recorded under the deferred method required under previous
accounting standards.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return.
Each subsidiary provides for income taxes based on its contribution to income
taxes (benefit) of the consolidated group.

Reclassifications -- Medium-term bank notes previously classified as
short-term borrowed funds have been reclassified to long-term debt to more
accurately reflect the weighted average maturity of these instruments.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE B -- MERGER

On December 6, 1991, South Carolina National Corporation (SCNC), a
South Carolina bank and savings and loan holding company, was merged into and
became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation. Pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the Agreement), which was approved by the shareholders of
both the Corporation and SCNC on October 25, 1991, approximately 15,954,662
shares of the Corporation's common stock were authorized for issuance under the
Agreement. These shares do not reflect the two-for-one common stock split
effective April 1, 1993. At the effective time of the merger, and in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement, the shareholders of SCNC common stock received
.675 of a share of the Corporation's common stock for each share of SCNC common
stock owned.

The consolidated financial statements of the Corporation give effect to
the merger which has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Accordingly, the accounts of SCNC have been combined with those of the
Corporation for all periods presented.

Separate results of operations of the combining entities for the year
ended December 31, 1991 were as follows:

The net income presented above for SCNC includes adjustments of $97.8
million to conform litigation, real estate and loan valuation policies and

assets.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE C -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" (FASB 107), requires disclosure of fair
value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the
balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases
where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques
are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount
rates and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair
value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets
and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
Also, the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 1993 and 1992. Such
amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial
statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value
may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Trading Account Assets -- Fair values for the Corporation's trading
account assets, which also are the amounts recognized in the statement of
condition, are based on quoted market prices.

Investment Securities -- Fair values for investment securities are
based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair
value is estimated using market prices for similar securities.

NOTE C -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- Concluded

Loans -- For credit card, equity lines and other loans with short-term
or variable rate characteristics, the carrying value reduced by an estimate of
credit losses inherent in the portfolio is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The fair values of residential mortgage loans are estimated using quoted market
prices for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences between
the market for the securities and the loans being valued and an estimate of
credit losses in the portfolio. The fair value of all other loans is estimated
by discounting their future cash flows using interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms, reduced by an estimate of credit losses
inherent in the portfolio. The discount rates used are commensurate with the
interest rate and prepayment risks involved for the various types of loans.

Deposits -- The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g.,
interest- and noninterest-bearing demand, savings and money market savings)
are, as required by FASB 107, equal to the amounts payable on demand at the
reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for certificates of
deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies
interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of
aggregated monthly maturities.

Long-Term Debt -- Fair values of long-term debt are based on market
prices where available. When quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the
Corporation's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments -- Fair values for the Corporation's
off-balance sheet instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into
similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements
and the counterparties' credit standing (loan commitments and letters of
credit), and the estimated amount the Corporation would receive or pay to
terminate or replace the contract at current market rates for the remainder of
the off-balance sheet instruments.

Many of the Corporation's assets and liabilities are short-term
financial instruments whose carrying amounts reported in the statement of
condition approximate fair value. These items include cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing bank balances, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, due from customers on acceptances, short-term borrowed
funds, acceptances outstanding, and the financial instruments included in other
assets and liabilities. The estimated fair values of the Corporation's
remaining on-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31 are
summarized below.

FASB 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. The disclosures also do not
include certain intangible assets, such as customer relationships, mortgage
servicing rights, deposit base intangibles and goodwill. Accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of
the Corporation.

The financial information presented over periods of years which
encompass various economic and interest rate conditions and cycles provides a
means of evaluating the effectiveness of the Corporation in dealing with
changing market conditions and in managing the controllable aspects of its
business.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, investment securities with a carrying
value of $3,543,263 and $3,021,363, respectively, were pledged as collateral to
secure public deposits and for other purposes.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115), which is effective January 1, 1994 with
early adoption permitted. FASB 115 requires that investments in equity
securities having readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt
securities be classified and accounted for in three categories.

Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity are to be classified as securities held to maturity. Held to
maturity securities are reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities
that are held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are
to be classified as trading securities. Trading securities are reported at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt and equity
securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading are to be
classified as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of
shareholders' equity, net of tax.

Upon adoption of FASB 115 as of January 1, 1994, the Corporation will
classify securities with an amortized cost of $3,713,450 as available for sale
at their fair value of $3,753,650. The excess of the fair value over the
amortized cost, net of tax, equal to $24,368 will be recorded as an increase to
shareholders' equity. The adoption of FASB 115 will not have a material impact
on the Corporation's results of operations, but increased volatility of
shareholders' equity and related capital ratios could result from changes in
unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale.

</TABLE> 

Loans totaling $42,256, $81,592 and $104,626 were transferred
to foreclosed real estate during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

It is the policy of the Corporation to review each prospective
credit in order to determine an adequate level of security or 
collateral to obtain prior to making the loan. The type of collateral will
vary and ranges from liquid assets to real estate. The Corporation's
access to collateral, in the event of borrower default, is assured
through adherence to state lending laws and the Corporation's
sound lending standards and credit monitoring procedures. The
Corporation regularly monitors its credit concentrations on loan
purpose, industry and customer bases. At year-end, there were
no significant credit concentrations within these categories.
For additional discussion related to off-balance sheet credit
issues, refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note J.

The Corporation's subsidiaries have granted loans and extended
letters of credit to certain directors and executive officers of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries and to their associates. The 
aggregate amount of loans was $219,623 and $251,274 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1993, $547,817 in new
loans was made, and repayments totaled $579,468. Outstanding
standby letters of credit to related parties totaled $28,183 and
$9,426 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Related
party loans are made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with unrelated persons and do not
involve more than the normal risk of collectibility.

Loans held for sale at December 31 along with activity during the
period are summarized as follows:

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (FASB 114), which is
effective January 1, 1995, with early adoption permitted. This
standard modifies the accounting for impaired loans, defined as
those loans where, based on current information and events, it
is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractural terms of the loan agreement.
The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the timing of
adoption and the effect that implementation of FASB 114 will
have on its financial statements, but does not expect it to have a
material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The net rental expense for all operating leases amounted to
$47,579 in 1993, $48,254 in 1992 and $43,626 in 1991. Certain
leases have various renewal options and require increased rentals
under cost of living escalation clauses.

In June 1993, The South Carolina National Bank purchased certain
branch and administration buildings which it had previously
leased under a sale-leaseback arrangement for $54,425. The
property was recorded at $43,540, which represents the purchase
price net of a portion of the gain on the original sale-leaseback
arrangement that had not been recognized.

NOTE G -- CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, lines of credit arrangements
aggregating $160,000 and $130,000, respectively, were available
to the Corporation from unaffiliated banks. Commitment fees
were 15 basis points in 1993 and ranged from 15 basis points
to 20 basis points in 1992; compensating balances are not
required. The unused portion of these banking arrangements
principally serves as commercial paper back-up lines. There
were no borrowings outstanding under credit arrangements at
December 31, 1993 or 1992.

NOTE H -- LONG-TERM DEBT -- Concluded


(a) During 1992, Wachovia Bank of North Carolina established a medium-term bank
    note program under which the bank may offer an aggregate principal amount 
    of up to $4 billion outstanding at any one time. The notes can be issued 
    as fixed or floating rate notes and with terms of 9 months to 10 years. The
    interest rates ranged from 3.30% to 6.10% and 3.20% to 6.00% with 
    maturities ranging from 1994 to 1998 and 1993 to 1995 at December 31, 1993 
    and 1992, respectively. The average rates were 4.54% and 4.59% with average
    maturities of 1.8 years and 1.8 years at December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
    respectively.  
(b) Debt qualifies for inclusion in the determination of total capital under 
    the Risk-Based Capital guidelines.  
(c) The debentures are redeemable under certain conditions and are convertible 
    into common stock of the Corporation at a conversion price of $19.29 per 
    share.  At December 31, 1993, $22,460 of these notes had been converted.  
(d) The notes were called in December 1992, with a payment date in March 1993. 
(e) The notes were convertible into common stock of the Corporation at a  
    conversion price of $5.5555 per share.

The principal maturities of long-term debt for the next five years
subsequent to December 31, 1993 are $515,114 in 1994, $1,215,991 in 1995,
$435,437 in 1996, $444 in 1997 and $205,164 in 1998. Interest paid on deposits
and other borrowings was $882,128 in 1993, $1,022,288 in 1992 and $1,472,254 in
1991.

In January 1994, the Corporation issued $250,000 of 6.375% subordinated notes
due in 2009.

NOTE I -- CAPITAL STOCK

On April 1, 1993, a two-for-one common stock split, effected in the form
of a stock dividend, was paid to the Corporation's shareholders. Unless
otherwise noted, information in this note, as well as share and per share
information presented throughout the financial statements, has been restated to
reflect the effect of the stock split.

The authorized capital stock of the Corporation consists of 500,000,000
common shares and 50,000,000 preferred shares. At December 31, 1993, 21,034,848
common shares were reserved for the conversion of notes and for stock issuable
in connection with employee benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan.

The Corporation's board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up
to 5,000,000 shares of common stock for various corporate purposes including the
issuance of shares for the Corporation's employee benefit plans and dividend
reinvestment plan. Share repurchase began on July 1, 1993. During the year, the
Corporation repurchased 2,730,200 shares pursuant to this authorization. At
December 31, 1993, the number of shares available for possible repurchase
totaled 2,269,800.

The various stock option and incentive plans of the Corporation provide
for the granting of options or awards for the purchase or issuance of 5,260,192
shares at 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant. A
committee of the board of directors determines the number of shares subject to
each option and the time or times when options shall be granted and exercised
and the duration of the exercise period, which in no case shall exceed ten
years. The committee also determines the number of awards to be granted and the
time or times when awards shall be granted and the period when awards are deemed
to be earned. Awards are exercised at no cost to the participant. Under one
plan, the non-management directors of the Corporation are granted a one-time
award of common stock to be earned over a period of three years.

At the time the options are exercised, the par value of all shares
issued is credited to common stock and the excess of the proceeds over the par
value is credited to capital surplus. At the time awards are granted, capital
surplus is credited and retained earnings debited for the fair market value of
the awards. When the stock awarded is issued, common stock is credited and
capital surplus is debited for the par value of the shares issued. Recipients of
awards are entitled to compensation equivalent to the dividends that would have
been payable on the proportion of the awards reserved but not yet fully earned
based on the years of service since the date of grant divided by the number of
years over which the award is deemed to be fully earned. Compensation equivalent
to dividends totaled $54 in 1993, $86 in 1992 and $63 in 1991. At December 31,
1993 and 1992, deferred compensation related to director and management awards
was $2,614 and $2,246, respectively. Compensation expense related to stock
awards was $1,864 for 1993, $4,050 for 1992 and $1,758 for 1991.

Activity in the option and award plans during 1993 and 1992 is summarized as

NOTE J -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Corporation is party to financial instruments with off-balance
sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
customers and to manage its own exposure to fluctuation in interest rates.
These financial instruments include unfunded commitments to extend credit,
standby, commercial and similar letters of credit, commitments to sell
securities, foreign exchange contracts, futures and forward contracts, interest
rate contracts, participations in bankers' acceptances and mortgage loans sold
with recourse. These instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure to
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
statement of financial condition. The contract or notional amount represents
the extent of the Corporation's involvement in any particular class of
instrument. The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for unfunded
commitments to extend credit and commercial, standby, and other letters of
credit, securities lent, participations in bankers' acceptances and mortgage
loans sold with recourse is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments. The Corporation follows the same credit policies and careful
underwriting practices in making commitments and conditional obligations as it
does for on-balance sheet instruments. For interest rate contracts, commitments
to purchase and sell securities, and futures and forward contracts, the
contract or notional amounts do not represent exposure to credit loss. The
Corporation controls the credit risk of these instruments through adherence to
credit approval policies, monetary limits and monitoring procedures.

Unless otherwise noted, the Corporation does not require collateral or
other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. In those
instances where collateral is deemed necessary, the Corporation ensures its
ability to access the collateral, in the event of borrower default, through
strict adherence to corporate lending policy and applicable state lending laws.

Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk at
December 31 are shown below.

Specific discussion of these instruments, along with the attendant
risks, credit concentrations and collateral policies, is as follows:

Commitments to Extend Credit -- These are legally binding contracts to
lend to a customer, so long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. These commitments have fixed termination dates and
generally require payment of a fee. As most commitments expire prior to being
drawn, the amounts shown do not necessarily represent the future cash
requirements of the contracts. Credit worthiness is evaluated on a case by case
basis, and in some instances, collateral is obtained to support the borrowing.
The collateral held may vary from liquid assets to real estate. At December 31,
1993 and 1992, approximately 15% and 17%, respectively, of unfunded commitments
to extend credit were supported by collateral. Of the total unfunded commitment
amounts presented, approximately 29% in 1993 and 30% in 1992 were comprised of
cancellable credit card commitments, and approximately 9% in 1993 and 8% in
1992 were represented by real estate commitments. Also included in total
unfunded commitments were securities underwriting commitments of $2,766 in 1993
and $3,510 in 1992.

Standby, Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit -- These instruments
are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation guaranteeing the
performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are issued
primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
in extending credit to customers and is subject to the Corporation's normal
sound underwriting process. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, approximately 6% and
8%, respectively, of these instruments were supported by collateral. There were
no significant concentrations of letters of credit to any one group of
borrowers at either year-end.

Securities Lent -- These are securities of the Corporation and its
customers lent to third parties. Credit risk arises in these transactions
through the possible failure of the borrower to return the securities. To
minimize this risk, the Corporation evaluates the credit worthiness of the
borrower on a case by case basis, and collateral with a market value exceeding
100% of the contract amount of securities lent is obtained.

Participations in Bankers' Acceptances -- These instruments represent
risk participations in time drafts drawn by customers under a committed
multibank credit facility. These drafts have been accepted and remarketed by
other financial institutions. Under the terms of these arrangements, the
Corporation may be required to reimburse the accepting financial institution
for the Corporation's pro rata share of any payment default by the customer.
The Corporation applies the same underwriting standards in evaluating the
credit risk associated with these instruments as it does in evaluating
on-balance sheet instruments.

Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse -- The Corporation is obligated under
recourse provisions related to the sale of residential mortgages to the Federal
National Mortgage Association. These mortgages are collateralized by 1-4 family
residential homes.

NOTE J -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT 
          LIABILITIES -- Concluded

All mortgage loans with original loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80% (up
to a maximum of 95%) have private mortgage insurance coverage.

Interest Rate Swaps -- These transactions generally involve the
exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal amounts. The majority of the interest rate swaps
entered into by the Corporation arise when the Corporation acts as an
intermediary in arranging these swaps on behalf of its customers, although some
swaps are entered into as part of the Corporation's asset/liability management.
The Corporation typically acts as a principal in the exchange of interest
payments between parties and, therefore, is exposed to loss should one of the
parties default. The Corporation performs normal credit reviews on its swap
customers and minimizes its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in
intermediated swaps by entering into offsetting swap positions that essentially
counterbalance each other or by using other hedging techniques to manage
risk.

Entering into interest rate swap agreements involves not only credit
risk but also the interest rate risk associated with unmatched positions.
Notional principal amounts are often used to express the volume of these
transactions but do not represent the much smaller amounts potentially subject
to credit risk. These amounts are derived by estimating the cost, on a present
value basis, of replacing at current market rates all those outstanding
agreements for which the Corporation would incur a loss in replacing the
contract. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the amount of risk totaled $19,203 and
$14,699, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, the notional amount of interest rate swaps where
the Corporation acts as an intermediary totaled $1,790,589. The notional amount
of interest rate swaps used in asset/liability management was $842,500 at
December 31, 1993. Of the $2,633,089 total notional amount, the notional amount
of fixed payment agreements totaled $1,331,199 and had a weighted average
remaining term of 2.59 years at December 31, 1993. The Corporation was paying
interest under these agreements at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.46% and
was receiving interest at a weighted average variable rate of 3.52% at December
31, 1993. The notional amount of variable rate payment agreements totaled
$1,301,890 and had a weighted average remaining term of 2.92 years at December
31, 1993. The Corporation was paying interest under these agreements at a
weighted average variable rate of 3.56% and was receiving interest at a
weighted average fixed rate of 5.51% at December 31, 1993.

Interest Rate Caps and Floors -- These instruments are written by the
Corporation to enable its customers to transfer, modify, or reduce their
interest rate exposure. Credit risk and interest rate risk are managed through
the oversight procedures applied to other interest rate contracts, as well as
through the purchase of offsetting cap and floor positions. The present value
of caps and floors in a profitable position, which represents the credit risk
of these instruments, totaled $4,672 at December 31, 1993 and $1,527 at
December 31, 1992. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had purchased $169,499
in interest rate caps and floors as offsetting positions to written caps and
floors. The comparable figure for December 31, 1992 was $184,345. The
Corporation also had interest rate caps purchased as part of the Corporation's
asset/liability management of $415,000 at December 31, 1993 and $15,000 at
December 31, 1992.

Commitments to Purchase and Sell Securities, Futures and Forward
Contracts -- These instruments are contracts for delayed delivery of securities
or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a
specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.
Risks arise in these transactions through the possible inability of one of the
counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from movements in
interest rates or securities values. Risks associated with these instruments
are controlled through offsetting purchase and sell positions, as well as
oversight provided by organized exchanges, which determine who may buy and sell
such instruments. The present value of futures contracts in a profitable
position totaled $18,026 at December 31, 1993 and $6,053 at December 31, 1992.

Net Options Written to Purchase or Sell Securities -- These options
give the holder the right to require the Corporation to buy or sell securities
at a specified price at some future date within the option period. Interest
rate fluctuations constitute the risk associated with these instruments. This
risk may be mitigated through the establishment of offsetting purchase
positions.

Commitments to Purchase and Sell Foreign Exchange -- As with
commitments to sell securities, these future type agreements represent
contractual obligations to purchase and sell foreign exchange at some future
date for some future price. The potential risks associated with these
obligations arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as the
potential inability of the counterparty to perform under the contract. These
risks are mitigated through the establishment of offsetting sell positions, as
well as standard limit and monitoring procedures. Foreign exchange contracts in
a profitable position amounted to $12,656 at December 31, 1993 and $18,492 at
December 31, 1992.

Foreign Exchange Options -- These agreements represent rights to
purchase or sell foreign currency at a predetermined price at a future date.
Fluctuations in foreign currency markets, as well as the potential default of
the counterparty to an option contract, represent the risks associated with
these instruments. Limit and monitoring procedures, along with offsetting
positions, serve to control the risk associated with these items. Foreign
exchange options purchased, which serve to offset written options, amounted to
$12,000 and $12,542 for December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The subsidiaries of the Corporation are defendants in certain legal
proceedings arising in connection with their business. In the opinion of
management and general counsel, the ultimate resolution of those proceedings
will result in no material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial
position and results of operations.

NOTE K -- INCOME TAXES

As of January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB
109), which requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for income
taxes. As permitted under FASB 109, prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.

The cumulative impact of adopting FASB 109 is a tax benefit of $2,700
or $.02 per fully diluted share, which is reflected in income tax expense for
the year ended December 31, 1993. The effect of this change on operating
results for 1993, excluding the cumulative effect of changing methods, is not
material.

The provision for income taxes is summarized below. Included in these
amounts are income taxes related to securities transactions of $7,472, $470 and
$3,997 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The Corporation made income tax
payments totaling $217,716 in 1993, $151,948 in 1992 and $112,386 in 1991.

The deferred tax provision for 1993 includes a benefit of $2,683 related to the 
revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset for the increase in the 
federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993.

The reasons for the difference between consolidated income tax expense

NOTE L -- CASH, DIVIDEND AND LOAN RESTRICTIONS

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries
enter into agreements, or are subject to regulatory requirements, that result
in cash, debt and dividend restrictions. A summary of the most restrictive
items follows.

The Corporation's banking subsidiaries are required to maintain average
reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those
reserve balances for the year ended December 31, 1993 was approximately
$440,055.

Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the banking subsidiaries are
also limited in the amount they may loan to their affiliates, including the
Corporation. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 10% and loans to all
affiliates may not exceed 20% of the bank's capital, surplus and undivided
profits (net assets) after adding back the allowance for loan losses. Based on
these limitations, approximately $324,951 was available for loans to the
Corporation at December 31, 1993.

NOTE L -- CASH, DIVIDEND AND LOAN RESTRICTIONS -- Concluded

The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the
total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar
year exceeds the bank's net profits, as defined, for that year 
combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar
years. Under this formula, the banking subsidiaries can distribute
as dividends to the Corporation in 1994, without the approval
of the Comptroller of the Currency, more than $379,411 plus an
additional amount equal to the banks' retained net profits for 1994
up to the date of any dividend declaration.

As a result of the above dividend and loan restrictions, approximately
$2,146,047 of consolidated net assets of the Corporation's banking
subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 was restricted from transfer to
the Corporation in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

The Corporation also provides supplemental benefits through
defined contribution plans designed to encourage participants
to save on a regular basis and to provide such participants with
deferred compensation and additional performance incentive.
Total expense relating to these plans, which represented the
Corporation's matching and discretionary contributions, was
$22,767 in 1993, $11,043 in 1992 and $7,248 in 1991. Employee
participants may elect to contribute from 1% to 10% of base salary,
with the Corporation matching 50% of each participant's 
contribution up to a maximum employer contribution of 3% of base
salary. The plans provide for additional contributions of up to
3% of salary in accordance with a preestablished formula based

on certain earnings performance criteria and also for special
discretionary employer contributions of up to 4% of each eligible
employee's base salary as approved annually by the board of
directors.

During 1992, the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) of
SCNC repaid its outstanding indebtedness of $25,000 with
proceeds received from the sale of Wachovia common stock
held by the ESOP. Company contributions to the ESOP have
been discontinued, and all remaining shares of Wachovia
common stock have been allocated to the ESOP participants.
Dividends paid on shares held by the ESOP totaled $443 in
1992 and $1,026 in 1991. Interest expense on ESOP debt amounted
to $625 in 1992 and $2,259 in 1991. Company contributions
and ESOP related expenses in 1991 totaled $1,497 and $2,535,
respectively.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide certain health
care benefits for retired employees. Substantially all of the
employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
normal retirement age while working for the Corporation or its
subsidiaries. The benefits are provided through self-insured
plans administered by insurance companies whose premiums
are based on the claims paid during the year.

On January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
(FASB 106), which requires the accrual of nonpension benefits
as employees render service. Adoption of FASB 106 increased
postretirement benefits expense in 1993 by $5,210 and, on an
after-tax basis, reduced net income by $3,235 or $.02 per fully
diluted share. In years prior to 1993, the Corporation recognized
the cost of providing these retirement benefits by expensing the
annual premiums or claims, which were $3,005 in 1992 and
$2,271 in 1991.

The liability for postretirement benefits is unfunded. The following
table presents the status of the plan as of December 31, 1993.

</TABLE>

The annual assumed rate of increase in health care costs for the
plan is 14% for 1994 compared with 16% for 1993, and is assumed
to decrease gradually to 7% in 2007 and remain at that level there-
after. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by one percentage point would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the plan as of
December 31, 1993 by $3,637 and the aggregate of the service
and interest cost of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 1993 by $291. The discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%.

* The allocation of the allowance for loan losses above represents an estimate
  based on historical loss experience, individual credits, economic conditions
  and other judgmental factors. Since any allocation is judgmental and involves
  consideration of many factors, the allocation may be more or less than the
  charge-offs that may ultimately occur. The entire allowance is available for
  charge-offs in any category of loans.

          under an agreement providing for a tax-free exchange of .675 of
          a share of Wachovia Corporation common stock for each share of South
          Carolina National. As a result of merger and special charges taken in
          the fourth quarter of 1991, the corporation's net income per primary
          share for the year 1991 was $1.34 compared with $2.05 in 1990 and
          $2.51 in 1992.
                The Five-Year Total Return chart compares Wachovia, the S&P 500
          and the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) 50 Index in stock price
          appreciation and dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment, from the
          base period December 31, 1988 through year-end 1993. The KBW Index is
          a market capitalization weighted measure of total return for 50 money
          center and major regional banks. Wachovia's total return is based on
          stock prices and dividends per share of Wachovia Corporation prior to
          its merger with South Carolina National.

                       Report of Independent Accountants
                       ---------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Shareholder
of South Carolina National Corporation



In our opinion, the consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of
changes in shareholder's equity of South Carolina National Corporation and
Subsidiaries (not separately presented herein - a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Wachovia Corporation) present fairly, in all material respects, the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1991, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.  We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2, as a result of the merger with Wachovia
Corporation, the Corporation changed its loan, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices so as to be applied consistently with those of
Wachovia Corporation.
