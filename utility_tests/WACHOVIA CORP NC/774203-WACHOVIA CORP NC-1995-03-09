LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS


Dear Wachovia Shareholder:

Wachovia produced excellent earnings during 1994, performing well in a highly
complex, competitive business environment. At the same time, the corporation
continued to assess its corporate strategies, implement organizational changes
and make investments designed to enhance our capabilities for the future.

Net income per fully diluted share was $3.12 in 1994, higher by 10.9 percent
from $2.81 in 1993. Net income for the year totaled $539.1 million, an increase
of 9.5 percent from $492.1 million, with gains primarily reflecting strong loan
growth, continued good expense control and reduced credit costs. Earnings also
were enhanced by a modest increase in other operating revenues. Returns were
17.4 percent on shareholders' equity and 1.46 percent on assets comparing
favorably with five-year averages of 15.2 percent and 1.23 percent,
respectively.

Although Wachovia's stock market price in relation to its earnings and book
value continues to represent a premium compared with peer banks, the good
earnings gains achieved in 1994 did not translate into stock price appreciation
for the year. Wachovia's total return for 1994, including dividend
reinvestment, was a negative .05 percent versus a negative 5.10 percent for the
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Index of 50 money center and regional banks. The S&P 500
Index had a positive total return of 1.32 percent for the year.

Measured against the nation's other major bank holding companies, Wachovia's
operating results for 1994 and financial condition at year-end remained
excellent. While it ranked 23rd in asset size, the corporation's return on
common shareholders' equity was eighth and its return on assets was third among
the 25 largest U.S. banking companies. Wachovia's strong returns were achieved
without sacrificing credit quality which remained stellar. Non-performing
assets at December 31, 1994 represented .39 percent of loans and foreclosed
property, the best ratio of problem assets among the nation's major banking
companies, with reserve coverage of nonperforming loans fifth best at 516
percent. Expense management was commendable with an overhead cost ratio of 54.1
percent for the year, best among the nation's 25 largest banking companies.
Capital remained healthy with common equity at 8.39 percent of assets, third
strongest at year-end.

Although its financial performance and industry rankings are gratifying,
Wachovia recognizes that considerable change faces the financial services
business in the years to come. The economy is likely to grow more slowly. The
field of financial services providers will continue to be intensely
competitive. Customer needs and expectations will evolve at a quicker pace as
technology extends the capabilities and boundaries of communication.

Throughout its 115-year history, Wachovia has produced long-term profitable
growth, while adapting to change and maintaining its core philosophy of
operating in a sound and prudent manner. Examples of this include the expansion
across North Carolina through a series of mergers and branchings earlier in our
history; becoming the first bank in the Southeast in 1959 to install an
electronic computer; developing a cash management consulting expertise in the
late 1960s strengthening Wachovia's ability to build a national corporate
banking presence; implementation of a personal banker program to strengthen
retail banking relationships in the early 1970s; pioneering variable rate home
mortgages and credit cards and two major interstate banking mergers within the
last 10 years. The ability to consistently move forward while producing
superior shareholder returns has enabled the organization to remain one of the
premier banking institutions in the world.

A comprehensive strategic assessment conducted by Wachovia management during
1994 identified ingredients essential for success and growth in shareholder
value in the remainder of the decade. These elements range from the astute
management of business lines to the use of technology to support sales and
service capabilities. A special section beginning on page 6 of this report
provides a broad overview of how Wachovia is positioning itself to remain among
the premier financial service providers. I encourage you to read it and welcome
your observations and suggestions.

Undergirding these initiatives have been major organizational and management
realignments announced during 1994 and early 1995 including the formation of
two major divisions, Corporate Financial Services and General Banking.

General Banking is charged with implementing a single strategic direction for
Wachovia's community banks and more effective coordination of services aimed at
the consumer market. The division encompasses Wachovia's banks in North
Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina along with consumer credit and noncredit
services. The division also incorporates Wachovia's personal trust services and
a growing complement of highly trained investment counselors. It is headed by
G. Joseph Prendergast.

To help accomplish its mission, General Banking now includes Wachovia Consumer
Services, managed by W. Doug King, and composed of credit card, residential

Joe Prendergast is 49 and has been with Wachovia since 1973. Doug King, 56,
began his banking career in 1963 and joined Wachovia through the December 1991
merger of South Carolina National Bank.

Hugh M. Durden is in charge of the Corporate Financial Services. This area
includes Wachovia Corporate Services, which provides all credit and noncredit
corporate banking services. It also embraces Wachovia's corporate trust,
employee benefit and charitable trust services. Combining all corporate related
activities in one division will enhance Wachovia's ability to grow
relationships domestically and abroad and to add new business. Hugh Durden, 52,
joined Wachovia in 1972.

Formation of the General and Corporate banking divisions should further improve
Wachovia's ability to lift the sales efforts and strengthen productivity
throughout our markets. The Administrative Services, Financial Management, Loan
Administration and Technology divisions are the other major functions
supporting the organization systemwide.

The Administrative Services Division includes the corporation's audit,
corporate communications, legal, personnel and security functions. Kenneth W.
McAllister, 46, general counsel, who joined Wachovia in 1988, manages this
area.

The Financial Management Division is responsible for funds management,
financial reporting, investor relations and general services functions in
addition to bond, money market, brokerage and trust investment management
services. Robert S. McCoy, Jr., 56, chief financial officer, manages this area.
He joined South Carolina National in 1984 following ten years as a partner with
the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.

General Loan Administration has overall responsibility for the corporation's
lending policies and credit quality. The division is headed by Mickey W. Dry,
55, chief credit officer, who has been with Wachovia since 1961.

The organization's technology function, including banking, credit and trust
operations, information services, systems development, remittance processing
and telecommunications, is in Wachovia Operational Services. Walter E. Leonard,
Jr., 49, manages this activity. He joined Wachovia in 1965.

The executive vice presidents responsible for these areas are exceptional
banking leaders. They are joined by thousands of professionally capable, highly
motivated and smart working Wachovians committed to providing outstanding
service to customers and dedicated to building shareholder value. Our
organizational structure, which will continue to be modified as necessary, will
enhance Wachovia's ability to be a superior, customer-focused financial
services provider in the exciting environment leading to the next century.

As 1995 gets under way, Wachovia is proud of its past performance and the
industry recognition it has received. However, we are not beguiled by history.
We will not rest on any laurels. The challenges confronting the entire
financial services arena are immensely sobering. At the same time, the people
of Wachovia approach the future with considerable optimism bolstered by
strategic preparation, tactical flexibility, enviable financial strength,
leading technology and strong leadership.

Your continued support and confidence are appreciated.

                                    WACHOVIA
                                  CORPORATION
                                   STRATEGIC
                                     REVIEW


Early in 1994 Wachovia began a strategic assessment process designed to take an
unrestrained look at the corporation in the changing environment for financial
services providers. The assessment reviewed the economic outlook, competitive
landscape and regulatory trends confronting our business. The process focused
on growth in shareholder value and outlined an approach for keeping Wachovia
among the industry's leaders.

In the remainder of the decade the economy should grow modestly at around half
the pace experienced in the 1980s. As the population continues to age, the
proportion of savers and investors to spenders and borrowers will increase.
Both retail and corporate customers are more financially sophisticated and
their expectations are shifting rapidly. They have access to a variety of
service providers and increasingly are willing to embrace technology to satisfy
their financial and information needs.

An expanding assortment of participants is competing intensely to serve this
marketplace of astute individual, institutional and corporate customers. These
include traditionally broad-based financial servicers such as banks, finance
companies and credit unions, but also more specialized players such as mutual
funds, insurance companies, securities firms and communications and software
companies.

Industry consolidation, aided by the passage of interstate banking legislation,
will help shrink overcapacity. This likely will proceed at a measured pace over
the years ahead. The real stimulus to consolidation will come over time as
economic factors affect performance. Other legislative and regulatory actions
will offer new opportunities but also additional restrictions and burdens.

In this challenging environment, there will continue to be leaders in the
financial services industry. The performance of these companies will warrant
and should receive market valuations above those accorded less skilled
competitors. To continue meeting the expectations of its shareholders,
customers and employees, Wachovia must maintain its leadership position and
performance. It must offer exciting services and seek out new markets at home
and abroad. The organization must change the way it communicates with customers
and sell more products and services to them while effectively managing costs.
The key strategic ingredients necessary to accomplish these goals include the
following:

- -  Managing the portfolio of businesses to achieve sound, profitable growth

- -  Using mergers and acquisitions to complement business development strategies

- -  Becoming more effective in selling products and services

- -  Redirecting technology investment to support sales and service capabilities

- -  Assessing and managing the prudent use of capital

This section reviews in more detail these critical components of our strategy.


                         BUSINESS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
A fresh look is being taken at Wachovia's complete mix of interest and
fee-related products and services. While


Wachovia's commitment to accommodate customers when and how they want to be
served is exemplified by Wachovia On-Call. The sales and service center
bankers, available around the clock, seven days a week, can be reached by
calling 1-800-WACHOVIA.

Expediting the mortgage loan application process for customers is a major
benefit of the new Wachovia Mortgage Origination System (WMOS). During 1995,
Wachovia lenders also will use WMOS with laptop computers to work with realtors
in identifying financing alternatives.

we believe that providing deposit and loan services will continue to be a good
business, revenue growth from these sources will be more subdued than in the
past. Our goal is to ensure that appropriate investment of resources is being
made in services and products which will allow the company to reach its
potential for growth and high returns. This process already is identifying
opportunities for new services and alternative delivery channels. Particularly
strong influences on Wachovia's lines of business will come from demographic
shifts and dramatic opportunities arising from the employment of technology.

This analysis of our lines of business has been ongoing. In February 1995,
Wachovia announced it is seeking bids on the sale of its $9 billion residential
mortgage loan servicing portfolio. Wachovia sold its student loan servicing
business and exited the retail lockbox service in 1993. The 1991 merger with
South Carolina National Bank (now Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A.) helped
to launch an expanded debit card program and contained the nucleus for Wachovia
On-Call.SM Wachovia acquired a credit card franchise through its 1985 merger
with First National Bank of Atlanta (Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A.), a
business which had grown to become the 15th largest among bank credit card
issuers nationwide at December 31, 1994. This business appraisal process will
be a prominent part of the corporate strategy and can be modified substantially
based on changing internal or external conditions.


                         CORPORATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY
Targeted acquisitions are likely to have a role in supporting the growth of
strategic businesses and in helping provide access to new customers. Banks
traditionally have focused on acquisition of other commercial banks to expand
geographic reach or deepen consumer deposits or branch banking market share.
While these types of transactions may continue to have appeal, Wachovia is not
obsessed with size nor attracted to transactions which dilute shareholder
value. It believes strategic acquisitions or combinations should enhance
product capabilities, increase the scale of existing businesses, provide access
to a larger base of customers and increase shareholder value over time.


                             MORE EFFECTIVE SELLING
Wachovians have sold well in the past. The corporation's share of market in its
home states has outpaced branch share for some time. Wachovia's national
corporate presence belies the organization's asset size by a wide margin.
However, Wachovia intends to strengthen its ability to sell both through the
core branch network and by exploring new initiatives outside the traditional
branch structure. Here are some specific examples:

- - Wachovia On-Call, a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week central telephone sales
  and service center opened in June 1994. Its first mission is to help
  customers with routine transactions at any hour of the day. The center is
  expected to handle about 3 million calls during 1995. While the majority of
  this contact will be responding to customer inquiries, the center's bankers
  have begun aggressively selling services. We believe Wachovia On-Call will be
  an important source of sales and will give branch personnel additional time
  to sell to customers directly.

- - During 1994, 115 investment counselors, approximately one for every four
  branches, were deployed in the home states of Georgia, North Carolina and
  South Carolina. All counselors are Series 7 registered representatives and
  are able to sell a full range of investment products including the Biltmore
  family of mutual funds. Investment counselors are trained and motivated to
  seek the best investment option for customers. Their compensation is not
  commission driven since the focus is on building relationships. Wachovia
  believes this relatively smaller sales contingent can grow as justified by
  the marketplace, and will enhance the ability to build relationships based on
  careful identification and lasting satisfaction of customer needs. Tellers
  and other retail employees are being

  trained and motivated to assist in identifying prospects for investment
  sales. The Wachovia On-Call center also will supplement this effort.

- - Although Wachovia is selling its residential mortgage loan servicing
  portfolio, the corporation is committed to significantly enhancing its loan
  origination position in a very fragmented mortgage lending business over the
  next several years. A major resource to support this effort was the
  introduction in late 1994 of the Wachovia Mortgage Origination System (WMOS),
  a new, automated mortgage application system designed to support branches
  and mortgage offices. WMOS provides mortgage loan product comparisons,
  significantly reduces application processing time and gives lenders immediate
  cross-sell opportunities. The product also has remote communication
  capabilities for use outside of branches with additional features planned
  over time. This process is being received enthusiastically by our customers.

- - Wachovia was among the leaders in developing a low-rate credit card strategy
  and has been very successful in marketing its Visa(R) and MasterCard(R) Prime
  Plus credit card in and out of home markets. At the end of 1994,
  approximately 1.5 million of our 2.5 million credit card accounts was outside
  the three home states. The credit card is expected to continue to grow, and
  its prospects are being enhanced with the launching of new features, such as
  the February 1995 announcement of the Prime For LifeSM card, the nation's
  first guaranteed prime rate option. At the same time, the organization is
  looking closely for ways to use telemarketing and direct mail capabilities to
  sell other services including car loans, mortgages, banklines and investment
  products to out-of-area customers.

- - Corporate banking also is building its sales capability. Wachovia has been
  ranked among the top 10 banks nationally in corporate market share. A
  national survey ranked the quality of Wachovia's treasury services
  capabilities number one among banks in 1994. However, this area is far from
  complacent with the enormous success of its relationship banking strategy. A
  65-member Sales Team Productivity (STP) task force was in place throughout
  1994 developing recommendations and plans to increase selling effectiveness
  by positioning bankers to bring the best talent to each customer
  relationship. With the shifting of responsibilities under the STP sales
  program, expectations are to double the time available to bankers for
  selling. Wachovia believes the STP initiative will help provide value to
  companies who not only are choosing and using fewer banks but also are
  demanding more from banking partners.


                       REDIRECTING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT
Technology has been one of the proudest strengths of Wachovia. Following
interstate mergers in 1985 and 1991, technology investment focused on
infrastructure improvement designed to create common systems across the three
states and support back office consolidations. This work is largely complete
and results have been excellent. Continuing initiatives in this area are
providing substantial savings.

Today, all of Wachovia's banking operations are on a unified, interactive
branch automation system. A sophisticated general ledger system is common
throughout the corporation. By the end of 1995, 19 credit operations areas in
the three states will be consolidated into one location in Winston-Salem. The
three-state mortgage processing functions were combined in Columbia in January
1995. The automobile sales finance group has consolidated 27 contract-buying
branches in three states into two centers and quadrupled from 12 to over 50 the
average number of loan decisions a credit officer makes each day. Also, a new
automated sales finance application processing system will be installed during
the first quarter of 1995 which will accelerate our response time regarding
credit decisions.

In the future, technology investment will be directed toward growth enhancing
initiatives designed to create value-added

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                                                             11

products, facilitate marketing and sales efforts and provide management with
more comprehensive performance measurement information. Many of these
activities are already in various stages of deployment and use, including an
enhanced trust system, image processing-based products, next generation branch
automation providing interactive personal computer systems to better serve
customers and Wachovia Connection,SM a PC-based gateway to bank information for
corporate treasurers.

Other technology will develop a more sophisticated systems architecture for
Wachovia's banking card, strengthen automated teller machine capabilities,
consolidate customer information data bases and expand Wachovia's brokerage
capability. In the future, organizations lacking a strong commitment to
technology investment will face complications as serious as those brought on by
troublesome loans. Investing in appropriate technology will remain among the
highest priorities at Wachovia.


                           PRUDENT CAPITAL PHILOSOPHY
A cornerstone of Wachovia's philosophy has been the maintenance of a strong
capital position while generating above average returns on shareholders'
equity. At December 31, 1994,

          investment options with a customer at          
          a Wachovia branch office.                      


During 1994, Wachovia deployed throughout its three home states 115 investment
counselors, who are extensively trained Series 7 registered representatives.
Their goal is to help customers select the most appropriate investment vehicle
from a full range of product alternatives. More counselors will be added in
1995.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wachovia's common equity to assets ratio of 8.39 percent ranked third among the
25 largest U.S. banking companies and has averaged 7.92 percent for the past
five years. Wachovia is committed to the maintenance of a strong and impressive
capital position.

As Wachovia moves ahead with its corporate strategies and planned investments,
its internal capital generation rate may exceed the needs of its business
activities. As in the past, Wachovia will manage and deploy capital in a
prudent, competent manner designed to enhance shareholder value over the
long-term.

While pursuing the core objectives of its strategic assessment, Wachovia will
remain focused on preserving its exemplary credit and risk management policies
and expense management practices.


                          COMPREHENSIVE RISK PRACTICES
Wachovia has long been recognized for its credit quality. While there are some
who believe credit issues are now less important, Wachovia's commitment to
being a sound bank is unwavering. But risk management today encompasses
practices which go well beyond sound credit administration. It includes the
operational, service delivery and general market risks associated with all
aspects of our business. For example:

- - Wachovia has been using interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet
  derivative instruments for a number of years. These instruments are used
  principally to help manage interest rate risk and are generally designed to
  neutralize the balance sheet from the adverse impact of external forces.

- - Wachovia is one of the leaders in addressing the growing issue of check
  fraud. Our check fraud task force, with representatives from operations,
  product management, legal and security, is helping bring industry
  associations together to focus on common loss prevention initiatives,
  conducting seminars to educate companies on risks and prevention measures and
  seeking ways to leverage image processing and other technology capabilities
  to combat the problem.

Risk management practices similar to these are in place throughout Wachovia and
should serve the organization well in the future.


                            SUPERIOR COST MANAGEMENT
Wachovia's overhead ratio of 54.1 percent for 1994 ranked the best among the 25
largest U. S. banks. The organization is committed to moving that ratio lower
over time and growing fee income will be vital to this strategy. However,
Wachovia remains dedicated to superior cost management. One major initiative
underway is to ensure procedures and staffing are standard throughout the three
states. The program is based on interviews with over 140 retail line and
support Wachovians who assessed the impact of their day to day activities on
the quality of service delivery. The results of this project will lower
Wachovia's costs and dramatically increase the time available for bankers and
other branch personnel to sell.


                         ATTRACTIVE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS
The organization is fortunate to have extensive branch banking networks in
three of the nation's most vibrant states. By several economic measures, the
Southeast is growing faster than the nation and our three home states are
outpacing the region. Wachovia's markets within each state are expected to
accelerate more quickly than the states as a whole. The combined three-state
population is 17.8 million with 6.6 million total households. We now have
relationships with about 2.1 million of them.

Business growth continues to be strong within the three states. North Carolina,
Georgia and South Carolina are among the top 15 states nationally in the
announcement of new and expanded manufacturing facilities. In these fine
markets, Wachovia covers a broad business spectrum

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                             13
<PAGE>   15

serving over 7,000 corporate clients, in addition to approximately 130,000
small and medium-size businesses within primary markets and contiguous states.
Wachovia intends to have a larger share of this market particularly in smaller
and medium-size business companies.

The corporation has a sizeable book of corporate and consumer business
generated away from home markets. For example, corporate lending outside the
three states represented approximately 36 percent of the total commercial loan
portfolio and about $2.569 billion in credit card loans was not in the primary
markets as of December 31, 1994.

Significant resources are in place within our home markets with approximately
1,300 consumer bankers, investment counselors and personal trust sales
personnel, 500 corporate relationship sales managers including market
specialists for capital markets, trust and treasury services, 493 branches and
652 ATMs . Increased attention also is being directed to finding ways to expand
the customer base outside home markets by employing nontraditional methods
minimizing the need to invest in on-site facilities.


                          STRONG COMMUNITY COMMITMENT
Wachovia also recognizes that its ability to remain a profitable and growing
institution is directly dependent on the economic and social well-being of the
communities it serves. The organization is committed to meeting legitimate
credit needs and providing other appropriate resources. One example of this
dedication is the Wachovia Advantage Affordable Home Loan program with two
recently introduced mortgage loan options offering low-cost home loan packages
with favorable lending terms.

In January 1995, Wachovia introduced in its home markets a low-rate secured
credit card which will help meet the needs of individuals wishing to establish
a credit history, those seeking to repair a damaged credit history and foreign
nationals wanting to establish credit in the United States. The card, with
credit limits from $500 to $5,000, generally will be secured by a deposit in an
interest-bearing Wachovia savings account.

Wachovia is actively involved in efforts to expand small and minority-owned
business lending through formation of a Business Banking Group, introduction of
a special small business loan program and Wachovia's partnership with the
Entrepreneurial Development Loan Fund lending consortium. Wachovia Bank of
North Carolina's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating is "outstanding" and a
"satisfactory" CRA rating has been accorded the Georgia and South Carolina
banks.

Across our three states, the people of Wachovia recognize that good citizenship
is an integral part of regular business activities. Wachovians help neighbors
and communities by participating in hundreds of meaningful programs ranging
from building Habitat for Humanity houses to helping clean up flood-stricken
areas of Georgia last July.


                         UNDERSTAND BUSINESS CHALLENGES
Recent decades have witnessed formidable challenges to the performance of
financial services companies. The remainder of the nineties promises to provide
even greater tests of the industry's management competence, technological
expertise, product delivery skills and ability to acquire and retain good
customers.

At Wachovia we understand the critical challenges affecting our business. The
organization is fortunate to have outstanding people, good markets, top
products, modern technology, exceptional service, a strong balance sheet and a
dependable and growing stream of earnings. These elements should position
Wachovia well to capitalize on opportunity and to cope with adversity in the
times ahead.


Technology is a major factor in Wachovia's ability to be a premier provider of
    financial services. To maintain a position of leadership, Wachovia is
    redirecting its technology investment from infrastructure improvements
       to strengthening its product lines and enhancing its ability to
          deliver services to customers in its home markets, across
                            the nation and abroad.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1994 vs. 1993

Overview

               Overall economic growth remained good in 1994 with the national
          unemployment rate dropping to 6.1 percent. Concerns over the
          continued pace of expansion led to Federal Reserve actions raising
          short-term interest rates six times throughout the year. Wachovia
          Corporation's primary operating states of Georgia, North Carolina and
          South Carolina continued to enjoy generally favorable economic
          conditions in 1994. Based on preliminary data, statewide unemployment
          rates for the year averaged 5.5 percent in Georgia, 4.4 percent in
          North Carolina and 6.1 percent in South Carolina, while
          nonagricultural employment in the three states grew 5 percent, 3.6
          percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.
               Wachovia Corporation's consolidated net income for 1994 totaled
          $539.058 million or $3.12 per fully diluted share compared with
          $492.095 million or $2.81 per fully diluted share in 1993. Increased
          operating results for the year reflected strong loan growth, good
          expense control and reduced credit costs, along with a modest
          contribution from other operating revenue. Net income represented
          returns of 17.4 percent on shareholders' equity and 1.46 percent on
          assets versus 17.1 percent and 1.46 percent, respectively, in 1993.
          The equity and assets used in calculating returns for 1994 include
          unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, on securities
          available-for-sale.
               Expanded discussion of operating results and the corporation's
          financial condition are presented in the following narrative, tables
          and charts. Interest income is stated on a taxable equivalent basis
          which is adjusted for the tax-favored status of earnings from certain
          loans and investments. References to changes in assets and
          liabilities represent daily average levels unless otherwise noted.
          The narrative should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
          Financial Statements and Notes on pages 46 through 63. Expanded
          six-year financial data appears on pages 64 through 71.

Net Interest Income

               Taxable equivalent net interest income, the primary source of
          the corporation's earnings, grew $41.340 million or 3 percent in
          1994. The increase reflected strong gains in interest-earning assets,
          principally loans, as well as a modestly improving average earning
          asset yield. Greater levels of interest-bearing liabilities and a
          higher average cost of funds partially reduced the increase. A
          portion of the increase in the average cost of funds resulted from a
          decision to lengthen the maturity of wholesale funding in order to
          somewhat insulate the corporation's net interest margin from a rising
          rate environment.
               The net yield on interest-earning assets (net interest income as
          a percentage of average interest-earning assets) declined 30 basis
          points for the year as increased rates on funding sources offset
          gains in earning asset yields. The average rate paid rose 34 basis
          points, led by short-term borrowing costs which increased in response
          to Federal Reserve actions. The average yield on interest-earning
          assets was up a more modest 5 basis points for the year, although the
          increase accelerated in the second half of 1994.

Interest Income

               Taxable equivalent interest income rose $240.716 million or 10.8
          percent, primarily the result of good growth in average
          interest-earning assets supplemented by a higher average yield.
          Average interest-earning assets expanded $3.014 billion or 10.1
          percent for the year with the average rate earned up 5 basis points.
               Strong loan demand paced overall interest-earning asset growth,
          with average loans rising $2.667 billion or 12.4 percent for the year
          versus $1.514 billion or 7.6 percent in 1993. Both commercial and
          retail loans were up, with growth stronger for the year in the
          commercial portfolio.
               Commercial loans, including related real estate categories,
          expanded $1.549 billion or 13 percent compared with an increase of
          $278 million or 2.4 percent in 1993. All categories were up for the
          year with gains concentrated in regular commercial loans, which rose
          $1.169 billion or 18.9 percent. Commercial mortgages were higher by
          $209 million or 6.6 percent, while construction loans increased $26
          million or 5.5 percent, the first yearly gain since 1990. Based on
          regulatory definitions, commercial mortgages were $3.484 billion or
          13.5 percent of total loans at December 31, 1994, and construction
          loans were $553 million or 2.1 percent. These compared with $3.199
          billion or 13.9 percent and $494 million or 2.2 percent,
          respectively, at year-end 1993.
               Retail loans, including residential mortgages, grew $1.118
          billion or 11.6 percent versus a gain of $1.236 billion or 14.7
          percent in 1993. The increase was led by credit card loans, up $938
          million or 36.2 percent, and by indirect retail loans, which rose
          $205 million or 9.1 percent and primarily consists of automobile
          sales financing. Credit cards have remained a particularly strong
          area of retail loan growth with demand fueled largely by Wachovia's
          variable rate pricing options. At December 31, 1994, managed credit
          card outstandings totaled $4.094 billion, including $125 million of
          net securitized loans. Approximately 90 percent of the portfolio was
          variable rate. This compared with $3.123 billion in outstandings with
          approximately 84 percent variable rate a year earlier. At year-end
          1992, approximately 61 percent of the credit card portfolio was
          variable rate.
               Direct retail loans and other revolving credit also were higher
          for the year, with the gain in direct retail loans reversing several
          consecutive yearly declines. Reflecting, in part, the impact of
          higher interest rates and lower demand, residential mortgages
          decreased $81 million or 2.1 percent. Although lower for the full
          year, residential mortgages have increased modestly on a sequential
          monthly basis since July.
               The corporation has a modest commitment of loans and other
          outstandings to foreign countries. Cross border commitments,
          primarily consisting of loans, were $275 million or .7 percent of
          total assets at December 31, 1994, down $77 million or 22 percent
          from $352 million or 1 percent at year-end 1993.
               Continued good loan growth throughout 1994 moderated the need
          for increases in investment securities which were up $644 million or
          9.1 percent for the year compared with an increase of $838 million or
          13.5 percent in 1993. Effective January 1, 1994, investment
          securities were classified by the corporation as either securities
          held-to-maturity or securities available-for-sale under Statement of
          Financial Accounting

          Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
          and Equity Securities" (FASB 115), which the corporation
          prospectively adopted on that date. Securities held-to-maturity are
          debt securities which management can demonstrate positive intent and
          ability to hold to maturity. They are reported at amortized cost.
          Securities available-for-sale are debt and equity securities not
          classified as either held-to-maturity or trading. Securities
          available-for-sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized
          gains and losses resulting from changes in market value included, net
          of tax, in shareholders' equity.
               At December 31, 1994, securities available-for-sale were $3.538
          billion and securities held-to-maturity were $4.185 billion. For the
          full year, there was an unrealized loss of $12.405 million, pretax,
          and $7.561 million, net of tax, on average securities
          available-for-sale. The municipal portfolio remains of good
          investment grade with 96.6 percent rated A or higher by Moody's at
          December 31, 1994 compared with 95.6 percent a year earlier.

Interest Expense

               Interest expense grew $199.376 million or 23.8 percent,
          reflecting expanded average interest-bearing liabilities and a higher
          average cost of funds. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased
          $3.016 billion or 12.3 percent, primarily in long-term debt and
          short-term borrowings. The average rate paid rose 34 basis points for
          the year, principally due to higher short-term borrowing costs
          pressed upward by the shift in Federal Reserve policy during the
          year.
               Total interest-bearing time deposits were relatively unchanged,
          declining $88 million or under 1 percent. Savings certificates and
          large denomination certificates declined while interest-bearing
          demand, savings and money market savings and foreign time deposits
          grew moderately. The majority of the deposits in foreign offices were
          in denominations of greater than $100,000.
               Short-term borrowings were higher by $827 million or 15.3
          percent. Federal funds sold and repurchase agreements accounted for
          almost all of the growth, rising $1.105 billion or 28 percent.
          Commercial paper borrowings increased $19 million or 3.9 percent,
          while other short-term borrowings, primarily consisting of term
          federal funds, were down $297 million or 30.6 percent.
               Wachovia Bank of North Carolina has an ongoing bank note program
          under which the bank may offer an aggregate principal amount of up to
          $7 billion outstanding at any one time. Notes can be issued with
          terms of 30 days to 15 years. Bank notes with original maturities of
          one year or less were issued beginning in the fourth quarter of 1994
          and are included in other short-term borrowed funds. At year-end
          1994, short-term bank notes totaled $456 million with an average cost
          of 6.13 percent and an average maturity of 4.15 months. Bank notes
          with original maturities of greater than one year are medium-term
          notes and are classified as long-term debt. Medium-term bank notes at
          December 31, 1994 were $3.953 billion with an average cost of 5.31
          percent and an average maturity of 1.73 years versus $2.370 billion
          outstanding a year earlier, with an average cost of 4.54 percent and
          an average maturity of 1.8 years. The bank note program provides
          additional funding at attractive rates, reflective of the issuing
          bank's strong credit ratings.
               Long-term debt increased $2.277 billion or 109.8 percent,
          principally driven by expansion of the medium-term bank note program.
          Medium-term bank notes were up $1.988 billion or 129.4 percent, while
          other long-term debt rose $289 million or 53.8 percent.
               Gross deposits for the year averaged $22.315 billion, lower by
          $58 million or less than 1 percent from $22.373 billion in 1993.
          Collected deposits, net of float, averaged $20.691 billion compared
          with $20.762 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $71 million or
          under 1 percent. Demand and noninterest-bearing time deposits in 1994
          averaged $5.384 billion versus $5.354 billion the year earlier.

Asset and Liability Management, Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity
Management

               The goal of asset and liability management is to maintain high
          quality and consistent growth of net interest income with acceptable
          levels of risk to changes in interest rates. The corporation seeks to
          meet this goal by influencing the maturity and repricing
          characteristics of the various lending and deposit taking lines of
          business, by managing discretionary balance sheet asset and liability
          portfolios and by utilizing off-balance sheet financial instruments.
               Interest rate risk management is carried out by Funds Management
          which operates under policies

<PAGE>   24


          established by the Finance Committee of the corporation's board
          of directors and the guidance of the Management Finance Committee.
          Rate risk, liquidity, capital positions and discretionary on and
          off-balance sheet activity are reviewed quarterly by the Board
          Finance Committee. Interim oversight of the asset and liability
          function is provided through regular bimonthly meetings of Funds
          Management and the Chief Financial Officer. Funds Management
          personnel carry out day-to-day activity within approved risk
          management guidelines and strategies.
               The corporation uses a number of tools to measure interest rate
          risk, including monitoring the difference or gap between rate
          sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods,
          monitoring the change in the net present value of the asset and
          liability portfolios under various rate scenarios and income
          simulation modeling. The rate sensitivity gap table on this page sets
          forth the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
          liabilities outstanding as of year-ends 1994 and 1993, which mature
          or are projected to reprice in

Note: Management's assumptions of the repricing characteristics of certain accounts without contractual maturity dates are
detailed above. The December 31, 1993 gap sensitivity table has been restated to reclassify $1.018 billion in loans from over one
year and nonsensitive to 0-3 months sensitive and $100 million in long-term debt from 0-3 months sensitive to over one year and
nonsensitive.

          each of the future time periods shown. The projected asset repricing
          volumes include management assumptions of prepayments of mortgage
          related assets and automobile financing. Also, the projected interest
          checking and savings repricing volumes are based on management's
          assumptions of the expected rate sensitivity of these accounts in
          relationship to the prime rate. Inclusion of the impact of these
          management assumptions in the gap analysis table presents a more
          accurate view of the corporation's rate risk position. The section on
          nonsensitive and maturities beyond one year includes bank credit card
          loans of $404 million in 1994 and $499 million in 1993, savings
          balances of $676 million in 1994 and $577 million in 1993 and
          interest-bearing checking balances of $2.115 billion in 1994 and
          $2.222 billion in 1993.
               Management believes that rate risk is best measured by
          simulation modeling which can incorporate changes in asset and
          liability volumes and changes in interest rates, as well as the
          associated timing of the rate of change in interest rates of various
          categories of assets and liabilities. The model used captures
          interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance
          sheet financial instruments and projects net interest income on a
          continuous rolling 12-month basis. The model also incorporates
          projections of noninterest income and expense including loan loss
          provision expense so management can view projected net income on a
          per share basis under simulated interest rate environments. The
          corporation monitors exposure to a gradual change in rates of 200
          basis points up or down over the rolling 12-month period and an
          instantaneous change in rates of 200 basis points up or down over the
          same period. From time to time, the model horizon is expanded to a
          24-month period. The results of these simulations are monitored for
          compliance with policy and analyzed with the objective of identifying
          potential adverse performance situations. If conditions indicate an
          adverse situation is likely, management's immediate goal is to
          construct a strategy to alter the balance sheet or enter into
          off-balance sheet financial instruments to neutralize, as much as
          possible, the adverse impact.
               The corporation policy limit for the maximum negative impact on
          net interest revenue from a gradual change in interest rates of 200
          basis points over 12 months is 7.5 percent. Management generally has
          maintained a risk position well within the policy guideline level.
          As of December 31, 1994, the current impact for a 200 basis point
          gradual increase in rates over 12 months would be a reduction of less
          than one half of one percent in net interest income from an unchanged
          rate environment.
               The corporation uses both on-balance sheet instruments such as
          investment securities and purchased funds and off-balance sheet
          derivative instruments to provide growth of net interest income,
          stability to the corporation's interest rate sensitivity and enhance
          liquidity. Off-balance sheet instruments used for asset and liability
          management purposes include interest rate swaps, futures and options
          with indices that directly correlate to on-balance sheet instruments.
          These financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, have
          been used by the corporation over a number of years, and management
          believes the use of such instruments enhances the effectiveness of
          asset and liability management on a sound basis.
               The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement
          No. 119, "Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair
          Value of Financial Instruments" (FASB 119), which is effective for
          this year's financial statements. FASB119 requires increased
          disclosures about derivatives and other financial instruments. The
          statement distinguishes between financial instruments held or issued
          for trading purposes and financial instruments held or issued for
          purposes other than trading, such as for risk management purposes.
          Specific disclosures required by FASB 119 regarding off-balance sheet
          financial instruments held for risk management purposes is provided
          in Note J to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures
          regarding instruments held for trading are included in Note I.
               Off-balance sheet asset and liability derivative transactions,
          on a stand-alone basis, resulted in additional interest expense of
          $9.910 million in 1994. However, this effect was more than offset by
          net interest income from related on-balance sheet instruments.
               At December 31, 1994, the corporation had $1.118 billion
          notional amount of derivatives outstanding for asset and liability
          management purposes. Interest rate swaps were $703 million or 63
          percent of the total notional amount. Details on the maturity
          schedule of asset and liability management derivatives including
          notional amounts and average maturities are contained in the
          following table.

               Off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments do not expose
          the corporation to credit risk equal to the notional amount, but
          instead credit risk is equal to the fair value gain of the instrument
          if a counterparty fails to perform. The credit risk is normally a
          small percentage of the notional amount and fluctuates as interest
          rates move up and down. The corporation mitigates this risk by
          subjecting the transactions to the same rigorous approval and
          monitoring process as is used for on-balance sheet credit
          transactions, by dealing in the national market with highly rated
          counterparties, by executing all transactions under International
          Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreements and by using
          collateral instruments to reduce exposure. Collateral is delivered by
          either party when the fair value of a particular transaction or group
          of transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis exceeds an
          acceptable threshold of exposure. The threshold level is determined
          based on the strength of the individual counterparty.
               The fair value of all asset and liability derivative positions
          for which the corporation was exposed to counterparties totaled
          $14.912 million as of December 31, 1994. The fair value of all asset
          and liability derivative positions for which counterparties were
          exposed to the corporation amounted to $40.440 million on the same
          date. Details of the net fair value loss of $25.528 million are
          included in Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
               The corporation uses derivative financial contracts to (1) swap
          floating rate assets or liabilities to fixed rate; (2) convert fixed
          rate assets or liabilities to floating rate; and (3) hedge the
          interest rate spread between assets and liabilities. These
          transactions serve to better match the repricing characteristics of
          various assets and liabilities, reduce spread risk, adjust overall
          rate sensitivity and enhance net interest income.
               Changing the repricing characteristics of liabilities to match
          the assets they support generally is accomplished through an interest
          rate swap whereby the corporation pays a fixed rate and receives a
          floating rate.

                                                                             25

          This allows the corporation to acquire fixed rate assets without
          increasing exposure to rising interest rates. Converting fixed rate
          debt to a floating rate is accomplished generally by receiving fixed
          on an interest rate swap and paying floating. The corporation has
          used this type of transaction to convert long-term subordinated debt
          to a floating rate. This transaction increases liquidity by allowing
          a long-term liability to replace a short-term liability, yet have a
          rate that is consistent with and fluctuates with short-term rates.
          Receiving a fixed rate on an interest rate swap and paying a floating
          rate has the effect of converting floating rate assets to fixed rate
          assets. The results are essentially the same as acquiring a fixed
          rate security funded with a floating rate liability. Both
          transactions reduce asset sensitivity. The corporation has used this
          type of transaction to convert a portion of the floating rate credit
          card portfolio to fixed rates.
               Hedging the spread between the rate received and the rate paid
          on certain assets and liabilities can be achieved by the use of
          options contracts such as caps. The corporation has entered into
          simultaneous transactions purchasing and selling caps to protect
          against a narrowing in the spread between the prime

          rate and federal funds for a portion of the prime floating assets.
          The caps also would prevent the corporation from benefiting from a
          widening in the spread between prime and federal funds for the assets
          covered by the transactions.
               The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that the
          corporation is positioned to meet all immediate and future demands
          for cash. Liquidity management relies upon liquidity analysis,
          knowledge of historical trends over past credit and business cycles
          and forecasts of future conditions to achieve its objectives. The two
          broad-based sources of liquidity which exist for the corporation are
          its high quality marketable assets and liabilities which are readily
          accepted in the marketplace. Asset liquidity primarily is provided by
          securities which, by their maturity structure or marketability, can
          produce cash flows that result in enhanced liquidity. The corporation
          generates additional cash through the liability side of the balance
          sheet from the growth of deposits and the issuance of bank notes and
          other forms of debt securities.
               Wachovia's ability to attract a variety of funds rests on the
          corporation's strength of capital, reputation, credit ratings and
          diverse statewide banking networks. At December 31, 1994, Wachovia's
          common equity represented 8.39 percent of assets, third highest among
          the 25 largest U.S. banking companies. Wachovia's strong capital
          position is reflected in its credit ratings and remains central to
          its ability to raise additional funds at attractive rates through
          short-term borrowings and long-term debt. At year-end 1994, the
          corporation's senior debt was rated (P)Aa3 by Moody's and (P)AA by
          Standard & Poor's. Subordinated debt was rated A1 and AA- by Moody's
          and Standard & Poor's, respectively. Commercial paper was rated P-1
          by Moody's and A-1+ by Standard & Poor's.
               In addition to seeking to maintain liquidity through a strong
          balance sheet and performance that assures market acceptance, the
          corporation limits, through policy and internal guidelines which are
          subject to periodic review and revision, the total amount of
          purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and the
          concentrations of funding from noncore sources. Purchased funds
          currently are limited to 40 percent of total assets by policy.
          Internal management guidelines are currently substantially below the
          policy limit. To insure against concentrations by maturity or type of
          funding source, the corporation also has established policy limits
          for the percentage of purchased funds from individual categories of
          liabilities to no more than 20 percent of assets. The percentage of
          purchased funds maturing overnight, within 30 days, within 90 days
          and within 180 days also are limited by policy. In addition,
          management monitors significant concentrations of funds from single
          deposit or borrowing sources. Asset liquidity is assured through
          maintaining significant amounts of investment securities in the
          available-for-sale portfolio. These securities may be sold at any
          time to provide needed liquidity or for other reasons. Liquidity for
          unusual circumstances also is available from the held-to-maturity
          investment securities account.
               Management regularly reviews the liquidity position under normal
          business conditions and under significant market disruption or stress

Nonperforming Assets

               Nonperforming assets at December 31, 1994 were $100.517 million
          or .39 percent of loans and foreclosed property. The total decreased
          $54.384 million or 35.1 percent from a year earlier, primarily due to
          improvement in borrowers' credit positions, which resulted in
          paydowns and the return of cash-basis assets to accrual status, and
          to sales of foreclosed property. The corporation's problem asset
          levels historically have remained relatively low as a result of its
          sound underwriting standards, consistent credit reviews and an
          aggressive loan charge-off policy.
               The largest category of nonperforming assets is real estate. At
          year-end 1994, real estate nonperforming assets totaled $68.353
          million, representing .87 percent of real estate loans and foreclosed
          real estate. This was down $55.242 million or 44.7 percent from
          $123.595 million or 1.65 percent a year earlier. The total at
          December 31, 1994 included $49.479 million in real estate
          nonperforming loans compared with $81.062 million at year-end 1993.
               Commercial real estate nonperforming assets were $43.399 million
          or 1.07 percent of related loans and foreclosed real estate. The
          total decreased $54.615 million or 55.7 percent from $98.014 million
          or 2.63 percent at December 31, 1993 and included $35.885 million of
          commercial real estate nonperforming loans versus $64.056 million a
          year earlier.

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

               The provision for loan losses was $71.763 million in 1994,
          exceeding net charge-offs by $1.334 million but lower by $20.889
          million or 22.5 percent from $92.652 million in 1993. The provision
          reflects management's assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for
          loan losses to absorb potential write-offs in the loan portfolio.
          Factors considered in this assessment include growth and composition
          of the loan portfolio, historical credit loss experience, current and
          anticipated economic conditions and changes in borrowers' financial
          positions.
               Net loan losses for the year totaled $70.429 million or .29
          percent of average loans compared with $67.411 million or .31 percent
          in 1993. Loan recoveries represented 31.4 percent of gross
          charge-offs, up from 30.6 percent in the prior year, with recoveries
          increasing primarily in real estate and credit cards. Real estate
          loans had net recoveries of $5.310 million, largely in commercial
          mortgages, versus net loan losses of $5.821 million in 1993. Credit
          card net charge-offs totaled $58.434 million or 1.66 percent of
          average credit card loans compared with $52.675 million or 2.03
          percent in the prior year.
               The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1994 was $406.132
          million, representing 1.57 percent of year-end loans and 516 percent
          coverage of nonperforming loans. Comparable amounts a year earlier
          were $404.798 million, 1.76 percent and 372 percent coverage,
          respectively.
               The corporation prospectively will adopt Statement of Financial
          Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
          of a Loan" (FASB 114), as of January 1, 1995. This new accounting
          standard requires that a loan which meets the definition of
          impairment be measured at the present value of expected future cash
          flows using the loan's effective interest rate, or as a practical
          expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of
          the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is
          impaired when, based on current information and events, it is
          probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due
          according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The
          corporation does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a
          material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

**The allocation of the allowance for loan losses above represents an estimate
  based on historical loss experience, individual credits, economic conditions
  and other judgmental factors. Since any allocation is judgmental and involves
  consideration of many factors, the allocation may be more or less than the

  charge-offs in any category of loans. See page 71 for percentages of loan

Noninterest Income

               Total other operating revenue was higher by $4.253 million or
          slightly under 1 percent for the year. The modest increase was the
          mixed result of good gains in credit card income, trust service fees
          and a broad array of other fee categories largely offset by reduced
          levels of deposit service charges, mortgage fee income and trading
          account profits.
               Credit card income grew $10.145 million or 10 percent. Higher
          levels of cardholder interchange income and membership fees primarily
          accounted for the increase. Cardholder purchase volume totaled $3.358
          billion in 1994 compared with $2.796 billion in 1993. Membership fee
          gains reflected both growth in new cardholder accounts and a strong
          renewal rate among existing accounts.
               Trust service fees increased $8.070 million or 6.7 percent.
          Growth occurred largely in personal financial services fees and in
          revenues associated with Wachovia's proprietary Biltmore Funds.
          Corporate trust fees were modestly higher for the year. During the
          fourth quarter of 1994, the corporation expanded its Biltmore mutual
          funds through the addition of two state municipal bond funds and an
          emerging markets equity fund. At December 31, 1994, assets of the
          Biltmore Funds totaled $2.209 billion versus $1.285 billion a year
          earlier. Total trust assets were $78.972 billion, including $17.084
          billion under management, compared with $92.287 billion in total
          assets, including $17.950 billion under management, at year-end 1993.
          The decline in custodial assets largely reflected the loss of a
          single major account while managed assets were lower, particularly
          the fixed income portfolio, due to market valuations in 1994. 
               Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $6.736 million or
          3.3 percent. The lower level largely reflected a drop in commercial
          account analysis fees due, in part, to closing of the corporation's
          retail lockbox in late 1993 and to the impact of rising interest
          rates, which increased the value of corporate deposit balances.
          Partially offsetting this decline was a modest increase in overdraft
          and NSF charges.
               Mortgage fee income was lower by $5.877 million or 15 percent.
          Although servicing fees, the largest component of total mortgage fee
          income, were up modestly in 1994, the gain was more than offset by
          reduced origination fees and losses on loan sales due to rising
          interest rates. Loan originations for the year totaled $1.429 billion
          versus $2.220 billion in 1993. At December 31, 1994, the mortgage
          portfolio serviced was $9.465 billion, representing 138,949 loans.
          This compared with $9.007 billion and 135,637 loans a year earlier.
          In February of 1995, the corporation announced it is offering for
          sale its residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio based on a
          strategic analysis of the future of the servicing business,
          competitive trends in the industry and the long-term need for
          investments in technology. The transaction is expected to close in
          late March or early April. The corporation will continue, however, to
          offer a full line of mortgage loan services.
               Increasing interest rates throughout the year negatively
          impacted bond values, lowering trading account profits. In 1994,
          trading account activity resulted in profits of $3.099 million
          compared with $13.103 million in 1993, a decrease of $10.004 million
          or 76.3 percent.

               Excluding income from student loan servicing, which the
          corporation sold as a subsidiary in February 1993, remaining combined
          categories of total other operating revenue grew $14.190 million or
          12.1 percent. Bankers' acceptance and letter of credit fees increased
          $3.500 million or 17.8 percent. Other service charges and fees, which
          include net ATM fees, mutual fund fees, safe deposit fees, brokerage
          commissions and debit card interchange fees, were up $7.969 million
          or 16.3 percent, while other income rose $2.889 million or 7.7
          percent.
               Revenues from Wachovia's off-balance sheet trading and lending
          activities totaled $14.457 million in 1994 versus $8.635 million in
          1993 and are included in other operating income. Note I in the Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional information
          on this activity.
               Including gains on securities and subsidiary sales, total
          noninterest income was lower by $19.851 million or 3.2 percent.
          Investment securities gains totaled $3.320 million in 1994 compared
          with $19.394 million in 1993. Total noninterest income in 1993 also
          included a pretax gain of $8.030 million from the sale of Wachovia
          Student Financial Services, Inc.

Noninterest Expense

               Total noninterest expense was down $32.823 million or 2.9
          percent for the year. The reduction reflected a slight decrease in
          total personnel expense, modestly higher combined net occupancy and
          equipment expense and lower spending levels in remaining combined
          categories of noninterest expense. The overhead ratio, which measures
          noninterest expense as a percent of total adjusted revenues (taxable
          equivalent net interest income and total other operating revenue),
          declined to 54.1 percent for the year from 57 percent in 1993.
               Total personnel expense edged down $5.173 million or slightly
          under 1 percent. Salaries expense grew $9.169 million or 2 percent,
          largely reflecting higher base salaries. Increases in relocation
          costs and temporary help, reflecting moves by the corporation to
          consolidate several loan processing and other operations, also
          contributed to the rise. Employee benefits expense decreased $14.342
          million or 12.7 percent. The decline largely was due to lower
          accruals for anticipated medical benefits costs, as well as reduced
          employee retirement savings and profit-sharing plan expenses,
          reflective of a special contribution made to the plan in 1993 but not
          in 1994.

               Combined net occupancy and equipment expense increased $3.103
          million or 1.7 percent. Net occupancy expense was down $1.159 million
          or 1.4 percent due, in part, to lower lease and renovation expenses.
          Equipment expense rose $4.262 million or 4.2 percent, primarily
          driven by increased depreciation expense and by higher equipment
          installation and relocation expenses associated with capital
          expenditures in 1993 and 1994 for new technology.
               Remaining combined categories of noninterest expense were down
          $30.753 million or 8.1 percent, led by a net gain in foreclosed
          property expense and by lower levels of amortization expense and
          advertising and sales promotion expense. The net gain in foreclosed
          property expense totaled $4.288 million in 1994 compared with net
          expense of $7.654 million in 1993.

Income Taxes

               Applicable income taxes increased $26.979 million or 13.8
          percent for the year. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are
          reduced primarily by the interest earned on state and municipal debt
          securities and industrial revenue obligations. Also, within certain
          limitations, one-half of the interest income on qualifying employee
          stock ownership plan loans is exempt from federal taxes. The interest
          earned on state and municipal debt instruments is exempt from federal
          taxes and, except for out-of-state issues, from Georgia and North
          Carolina taxes as well, and results in substantial interest savings
          for local governments and their constituents.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL RATIOS

               Shareholders' equity was $3.287 billion at December 31, 1994, a
          gain of $269 million or 8.9 percent from $3.018 billion at year-end
          1993. The total at December 31, 1994 included $37.635 million, net of
          tax, of unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale marked to
          fair market value under FASB 115. Equity for the year averaged $3.096
          billion, an increase of $224 million or 7.8 percent from $2.872
          billion in 1993 and included unrealized losses of $7.561 million, net
          of tax, on securities available-for-sale. At year-end 1994,
          Wachovia's book value was $19.23 per share, up 9.2 percent from
          $17.61 per share a year earlier. The corporation's internal capital
          generation rate (net income less dividends as a percentage of average
          equity) was 10.6 percent for the year compared with 10.5 percent in
          1993.
             On July 22, 1994, the corporation's board of directors
          authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of common stock.
          The authorization replaces an earlier one for the repurchase of the
          same number of shares. Repurchased shares will be used for various
          corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for the
          corporation's employee stock plans and dividend reinvestment plan. In
          1994, a total of 1,620,900 shares were repurchased under the new and
          earlier authorizations at an average price of $32.55 per share for a
          total cost of $52.760 million. Shares available for possible
          repurchase at year-end 1994 totaled 4,324,500.
               Intangible assets were $78.408 million at December 31, 1994,
          down $11.710 million or 13 percent from $90.118 million a year
          earlier. The total consisted of $34.477 million in mortgage servicing
          rights, $30.961 million in goodwill, $8.574 million in deposit base
          intangibles and $4.396 million in other intangible assets, primarily
          purchased credit card intangibles. At year-end 1993, mortgage
          servicing rights were $40.875 million, goodwill totaled $32.451
          million, deposit base intangibles were $10.647 million and other
          intangibles were $6.145 million.
               Regulatory agencies divide capital into Tier I (consisting of
          shareholders' equity less ineligible intangible assets) and Tier II
          (consisting of the allowable portion of the reserve for loan losses
          and certain long-term debt) and measure capital adequacy by applying
          both capital levels to a banking company's risk-

          adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Regulatory requirements
          presently specify that Tier I capital should exclude the market
          appreciation or depreciation of securities available-for-sale arising
          from valuation adjustments under FASB 115. In addition to these
          capital ratios, regulatory agencies have established a Tier I
          leverage ratio which measures Tier I capital to average assets less
          ineligible intangible assets.
               Regulatory guidelines require a minimum of total capital to
          risk-adjusted assets ratio of 8 percent with one-half consisting of
          tangible common shareholders' equity and a minimum Tier I leverage
          ratio of 3 percent. Banks which meet or exceed a Tier I ratio of 6
          percent, a total capital ratio of 10 percent and a Tier I leverage
          ratio of 5 percent are considered well capitalized by regulatory
          standards.
               At December 31, 1994, Wachovia's Tier I to risk-adjusted assets
          ratio was 9.26 percent with total capital 12.73 percent of
          risk-adjusted assets. The corporation's Tier I leverage ratio was
          8.63 percent.

Dividends

               Cash dividends paid totaled $210.503 million in 1994 versus
          $191.488 million in 1993, an increase of $19.015 million or 9.9
          percent. For 1994, cash dividends paid represented a payout of 39.1
          percent of net income compared with 38.9 percent in 1993. Cash
          dividends paid per common share were $1.23, higher by 10.8 percent
          from $1.11 paid per common share a year earlier.
               The corporation's board of directors declared a first quarter
          dividend of $.33 per share at its meeting on January 27, 1995. The
          dividend represents an increase of 10 percent from $.30 per share
          paid in the same period of 1994 and is payable on March 1 to
          shareholders of record on February 8, 1995.

FOURTH QUARTER ANALYSIS

               Net income per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of
          1994 was $.82, up 16.4 percent from $.71 per share in the same period
          a year earlier. Net income totaled $142.126 million, higher by
          $19.129 million or 15.6 percent, and represented returns of 17.8
          percent on shareholders' equity and 1.49 percent on assets.
               Taxable equivalent net interest income rose $20.616 million or
          5.9 percent on strong loan growth and a higher earning asset yield.
          Average loans increased $3.125 billion or 14.1 percent, led by
          regular commercial loans, up $1.623 million or 25.9 percent, credit
          cards, which were higher by $885 million or 30.2 percent, and
          commercial mortgages, which grew $290 million or 9.2 percent. The
          average loan yield increased 77 basis points from the year-earlier
          period.
               The provision for loan losses was $19.539 million, higher by
          $1.526 million or 8.5 percent from $18.013 million in the fourth
          quarter of 1993. Net loan losses totaled $19.412 million or .31
          percent of average loans on an annualized basis compared with $17.306
          million or .31 percent in the year-earlier quarter. The majority of
          the increase in net loan losses was due to higher credit card net
          charge-offs, which largely reflected growth in the credit card
          portfolio. Credit card net loan losses totaled $16.756 million or

          1.76 percent of average credit card loans for the period versus
          $12.767 million or 1.74 percent a year earlier. Other retail net
          charge-offs were $2.289 million or .29 percent of average direct and
          indirect retail loans compared with $1.812 million or .23 percent in
          the final period of 1993. Real estate loans had net recoveries of
          $839 thousand versus net loan losses of $1.156 million in the prior
          year period.
               Other operating revenue was higher by $2.282 million or 1.5
          percent. Credit card income grew $2.366 million or 8.5 percent and
          trust service fees increased $933 thousand or 3.1 percent. These
          gains were offset by a trading account loss of $582 thousand as well
          as by lower levels of mortgage fee income and deposit account service
          charges, down $1.244 million or 12.3 percent and $569 thousand or 1.2
          percent, respectively. Other remaining categories of total other
          operating revenue were up $3.475 million or 10.5 percent, led by
          gains in other service charges and fees, insurance premiums and
          commissions, and bankers acceptance and letter of credit fees.
               Total noninterest expense declined $17.215 million or 5.7
          percent. Total personnel expense decreased $6.143 million or 4.2
          percent with salaries expense dropping $4.301 million or 3.5 percent
          and employee benefits expense down $1.842 million or 7.2 percent.
          Combined net occupancy and equipment expense declined $2.412 million
          or 4.7 percent, with lower net occupancy expenses primarily
          accounting for the decrease. Remaining combined categories of
          noninterest expense were down $8.660 million or 8.6 percent.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1993 vs. 1992

               The corporation's net income in 1993 totaled $492.095 million or
          $2.81 per fully diluted share compared with $433.225 million or $2.48
          per fully diluted share in 1992. The higher earnings reflected
          expanded net interest income, healthy gains in other operating
          revenue, reduced credit costs and good expense control, with net
          income for the year representing returns of 17.1 percent on
          shareholders' equity and 1.46 percent on assets.
               Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $48.429 million
          or 3.6 percent. Growth in interest-earning assets and a reduced
          average funding cost accounted for the increase which was moderated
          by a lower average earning asset yield and higher levels of
          interest-bearing liabilities. The net yield on interest-earning
          assets decreased 11 basis points.
               Taxable equivalent interest income was lower by $79.587 million
          or 3.5 percent. Average interest-earning assets increased $1.683
          billion or 6 percent, but gains in income were more than offset by
          the impact of a 73 basis point drop in the average rate earned. Loans
          grew $1.514 billion or 7.6 percent with retail loans, including
          residential mortgages, up $1.236 billion or 14.7 percent. Commercial
          loans, including commercial mortgages and construction loans, were
          higher by $278 million or 2.4 percent. Investment securities rose
          $838 million or 13.5 percent for the year.
               Interest expense decreased $128.016 million or 13.2 percent as
          the average funding cost dropped 72 basis points to 3.43 percent
          versus 4.15 percent in 1992. Average interest-bearing liabilities
          were higher by $1.201 billion or 5.2 percent, led by expansion in the
          corporation's medium-term bank notes, which increased by $1.262
          billion. Total interest-bearing time deposits were down $865 million
          or 4.8 percent with decreases in savings certificates and large
          denomination certificates softened by growth in interest-bearing
          demand and savings and money market savings deposits. Total
          short-term borrowings rose $442 million or 8.9 percent.

                                                                              41

               The table below summarizes the changes in interest income
          (taxable equivalent) and interest expense resulting from changes in
          rates and volume between 1993 and 1992. Changes which are not solely
          due to rate or to volume are allocated proportionately to rate and
          volume. Information on changes in rates and volume between 1994 and
          1993 can be found on page 19.

</TABLE>

               Nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 decreased $110.508
          million or 41.6 percent to $154.901 million or .67 percent of loans
          and foreclosed property. The decline largely reflected paydowns,
          property sales and the return of cash-basis assets to accrual status
          as real estate market conditions generally improved and declining
          interest rates helped borrowers' credit positions. Net loan losses
          were lower by $27.834 million or 29.2 percent, and totaled $67.411
          million or .31 percent of average loans for the year. The provision
          for loan losses was $92.652 million, a decrease of $26.768 million or
          22.4 percent from the 1992 level and exceeded net charge-offs by
          $25.241 million. At December 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses
          was $404.798 million, representing 1.76 percent of loans and 372
          percent coverage of nonperforming loans compared with $379.557
          million, 1.80 percent and 218 percent coverage, respectively, at
          year-end 1992.
               Total other operating revenue grew $64.937 million or 12.1
          percent. Credit card fee income was up $23.712 million or 30.4
          percent, service charges on deposit accounts rose $13.348 million or
          7 percent, and trust service fees were higher by $10.526 million or
          9.6 percent. Trading account profits totaled $13.103 million for the
          year compared with a loss of $11.542 million in 1992 due to hedging
          in mortgage backed securities. Mortgage fee income declined $977
          thousand or 2.4 percent. Remaining combined categories of total other
          operating revenue, excluding student loan servicing which was sold as
          a subsidiary in the second month of 1993, increased $21.398 million
          or 22.2 percent.
               Total noninterest expense was higher by $35.584 million or 3.2
          percent. Total personnel expense rose $28.857 million or 5.3 percent
          with higher employee benefits expense acccounting for the majority of
          the increase. Increased benefits expense largely reflected both a
          special contribution by the corporation to its employee retirement
          savings and profit-sharing plan and the impact of a new accounting
          change for post-retirement expenses adopted at the beginning of 1993.
          Combined net occupancy and equipment expense was up $2.727 million or
          1.5 percent, while remaining combined categories of noninterest
          expense rose a modest $4 million or 1.1 percent. The corporation's
          overhead ratio measuring noninterest expense as a percent of taxable
          equivalent net interest income and total other operating revenue was
          57 percent for the year compared with 58.6 percent in 1992.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

               Wachovia Corporation is a registered bank holding company under
          the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCAct) and is subject to the
          supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the
          Federal Reserve System (FRB). South Carolina National Corporation is
          likewise subject to the requirements of the BHCAct, which requires
          prior Board approval for bank acquisitions and prohibits a bank
          holding company from engaging in any business other than banking or
          bank-related activities. In addition to the provisions of the BHC
          Act, state banking commissions serve in a supervisory and regulatory
          capacity with respect to the bank holding company activities.
          Wachovia Corporation is also a savings and loan holding company
          registered under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), as amended
          by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of
          1989 (FIRREA), and is subject to examination, supervision and
          reporting requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).
               Various state and federal laws govern the activities of the
          Corporation's banking affiliates. As federally insured national
          banks, Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A., Wachovia Bank of
          Georgia, N.A., Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A., and The First
          National Bank of Atlanta are subject to the regulation, supervision
          and reporting requirements of the Office of the Comptroller of the
          Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
          The banking subsidiaries are directly affected by the actions of the
          FRB as it attempts to manage the money supply and credit availability
          in the economy.
               The Corporation's nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to a
          variety of state and federal laws. For example, the Corporation's
          discount brokerage and investment advisory subsidiary is subject to
          supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
          (SEC), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., state
          securities regulators and the various exchanges through which it
          conducts business. The Corporation's insurance subsidiaries are
          subject to the insurance laws of the states in which they are active.
          All nonbanking subsidiaries are supervised by the FRB.
               Federal law regulates transactions among Wachovia Corporation
          and its affiliates, including the amount of banking affiliates' loans
          to or investments in, nonbank affiliates and the amount of advances
          to third parties collateralized by securities of the affiliate. In
          addition, various requirements and restrictions under federal and
          state laws regulate the operations of the Corporation's banking
          affiliates, requiring the maintenance of reserves against deposits,
          limiting the nature of loans and interest that may be charged
          thereon, restricting investments, and other activities.
               Under FRB policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source
          of financial strength to, and commit resources to support, each of
          its subsidiary banks. In addition, FIRREA provides that a depository
          institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable by the FDIC for
          any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in connection
          with the default of a commonly controlled FDIC insured depository
          institution. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
          Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) federal banking regulators are
          required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository
          institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. 
          FDICIA also imposes substantial new examination, audit and reporting 
          requirements on insured depository institutions. Among other 
          requirements, the regulation requires a revision of risk-based 
          capital standards. The new standards are required to incorporate 
          interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of 
          nontraditional activities and to reflect the actual performance and 
          expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgages. See Equity and 
          Capital Ratios on pages 34 and 35.
               The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
          of 1994 (the Act) has introduced a process that will enable
          nationwide interstate banking through bank subsidiaries and
          interstate bank mergers. Separately the Act will also permit bank
          subsidiaries to act as agents for each other across state lines.
          Effective September 29, 1995, the bill will allow adequately
          capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire control of
          a bank in any state. Any acquisitions will be subject to
          concentration limits. Beginning June 1, 1997, banks will be permitted
          to merge with one another across state lines. A state could authorize
          such mergers earlier than June 1, 1997. In contrast, a state also
          could choose to

                                                                              43

          opt-out of interstate branching by enacting legislation before
          June 1, 1997. The legislation preserves state laws which require that
          a bank must be in existence for a minimum period of time before being
          acquired as long as the requirement is five years or less. This
          legislation has immediate relevance for the banking industry due to
          increased competitive forces from institutions which may consolidate
          through mergers and those which may move into new markets through
          enhanced opportunities to branch across state lines.
               The FDIC has proposed a reduction in the rates charged for
          deposit insurance premiums. The reduction as proposed will
          significantly reduce the amount of premiums assessed against well
          managed banks. Several issues are outstanding regarding the impact of
          premium reductions by the bank insurance fund on the related but
          currently separate Savings Institution Insurance Fund. At the
          earliest, any premium reductions will not be realized until midyear,
          when the Bank Insurance fund is expected to reach its required
          capitalization level.
               There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals
          that would have an impact on the operation of bank holding companies
          and their banks. Due to continued changes in the regulatory
          environment, additional legislation aimed at banking industry reform
          is likely to continue. While the potential effects of legislation
          currently under consideration cannot be measured with any degree of
          certainty, the Corporation is unaware of any pending legislative
          reforms or regulatory activities which would materially affect its
          financial position or operating results in the foreseeable future.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Wachovia Corporation is responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements, related financial data and other information in this
annual report. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on
management's estimates and judgment where appropriate. Financial information
appearing throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial
statements.

In meeting its responsibility both for the integrity and fairness of these
statements and information, management depends on the accounting system and
related internal control structures that are designed to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are authorized and recorded in accordance with
established procedures and that assets are safeguarded and proper and reliable
records are maintained.

The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that the cost
of an internal control structure should not exceed the related benefits. As an
integral part of the internal control structure, the corporation maintains a
professional staff of internal auditors who monitor compliance with and assess
the effectiveness of the internal control structure and coordinate audit
coverage with the independent auditors.

The Audit Committee of Wachovia's Board of Directors, composed solely of
outside directors, meets regularly with the corporation's management, internal
auditors, independent auditors and regulatory examiners to review matters
relating to financial reporting, internal control structure and the nature,
extent and results of the audit effort. The independent auditors, internal
auditors and banking regulators have direct access to the Audit Committee with
or without management present.

The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent
auditors, who render an independent professional opinion on management's
financial statements. Their appointment was recommended by the Audit Committee,
approved by the Board of Directors and ratified by the shareholders. Their
examination provides an objective assessment of the degree to which the
corporation's management meets its responsibility for financial reporting.
Their opinion on the financial statements is based on auditing procedures which
include reviewing internal control structures and performing selected tests of
transactions and records as they deem appropriate. These auditing procedures
are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial
statements are fairly presented in all material respects.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
Wachovia Corporation

We have audited the consolidated statements of condition of Wachovia
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wachovia
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note C to the financial statements, in 1994, the Corporation
changed its method of accounting for certain investment securities. As
discussed in Notes K and M to the financial statements, in 1993, the company
changed its methods of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits.

WACHOVIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note A -- Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Wachovia Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Corporation) follow generally accepted accounting principles and policies
within the financial services industry. The following is a summary of the more
significant policies:

Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Wachovia Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
all material intercompany balances and transactions.

Cash and Due From Banks -- The Corporation considers cash and due from banks,
all of which are maintained in financial institutions, as cash and cash
equivalents for purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Trading Instruments -- The Corporation maintains trading positions in both
derivative and nonderivative (or cash) financial instruments. Trading cash
instruments are held for distribution through retail sales or in anticipation
of market movements and are carried at fair value. Gains and losses, both
realized and unrealized, are included in "trading account profits (losses)" in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest revenue arising from cash
financial instruments is included in "interest income-trading account assets"
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Trading cash instruments are
comprised primarily of securities backed by the U.S. Treasury and various
federal agencies and state and local governmental bodies.

Trading derivative financial instruments are customer oriented, and trading
positions are established as necessary to accommodate customers' requirements.
Gains and losses from securities trading derivatives are included in "trading
account profits (losses)," while gains and losses from interest rate
derivatives and foreign exchange activities are included in "other operating
income" in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity and Available-for-Sale -- Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Debt
securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Corporation has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost.

Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading and marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are stated at fair value and their unrealized gains and losses, net
of tax, are reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage backed securities, over the
estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest
income from investments. The adjusted cost of the specific security sold is
used to compute "investment securities gains or losses" reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Investment securities are concentrated in a
variety of state and municipal, U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities.

Risk Management Instruments -- Interest rate swaps and options (caps and
floors) are used as part of the Corporation's overall interest rate risk
management and are designated as hedges of interest-bearing assets and
liabilities. Amounts receivable or payable under interest rate swap and option
agreements are recognized in "net interest income" in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. If a derivative financial instrument designated as a
hedge is terminated early, any resulting gain or loss is deferred and amortized
to net interest income over the remaining periods originally covered by the
derivative financial instrument.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses -- Loans are carried at their principal
amount outstanding, except for loans held for resale which are carried at the
lower of cost or market. Interest on commercial mortgage and installment loans
is accrued and credited to operating income based upon the principal amount
outstanding. Except for revolving credit loans, the recognition of interest
income is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal and
interest or when, in management's judgment, the interest will not be
collectible in the normal course of business. When interest accruals are
discontinued, prior accrued interest is reversed. Management may elect to
continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of
collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest.
Interest is accrued on revolving credit retail loans until payments become 120
days delinquent, at which time the outstanding principal balance and accrued
unpaid interest is charged off.

The allowance is maintained at a level believed to be adequate by management to
absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of
the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio, past
loan loss experience, current domestic and international economic conditions,
volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and other risks inherent
in the portfolio.

Premises and Equipment -- Premises, equipment and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. For financial
reporting purposes, the provision for depreciation is computed by the
straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the life of the leasehold asset or the lease term.

Intangible Assets -- Premiums paid to purchase servicing rights of mortgage
loans are amortized over the aggregate estimated remaining servicing life of
the loans. The excess of cost over net assets and identifiable intangible
assets, including deposit base intangibles, of acquired businesses is amortized
on the straight-line method over the estimated periods benefited.

Income Taxes -- Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" (FASB 109), which requires an asset and liability approach to
accounting for income taxes. Under FASB 109, deferred income taxes reflect the
net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. Financial statements for prior years reflect income taxes
recorded under the deferred method required under previous accounting
standards.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Each
subsidiary provides for income taxes based on its contribution to income taxes
(benefit) of the consolidated group.

Reclassifications -- Certain of the prior years' balances have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

NOTE B -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates
and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in
many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.
The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may
have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Also, the fair
value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available
to management as of December 31, 1994 and 1993. Such amounts have not been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those
dates and therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein.

Trading Account Assets -- Fair values for the Corporation's trading account
assets, which also are the amounts recognized in the statements of condition,
are based on quoted market prices. These assets are those which are held for
trading purposes.

Investment Securities -- Fair values for investment securities are based on
quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is
estimated using market prices for similar securities. Investment securities are
classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon management's
determination at the time of purchase and periodic reevaluation. Securities
held for trading purposes are not included in these classifications, but rather
are included in Trading Account Assets described above.

Loans -- For credit card, equity lines and other loans with short-term or
variable rate characteristics, the carrying value reduced by an estimate of
credit losses inherent in the portfolio is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The fair value of all other loans is estimated by discounting their future cash
flows using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar
terms, reduced by an estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The
discount rates used are commensurate with the interest rate and prepayment
risks involved for the various types of loans. Loans are held for purposes
other than trading.

Deposits -- The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest- and
noninterest-bearing demand, savings and money market savings) are equal to the
amounts payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).
Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash
flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
certificates to a schedule of aggregated monthly maturities.

Long-Term Debt -- Fair values of long-term debt are based on market prices
where available. When quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Corporation's
current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements.

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments -- Fair values for the Corporation's off-balance
sheet instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar
agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the
counterparties' credit standing for loan commitments and letters of credit, and
the estimated amount the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate or
replace the contract at current market rates for the remainder of the
off-balance sheet instruments. Off-balance sheet instruments classified as held
for trading purposes are described further in Note I, and those classified as
held for other than trading purposes are described further in Note J.

Many of the Corporation's assets and liabilities are short-term financial
instruments whose carrying amounts reported in the statement of condition
approximate fair value. These items include cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing bank balances, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, due from customers on acceptances, short-term
borrowed funds, acceptances outstanding, and the financial instruments included
in other assets and liabilities. The estimated fair values of the Corporation's
remaining on-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31 are
summarized below.

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, investment securities with a carrying value of
$4,011,111 and $3,543,263, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure
public deposits and for other purposes. There were no obligations of any one
issuer exceeding 10 percent of consolidated shareholders' equity at December
31, 1994.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115). FASB 115 requires that investments in
equity securities having readily determinable fair values and all investments
in debt securities be classified and accounted for in three categories.

Debt securities that management has the positive intent to hold to maturity are
classified as securities held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are
reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that are held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future are classified
as trading securities. Trading securities are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses included in earnings of ($177), $1,079 and
($13,792) in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Debt and equity securities not
classified as either held-to-maturity or trading are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of
shareholders' equity, net of tax.

</TABLE>

Loans totaling $13,051, $42,256 and $81,592 were transferred to foreclosed real
estate during 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

It is the policy of the Corporation to review each prospective credit in order
to determine an adequate level of security or collateral to obtain prior to
making the loan. The type of collateral will vary and ranges from liquid assets
to real estate. The Corporation's access to collateral, in the event of
borrower default, is assured through adherence to state lending laws and the
Corporation's sound lending standards and credit monitoring procedures. The
Corporation regularly monitors its credit concentrations on loan purpose,
industry and customer bases. At year-end, there were no significant credit
concentrations within these categories. For additional discussion related to
off-balance sheet credit issues, refer to Note I.

The Corporation's subsidiaries have granted loans and extended letters of
credit to certain directors and executive officers of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries and to their associates. The aggregate amount of loans was
$399,023 and $219,623 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. During 1994,
$557,328 in new loans was made, and repayments totaled $377,928. Outstanding
standby letters of credit to related parties totaled $34,934 and $28,183 at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Related party loans are made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated transactions
with unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of
collectibility.

Loans held for sale at December 31 along with activity during the period are
summarized as follows:

The Corporation will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (FASB 114), as of January 1,
1995. This standard modifies the accounting for impaired loans, defined as
those loans where, based on current information and events, it is probable that
a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Corporation believes the adoption
of FASB 114 will not have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations.

Note H -- Capital Stock

On April 1, 1993, a two-for-one common stock split, effected in the form of a
stock dividend, was paid to the Corporation's shareholders. Unless otherwise
noted, information in this note, as well as share and per share information
presented throughout the financial statements, has been restated to reflect the
effect of the stock split.

The authorized capital stock of the Corporation consists of 500,000,000 common
shares and 50,000,000 preferred shares. At December 31, 1994, 25,685,158 common
shares were reserved for the conversion of notes and for stock issuable in
connection with employee benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan.

On July 22, 1994, the Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 5 million shares of common stock, replacing an earlier
authorization for the same number of shares. Repurchased shares will be used
for various corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for the
corporation's employee benefit plans and dividend reinvestment plan. During the
year, the Corporation repurchased 1,620,900 shares pursuant to this and prior
year authorizations. At December 31, 1994, the number of shares available for
possible repurchase totaled 4,324,500.

At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 22, 1994, a new Wachovia
Corporation Stock Plan was approved. The 1994 officer plan awards 60,500 shares
of stock contingent upon the corporation's return on equity (ROE) over the
five-year period, 1994-1998. The 1994 director plan granting 3,500 shares is
not performance based and vests April 22, 1995.

The various stock option and incentive plans of the Corporation provide for the
granting of options or awards for the purchase or issuance of 10,625,004 shares
at 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant. A
committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of shares subject to
each option and the time or times when options shall be granted and exercised
and the duration of the exercise period, which in no case shall exceed ten
years. The committee also determines the number of awards to be granted and the
time or times when awards shall be granted and the period when awards are
deemed to be earned, with the exception of the 1994 officer plan in which
awards are earned based on the Corporation's ROE. Awards are exercised at no
cost to the participant. Under the 1994 plan, newly elected nonemployee
directors of the Corporation are granted a one-time award of 1,000 shares of
restricted stock to be earned over a period of three years. Also, an annual
award of 250 shares of restricted stock is granted to all nonemployee directors
to be earned over a period of one year.

At the time the options are exercised, the par value of all shares issued is
credited to common stock and the excess of the proceeds over the par value is
credited to capital surplus. At the time awards are granted, capital surplus is
credited and retained earnings debited for the fair market value of the awards.
When the stock awarded is issued, common stock is credited and capital surplus
is debited for the par value of the shares issued. Recipients of awards under
the predecessor plan are entitled to compensation equivalent to the dividends
that would have been payable on the proportion of the awards reserved but not
yet fully earned based on the years of service since the date of grant divided
by the number of years over which the award is deemed to be fully earned.

WACHOVIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note I -- Off-Balance Sheet Trading and Lending Activities

The Corporation maintains positions in a variety of financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its customers.
Financial instruments issued or held to accommodate customer lending activities
include unfunded commitments to extend credit, standby, commercial and similar
letters of credit, securities lending, participations in bankers' acceptances
and mortgage loans sold with recourse. In order to accommodate customer capital
management, interest rate risk management and international transaction
requirements, the Corporation engages in trading activities as a dealer by
structuring and executing over-the-counter interest rate contracts, commitments
to purchase or sell securities, and foreign exchange contracts. The Corporation
maintains active trading positions in foreign exchange forward contracts and
manages credit risk through the establishment of offsetting sell positions, as
well as standard limit and monitoring procedures. The Corporation maintains a
trading portfolio of interest rate swap and option (caps and floors) contracts
and foreign exchange options consisting of generally matched, offsetting
contracts with customers and market counterparties.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure
to credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
statements of financial condition. The Corporation follows the same credit
policies and careful underwriting practices in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. In those
instances where collateral is deemed necessary to support financial instruments
with credit risk, the Corporation ensures its ability to access the collateral,
in the event of borrower default, through strict adherence to corporate lending
policy and applicable state lending laws.

Derivative Financial Instruments Held or Issued for Trading Purposes -- The
amounts disclosed below represent the end of period fair value of derivative
financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes and the average
aggregate fair values during the year of those instruments. The Corporation's
credit exposure to off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments is
represented by the fair value gain of the instrument if a counterparty fails to
perform. Options written do not expose the Corporation to credit risk, except
to the extent of the underlying risk in the debt instrument that the
Corporation may be obligated to acquire under certain written put options. Caps
and floors written do not expose the Corporation to credit risk.

</TABLE>


Interest Rate Swaps -- These transactions generally involve the exchange of
fixed and floating rate payments without the exchange of the underlying
principal amounts. Payments made or received under swap contracts are accrued
on the basis of their contractual terms and are included in "other operating
income" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The related accrued amounts
receivable or payable to customers and counterparties are recorded as "other
assets or liabilities" in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Revenues
from the customer portfolio represent a small profit margin on intermediated
transactions. The difference in the fair value of the offsetting contracts is
not material.

The Corporation acts as principal in the exchange of interest payments between
parties, and therefore, is exposed to loss should one of the parties default.
The Corporation controls the credit risk of these instruments through adherence
to credit approval policies, monetary limits and monitoring procedures.
Entering into interest rate swap agreements involves not only credit risk but
also interest rate risk associated with unmatched positions. Notional principal
amounts are often used to express the volume of these transactions but do not
represent the much smaller amounts potentially subject to credit risk. These
amounts are derived by estimating the cost, on a present value basis, of
replacing outstanding agreements at current market rates. Contracts whose
present value estimates indicate fair value gains are those which customers and
market counterparties are exposed to the Corporation and for which the
Corporation has potential credit risk. The Corporation controls interest rate
risk inherent in the derivative trading portfolio by entering into offsetting
swap positions or by using other hedging techniques to manage risk.

At December 31, 1994, the weighted average maturity of pay-fixed swaps held in
the customer portfolio was 2.63 years and 2.66 years for receive-fixed swaps.
Under pay-fixed swap agreements, the Corporation was paying interest at a
weighted average fixed rate of 5.24% and was receiving interest at a weighted
average floating rate of 5.17% (based on year-end rates). Under receive-fixed
swap agreements, the Corporation was receiving interest at a weighted average
fixed rate of 5.48% and was paying interest at a weighted average floating rate
of 5.40% (based on year-end rates).

NOTE I -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRADING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES -- Continued

Interest Rate Caps and Floors -- These instruments are written by the
Corporation to enable its customers to transfer, modify, or reduce their
interest rate risk exposure. In a cap or floor contract, the purchaser pays a
premium at the initiation of the contract for the right to receive payments if
market interest rates are greater than the strike price of a cap or less than
the strike price of a floor. Payments made or received under cap or floor
contracts are accrued on the basis of their contractual terms and are included
in "other operating income" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Credit
risk and interest rate risk are managed through the oversight procedures
applied to other interest rate contracts, as well as through the purchase of
offsetting cap and floor positions. The present value of purchased caps and
floors in a gain position represent the potential credit risk to the
Corporation.

Commitments to Purchase and Sell Securities, Futures and Forward Contracts --
These instruments are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money
market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified
future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.
Commitments to purchase and sell securities, futures and forward contracts used
in securities trading operations are recognized currently at market value and
are included in "trading account profits (losses)" in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Risks arise in these transactions through the possible
inability of one of the counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and
from movements in interest rates or securities values. Risks associated with
these instruments are controlled through offsetting purchase and sell
positions, as well as oversight provided by organized exchanges, which
determine who may buy and sell such instruments.

Net Options Written to Purchase and Sell Foreign Exchange -- Forward
commitments involve the purchase or sale of foreign currency amounts for
delivery at a specified future date. Payments on forward commitments are
exchanged on the delivery date based upon the exchange rate in the contract.
Forward commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange are recognized at
market value and are included in "other operating income" in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The potential risks associated with these obligations
arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as potential
inability of the counterparty to perform under the contract. These risks are
mitigated through the establishment of offsetting sell positions, as well as
standard limit and monitoring procedures.

Foreign Exchange Options -- These agreements represent rights to purchase or
sell foreign currency at a predetermined price at a future date. The purchaser
pays a premium at the initiation of the contract for the right to exchange a
specified amount at the contract's exchange rate at the maturity of the option.
The Corporation maintains a portfolio of generally matched offsetting foreign
exchange options. Fluctuations in foreign currency markets, as well as the
potential default of the counterparty to an option contract, represent the
risks associated with these instruments. Limit and monitoring procedures along
with offsetting positions serve to control the risk associated with these
items. The fair value of foreign exchange options purchased serves to offset
the fair value of written options.

Revenues from the derivative trading portfolio are shown below.

</TABLE>

Commitments to Extend Credit -- These are legally binding contracts to lend to
a customer, so long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the contract. These commitments have fixed termination dates and generally
require payment of a fee. As most commitments expire prior to being drawn, the
amounts shown do not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the
contracts. Credit worthiness is evaluated on a case by case basis, and in some
instances, collateral is obtained to support the borrowing. The collateral held
may vary from liquid assets to real estate. At December 31, 1994 and 1993,
approximately 12% and 15%, respectively, of unfunded commitments to extend
credit were supported by collateral. Of the total unfunded commitment amounts
presented, approximately 22% in 1994 and 29% in 1993 were comprised of
cancelable credit card commitments, and approximately 9% in 1994 and 9% in 1993
were represented by real estate commitments. Also included in total unfunded
commitments were securities underwriting commitments of $880 in 1994 and $2,766
in 1993.

Standby, Commercial and Similar Letters of Credit -- These instruments are
conditional commitments issued by the Corporation guaranteeing the performance
of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are issued primarily to
support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
credit to customers and is subject to the Corporation's normal sound
underwriting process. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, approximately 4% and 6%,
respectively, of these instruments were supported by collateral. There were no
significant concentrations of letters of credit to any one group of borrowers
at either year-end.

Securities Lent -- These are securities of the Corporation and its customers
lent to third parties. Credit risk arises in these transactions through the
possible failure of the borrower to return the securities. To minimize this
risk, the Corporation evaluates the credit worthiness of the borrower on a case
by case basis, and collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the
contract amount of securities lent is obtained.

Participation in Bankers' Acceptances -- These instruments represent risk
participation in time drafts drawn by customers under a committed multibank
credit facility. These drafts have been accepted and remarketed by other
financial institutions. Under the terms of these arrangements, the Corporation
may be required to reimburse the accepting financial institution for the
Corporation's pro rata share of any payment default by the customer. The
Corporation applies the same underwriting standards in evaluating the credit
risk associated with these instruments as it does in evaluating on-balance
sheet instruments.

Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse -- The Corporation is obligated under
recourse provisions related to the sale of certain residential mortgages to the
Federal National Mortgage Association. These mortgages are collateralized by
1-4 family residential homes. All mortgage loans with original loan-to-value
ratios exceeding 80% (up to a maximum of 95%) have private mortgage insurance
coverage.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE J -- OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The Corporation manages its exposure to fluctuation in interest rates by
entering into interest rate swap, cap and floor contracts with financial
institution counterparties. The operations of the Corporation are subject to a
risk in interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference
between the amount of the Corporation's interest-earning assets and the amount
of interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice in specified periods.
The principal objective of the Corporation's asset/liability management
activities is to provide maximum levels of net interest income while
maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and
facilitating the funding needs of the Corporation. To achieve that objective,
the Corporation uses a combination of derivative financial instruments,
including interest rate swaps and options with indices that correlate to
on-balance sheet instruments to modify the repricing characteristics of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

The amounts disclosed below represent the end of period notional and fair value
of derivative financial instruments held for risk managment purposes. The
Corporation's credit exposure to off-balance sheet derivative financial
instruments is represented by the fair value gain of the instrument if a
counterparty fails to perform.

NOTE K -- INCOME TAXES

As of January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FASB
109), which requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for income
taxes. As permitted under FASB 109, prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.

The cumulative impact of adopting FASB 109 was a tax benefit of $2,700 or $.02
per fully diluted share, which is reflected in income tax expense for the year
ended December 31, 1993.

The provision for income taxes is summarized below. Included in these amounts
are income taxes related to securities transactions of $1,328, $7,472 and $470
in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Corporation made income tax payments
totaling $211,345 in 1994, $217,716 in 1993 and $151,948 in 1992.

The deferred tax provision for 1993 includes a benefit of $2,683 related to the
revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax asset for the increase in the
federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993.

The reasons for the difference between consolidated income tax expense and the
amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% in
1994 and 1993 and 34% in 1992 to income before taxes were as follows:

Under FASB 109, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Management believes that the Corporation will fully realize the net deferred
tax asset as of December 31, 1994 based on the Corporation's refundable taxes
from carryback years, as well as its current level of operating income.

The consolidated net deferred income tax asset amounted to $88,877 at December
31, 1992. The components of the provision for deferred income taxes for the
year ended December 31, 1992 are as follows:

NOTE L -- CASH, DIVIDEND, LOAN RESTRICTIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries enter
into agreements, or are subject to regulatory requirements, that result in
cash, debt and dividend restrictions. A summary of the most restrictive items
follows.

The Corporation's banking subsidiaries are required to maintain average reserve
balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve
balances for the year ended December 31, 1994 was approximately $428,507.

Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the banking subsidiaries also are
limited in the amount they may loan to their affiliates, including the
Corporation. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 10% and loans to all
affiliates may not exceed 20% of

the bank's capital, surplus and undivided profits (net assets) after adding
back the allowance for loan losses. Based on these limitations, approximately
$333,968 was available for loans to the Corporation at December 31, 1994.

The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of all
dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank's
net profits, as defined, for that year combined with its retained net profits
for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the banking
subsidiaries can distribute as dividends to the Corporation in 1995, without
the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, more than $495,813 plus an
additional amount equal to the banks' retained net profits for 1995 up to the
date of any dividend declaration.

As a result of the above dividend and loan restrictions, approximately
$2,283,072 of consolidated net assets of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries
at December 31, 1994 was restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the
form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

The subsidiaries of the Corporation are defendants in certain legal proceedings
arising in connection with their business. In the opinion of management and
general counsel, the ultimate resolution of those proceedings will result in no
material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial position and results of
operations. There are no known situations where the Corporation has an
environmental liability that will materially affect the financial position or
results of operations.

NOTE M -- PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Corporation maintains a defined benefit pension plan which covers
substantially all employees. The plan provides pension benefits that are based
upon the employee's length of credited service and final average compensation
as defined in the plan. The pension expense of the plan is determined using the
projected unit credit method. The Corporation's policy is to fund amounts
allowable for federal income tax purposes. The following table sets forth the
funded status of the Corporation's defined benefit pension plan and the amounts
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at December 31.

The Corporation also provides supplemental benefits to substantially all
employees through defined contribution plans designed to encourage participants
to save on a regular basis and to provide such participants with deferred
compensation and additional performance incentive. Total expense relating to
these plans, which represented the Corporation's matching and discretionary
contributions, was $16,131 in 1994, $22,767 in 1993 and $11,043 in 1992.
Employee participants may elect to contribute from 1% to 10% of base salary,
with the Corporation matching 50% of each participant's contribution up to a
maximum employer contribution of 3% of base salary. The plans provide for
additional contributions of up to 3% of salary in accordance with a
preestablished formula based on certain earnings performance criteria and also
for special discretionary employer contributions of up to 4% of each eligible
employee's base salary as approved annually by the Board of Directors.

During 1992, the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) of South Carolina
National Corporation repaid its outstanding indebtedness of $25,000 with
proceeds received from the sale of Wachovia common stock held by the ESOP.
Company contributions to the ESOP have been discontinued, and all remaining
shares of Wachovia common stock have been allocated to the ESOP participants.
Dividends paid on shares held by the ESOP totaled $443 in 1992. Interest
expense on ESOP debt amounted to $625 in 1992.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide certain health care benefits for
retired employees. Substantially all of the employees may become eligible for
these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the
Corporation or its subsidiaries. The benefits are provided through self-insured
plans administered by insurance companies whose premiums are based on the
claims paid during the year.

On January 1, 1993, the Corporation prospectively adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (FASB 106), which requires the
accrual of nonpension benefits as employees render service. Adoption of FASB
106 increased postretirement benefits expense in 1993 by $5,210 and, on an
after-tax basis, reduced net income by $3,235 or $.02 per fully diluted share.
Prior to 1993, the Corporation recognized the cost of providing these
retirement benefits by expensing the annual premiums or claims which were
$3,005 in 1992.

The liability for postretirement benefits is unfunded. The following table
presents the status of the plan as of December 31.

</TABLE>

The annual assumed rate of increase in health care costs used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 1994 is 8% for retirees under age 65 and 6% for
retirees age 65 and over. These rates are assumed to remain constant for each
of these categories of retirees for 1995 and thereafter. For 1993 reported
figures, the annual rate of increase in health care costs was assumed to be 16%
initially, decreasing to 14% for 1994, and gradually to 7% by 2007 and
remaining at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health
care cost trend rates by one percentage point would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for the plan as of December 31, 1994 and 1993
by $1,746 and $3,637, respectively, and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 and 1993
by $131 and $291, respectively. The discount rates used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 1994 and 1993
were 8.5% and 7.5%, respectively.

               In 1991, Wachovia Corporation merged with South Carolina
          National Corporation under an agreement providing for a tax-free
          exchange of .675 of a share of Wachovia Corporation common stock for
          each share of South Carolina National. As a result of the merger and
          special charges taken in the fourth quarter of 1991 to complete it,
          the corporation's net income per primary share was $1.34 in 1991
          compared with $2.05 in 1990.
               The Five-Year Total Return chart compares Wachovia, the S&P 500
          Index and the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) 50 Index in stock price
          appreciation and dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment, from the
          base period of year-end 1989 through December 31, 1994. The KBW 50
          Index is a market capitalization weighted measure of total return for
          50 money center and major regional banks. Wachovia's total return is
          based on stock prices and dividends per share of Wachovia Corporation
          prior to its merger with South Carolina National.
