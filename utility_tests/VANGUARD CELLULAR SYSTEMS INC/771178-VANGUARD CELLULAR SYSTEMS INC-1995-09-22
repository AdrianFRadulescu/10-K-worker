ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
        FINANCIAL CONDITION
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1993
     In 1994, the Company reclassified certain pass-through items previously
recognized as service revenue in its Statements of Operations to offset the
related cost of service expenses. These reclassified items relate to charges
associated with the Company's subscribers roaming into adjacent cellular
markets. Appropriate reclassifications have been made in each period presented
in the accompanying financial statements. These reclassifications were made to
conform the treatment in the Company's financial statements to the accounting
treatment common in the industry.
     Unless otherwise indicated all information in this report has been adjusted
for the Company's 3 for 2 stock split paid in the form of a stock dividend on
August 24, 1994.
     Service revenues increased by $47.5 million or 48% primarily as a result of
an 85% increase in the number of subscribers in majority owned markets to
approximately 245,000 as of December 31, 1994 as compared to the end of 1993.
Total net subscribers in the Company's majority owned markets increased by
112,700 during 1994 as compared to an increase of 40,000 in 1993. Of the total
increase during 1994, 98,300 net activations occurred in markets operated by the
Company in both periods while 14,400 of the net subscribers were attributable to
markets acquired by the Company during the year. The 146% growth rate of net
subscriber additions in markets operated in both periods is the result of an
increase in productivity by sales personnel which the Company believes has been
augmented by increased sales training, and the growing acceptance of cellular
communications. The growth in net subscriber additions also reflects the number
of agents in the Company's indirect distribution channels combined with moderate
economic growth in the Company's operating regions. Service revenues
attributable to the Company's own subscribers increased 52% during 1994 to
$110.1 million as compared to 1993 while service revenues from customers from
other cellular markets roaming into the Company's markets increased 37% to $36.3
million. When combining revenue from the Company's customers with roaming
revenue, overall average monthly revenue per subscriber, which is based upon
service fees for the period and averages of subscribers computed on a quarterly
basis, declined 8% to $70 for the year from $76 a year ago. Substantially all of
this decline was the result of the Company's subscriber growth rate exceeding
the rate of growth for roaming revenues.
     Cellular equipment revenues increased $8.6 million or 87% to $18.5 million
for 1994 as compared to $9.9 million for 1993. This increase was primarily due
to the 146% increase in 1994 of net subscriber additions in markets operated by
the Company in both periods. Cost of cellular equipment increased 123% to $29.9
million during 1994. The Company continued to sell telephones at or below cost
in response to competitive pressures and also continued the availability of its
rental program.
     Cost of service expenses decreased as a percentage of service fees from 15%
for 1993 to 14% in 1994. In many instances in 1994, the Company's customers who
roam into adjacent cellular markets were charged at rates consistent with those
rates the Company charges in its own markets rather than passing through higher
roaming rates customarily charged by many cellular carriers. This billing
practice, while creating a marketing advantage by providing the customer with a
broader virtual service area, has increased net costs related to the provision
of these services by approximately $7.5 million in 1994 as compared to
approximately $4.7 million during 1993. The rapid subscriber growth that has
occurred in the past year has made this larger virtual service area available to
significantly more customers which has caused greater net costs to be incurred
by the Company in connection with this billing practice. The Company is
continuing its efforts to reduce these costs through the negotiation of more
favorable roaming agreements with both wireline and non-wireline cellular
service providers. In addition, the continued negotiation of more favorable
interconnection agreements with local exchange carriers should contribute to
stability in cost of service as a percentage of service fees.
     General and administrative expenses increased 29% or $9.8 million during
1994 but decreased as a percentage of service fees to 30% from 35% in 1993.
These expenses declined as a percentage of service fees primarily as a result of
controlled increases of many overhead expenses resulting in higher utilization
of the Company's existing personnel and systems. General and administrative
expenses should continue to decline as a percentage of service fees as the
Company continues to add more subscribers without commensurate increases in
general and administrative overhead.
     Marketing and selling expenses increased 71% to $37.1 million during 1994
as compared to 1993 and as a percentage of service fees these expenses increased
to 25% from 22%. Marketing and selling expenses, including the net loss on
subscriber equipment, increased 93% to $48.5 million during 1994 as compared to
1993. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher rate of growth in
the net subscriber additions described above for 1994 as compared to 1993 and
the resulting increase
 
<PAGE>
in salaries and commissions. Marketing and selling expenses per net subscriber
addition, including the loss on cellular equipment, (excluding the number of
subscribers in acquired markets at the time of acquisition) declined 22% to $493
in 1994 from $629 during 1993.
     Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.1 million or 4% during 1994. The
primary reason for this decrease was that the Company changed the depreciable
lives of certain of its property and equipment to more closely approximate its
historical experience and the estimated useful lives of these assets. These life
changes affected assets representing approximately 30% of the cost of the
Company's depreciable assets. This change reduced depreciation expense and net
loss for 1994 by approximately $4.5 million or $0.12 per share. This effect of
the depreciable life changes was offset in part by approximately $63.0 million
and $21.0 of new property and equipment placed in service during 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
     Interest expense increased $6.7 million or 44% during 1994 as a result of
increased average borrowings of approximately $73.2 million and, to a lesser
extent, an increase in average interest rates charged.
     Net loss before extraordinary item decreased from $15.3 million or $0.40
per share in 1993 to $13.9 million or $0.36 per share in 1994. The decrease in
net loss per share was primarily attributable to an increase in "Operating Cash
Flow -- EBITDA" (income from operations before depreciation and amortization )
of $10.7 million or 42% to $35.9 million.
     In December 1994, the Company completed the closing of a $675 million
credit facility which refinanced its existing $390 million facility. In
connection with this refinancing, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of
$8.4 million ($0.22 per share), which represented the write-off of all
unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinanced facility. The
increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the extraordinary item and
increased interest expense described above as well as $3.5 million of other
expense in connection with accumulated legal fees and costs associated with the
resolution of pending litigation.
  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992
     Service fee revenues increased by $26.2 million or 36% primarily as a
result of a 43% increase in the number of subscribers in majority owned markets
to approximately 132,300 as of December 31, 1993. All of the increase in the
number of subscribers was due to subscriber growth in markets controlled by the
Company in both years. Total net subscribers in the Company's majority owned
markets increased by 40,000 during 1993 as compared to 23,100 during 1992. This
73% increase in the number of net subscriber additions was primarily
attributable to the same factors resulting in the increase for 1994 as described
above. Service fees attributable to the Company's own subscribers increased 38%
during 1993 to $72.4 million while service fees from customers from other
cellular markets roaming into the Company's markets increased 31% to $26.6
million. When combining revenue from the Company's customers with roaming
revenues, overall average monthly service revenue per subscriber decreased 1% to
$76 in 1993 from $77 in 1992.
     Cellular equipment revenues increased 66% to $9.9 million and cost of
cellular telephone equipment increased 77% to $13.4 million resulting in a net
loss on cellular equipment of $3.5 million.
     Cost of service expenses as a percentage of service fee revenues remained
constant at 15% for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992. The Company
estimates that its billing practice with respect to customers roaming into
adjacent markets increased cost of service by $4.7 million and $2.4 million in
1993 and 1992, respectively.
     General and administrative expenses increased 17% or $4.9 million but
decreased as a percentage of service fees to 35% from 40% in 1992. Increases in
the overall amount of expenses were primarily attributable to the same factors
resulting in the increase for 1994.
     Marketing and selling expenses increased 29% to $21.7 million during 1993,
but as a percentage of service fees, these expenses declined during 1993 to 22%
from 23% in 1992. The higher rate of growth in net subscriber additions
described above during 1993 and the resulting increase in salaries and
commissions contributed to the overall increase in marketing and selling
expenses. This increased growth rate in net subscriber additions combined with
an emphasis on shifting variable marketing costs to fixed also caused marketing
and selling expenses per net subscriber addition, including the net loss on
cellular equipment, to decline 21% to $629 from $799 in 1992.
     Depreciation and amortization increased $3.1 million or 14% during 1993 as
a result of approximately $39.2 million in new capital equipment being placed in
service during 1993 and 1992. As a percentage of service fees, depreciation and
amortization declined to 25% during 1993 from 30% during 1992.
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
     Interest expense decreased $788,000 or 5% during 1993 as the result of
declines in interest rates charged on borrowings partially offset by an increase
in average borrowings of approximately $20.0 million.
     Net loss before extraordinary item decreased from $26.7 million or $0.72
per share for the year ended December 31, 1992 to $15.3 million or $0.40 per
share in the 1993 period. The decrease in net loss per share was primarily due
to an increase in Operating Cash Flow-EBITDA.
     In April 1993, the Company completed the closing of a $290 million credit
facility (the "1993 Loan Agreement") which refinanced its existing $275 million
credit facility. In connection with the refinancing of the $275 million credit
facility, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $3.7 million $(0.10) per
share which represented the write-off of all unamortized deferred financing
costs related to that facility.
     Net loss decreased from $26.7 million or $0.72 per share for the year ended
December 31, 1992 to $19.0 million or $0.50 per share in 1993.
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company requires capital to acquire, construct, and expand its cellular
systems. The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of cellular
systems and properties as well as other investment opportunities. In addition,
although the primary buildout of its cellular system is complete, the Company
will continue to construct additional cell sites and purchase cellular equipment
to increase capacity as subscribers are added and usage increases, to expand
geographic coverage and to provide for increased portable usage.
     The specific capital requirements of the Company will depend primarily on
the timing and size of any additional acquisitions and other investments as well
as property and equipment needs associated with the rate of subscriber growth.
Operating Cash Flow (or EBITDA) has been a significant source of internal
funding in recent years, but the Company does not expect Operating Cash Flow to
grow sufficiently to meet both its property and equipment and debt service
requirements for at least the next two years. In recent years, the Company has
met its capital requirements primarily through bank financing and private
issuances of its Class A Common Stock.
   
     Operating Cash Flow does not represent and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income or operating income as determined by generally
accepted accounting principles. It should not be considered in isolation from
other measures of performance according to such principles, including operating
results and cash flows. Operating Cash Flow increased from $25.3 million in 1993
to $35.9 million in 1994 whereas net cash provided by operating activities as
shown on the Statement of Cash Flows decreased from $8.6 million in 1993 to $2.3
million in 1994. Net cash provided by operating activities in 1994 reflects a
$6.7 million increase in interest expense, attributable primarily to increased
borrowings, as well as increases in working capital items. Financing activities,
primarily proceeds from long-term debt less principal repayments related to
refinancings, of $100.3 million in 1994 and $31.0 million in 1993 provided
substantially all of the net cash used in investing activities. Investing
activities, primarily purchases of property and equipment and payments for
acquisitions, used net cash of $105.9 million in 1994 and $40.0 million in 1993.
    
     1994 CREDIT FACILITY. On December 23, 1994, the Company completed the
closing of a $675 million credit facility, pursuant to an Amended and Restated
Loan Agreement (the "1994 Credit Facility"), with various lenders led by The
Toronto-Dominion Bank and The Bank of New York. The 1994 Credit Facility
provides the Company with additional financial and operating flexibility and
enables the Company to accelerate its cellular network buildout and pursue
business opportunities that may arise in the future. The 1994 Credit Facility
refinanced the 1993 Loan Agreement. The 1993 Loan Agreement closed in April 1993
and refinanced the Company's previously existing credit facility.
     The 1994 Credit Facility consists of a "Term Loan" and a "Revolving Loan."
The Term Loan, in the amount of $325 million, was used to repay the Company's
borrowings under the 1993 Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loan, in the amount of
up to $350 million, is available for capital expenditures, to make acquisitions
of and investments in cellular and other wireless communication interests, and
for other general corporate purposes.
     As security for borrowings under the 1994 Credit Facility, the Company has
pledged substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets and future cash
flows. Among other restrictions, the 1994 Credit Facility restricts the payment
of cash dividends, limits the use of borrowings, limits the creation of
additional long-term indebtedness and requires the maintenance of certain
financial ratios. The requirements of the 1994 Credit Facility were established
in relation to the Company's projected capital needs and projected results of
operations and cash flow. These requirements generally were designed to require
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
continued improvement in the Company's operating performance such that its
Operating Cash Flow -- EBITDA would be sufficient to continue servicing the debt
as repayments are required. The Company is in compliance with all loan
covenants.
     As of December 31, 1994, $348.5 million had been borrowed under the 1994
Credit Facility. Under the restrictive covenants of the facility, future
borrowing availability generally increases as the Company's operating
performance improves. The Company does not expect these covenants to curtail
planned borrowings. As of December 31, 1994, the most restrictive of these
convenants would limit available borrowings during the first quarter of 1995 to
$210.3 million.
     The outstanding amount of the Term Loan as of March 30, 1998 is to be
repaid in increasing quarterly installments commencing on March 31, 1998 and
terminating at its maturity date of December 31, 2003. The quarterly installment
payments begin at 1.875% of the outstanding principal amount at March 30, 1998
and gradually increase to 5.625% at March 31, 2003. The available borrowings
under the Revolving Loan shall be reduced on a quarterly basis also commencing
on March 31, 1998 and terminating on December 31, 2003. The quarterly reduction
begins at 1.875% of the Revolving Loan Commitment at March 30, 1998 and
gradually increases to 5.625% on March 31, 2003.
     The Term Loan and the Revolving Loan bear interest at a rate equal to the
Company's choice of the Prime Rate or Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin
based upon a leverage ratio for the most recent fiscal quarter. As of December
31, 1994 the leverage ratio, which is computed as the ratio of Total Debt (as
defined) to Adjusted Cash Flow (as defined), was at such a level as to cause the
applicable margins on the borrowings to be 0.375% and 1.625% per annum for the
Prime Rate and Eurodollar Rate, respectively.
     ACQUISITIONS. The Company completed several acquisitions in 1994 and early
1995. On April 26, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of the Altoona,
PA MSA and the Chambersburg, PA (PA-10) RSA, which are contiguous to its
Mid-Atlantic Supersystem in exchange for $4.4 million in cash, the exchange of
the Hagerstown, MD cellular market and the Company's minority ownership interest
in one cellular market.
     The Company purchased in October 1994, for $6.9 million in cash and $3.3
million in the Company's Class A Common Stock, the Washington, Maine (ME-4) RSA
and three of the four counties of the Mason, West Virginia (WV-1) RSA. The Maine
RSA is approximately 40 miles north of the Portland, Maine MSA, which is already
operated by the Company. The West Virginia RSA is contiguous to the Company's
Charleston, West Virginia MSA.
     On December 14, 1994, the Company purchased the Binghamton, New York MSA
and the Elmira, New York MSA ("Binghamton/Elmira Transaction") for a purchase
price of approximately 1.8 million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock
and $6.1 million in cash borrowed under the 1993 Loan Agreement, subject to
post-closing adjustments. These markets are contiguous to the Company's
Mid-Atlantic Supersystem.
     All markets that have been acquired as of December 31, 1994 are operational
cellular systems. Condensed pro forma financial information for these markets as
of December 31, 1994 is contained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements.
     In January 1995, the Company purchased the Union, Pennsylvania (PA-8) RSA
for a cash price of $51.3 million with borrowings under its 1994 Credit
Facility. The PA-8 RSA lies in the center of the Company's Mid-Atlantic
Supersystem.
     GEOTEK COMMUNICATIONS, INC.. In February 1994, the Company purchased for
$30.0 million from Geotek Communications, Inc. (Geotek), 2.5 million shares of
Geotek common stock and received options to invest up to $167.0 million for an
aggregate of 10 million shares. Geotek is a telecommunications company that is
developing an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) wireless communications
network in the United States based on its proprietary Frequency Hopping Multiple
Access (FHMA) digital technology. Geotek's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ
National Market System.
     The options received by the Company were issued in three series as follows:
(i) Series A for 2 million shares at $15 per share; (ii) Series B for 2 million
shares at $16 per share; and (iii) Series C for 3 million shares at $17 per
share and 3 million shares at $18 per share. All options are immediately
exercisable. The Series A options expire upon the commercial validation (as
defined) of Geotek's first ESMR system using FHMA (the Series A Expiration
Date). The series B and Series C options expire 1 year and 2 years,
respectively, after the Series A Expiration Date. However, the Company may
extend the Series B and Series C options by six months and the Series C options
by an additional six months and, if any portion of any series of options
expires, all unexercised options expire immediately.
     The Company has also entered into a five-year management consulting
agreement to provide operational and marketing support in exchange for 300,000
shares of Geotek common stock per year. However, should any portion of the
Series A, B or
                                       4
 
<PAGE>
C options expire, the management consulting agreement is immediately terminated.
During 1994, approximately 250,000 shares were earned under this management
agreement.
     If all options are exercised and all shares are earned and received under
the management consulting agreement, the Company would own an aggregate of
approximately 20% of Geotek's common stock on a fully diluted basis. Under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", which are effective for
1994, this investment is classified as "available for sale". As such, the
investment is recorded at its market value and any unrealized gains or losses
are recognized as a separate component of shareholders' equity, but do not
affect results of operations.
     The Company funded its initial $30.0 million investment in Geotek using
borrowings under the 1993 Loan Agreement. The 1994 Credit Facility permits
borrowings to fund the exercise of approximately $30.0 million of these options
but requires a waiver for borrowings to exercise additional amounts. If such a
waiver was not granted the Company would require other sources of financing to
exercise the remaining options.
   
     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. As of December 1994, the Company had approximately
$184.0 million of property and equipment placed in service. The Company
historically has incurred capital expenditures primarily based upon capacity
needs in its existing markets resulting from continued subscriber growth. During
1994, the Company initiated a plan to double the number of cell sites in order
to increase geographic coverage and provide for additional portable usage in the
Company's cellular markets. As a result of this accelerated network buildout and
the continued growth of the Company's subscriber base, capital expenditures were
approximately $63.0 million during 1994. During 1995, the Company plans to
accelerate this buildout further. Capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated to
be approximately $130 million and are expected to be funded primarily with
proceeds from the 1994 Credit Facility. Approximately $100 million of these
planned capital expenditures will be for cellular telephone systems and the
remainder primarily for cellular phones held for rental and office equipment and
furniture and other similar assets.
    
     CASH FLOW GOALS. Operating Cash Flow improved $10.7 million to $35.9
million during 1994. The Company's primary goal over the next several years will
be to maximize operating cash flow. In order to do so the Company must minimize
decreases in monthly revenue per subscriber and continue to have rapid
subscriber growth with low incremental marketing and sales costs.
     The Company believes its business strategy and sales force will generate
continued net subscriber growth and that its focus on higher revenue customers,
principally business users, will assist in supporting revenue per subscriber.
The Company has substantially completed the development of its managerial,
administrative and marketing functions, as well as the primary buildout of the
cellular networks in its existing markets, and believes that the rate of service
fee growth will exceed the rate of growth of operating expenses.
     Although there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing growth goals
will be achieved, the Company believes that its internally generated funds and
its available bank lines of credit will be sufficient during the next several
years to complete its planned network expansion and acquisitions, to fund
operating expenses and debt service described above and to provide flexibility
to pursue business opportunities that might arise in the future.
  INFLATION
     The Company believes that inflation affects its business no more than it
generally affects other similar businesses.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION
     Vanguard Cellular Systems, Inc. (Vanguard) (a North Carolina corporation)
is a provider of cellular telephone service to various markets throughout the
eastern United States. The activities of Vanguard, its wholly owned subsidiaries
and its majority owned cellular entities (collectively referred to as the
Company) include acquiring interests in entities which have been granted
nonwireline Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permits to construct or
authorizations to operate cellular telephone systems, and constructing and
operating cellular telephone systems.
     All of the Company's cellular entities operate under the trade name of
CELLULARONE(Register mark), which is the trade name many nonwireline carriers
have adopted to provide conformity throughout the industry. The trade name is
owned by a partnership in which the Company holds a minority ownership interest.
NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vanguard, its
wholly owned subsidiaries and the entities in which it has a majority ownership
interest. Investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but
does not exercise control through majority ownership have been accounted for
using the equity method of accounting. Investments in which the Company does not
exercise significant influence or control through majority ownership have been
accounted for using the cost method of accounting. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
  CELLULAR TELEPHONE INVENTORIES
     Inventories, consisting primarily of cellular telephones held for resale,
are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.
  INVESTMENTS
     INVESTMENTS IN CELLULAR ENTITIES -- Investments in cellular entities
consist of the costs incurred to acquire FCC licenses or interests in entities
that have been awarded FCC licenses to provide cellular service, and capital
contributions to unconsolidated cellular entities. Acquisition costs, referred
to as deferred cellular license acquisition costs, consist primarily of amounts
paid for the acquisition of ownership interests and payments of other
acquisition related expenses, net of the Company's share of the fair value of
the net assets acquired. Exchanges of minority ownership interests in cellular
entities are recorded based on the fair value of the ownership interests
acquired.
     The Company recognizes its pro rata share of the net income or losses
generated by the unconsolidated cellular entities carried on the equity method.
     OTHER INVESTMENTS -- Other investments consist of the market value of the
Company's investment in Geotek Communications, Inc. and the cost of the
Company's investment in International Wireless Communications, Inc.
  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes over the following
estimated useful lives:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
NOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES -- CONTINUED
     Effective January 1, 1994, the Company changed the depreciable lives of
certain of its property and equipment to more closely approximate its historical
experience and the useful lives of these assets. These life changes affected
assets representing approximately 30% of the cost of the Company's depreciable
assets. This change reduced depreciation expense and net loss for 1994 by
approximately $4,500.
     At December 31, 1994 and 1993, construction in progress was composed
primarily of the cost of uncompleted additions to the Company's cellular
telephone systems in majority owned cellular markets. The Company capitalized
interest costs of $684, $188 and $188 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, as
part of the cost of cellular telephone systems.
     Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations as
incurred. Gains or losses at the time of disposition of property and equipment
are reflected in the statements of operations currently.
     Cellular telephones are rented to certain customers generally with a
contract for a minimum stipulated length of service. Such customers have the
option to purchase the cellular telephone at any time during the term of the
agreement.
  OTHER ASSETS
     Other assets include deferred financing costs (Note 4) which are being
amortized over the period of the related agreements. Amortization of $1,196,
$953 and $709 has been included in interest expense in the accompanying December
31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 Statements of Operations, respectively. In addition,
payments related to agreements not to compete in certain cellular markets are
being amortized over the period of the related agreements. Amortization expense
relating to these agreements of $160, $1,325 and $1,316 has been included in the
accompanying December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 Statements of Operations,
respectively. Other assets also include $4,200 allocated to the acquired
customer bases in connection with the acquisitions of the Binghamton and Elmira
MSAs which occured in December 1994.
  REVENUE RECOGNITION
     Service fees are recognized at the time cellular services are provided and
service fees related to prebilled services are not recognized until earned.
Cellular telephone equipment revenues consist primarily of sales of cellular
telephones to subscribers and are recognized at the time equipment is delivered
to the subscriber.
  INCOME TAXES
     In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The
Company adopted this Statement effective January 1, 1993. The effect of the
change in accounting on the Company's financial position and results of
operations is immaterial.
  NET LOSS PER SHARE
     Net loss per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options have not been included
in the calculation of net loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.
  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
     Additional required disclosures of noncash investing and financing
activities for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 are as follows:

  RECLASSIFICATION
     Certain amounts in the 1993 and 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation. The Company reclassified
certain direct pass through items previously recognized as service revenue in
its Statements of Operations to cost of service expenses to conform with
industry practice. These reclassified items relate to charges associated with
the Company's subscribers roaming into adjacent cellular markets. The
reclassification has had no effect on the Company's net loss or net loss per
share.

interests ranging from 0.3% to 18.3%. The Company holds these ownership
interests for investment purposes.
Other Investments
  GEOTEK COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
     In February 1994, the Company purchased for $30,000 from Geotek
Communications, Inc. (Geotek) 2,500,000 shares of Geotek common stock and
options to invest up to $167,000 for an aggregate of 10,000,000 additional
shares. Geotek is a telecommunications company that is developing an Enhanced
Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) wireless communications network in the United
States based on its Frequency Hopping Multiple Access digital technology (FHMA).
Geotek's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market System.
     The options purchased by the Company were issued in three series as
follows: (i) Series A for 2,000,000 shares at $15 per share; (ii) Series B for
2,000,000 shares at $16 per share; and (iii) Series C for 3,000,000 shares at
$17 per share and 3,000,000 shares at $18 per share. All options are exercisable
immediately. The Series A options expire upon the commercial validation (as
defined) of Geotek's first SMR system using FHMA (the Series A Expiration Date).
The Series B and Series C options expire 1 year and 2 years, respectively, after
the Series A Expiration Date. However, the Company may extend the Series B and
Series C options by six months and the Series C options by an additional six
months and, if any portion of any series of options expires, all unexercised
options expire immediately.
     The Company has also entered into a 5-year management consulting agreement
to provide operational and marketing support in exchange for 300,000 shares of
Geotek common stock per year. However, should any portion of the Series A, B or
C options expire, the management consulting agreement is immediately terminated.
The Company recognized revenues of $2,496 related to the provision of management
consulting services to Geotek during 1994.
     As of December 31, 1994, the Company has purchased or earned under the
management consulting agreement approximately 2,750,000 shares of Geotek common
stock representing approximately 5.5% of Geotek's outstanding shares. If all
options are exercised and all shares are earned and received under the
management consulting agreement, the Company would own an aggregate of
approximately 20% of Geotek's common stock on a fully diluted basis.

     On December 23, 1994, the Company completed the closing of a $675 million
credit facility, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the "1994
Credit Facility"), with various lenders led by The Toronto-Dominion Bank and The
Bank of New York.
     The 1994 Credit Facility is available to provide the Company with
additional financial and operating flexibility and enable it to pursue business
opportunities that may arise in the future. The 1994 Credit Facility refinanced
the Company's then existing $390 million credit facility (the "1993 Loan
Agreement"). The 1993 Loan Agreement closed in April 1993 and refinanced the
Company's previously existing credit facility. In connection with the
refinancings, the Company recorded

extraordinary losses of $8,402 ($0.22 per share) in 1994 and $3,715 ($0.10 per
share) in 1993, which represented the write-offs of all unamortized deferred
financing costs related to the refinanced facilities.
     The 1994 Credit Facility consists of a "Term Loan" and a "Revolving Loan."
The Term Loan, in the amount of $325,000, was used to repay the Company's
borrowings under the 1993 Loan Agreement. The Revolving Loan, in the amount of
up to $350,000, is available for capital expenditures, to make acquisitions of
and investments in cellular and other wireless communication interests, and for
other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 1994, $326,500 was
available for future expenditures under the Revolving Loan, as amended.
     The outstanding amount of the Term Loan as of March 30, 1998 is to be
repaid in increasing quarterly installments commencing on March 31, 1998 and
terminating at the maturity date of December 31, 2003. The quarterly installment
payments begin at 1.875% of the outstanding principal amount at March 30, 1998
and gradually increase to 5.625% at March 31, 2003. The available borrowings
under the Revolving Loan shall be reduced on a quarterly basis also commencing
on March 31, 1998 and terminating on December 31, 2003. The quarterly reduction
begins at 1.875% of the Revolving Loan commitment at March 30, 1998 and
gradually increases to 5.625% on March 31, 2003. The outstanding borrowings
under the Term Loan are due and the Revolving Loan commitment is reduced
quarterly as follows:

</TABLE>
 
     The Term Loan and the Revolving Loan bear interest at a rate equal to the
Company's choice of the Prime Rate or Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin
based upon a leverage ratio for the most recent fiscal quarter. The ranges for
this applicable margin are 0.0% to 1.375% for the Prime Rate and 1.125% to
2.625% for the Eurodollar Rate. As of December 31, 1994 the leverage ratio,
which is computed as the ratio of Total Debt (as defined) to Adjusted Cash Flow
(as defined), was at such a level as to cause the applicable margins on the
borrowings to be 0.375% and 1.625% per annum for the Prime Rate and Eurodollar
Rate, respectively. At December 31, 1994, the Company's effective interest rate
on its outstanding borrowings was 8.875%.
     As security for borrowings under the 1994 Credit Facility, the Company has
pledged substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets and future cash
flows. Among other restrictions, the credit facility restricts the payment of
cash dividends, limits the use of borrowings, limits the creation of additional
long-term indebtedness and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios.
The Company is in compliance with all loan covenants.
     The Company maintains interest rate swaps and interest rate caps which
provide protection against interest rate risk. At year-end the Company had
interest rate cap agreements in place covering a notional amount of $270,000.
The interest rate cap agreements provide protection to the extent that LIBOR
exceeds 5.5% through July 1995 or 9.0% through December 1997. The total cost of
these interest rate cap agreements of $687 has been recorded in other assets in
the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the lives of the
agreements as a component of interest expense.
     Additionally, the Company maintains interest rate swap agreements that fix
the LIBOR interest rate at 6.9% on a notional amount of $100,000 through June
1995 and 6.1% on a notional amount of $210,000 through March 1995. Under these
swap agreements, the Company benefits if LIBOR interest rates increase above the
fixed rates and incurs additional

interest expense if rates remain below the fixed rates. Any amounts received or
paid under these agreements are reflected as interest expense over the period
covered.
     The fair value of these interest rate protection agreements is estimated to
be $1,800 and reflects the quoted market value of these contracts at December
31, 1994. The effect of interest rate protection agreements on the operating
results of the Company was to increase interest expense by $95, $884 and $2,510
in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
NOTE 5: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
  OPERATING LEASES
     The Company leases office space, furniture, equipment, vehicles and land
under noncancelable operating leases expiring through 2019. As of December 31,
1994, the future minimum rental payments under these lease agreements having an
initial or remaining term in excess of one year were as follows:

     Rent expense under operating leases was $4,178, $3,461 and $3,242, for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
  CONSTRUCTION AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
     Capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated to be approximately $130,000
for the Company, and are expected to be funded primarily with proceeds from the
1994 Credit Facility (Note 4).
  LITIGATION
     In June 1989, a suit was filed by a group of former partners in the San
Juan Cellular Settlement Partnership which alleged that the Company and two of
its officers breached fiduciary duties and acted fraudulently in connection with
settlement of licensing proceedings concerning the San Juan, PR market and
certain other markets. The Company settled this litigation with all plaintiffs
and such amounts are included in the accompanying financial statements.
     Additionally, the Company is involved in various other legal proceedings
arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the
outcome of the above legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
NOTE 6: INCOME TAXES
     As of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS
109"). SFAS 109 requires recognition of future tax benefits, to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not, attributable to deductible
temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of
assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards. The adoption
of SFAS 109 did not impact the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

     The valuation allowance of $57,880 as of December 31, 1993 was provided
because, in the Company's assessment, it was uncertain whether the net deferred
tax assets would be realized. In addition, because of its continuing assessment
that it is uncertain whether the net deferred tax assets will be realized, the
Company increased the valuation allowance during 1994 by $3,552 to offset the
1994 net deferred tax benefit.
    
     For Federal income tax reporting purposes, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $315,000 at December 31, 1994. These losses
may be used to reduce future taxable income, if any, and expire through 2009.
These carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation in the future in
accordance with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The primary differences between the
accumulated deficit for financial reporting purposes and the income tax loss
carryforwards relate to the differences in the treatment of certain deferred
cellular license acquisition costs, certain gains on dispositions of cellular
interests, partnership losses, depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and
compensation earned under the stock compensation plan.
     Of the total net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $79,000
relates to additional deductions arising from restricted stock bonuses, stock
options and stock purchase warrants. To the extent that the benefit of these
carryforwards is realized in future years, the tax benefit will be recorded
directly to additional capital in excess of par.
NOTE 7: CAPITAL STOCK
  COMMON STOCK
     In July 1994, the Board of Directors declared a 3 for 2 stock split of the
Company's Class A common stock which was effected in the form of a dividend paid

offered in connection with the acquisition of entities which have received or
may receive an authorization or license from the FCC to provide cellular
service. Through December 31, 1994, 2,707,957 shares of Class A common stock
have been issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of the PA-12, PA-11, PA-5,
WV-1, and ME-4 RSAs, and the Binghamton and Elmira MSAs.

     During 1989, the Board adopted the 1989 Stock Option Plan (the 1989 Plan).
Under the provisions of the 1989 Plan, the Company may grant up to 3,000,000
shares of the Company's Class A common stock to officers and key employees in
the form of nonqualified or incentive stock options. Nonqualified stock options
must require exercise prices of not less than the fair market value of the
Company's Class A common stock on the date of the grant. As of December 31,
1994, 586,417 shares were available for future grants.
     During 1994, the Board adopted the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 1994
Plan). Under the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the Company may grant up to
3,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock to officers, directors
and key employees in the form of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock and
performance shares. All stock options must require exercise prices of not less
than the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of
the grant, except that certain incentive stock options must require exercise
prices of not less than 110% of fair market value of the Company's Class A
common stock on the date of the grant. As of December 31, 1994, 2,250,000 shares
were available for future grants.
     Options granted under the Plans may not have a term greater than ten years
from the date of grant and are not transferable except upon death.
  RESTRICTED STOCK BONUSES
     During 1987, the Board granted restricted stock bonuses for a total of
3,469,554 shares of Class A common stock (i) to three key officers for 1,077,768
shares each and (ii) to a director and a key employee for an aggregate of
236,250 shares. In the event of a change in control of the Company prior to
December 31, 1998, the participants will be reimbursed for certain individual
income tax payments, as defined, on the shares vesting after February 1991. As
of December 31, 1994, all of the shares have vested.
  STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
     Stock purchase warrants for 150,000 shares at a price of $8.00 per share
were exercised in 1992, and as of December 31, 1994, the Company has no
outstanding stock purchase warrants.
  STOCK OPTIONS
     Under the terms of the Company's Stock Compensation Plans, the Board has
granted incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options requiring
exercise prices approximating the fair market value of the Company's Class A
common stock on the date of the grant.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Vanguard Cellular Systems, Inc.:
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vanguard
Cellular Systems, Inc. (a North Carolina corporation) and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Vanguard Cellular Systems,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
     Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to
financial statements and schedule is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. The schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
