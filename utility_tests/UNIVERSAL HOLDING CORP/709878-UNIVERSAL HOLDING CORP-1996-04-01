                                     PART I

ITEM 1--BUSINESS

GENERAL

     The Company is an insurance holding company, the principal subsidiaries of
which are American Progressive Life and Health Insurance Company of New York
("American Progressive") and American Pioneer Life Insurance Company ("American
Pioneer"), each of which sells life insurance, accident & health insurance and
annuity products, and WorldNet Services Corp. ("WorldNet"), a service firm that
provides managed care, claims adjudication and communications services to
insurance companies and affinity groups.

     The Company, a New York corporation, was formed in 1981 for the purpose of
owning and operating John Adams Life Insurance Company of New York ("John
Adams"). In July 1988, Barasch Associates Limited Partnership ("BALP") invested
$2,000,000 in the Company and acquired operating control, with certain
principals of BALP being elected to key executive positions in the Company and
John Adams. See "Management".

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY ACQUISITIONS

     In May 1991, the Company, through John Adams, acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of American Progressive, into which John Adams then
merged on June 27, 1991, with American Progressive as the surviving company.
American Progressive was acquired from Midland National Life Insurance Company
("Midland") for (a) a cash payment of $4,197,231, and (b) 510,000 shares ($10
par value) of the Company's Series A cumulative, redeemable, convertible
preferred stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), for a total purchase price of
$9,297,231. American Progressive's statutory book value immediately prior to
acquisition was approximately $9,200,000, its adjusted statutory book value
(book value plus AVR) was approximately $9,290,000, and its GAAP stockholder's
equity was approximately $9,700,000. As of December 31, 1995, the adjusted
statutory book value was approximately $9,256,000 and the GAAP stockholder's
equity was approximately $26,442,058. American Progressive, domiciled in New
York and licensed in 32 other states, historically concentrated on the sale of
individual accident & health insurance products primarily in New York and the
northeastern United States.

     In May 1993, American Progressive acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
American Pioneer, based in Orlando, Florida, which sold life and accident &
health insurance in 32 states, primarily in the southeast. American Pioneer's
parent, American Pioneer Savings and Loan Association, had been under the
control of the Resolution Trust Company ("RTC") since May 1990. American Pioneer
had a statutory book value of approximately $7,325,000, an adjusted statutory
book value of approximately $7,472,000, and a GAAP stockholder's equity of
approximately $14,367,000 when it was purchased by American Progressive for
$6,827,000 in cash. By December 31, 1995, American Pioneer's adjusted statutory
book value had increased to approximately $13,815,000 and its GAAP stockholder's
equity was $16,092,649.

         As of January 1, 1994, American Progressive acquired by means of
reinsurance a block of supplemental health insurance with annualized premiums of
approximately $1,200,000. In this transaction, American Progressive assumed all
liability under the reinsured policies incurred after January 1, 1994, in
exchange for its receipt from the ceding company of cash equal to the unearned
premium and active lives reserves on the reinsured business, net of a $60,000
ceding commission, and future premium payments from the insureds.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

     The Company has implemented, and plans to continue to pursue, the following
strategies:

     Internal Growth

     The Company has focused its efforts to reach narrow segments of the
insurance market as defined by product or by geography. These include:

     o    Life and accident & health products designed for the senior market; 

     o    Life insurance for middle-income earners;

                                        2

<PAGE>



     o    Specialty group accident and health products sold to employers,
          including dental and short term disability;

     o    Annuities.

     The Company seeks to distribute its products through independent marketing
organizations paid on a variable cost basis. The Company is able to attract
these organizations by providing a high level of service and accessibility of
management, and by providing specially designed products to enable them to
distinguish themselves in the marketplace.

     External Growth

     In the past four years, the Company has successfully acquired and
integrated two insurance companies and three blocks of business that will
increase the overall profitability of the Company and the Company continues to
seek out further acquisitions.

PRODUCTS

     Life Insurance and Annuities

     The Company, through its Insurance Subsidiaries, underwrites the following
life insurance, annuities and accident & health insurance products:

          Life Insurance: The Company sells whole life, universal life, and term
     life insurance. All policies are non-participating.

          Annuities: The Company sells Single Premium Deferred Annuities and
     Flexible Premium Deferred Annuities. All of the Company's annuity products
     provide minimum interest rate guarantees. The minimum guaranteed rates on
     the Company's annuity products currently range from 4.5% to 5.5% annually
     and the contracts are designed to permit the Company to change the
     crediting rates annually subject to the minimum guaranteed rate. The
     Company takes into account the profitability of its annuity business and
     its relative competitive position in determining the frequency and extent
     of changes to the interest crediting rates.

     Policyholders of annuity and life insurance products marketed and issued by
the Company enjoy certain income tax advantages as compared to holders of
certain other savings investments such as certificates of deposit and taxable
bonds.

     One important tax advantage is that policyholders generally are not subject
to federal income tax on increases in the value of an annuity or life insurance
contract until some form of distribution is made from the contract, instead of
the current taxation of all accrued earnings that is imposed on many other
savings investments. Another important tax advantage is that life insurance
death benefits are generally exempt from federal income taxes and may be
structured so as to be free from federal estate taxes. A further federal tax
benefit is that when regular annuity payments are paid under an annuity
contract, a portion of each payment may be treated as a nontaxable return of the
investment in the contract.

     The Company also sells certain annuities that offer the tax advantages
provided by Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Tax Code"), which are known as tax-sheltered Section 403(b) annuities. The
tax-sheltered Section 403(b) annuity offered by the Company is a retirement
savings plan vehicle through which educators and employees of certain
not-for-profit institutions are permitted under Section 403(b) of the Tax Code
to defer income through a salary reduction program. Purchasing a tax-sheltered
annuity under Section 403(b) is similar to contributing to a Section 401(k)
plan, but with different (and somewhat more favorable) rules on the maximum
amount of current income which may be contributed by the participant on a
pre-tax basis. Generally, a participant may elect to defer a percentage, limited
by statute, of included compensation, subject to a maximum of approximately
$9,500 per year, under a Section 403(b) plan. This limit can be higher under
certain circumstances.

     The following table sets forth a summary of life premium revenues and
annuity considerations on first year and renewal basis for the last three years
ended December 31, 1995, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting
principles ("SAP"). These amounts differ from the premiums reported in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations, since under GAAP, the annuity
and universal life insurance policies are reported under the

     Accident & Health Insurance

     The Company's accident & health insurance products are sold on both
individual and group bases. The individual products currently marketed include
Medicare supplement, hospital indemnity, home health care, long term care and
major medical and hospital. The group products offered are dental insurance
issued by American Pioneer, and New York State Disability Insurance ("DBL") by
American Progressive. Much of the Company's accident & health insurance is
written as coverages which do not pay hospital or medical expenses, but rather
provide cash indemnity or income replacement. These coverages are referred to by
the Company as "supplemental" accident & health policies and are not to be
confused with Medicare supplement policies.

     The Medicare supplement policies offered by both Insurance Subsidiaries are
on plans A, B, C and F and are underwritten on a simplified issue basis, except
that the policies sold in New York are on a guaranteed issue basis, subject to
the community rating laws of that state. See "Regulation--Health Care Reform".

     Hospital indemnity policies are offered by American Progressive, on a
guaranteed issue basis for ages over 59, and pay benefits up to $150 per day for
hospitalization, with a maximum benefit period for any one cause of illness of
365 days.

     Major medical and hospital policies are sold by American Pioneer under
intensive underwriting guidelines. These policies have deductibles on a per
confinement basis ranging from $300 to $5,000, as to major hospital, and $150 to
$10,000 as to major medical. Reinsurance is currently in place which limits the
Company's exposure on major medical and major hospital insurance to $15,000 on
each insured per year.

     Group dental insurance is sold by American Pioneer under an indemnity plan,
which pays a stated percentage of the dentist's charges up to an annual maximum
of $2,000, and under a scheduled plan, which pays amounts specified in the
policy up to an annual maximum limit of $1,000. These products allow the insured
a free choice of dentists.

     The disability insurance sold by the Company includes both the DBL sold by
American Progressive, pursuant to the New York Workers Compensation Law that
requires covered employers to provide employees with insurance to replace a
portion of income lost through non-work related disability for up to 26 weeks,
and individual long-term disability insurance sold by American Pioneer with
benefit provisions of up to five years. The rates charged for DBL coverage are
set by the Company, based on the size, composition and claims history of the
group. The individual policies are underwritten based on the medical history of
the applicant.

     Effective January 1, 1994, American Progressive entered into a pooling
agreement through National Accident Insurance Underwriters ("NAIU"), an
unaffiliated agency, to underwrite travel accident insurance policies. See
"Reinsurance - Accident Insurance Pool" below.

         In addition to the health products described above, the Insurance
Subsidiaries have various other accident & health ("A&H") coverages in force.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     Historically, the Insurance Subsidiaries have sold their products through
traditional independent marketing organizations, general agents and producers.
The Company has adopted a strategy of seeking to structure arrangements with
marketing organizations, licensed as general agents, that sell particular
products and programs meeting particular market niches or needs. One such
arrangement, with an organization that focuses on individual sales of
deposit-term life insurance policies to moderate income buyers, produced 8.8% of
the Company's individual life insurance sales in 1995. Another such arrangement
with an organization that focuses on individual sales of interest sensitive
whole life insurance policies through single or multi-year premium payments to
middle age and senior age buyers produced 51.8% of the Company's individual life
insurance sales in 1995. An arrangement with a marketing organization in one
state, which primarily sells Blue Cross -- Blue Shield health insurance,
accounted for almost all of the Company's group life sales in the same period.
Other arrangements with several agencies in upstate New York which primarily
sell health insurance though independent agents, accounted for 86.9% of the
Company's sales of Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity coverage in the
same period. Additional arrangements for specialized products and markets are
being actively pursued, but no assurance can be given that any such products or
markets will be found, or that they can be profitably developed.

     The Insurance subsidiaries have more than 1,200 general agents and more
than 2,600 producers under contract, most of whom also sell similar products for
other companies. In 1995, no general agent produced as much as 5% of the
Company's accident & health insurance premiums or life insurance premiums and
only one general agent produced more than 5% of the Company's annuity premiums
(33%). The agents, general agents and producers are paid purely on a commission
basis and are not Company employees. In this marketing area, the Company
believes that the Company offers competitive commission rates and seeks to
provide innovative products and quality service to its independent general
agents. In particular, the Company believes that it provides a higher level of
agent support and is more responsive to its agents in the field than many larger
organizations with which it competes. Compensation of the Company's agents on
certain products is regulated by the various state Departments of Insurance.

     The Company, through the Insurance Subsidiaries, is licensed to market its
products in 45 states and in the District of Columbia. However, approximately
77% of its 1995 premium and annuity considerations came from the states of New
York, Florida, North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia.

COMPETITION

     The Company competes with other insurance and financial services companies,
including large multi-line organizations, both in connection with the sale of
insurance and asset accumulation products and in acquiring blocks of business.
Many of these organizations have substantially greater capital and surplus,
larger and more diversified portfolios of life and health insurance policies,
larger agency sales operations and higher ratings. In addition, it has become
increasingly difficult for small companies to compete effectively with their
larger competitors for traditional life and annuity sales in part as a result of
heightened consumer and agent awareness of the financial size of companies.

     The Company has met, and seeks to continue to meet, these competitive
pressures by offering a high level of service and accessibility to its field
force and by developing specialized products and marketing approaches which
enable it to sell products for which, or in markets in which, it faces less
competition.

RATINGS

     American Pioneer and American Progressive have been designated "B+(Very
Good)" and "B(Adequate)" respectively, by A.M. Best. In evaluating a company's
financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews its profitability,
leverage and liquidity as well as its book of business, the adequacy and
soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its
assets, the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competence of its

                                        7


<PAGE>



management. A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors relevant to
policyholders, agents, insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not directed
to the protection of investors. According to A.M. Best's published material, a
"B+" or "B" rating is assigned to companies which, in its opinion, have achieved
very good (B+) or adequate (B) overall performance when compared to the
standards it has established. Such companies have a good (B+) or adequate (B)
ability to meet their obligations to policyholders, but, as to "B", their
financial strength may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in underwriting or
economic conditions. American Pioneer and American Progressive are rated "BBBq"
and "Bq", respectively by Standard and Poors, which means that, based on their
publicly available information, they are currently able to meet policyholder
obligations, but, as to "Bq", such ability is especially vulnerable to adverse
economic and underwriting conditions. The Insurance Subsidiaries are not
currently rated by the Duff and Phelps or Moody's rating organizations. Although
a higher rating by A.M. Best or another insurance rating organization could have
a favorable effect on the Company's business, management believes that the
marketing strategy described above has enabled, and will continue to enable, the
Insurance Subsidiaries to compete effectively.

UNDERWRITING PROCEDURES

     Premiums charged on insurance products are based, in part, on assumptions
about the expected mortality and morbidity experience. In that regard, the
Company has adopted and follows detailed uniform underwriting procedures
designed to assess and quantify certain insurance risks before issuing
individual life insurance and certain health insurance policies and certain
annuity policies to individuals. These procedures are generally based on
industry practices, reinsurer underwriting manuals and the Company's prior
underwriting experience. To implement the procedures, each Insurance Subsidiary
employs an experienced professional underwriting staff.

     Applications for insurance to be underwritten are reviewed to determine if
any additional information is required to make an underwriting decision, which
depends on the amount of insurance applied for and the applicant's age and
medical history. Such additional information may include medical examinations,
statements from doctors who have treated the applicant in the past and, where
indicated, special medical tests. If deemed necessary, the Company uses
investigative services to supplement and substantiate information. For certain
coverages, the Company may verify information with the applicant by telephone.
After reviewing the information collected, the Company either issues the policy
as applied for, issues the policy with an extra premium charge due to
unfavorable factors, issues the policy excluding benefits for certain conditions
for a period of time or rejects the application. For certain of its coverages,
the Company has adopted simplified policy issue procedures in which the
applicant submits a single application for coverage typically containing only a
few health related questions instead of a complete medical history. In New York
and other states, certain of the Company's products, including Medicare
supplement, are subject to "Community Rating" laws which severely limit or
prevent underwriting of individual applications. See "Regulation--Health Care
Reform".

     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS"), which has received wide
publicity because of its serious public health implications, presents special
concerns to the life and health insurance industry. The Company considers AIDS
information in underwriting and pricing decisions in accordance with applicable
laws. Applicants for life insurance coverage equal to or exceeding $100,000, for
major medical and major medical coverages must submit to a blood or urine test,
which includes AIDS antibody screening. The Company's own mortality and
morbidity experience reflects no unduly adverse impact as a result of any
acceleration of AIDS-related life insurance claims. The Company is continuing to
monitor developments in this area but is necessarily unable to predict the
long-term impact of this problem on the life insurance industry, in general, or
on the Company, in particular.

INVESTMENTS

     The Company's investment policy is to balance the portfolio between
long-term and short-term investments so as to continue to achieve investment
returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity
adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims. The Company invests in
assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which it
operates, which laws prescribe the nature, quality of and limitations on various

                                        8

types of investments which may be made. Current policy is to invest primarily in
fixed maturity securities of the U.S. Government and its agencies and in
corporate fixed maturity securities with investment grade ratings of "Baa3"
(Moody's) or "BBB-" (Standard & Poors) or better. However, the Company does own
some investments that are rated "BB" or not rated (4.4% of total fixed
maturities as of both December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively). As of December
31, 1995, one of the Company's investments with a carrying value of $243,750 was
in default. In November, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued a Special Report titled "A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", which report
allows enterprises to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all
securities held and account for any resulting reclassifications between the
investment accounts. This one-time reassessment had to be made prior to December
31, 1995 and be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements. In
December, 1995, the Company did reassess the appropriateness of the
classifications of its securities and reclassified all of the securities
contained in the held to maturity account to the available for sale account as
they may be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the asset/liability
management strategy. The carrying value of the securities reclassed to available
for sale amounted to $35,942,303 and the fair value amounted to $36,098,026.
This transfer resulted in the Company increasing its unrealized gains by
$155,723. The Company currently engages the services of two unrelated investment
advisors, Conseco Capital Asset Management and Gibraltar Investment Management,
to manage the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, under the direction of the
management of the Insurance Subsidiaries and in accordance with guidelines
adopted by their Boards of Directors. The Company's policy is not to invest in
derivative programs or other hybrid securities, except for GNMA's, FNMA's and
investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations.

     At both December 31, 1994 and 1995, 95.6%, of the Company's investments
were investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities (i.e., those rated
"BBB-" or higher by Standard & Poor's Corporation or "Baa3" or higher by Moody's
Investors Service). At December 31, 1994 and 1995, these investment grade
securities included approximately $33,764,800 and $29,946,626, respectively, of
collateralized mortgage obligations secured by residential mortgages. These
amounts represented approximately 33% and 26% of the Company's fixed maturity
portfolio at December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. Certain classes of
mortgage-backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk. This is
due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be
repaid more rapidly than scheduled, as individuals refinance higher rate
mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available. As a result,
holders of mortgage-backed securities may receive higher prepayments on their
investments which they may not be able to reinvest at an interest rate
comparable to the rate paid on such mortgage-backed securities. At December 31,
1994 and 1995, less than investment grade fixed maturity securities had
aggregate carrying values of $4,446,205 and $5,092,566 respectively, and
aggregate market values of $4,314,977 and $5,092,566 respectively, amounting to
3.5% and 3.8% respectively, of total investments and 2.7% and 2.8% respectively,
of total assets. The Company's holdings of less than investment grade corporate
fixed maturity securities are diversified and the investment in any one such
security at both December 31, 1994 and 1995 was less than $1,000,000, which was
approximately 0.6% of total assets. The Company wrote down the value of certain
securities by $200,000 in 1993 and $195,000 in 1995, which was included in
realized gains on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. The
Company did not write down the value of any securities during 1994.

     Between 1992 and 1994, the Company acquired real property municipal tax
lien certificates for its own account and for resale through an origination
agreement with Salomon Brothers Realty Corp. Tax lien certificates represent
delinquent real property tax obligations to local governments and are senior in
priority to all mortgages and other encumbrances on real estate. The
certificates carry penalties and interest which must be paid to redeem the
certificate and to prevent foreclosure. On December 17, 1994, the Company sold
96% of its portfolio of real property municipal tax lien certificates to an
unrelated third party for a cash payment equal to their cost, plus accrued
interest and penalties, plus $140,000. The Company does not presently intend to
purchase additional tax certificates. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".

INVESTMENT INCOME

     Investment income is an important part of the Company's total revenues and
profitability. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations--Effects of Accounting Pronouncements" for comments on
the impact of changing interest rates. The following table shows the investment
results of the Company's total invested asset portfolio, for the last three
years ended December 31, 1995:

RESERVES

         In accordance with applicable insurance regulations, the Company has
established, and carries as liabilities in its statutory financial statements,
actuarially determined reserves that are calculated to satisfy its policy and
contract obligations. Reserves, together with premiums to be received on
outstanding policies and contracts and interest thereon at certain assumed
rates, are calculated to be sufficient to satisfy policy and contract
obligations. The actuarial factors used in determining such reserves are based
on statutorily prescribed mortality tables and interest rates. Reserves
maintained also include unearned premiums, premium deposits, reserves for claims
that have been reported but are not yet paid, reserves for claims that have been
incurred but have not yet been reported and claims in the process of settlement.

         The reserves reflected in the Company's consolidated financial
statements are calculated in accordance with GAAP. These reserves are based upon
the Company's best estimates of mortality and morbidity, persistency, expenses
and investment income, with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical
deviation. The Company uses the net level premium method for all non-interest
sensitive products and the retrospective deposit method for interest sensitive
products. GAAP reserves differ from statutory reserves due to the use of
different assumptions regarding mortality and morbidity, and interest rates and
the introduction of lapse assumptions into the GAAP reserve calculation.

REINSURANCE

     Ceded

     Consistent with the general practice of the life insurance industry, the
Company reinsures portions of the coverage provided by its life insurance
products to unaffiliated insurance companies under various reinsurance
agreements. Such agreements allow the Company to write policies in amounts
larger than the risk it is willing to retain on any one life, and to continue
writing a larger volume of new business. Such reinsurance agreements generally
provide for allowance for first year expenses in excess of the actual amount of
expenses, resulting in a profit to the Company. The mortality risk retention
limit on each policy varies generally between $25,000 and $75,000. The Company
cedes insurance primarily on an "automatic" basis, the Company receives
allowances from its reinsurers ranging from 100% to 142% of the reinsurers'
premium in the first policy year and at varying rates of up to 40% in renewal
years. Reinsurance is not maintained on any of the annuity policies in force.

     The Company has "excess of loss" reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated
insurance companies on its accident & health insurance policies to reduce the
liability on individual risks to $60,000 at American Pioneer and $200,000 at
American Progressive. As of June 30, 1995, the Company effected a "quota share"
reinsurance agreement

                                       12


<PAGE>



with an unaffiliated reinsurer (rated A+ by A.M. Best) to cede 75% of the
remaining $60,000 of individual accident & health insurance risk at American
Pioneer. The Company received a ceding commission of $862,000, $625,000 of which
was offset by the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset related to
this business. The remaining $237,000 was recorded as deferred revenue and will
be recognized as income over the expected life of the reinsured business.
Approximately $80,000 of such deferred revenue was recognized as income during
1995 and the remaining deferral is expected to amortize over the next year. In
addition, the Company has a quota share agreement on its Accidental Death and
Dismemberment policies under which the reinsurer receives 90% of all premiums
and pays 90% of all losses and the Company receives allowances ranging from
20%-30% of the ceded premium. American Pioneer also reinsures all of the risk in
excess of two years of benefits on certain disability income policies.

     As of June 30, 1993, the Company effected a "quota share" reinsurance
agreement with an unaffiliated reinsurer (rated A+ by A.M. Best) to cede 90% of
certain ordinary life insurance. Approximately $3,700,000 of reserves were ceded
with annual premiums in force amounting to approximately $1,500,000. The Company
received a ceding commission of $1,665,000, $680,000 of which was offset by
amortization of the present value of future profits asset related to this
business. The remaining $985,000 was recorded as deferred revenue and will be
recognized as income over the expected life of the reinsured business.
Approximately $120,000, $220,000 and $165,000 of such deferred revenue was
recognized as income during 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

     The Company is contingently liable to pay claims in the unlikely event that
a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. The
Company's primary reinsurers are currently rated A+ (Superior) and A (Excellent)
by A.M. Best. To the Company's knowledge, no reinsurer of business ceded by the
Company has been unable to pay any policy claims on any reinsured business. The
reinsurance agreements are subject to cancellation on 90 days' notice as to
future business, but policies reinsured prior to such cancellation remain
reinsured as long as they remain in force. Management believes that if its
reinsurance agreements were canceled it would be able to obtain other
reinsurance arrangements on satisfactory terms to enable it to continue writing
new business.

     Assumed

     As part of its strategy of acquiring blocks of business, the Company has
acquired several blocks of business through reinsurance.

     American Progressive participates in a modified coinsurance agreement with
an unaffiliated insurer under an agreement entered into in 1986. The business
assumed consists of non-participating premium-paying Whole Life and increasing
premium Whole Life policies. At December 31, 1995, premiums in force ceded to
American Progressive under this arrangement were approximately $400,000, the
amount of insurance in force was approximately $27.3 million and the reserves
assumed were approximately $4.5 million.

     In 1994, the Company assumed 100% of the risk and premium on certain
accident & health insurance policies written by three insurers not affiliated
with the Company: North American Company for Life and Health Insurance, North
American Company for Life and Health Insurance of New York and Baptist Life
Insurance Company of New York. At December 31, 1995, the premium in force on
these policies was approximately $1 million and the associated reserves were
approximately $900,000.

     Accident Insurance Pool

     Effective January 1, 1994, American Progressive entered into a pooling
agreement through National Accident Insurance Underwriters, an unaffiliated
agency, and two unaffiliated insurers, General American Life Insurance Company
and Heritage Life Insurance Company, to underwrite travel accident insurance
policies. A third unaffiliated company, Westward Life Insurance Company, joined
the pool as of July 1, 1994. On December 31, 1994, General American Life
Insurance Company withdrew from the pool and on January 1, 1995, Trustmark
Insurance Company entered the pool. On December 31, 1995, Heritage Life
Insurance Company withdrew from the pool and on January 1, 1996 Home Life
Financial Assurance Corporation entered the pool. Under the terms of the pooling
agreement, a portion of each risk is reinsured to companies outside the pool.
American Progressive will issue policies on insureds located in New York State
when required policy forms are approved, reinsuring a portion of the pool's
retention to each

                                       13


<PAGE>



of the other carriers and assumes its portion of the pool's retention on polices
written by the other participants. As of December 31, 1994 and 1995,
respectively, American Progressive had approximately $9 million and $8 million,
respectively in premiums in force under this arrangement, all of which was
assumed from the other pool participants.

WORLDNET

     Acquisitions

     In January 1992, WorldNet, a newly-formed subsidiary, acquired certain
assets and the client base of a firm that provided managed care, travelers'
medical assistance and claims administration to insurance companies (foreign and
domestic) and affinity groups, including credit card companies.

     On April 1, 1994, WorldNet acquired certain assets of Health Assistance for
Travelers, Inc. ("HAT") (a subsidiary of Ontario Blue Cross of Canada ("OBC"))
and an affiliated corporation for Can. $625,000 (approximately U.S. $470,000),
payable over five years. WorldNet also executed an agreement with HAT and OBC by
which WorldNet agreed to perform HAT's obligations under certain service
contracts between HAT and OBC, and other insurers. The assets acquired included
HAT's office in Miami Beach, Florida. In July 1994, the WorldNet facility in
Texas was closed and its functions and some of its personnel were transferred to
the Miami Beach facility acquired from HAT.

     In 1995, substantially all of the assets of OBC (including the shares of
OBC's subsidiary HAT) was acquired by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty
Health"). In February, 1996, WorldNet and Liberty Health agreed to terminate the
service agreement between OBC and WorldNet. In connection with the termination
of the service agreement, Liberty Health agreed to cancel the promissory notes
executed on April 1, 1994, which notes amounted to $370,000 at December 31,
1995. At the same time, the Company wrote off corresponding assets, including
the value of the service agreement, which assets amounted to approximately
$170,000. The resulting net income from this transaction was approximately
$200,000 and will be reflected in the Company's financial statements for the
first quarter of 1996.

     General

     WorldNet is a fee-based company whose primary services are to provide
medical managed care and assistance to people traveling away from their homes.
These, and other related services, are sold by WorldNet to insurance companies
(for their insureds), credit card companies (for their card members) and
associations (for their members).

     International Managed Care

     WorldNet has achieved a significant portion of its revenue from the sale of
managed care, cost containment and claims adjudication services to foreign (to
date, primarily Canadian) insurers for their insureds while they are in the
United States. During 1995, the Company canceled certain unprofitable contracts,
which contracts had revenues of approximately $1,000,000 in 1994. WorldNet
arranges access to appropriate medical care, manages the care and cost while the
case is in process and often arranges evacuation to the country of origin.

     WorldNet also provides complete claims adjudication services including
coordination of benefits, subrogation and audits. The clients who use WorldNet's
managed care services include a number of large insurers in Canada and Europe.

     Travel Assistance and Related Claims Adjudication

     WorldNet's travel assistance product is sold as an enhancement for its
clients' cardholders, policyholders and members. The service provides 24-hour
telephone access to assistance for medical, legal and other problems that arise
especially while away from home. Related to this function, WorldNet also
provides claims adjudication for travel-related insurance products such as
baggage, collision damage waiver and trip-cancellations. WorldNet services three

                                       14


<PAGE>



large credit card issuers in the United States and Canada and numerous domestic
and foreign insurers for travel assistance and related enhancement programs.

     Operations

     WorldNet operates a 24-hour multi-lingual communications center, which was
moved from Dallas, Texas to Miami, Florida in July 1994. This center is staffed
by managed care and assistance specialists. The company has developed
proprietary software applications that have been customized for its market.

     Revenues

     WorldNet's revenues for years ended December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995 were
as follows:

     Marketing

     WorldNet's services are marketed by direct contact from its staff to travel
insurance underwriters and brokers in the U.S. and abroad. WorldNet will
continue to focus its marketing efforts toward international insurance companies
that need access to managed care and cost containment techniques for their
insureds traveling in the U.S.

     Competition

     WorldNet has a number of domestic and foreign competitors. Most of the
competitors are owned by very large insurance organizations with greater
financial resources than WorldNet. WorldNet seeks to meet this competition by
emphasizing its high quality of service and the use of managed care and cost
containment techniques.

REGULATION

     General

     The Insurance Subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to
the laws, regulations and supervision of the states in which they are domiciled
(New York in the case of American Progressive and Florida in the case of
American Pioneer) and in various other states in which they are authorized to
transact business. The purpose of such laws and regulations is primarily to
provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interest of
shareholders.

     The insurance laws regulate, among other things, capitalization,
permissible investments, premium rates on statutory disability insurance and
other health insurance policy forms, the form and content of policies which may
be offered, specified methods of accounting (statutory accounting or SAP) for
detailed financial statements submitted to the various Insurance Departments and
minimum capital and surplus required to continue in operation.

                                       15


<PAGE>



     Most states have enacted legislation or adopted administrative regulations
covering such matters as the acquisition of control of insurance companies and
transactions between insurance companies and the persons controlling them.
Additional requirements are often imposed as a condition of approval of the
acquisition of an insurance company, as occurred in the case of the Company's
acquisition of both American Pioneer and American Progressive. The nature and
extent of the legislation and administrative regulations now in effect vary from
state to state and most states require administrative approval of the
acquisition of control of an insurance company incorporated in the state,
whether by tender offer, exchange of securities, merger or otherwise, and
require the filing of detailed information regarding the acquiring parties and
the plan of acquisition. The approval of the domiciliary insurance department is
also required before a controlling interest (10% as to New York, 5% as to
Florida) of an insurance company, or of a holding company which owns such an
insurance company, can be acquired or transferred. Every insurance company which
is authorized to do business in the state and is a member of an "insurance
holding company system" is generally required to register as such with the
insurance regulatory authorities and file periodic reports concerning its
relationships with the insurance holding company. Material transactions between
registered insurance companies and members of the holding company system are
required to be "fair and reasonable" and in some cases are subject to
administrative approval, and the books, accounts and records of each party are
required to be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the precise
nature and details of the transactions.

     Each Insurance Subsidiary is required to file detailed reports with the
insurance department of each state in which it is licensed to conduct business,
and its books and records are subject to examination by each such insurance
department. In accordance with the insurance codes of their domiciliary states
and the rules and practices of the NAIC, the Insurance Subsidiaries are examined
periodically by examiners of New York and Florida and by representatives (on an
"association" or "zone" basis) of the other states in which they are licensed to
do business. American Progressive was examined in 1992 for the three years ended
December 31, 1991 by the New York State Insurance Department and is currently
under examination for the three years ended December 31, 1994. American Pioneer
was examined in 1993 for the year ended December 31, 1992 by the Florida
Insurance Department. The Company has complied with all recommendations made on
such reports, and no issues were raised which the Company deems to be material.

     Many states require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders
either in those states or for all policyholders. At December 31, 1994 and 1995,
securities totaling $5,852,000 and $6,468,000, respectively (approximately 4.7%
and 4.8 %, respectively, of the carrying value of the Company's invested
assets), were on deposit with various state treasurers or custodians. Such
deposits must consist of securities that comply with the standards established
by the particular state.

     Insurance Regulatory Changes

     The NAIC and state insurance regulators have recently become involved in a
process of re-examining existing laws and regulations and their application to
insurance companies. This re-examination has focused on insurance company
investment and solvency issues, risk-based capital guidelines, assumption
reinsurance, interpretations of existing laws, the development of new laws, the
interpretation of nonstatutory guidelines, and the circumstances under which
dividends may be paid. The NAIC has encouraged states to adopt model NAIC laws
on specific topics such as holding company regulations and the definition of
extraordinary dividends. It is not possible to predict the future impact of
changing state regulation on the operations of the Company.

     The statutory filings of American Progressive and American Pioneer require
classifications of investments and, since the annual statements required to be
filed for the year ended December 31, 1992, have required the maintenance of an
asset valuation reserve ("AVR") account and have required that investment gains
and losses resulting from changes in interest rate levels be deferred and taken
into income over a period of years through a new interest maintenance reserve
("IMR").

     New York State enacted legislation in 1992 that requires all health
insurance sold to individuals and groups with less than 50 employees, to be
offered on an open enrollment and community rated basis effective April 1, 1993.
Such insurance may continue to be sold to groups with more than 50 employees on
an underwriting basis, with premiums set to reflect expected or actual expenses.
This new law prohibits the use of individual underwriting techniques and health
insurers must accept all who apply regardless of medical condition. In addition,
the community rating aspect of the law prohibits the use of age, sex, health or
occupational factors in rating and will require that the same average rates be
used for all persons with the same policy residing in the same location. The
Medicare supplement actively marketed by American Progressive in New York State
and certain of its in force business is subject to the community rating rules.
If similar legislation were enacted in other states, principally Florida, in
which the Company writes substantial amounts of medically underwritten health
insurance, the Company might reduce the amount of such coverage written or cease
offering it entirely.

     Dividend and Distribution Restrictions

     Under the New York State Insurance Law, the declaration or payment of a
dividend by American Progressive requires the approval of the New York
Superintendent of Insurance, who, as a matter of present policy, would not
approve such payment until American Progressive had generated sufficient
statutory profits to offset its entire negative unassigned surplus, which was
approximately $8,169,000 as of December 31, 1994 and $9,025,000 at December 31,
1995.

     Under current Florida State insurance law, a life insurer may pay a
dividend or make a distribution without the prior written approval of the
department when:

          (a) the dividend is paid from that portion of the accumulated and
     available surplus of the Company as is derived from the net operating
     profits of its business and its net realized capital gains;

          (b) the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of (i) 10% of
     the insurer's surplus as to policyholders derived from net operating
     profits on its business and net realized capital gains; or (ii) the
     insurer's entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains
     derived during the immediately preceding calendar year;

          (c) the insurer will have surplus as to policyholders equal to or
     exceeding 115% of the minimum required statutory surplus as to
     policyholders after the dividend or distribution is made; and

                                       17


<PAGE>



          (d) the insurer has filed notice with the department at least 10
     business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution.

American Pioneer has the present capacity to pay dividends of approximately
$1,700,000 during the year ending December 31, 1996. Dividends of $1,000,000 and
$500,000 were paid by American Pioneer to American Progressive in 1994 and 1995,
respectively.

     Risk-Based Capital Requirements

     Effective December 31, 1993, the NAIC adopted new risk-based capital
("RBC") requirements, which have also been adopted in New York and Florida.
These are intended to provide for a measurement of statutory capital and surplus
needs based on the risks in a company's mix of products and investment
portfolio. As of December 31, 1994 and 1995, American Progressive's ratios of
total adjusted capital to RBC, based on the NAIC approved model, were
approximately 351% and 334% of the Authorized Control Level, respectively. As of
December 31, 1994 and 1995, American Pioneer's ratios of total adjusted capital
to RBC, based on the NAIC approved model, were approximately 658% and 756% of
the Authorized Control Level, respectively.

         Guaranty Association Assessments

     All states require insurance companies to participate in guaranty
associations designed to cover claims against insolvent insurers. The incurrence
and amount of such assessments have increased in recent years and are generally
expected to increase further in future years. American Progressive and American
Pioneer were assessed and paid approximately $20,000 and $55,000, respectively,
in 1994 and $12,000 and $152,000, respectively, in 1995. The likelihood and
amount of any other future assessments are now unknown and are beyond the
control of the Company.

     Health Care Reform

     From time to time numerous proposals have been introduced in Congress and
the state legislatures to reform the current health care system. Proposals have
included, among other things, employer-based insurance systems, subsidized
premiums for lower income people, "managed competition" among health plans,
programs to regulate policy availability and affordability and public and
private programs. Changes in health care policy could significantly affect the
Company's health insurance business.

     Whether or not Congress passes any of these measures in the foreseeable
future, it is likely that these items will reappear on the legislative agenda in
the future. Reform proposals also could involve standardization of major medical
or long-term care coverages, impose mandated or target loss ratios or rate
regulation, require the use of community rating or other means that limit the
ability of insurers to differentiate among risks, or mandate utilization review
or other managed care concepts to determine what benefits would be paid by
insurers. These or other proposals could increase or decrease the level of
competition among health insurers. In addition, changes could be made in
Medicare that could necessitate revisions in the Company's Medicare Supplement
products. Other potential initiatives, designed to tax insurance premiums or
shift medical care costs from government to private insurers, could have an
adverse effect on the Company's business. The Company is unable to predict what
changes to the country's health care system will be enacted, if any, or their
effects on the Company's business. See "Regulation".

     New York State enacted legislation in 1992 that requires all health
insurance sold to individuals and groups with less than 50 employees, to be
offered on an open enrollment and community rated basis effective April 1, 1993.
This legislation has had a limited effect on the Company's business, primarily
on the Medicare supplement and senior hospital cash business being written by
American Progressive, as well as a limited amount of its other in force medical
insurance. The adoption of similar legislation in certain other states,
particularly where the Company writes or has in force major medical insurance in
the issuance of which the Company relies upon medical underwriting, could have
an

                                       18


<PAGE>



adverse effect and could require the Company to curtail or eliminate the writing
of such business. See "Business--Products--Accident & Health Insurance" and
"Regulation".

     Other Possible Changes in Legislation

     Since insurance is a regulated business, with a high public profile, it is
always possible that legislation may be enacted which would have an adverse
effect on the Company's business.

     The statutory disability benefits insurance ("DBL") sold by American
Progressive is mandatory pursuant to Article 9 of the New York Workers
Compensation Law. This benefit has been reviewed by the New York State
Legislature on several occasions since its adoption and the benefits provided
under such statute have been increased. If future laws reduce the requirement
for employers to provide this type of insurance, such laws might have an adverse
effect on the Company's writing of DBL business. However, the Company is not
aware that any such legislation is being actively considered by the New York
State Legislature at this time. See "Business--Products--Accident & Health
Insurance".

     Another important portion of the Company's insurance business is the sale
of deferred annuities and certain life insurance products, which are attractive
to purchasers in part because policyholders generally are not subject to federal
income tax increases in the value of an annuity or life insurance contract until
some form of distribution is made from the contract. From time to time, Congress
has considered proposals to reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of annuities
and life insurance which, if enacted, might have an adverse effect on the
ability of the Company to sell the affected products in the future. The Company
is not aware that Congress is actively considering any legislation that would
reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of annuities or life insurance; however,
it is possible that the tax treatment of annuities or life insurance could
change by legislation or other means (for example, by Internal Revenue Service
regulations or judicial decisions).

     Certain changes in insurance and tax laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on the operations of insurance companies. Specific
regulatory developments which could have a material adverse effect on the
operation of the insurance industry include, but are not limited to, the
potential repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which exempts insurance companies
from a variety of federal regulatory requirements), and adoption of laws, such
as those already in force in New York, limiting an insurer's ability to
medically underwrite and rate health insurance policies or to exclude
pre-existing conditions from coverage. In addition, the administration of such
regulations is vested in state agencies which have broad powers and are
concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION OF THE COMPANY

     The Company files a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes, in
which the Insurance Subsidiaries are not currently permitted to be included. At
December 31, 1995 the Company (exclusive of the Insurance Subsidiaries) had a
net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately $5,900,000 which expire in
the years 1996 to 2009.

     The Insurance Subsidiaries filed a separate consolidated federal income tax
return in which they are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the
Tax Code. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended the Tax Code to
require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be
capitalized and amortized over a period of years, as opposed to an immediate
deduction in the year incurred. Instead of measuring actual selling expenses,
the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums. In
general, the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten-year
period. Since this change only affects the timing of the deductions, it does
not, assuming stability of rates, affect the provisions for taxes reflected in
the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, by
deferring deductions, the change does have the effect of increasing the current
tax expense, thereby reducing statutory surplus. Because of the Insurance
Subsidiaries' net operating loss

                                       19


<PAGE>



carryforwards, there was no increase in the Company's current income tax
provision for the three years ended December 31, 1995 due to this change.

     At December 31, 1995 American Progressive had net operating tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $6,400,000, which expire in the years 2002 to
2007. As a result of changes in ownership of the Company in 1988, use of the
loss carryforwards of American Progressive were subject to annual limitations
during the 1988 to 1994 tax years.

     At December 31, 1995 American Pioneer had net operating tax loss
carryforwards, all incurred prior to its acquisition by the Company, of
approximately $1,800,000 which expire in the years 1997 to 2004 and capital loss
carryforwards of approximately $300,000, which expire in 1997. As a result of
changes in ownership of American Pioneer in May 1993, use of all the loss
carryforwards of American Pioneer are subject to annual limitations of
approximately $390,000.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 175 employees,
none of whom is represented by a labor union. The Company considers its
relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

     All of the executive officers listed above devote their full business time
to the Company.

     All of the Company's and its subsidiaries' officers are elected annually.
The Company's directors are elected for three year terms, classified into three
classes with the Directors in each class serving for three years, with the terms
staggered by class so that one class is elected at each annual meeting of
shareholders for a full three year term. All officers and directors hold office
until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to early removal
by the Board.

     As is noted above, Mr. Becker was a partner in Laventhol & Horwath from
1988 to 1990 and Mr. Wehner was an officer of JT Moran Financial Corp. and Moran
& Co. (collectively "Moran") from 1987 to 1990. In November 1990, Laventhol &
Horwath filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code. In July 1992, as a result of obligations arising out of the
Laventhol & Horwath failure, Mr. Becker filed personally for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Moran declared bankruptcy in
January 1990, and in July 1992 the SEC instituted a civil suit against six
former officers of Moran, including Mr. Wehner. Mr. Wehner settled the SEC suit
by consenting to the entry of an injunction against his future activity in the
securities business, without admitting any of the allegations of the SEC's
Complaint.

     The By-laws of the Company provide that the number of directors shall be
set by the Board of Directors and that the number of directors in each class
shall be equal, or as nearly as practical. The Company's Board of Directors
consists of nine directors and one vacancy.

     The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, consisting of Messrs.
Becker, Bolger, Henshel, and McLaughlin and a Compensation Committee consisting
of Messrs. Becker, Harmeling and Harris and an Executive Committee consisting of
Messrs. Marvin, Richard and Michael Barasch, and Mr. Bolger. The Audit Committee
is empowered to consult with the Company's independent auditors with respect to
their audit plans and to review their audit report and the accompanying
management letters. The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends
compensation, including incentive stock option grants, of officers of the
Company. The Executive Committee has the authority to act between Board meetings
on behalf of the Board, on all matters allowed by law.

                 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     WAND/MIDLAND TRANSACTION

     On March 7, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with Midland
National Life Insurance Company ("Midland"), the holder of all of the Company's
outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred"), under
which the Company was granted the right to redeem the Series A Preferred for $4
million in cash plus a $1 million five year Convertible Debenture ("the Midland
Debenture") bearing interest at 7%.

     To effectuate this transaction, the Company as of December 30, 1994*, sold
400 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Wand/Universal Investments L.P.
("Wand") for $4 million. This sale was made pursuant to a stock subscription
agreement ("the Wand Agreement") entered into on August 12, 1994.

- - -----------------

*    Upon issuance on December 30, 1994, the Series B Preferred was placed in
     escrow pending receipt of required regulatory actions by the New York and
     Florida Insurance Departments. On January 6, 1995 regulatory approval was
     obtained and the escrow was formally released on January 11, 1995.

                                       23


<PAGE>



The Series A Preferred was redeemed as of December 30, 1994**, by a payment of
the $4 million proceeds of the Wand sale and the issuance of the Midland
Debenture. Since the Midland Debenture was convertible at the option of the
holder into 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock, its fair value was
taken as $1,618,062 as of December 30, 1994. As of that date, the Series A
Preferred had a liquidation preference of $7,139,757, so that the redemption
resulted in an increase of $1,521,695 in earnings applicable to common
shareholders.

     On February 12, 1995, as of which date the Company had called the Midland
Debenture, Midland elected to convert $893,504 of its outstanding principal face
amount into 671,807 shares of Common Stock; the balance of the $106,496 was paid
in cash. The issuance of these shares, which had a fair value of $1,496,114 on
the date of their issuance, resulted in additional $602,610 of shareholders'
equity.

     The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at $2.25 per
share (subject to adjustment) and is entitled to dividends as if already
converted, only when and if dividends are declared on the Common Stock. The
holder of the Series B Preferred Stock may not require the Company to redeem it
unless the Company engages in certain defined transactions. The Company has the
right to require a conversion if it raises additional equity from the public on
pricing terms that meet certain criteria.

     Pursuant to the Wand Agreement, the Company increased the size of its Board
to ten, elected Patrick J. McLaughlin to fill the vacancy and paid Wand an
acquisition fee of $225,000 to cover its expenses in connection with the
closing. In addition, two agreements have been entered into:

          The Company and Wand Partners L.P., an affiliate of Wand, entered into
     a financial advisory agreement, under which such Wand affiliate is to
     render advisory services to the Company and is to be paid a fee of $100,000
     per year for such services as long as Wand owns 500,000 shares of Common
     Stock or common stock equivalent, reduced by any director's fees paid to
     the director designated by Wand.

          The Company, Wand and certain shareholders of the Company, including
     BALP, entered into a shareholders' agreement which provided, among other
     things that: (a) after the Series B Preferred Stock was converted into
     Common Stock, the contracting shareholders agreed to vote their shares of
     the Company for the election of one director designated by Wand; (b) the
     holder of the Series B Preferred Stock (and the Common Stock into which it
     is convertible) agreed to vote its shares for BALP's designees for election
     to the other positions on the Board of Directors of the Company; (C) the
     holder of the Series B Preferred Stock had the right to require the Company
     to register the Series B Preferred Stock and the Common Stock issuable upon
     its conversion at any time on a "piggy-back" basis and on two occasions on
     a "demand" basis; (d) Wand may not acquire more than an additional 5% of
     the Company's outstanding Common Stock without the Company's consent, as
     long as BALP and certain partners in BALP continue to hold at least certain
     percentages of the Company's Common Stock, on an outstanding and fully
     diluted basis; and (e) BALP and certain of its partners may not make
     private sales of their shares of Common Stock unless Wand is given the
     opportunity to sell a proportionate part of its holding on the same terms.

     In addition with the determination by the New York Superintendent of
Insurance (the "Superintendent") that Wand is not a controlling shareholder of
Company, within the meaning of the New York Insurance Law (see "Regulation"),
commitments were entered into by the Company and Wand and certain of their
controlling parties.

- - ---------------

**   The redemption of the Series A Preferred was also closed in escrow on
     December 30, 1994, and released from escrow on January 11, 1995.

                                       24


<PAGE>



     Under these commitments:

          Wand, its general partner and the two individuals who own all of the
     stock of its general partner are prohibited from engaging in any proxy
     contest with respect to the Company; exercising, or attempting to exercise,
     control over the Company; acquiring any additional securities of the
     Company (except by conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock); or
     admitting any new general or limited partner to the partnership.

          The Company, American Progressive, BALP, BALP's general partner and
     certain limited partners, and its general partner's shareholders are
     prohibited from decreasing the size of the Company's Board of Directors,
     electing any designee or affiliate of Wand (except for the one director of
     the Company to be designated by Wand) as a director or officer of the
     Company or American Progressive or engaging in any transaction (except for
     performance of the financial advisory agreement) with Wand or any of its
     partners.

These prohibitions generally apply as long as Wand owns 10% or more of the
outstanding voting power of the Company, and unless the approval of the
Superintendent has been obtained.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

by the Company, include the following persons who were officers and directors of
the Company, members of their families and a holder of more than 5% of the

DIVIDENDS

     The Company has neither declared nor paid dividends on its Common Stock and
no such dividends are likely in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to
pay dividends will be made by the Board of Directors in light of conditions then
existing, including the Company's results of operations, financial condition and
requirements, loan covenants, insurance regulatory restrictions, business
conditions and other factors. In addition, the ability of the Company to pay
dividends, if and when it should wish to do so, may depend on the ability of its
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company. See "Regulation--Dividend and
Distribution Restrictions".

ITEM 7--MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company is an insurance holding company representing the strategic
combination of two life insurance companies, American Progressive and American
Pioneer, and WorldNet, an international managed care company. These companies
were assembled in 1991-1993, with the Insurance Subsidiaries each being acquired
at prices approximately equal to or below their adjusted statutory book value.
Management is now focused on growth, both internal, through aggressive marketing
and product development programs directed at specialty life and accident &
health insurance products, and by seeking further acquisitions of insurance
companies or blocks of business. It also has embarked on a program to
rationalize operations through consolidation of administrative and processing
facilities.

     The Insurance Subsidiaries had revenues of approximately $25.6 million,
$43.9 million and $40.5 million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1994 and
1995, respectively, representing 91%, 91% and 93%, of the Company's total
revenues for each period, respectively. Although American Progressive, domiciled
in New York, primarily sells its products in New York and the northeastern
United States and American Pioneer, domiciled in Florida, primarily sells its
products in Florida and the southeastern United States, one or both of the
Insurance Subsidiaries is licensed in 45 states and in the District of Columbia.
American Pioneer and American Progressive have been rated "B+" and "B" by A.M.
Best, respectively. A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors relevant to
policyholders, agents, insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not directed
to the protection of shareholders in the rated company. See "Business--Ratings".

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1995

     The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994 and 1995
include the operations of American Progressive, American Pioneer and WorldNet.

     Net Income. For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company earned net
income of approximately $2,642,000 resulting in an earnings per share applicable
to common shareholders of $0.25. For the year ended December 31, 1994, the
Company earned net income of approximately $2,228,000 before its dividend
requirement on the Series A Preferred Stock, which dividend amounted to
approximately $576,000, resulting in an earnings per share of $0.20. On December
30, 1994, the Company redeemed the Series A Preferred Stock at a discount of
approximately $1,522,000 ($0.17 per share), which discount increased the 1994
net income applicable to common shareholders to approximately $3,173,000, or
$0.37 per share.

     Revenues. Total revenues decreased approximately $4,311,000 from total
revenues of approximately $48,033,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994 to
approximately $43,722,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995. Total premiums
and policyholder fees earned decreased approximately $3,514,000. Supplemental
health insurance premiums at American Progressive increased approximately
$1,842,000 (primarily in NYS DBL, Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity)
and its life premiums grew approximately $340,000, while American Pioneer's life
premiums grew approximately $656,000 and its group dental premiums grew
approximately $892,000. The increase in these life and supplemental health
premiums of $3,730,000 was offset by the decrease of approximately $4,757,000 in
American Pioneer's major hospital and major medical premiums and the decrease in
American Progressive's premiums from its participation in NAIU accident pool
(approximately $1,531,000) and other accident & health products that are no
longer being actively marketed by the Company (approximately $956,000). Realized
gains on investments increased approximately $632,000 to approximately $674,000,
compared to a gain of approximately $42,000 for the prior year, and are
primarily attributed to increasing interest rates throughout 1995. As a result
of realizing these investment gains, net investment income decreased
approximately $466,000.

                                       29


<PAGE>



     Fee income for the year ended December 31, 1995 decreased approximately
$988,000 which reflects the fees earned by WorldNet for managed care, travel
assistance, claims administration and communication services. This reduction is
a result of the Company's termination of certain nonprofitable contracts. For
the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company amortized approximately $244,000
of the deferred revenue compared to the $219,000 amortized in the same period in
1994, which increase is attributable to the $80,000 of additional amortization
generated by the 75% quota share reinsurance agreement effected on July 1, 1995.
See "Business-Reinsurance Ceded".

     Benefits, Claims and Other Deductions. Total benefits, claims and other
deductions decreased approximately $4,724,000 to $41,071,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1995. The change in future policy benefits amounted to a decrease
of approximately $4,267,000. The decrease in reserves for the year ended
December 31, 1995 was $1,337,000 and primarily relates to the reduction in the
1995 NAIU premium, (approximately $491,000) the non-marketed accident & health
business of American Progressive ($827,000) and the major hospital and major
medical of American Pioneer ($430,000) offset by an increase in the supplemental
health insurance reserves currently being sold (approximately $559,000). This
decrease compares to an increase in 1994 of approximately $2,930,000, which
increase in 1994 primarily relates to the increase in reserves of American
Progressive when it entered the NAIU accident pool and assumed the North
American Company businesses of approximately $2,556,000 (See "Business -
Reinsurance"). Claims and other benefits increased approximately $1,247,000.
This increase is a result of increased mortality of approximately $344,000 at
American Progressive and increased supplemental health benefits of approximately
$2,456,000 and increased morbidity of approximately $651,000 on the non-marketed
health business at both insurance companies. This increase was offset by a
reduction of approximately $2,204,000 in major hospital and major medical
benefits at American Pioneer, which reduction is a result of the lower premium
revenue discussed above. The increase in deferred acquisition costs increased
approximately $386,000 and was due to the increase in new business production
noted above.

     Other operating costs and expenses decreased approximately $1,286,000.
Expenses incurred by the insurance subsidiaries during 1995 exceeded the 1994
amount by approximately $151,000. Commissions, new business expenses and premium
taxes increased approximately $509,000, while the general overhead expenses
decreased approximately $358,000. The remaining decrease of $1,437,000 results
from a decrease of continuing operation expenses incurred by WorldNet
(approximately $1,708,000) resulting from the termination of certain
unprofitable contracts, (approximately $1,208,000) and the relocation of
WorldNet to Florida from Texas in 1994 (approximately $500,000) offset by an
increase by the Parent Company (approximately $271,000). Amortization of the
present value of future profits was approximately $205,000 for 1995 compared to
$237,000 in 1994, which decrease is due to the lower amount of insurance in
force.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1994

     The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994 include the
operations of American Progressive, American Pioneer and WorldNet. The results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 include all the operations of
American Progressive and WorldNet and the results of the operations of American
Pioneer from May 26, 1993 (the date of acquisition) to December 31, 1993.

     Net Income. For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company earned net
income of approximately $2,228,000 before its dividend requirement on the Series
A Preferred Stock, which dividend amounted to approximately $576,000, resulting
in an earnings per share of $0.20. On December 30, 1994, the Company redeemed
the Series A Preferred Stock at a discount of approximately $1,522,000 ($0.17
per share), which discount increased the net income applicable to common
shareholders to approximately $3,173,000, or $0.37 per share. For the year ended
December 31, 1993, the Company reported net income of approximately $1,553,000
before its dividend requirement on the Series A Preferred Stock, which amounted
to $529,000, resulting in an earnings per share of $0.14.

                                       30


<PAGE>



     Revenues. Total revenues increased approximately $19,953,000 to
approximately $48,033,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994 compared to total
revenues of approximately $28,089,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.
Premiums and policyholder fees earned increased approximately $18,798,000. The
most significant component of this increase is the inclusion of the premiums of
American Pioneer for the entire year in 1994 compared to only seven months in
1993, which amounted to approximately $8,725,000. The remaining increase of
$10,073,000 is a result of new supplemental health premiums at American
Progressive, which amounted to approximately $9,291,000, acquired blocks of
accident insurance amounting to approximately $1,447,000, an increase of life
premiums of approximately $215,000 and offset by a decrease in its in force
health premiums of approximately $880,000. Net investment income increased
approximately $710,000. This increase is attributable to the inclusion of the
net investment income of American Pioneer in 1994 offset by the decrease in
interest income of American Progressive due to its purchase of American Pioneer.
Realized gains on investments decreased approximately $634,000 to a gain of
approximately $42,000, compared to a gain of approximately $676,000 for the same
period last year and is primarily attributed to the lack of sales in 1994 due to
the increase of prevailing interest rates in 1994 compared to declining rates in
1993.

     Fee income for the year ended December 31, 1994 increased approximately
$1,660,000 which reflects an increase in fees earned by WorldNet for managed
care, travel assistance, claims administration and communication services. For
the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company amortized approximately $219,000
of the deferred revenue which was generated in 1993 through the reinsurance of
certain ordinary life insurance policies compared to $801,000 amortized in the
same period in 1993. See "Results of Operations--Years Ended December 31, 1993
and 1992--Revenues" for further discussion of the 1993 amount.

     Benefits, Claims and Other Deductions. Total benefits, claims and other
deductions increased approximately $19,340,000 to $45,795,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1994. The change in future policy benefits amounted to an increase
of approximately $3,938,000, which is the result of the increase in health
insurance writings in American Progressive. Claims and other benefits increased
approximately $6,939,000. The most significant component of this increase is the
inclusion of claims of American Pioneer, which amounted to approximately
$3,994,000. The remaining increase of $2,945,000 is a result of the increase in
health premiums of American Progressive noted above. The increase in deferred
acquisition costs increased approximately $1,594,000 due to the inclusion of
American Pioneer and the increase in new business production at American
Progressive.

     Other operating costs and expenses increased approximately $10,613,000. As
a result of the transaction with HAT discussed below (See "--Liquidity and
Capital Resources--WorldNet"), the Company decided to discontinue the operations
of its subsidiary, WorldNet Services Corp., a Texas corporation
("WorldNet-Texas"), effective August 31, 1994. The loss incurred for the
disposal of WorldNet-Texas amounted to approximately $500,000 ($0.05 per share),
which primarily consisted of employee severance and employee relocation.
Expenses incurred by American Pioneer during 1994 exceeded the 1993 amount by
approximately $4,773,000. The remaining increase of $5,840,000 results from an
increase of continuing operation expenses incurred by WorldNet as a result of
increased revenues (approximately $2,575,000), American Progressive
(approximately $3,038,000) and the Parent Company (approximately $226,000). The
increase in expenses at American Progressive was primarily attributable to
increased business. Commission and new business expenses and premium taxes
increased approximately $3,172,000, while the general overhead expenses
decreased approximately $134,000.

     When the Company acquired American Pioneer in May 1993, it established an
asset account for the present value of future profits related to its insurance
in force. Approximately $237,000 was amortized from this account as a charge
against income in 1994, while in the corresponding period of 1993, $793,000 was
amortized, $680,000 of which was as a result of the reinsurance of certain life
policies by American Pioneer. See "Results of Operations--Years Ended December
31, 1993 and 1992--Benefits, Claims and Other Deductions" for further discussion
of the 1993 amount.

                                       31

     The provision for federal income taxes was a current tax expense of
approximately $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994, which was derived
from alternative minimum tax calculations resulting from the use of tax loss
carryforwards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company's need for capital has historically been to maintain or
increase the surplus of its Insurance Subsidiaries, to fund the losses incurred
by WorldNet, and to support the Company as an insurance holding company,
including the maintenance of its status as a public company. In addition, the
Company requires capital to fund its anticipated growth through acquisitions of
other companies and blocks of insurance business.

     The Company

     The Company requires cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to
support its status as an insurance holding company (which under applicable
Insurance Department regulations must bear its own expenses) and to meet the
cost involved in being a publicly-owned company.

     As of December 30, 1994, the Company sold 400 shares of the Series B
Preferred Stock to Wand/Universal Investments L.P. ("Wand") for $4 million
pursuant to a stock subscription agreement entered into on August 12, 1994. See
"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions--Wand/Midland Transaction" for
additional information. The proceeds of the sale were used to redeem all of the
Series A Preferred Stock. The liquidation preference (including accumulated
dividends) of the Series A Preferred Stock as of December 30, 1994 was
approximately $7.1 million, which was eliminated as a consequence of the
redemption, resulting in an increase in earnings per share applicable to common
shareholders and stockholders' equity of approximately $1.5 million. The
redemption price of $5,618,062 (the "Redemption Price") was paid by a cash
payment of $4,000,000 and the issuance of a convertible debenture with a fair
value of $1,618,062 (based on the then market price of the common stock then
issuable upon conversion of the debenture) and a face amount of $1,000,000 (the
"Debenture"). This redemption was effected pursuant to a repurchase agreement
between the Company and Midland entered into on March 7, 1994. The Series A
Preferred Stock had been issued to Midland in 1991 in connection with the
Company's purchase of all the outstanding common stock of American Progressive
from Midland. The Debenture was called for redemption on February 12, 1995, at
which time $106,496 of its principal was paid in cash and the balance of the
principal was converted into 671,807 shares of Common Stock.

     In December 1994, the Company sold 688,610 shares of Common Stock to
various persons and a corporation for an aggregate consideration of $1,549,372
($2.25 per share). Some of the purchasers were granted registration rights by
the Company. The purchasers included certain officers and directors of the
Company, members of their families and a holder of more than 5% of the Company's
common stock, whose purchases totaled 267,666 shares. See "Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions--Other Transactions".

     On September 30, 1994, the Company entered into a new agreement with its
commercial bank, under which it borrowed $800,000 on a one year term loan,
extended by the Company for a second year. The borrowing under the new agreement
was utilized to pay off the $400,000 borrowed under a prior $500,000 line of
credit with the same bank and as working capital for the Company and operating
expenses for WorldNet. The new loan is secured by the pledge of 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Quincy Coverage Corp. ("Quincy"), an immaterial
subsidiary engaged in the insurance brokerage business, the receivables of
Quincy and WorldNet and 9.9% of the outstanding common stock of American
Progressive. As of December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1995, $800,000 was
outstanding on this loan agreement, which bears interest at 2.0% over prime. The
Company expects to refinance this loan when it matures.

     Insurance Subsidiaries

     American Progressive and American Pioneer are required to maintain minimum
amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting. The
minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of American Progressive and
American Pioneer as of December 31, 1995 for the maintenance of authority to do
business were $2,500,000 and $1,561,917, respectively, but substantially more
than this is needed to permit continued writing of new business. At December 31,
1995 the adjusted statutory capital and surplus, including asset valuation
reserve, of American Progressive and American Pioneer were $9,255,846 and
$13,815,357 respectively.

     The NAIC has adopted risk based capital ("RBC") rules which became
effective December 31, 1993 and have been adopted by both New York and Florida.
See "Regulation--Risk-Based Capital Requirements". The new RBC rules provide for
various regulatory actions when the ratio of a company's total adjusted surplus
to its RBC falls below 100%. At December 31, 1995, American Progressive and
American Pioneer had RBC ratios of approximately 334% and 756% of the Authorized
Control Level, respectively.

     Liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability
to pay scheduled contractual benefits, pay operating expenses, and fund
investment commitments. Sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled
principal and interest payments on investments, premium payments and deposits
and the sale of liquid investments. These sources of liquidity for the insurance
subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses.

     Liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death
benefits, benefits under accident and health policies and interest-sensitive
policy surrenders and withdrawals. The amount of surrenders and withdrawals is
affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar
products, general economic conditions and events in the industry which affect
policyholders' confidence. Although the contractual terms of substantially all
of the Company's in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders
the right to surrender the policies and annuities, the Company imposes penalties
for early surrenders. At December 31, 1995 the Company held reserves that
exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and
annuities by more than $9.9 million. The insurance companies have not
experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity over the
past years.

     Changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and
withdrawals. In addition to the potential impact on liquidity, unanticipated
surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could
adversely affect earnings if the Company were required to sell investments at
reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands. The Company manages the asset
and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of
changing market rates. The Company seeks to invest in assets which have duration
and interest spread characteristics similar to the liabilities which they
support.

     The net yield on cash and invested assets declined from 7.83% in 1993, to
7.48% in 1994 and to 6.97% in 1995. These decreases came as a result of
declining market interest rates in 1993 and 1994, which caused higher yielding
securities to be called or prepaid from the portfolio with the reinvestment of
the proceeds at lower interest rates. In addition, the Company invested in
shorter maturity investments to better match its policyholder liabilities and
decrease its exposure to interest rate volatility. A significant portion of
these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account
balances, which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their
credited interest rates. The credited interest rates of the interest-sensitive
policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors
such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically
follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities.

     At December 31, 1995, the investment portfolios of the life insurance
subsidiaries included cash and short-term investments totaling $12,290,000, as
well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with
carrying values of (and fair values) of $116,429,000. The fair values of these
liquid investments totalled more than

                                       33


<PAGE>



$128,719,000 and constituted approximately 95% of the Company's investments at
December 31, 1995. At December 31, 1995, all of the Company investments were
income producing and current in interest and principal payments except for one
security with a carrying value of $243,750. In addition, the Company has no
investment in any derivative instruments or other hybrid securities that contain
any off balance sheet risk or investments in other securities whose fair values
and principal repayments would be highly volatile to changes in interest rates,
except for GNMA's, FNMA's and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage
obligations.

     In December 1991, WorldNet was formed to provide travel assistance, claims
administration and communication services and acquire certain assets of an
unaffiliated company which had previously been engaged in that business.

     On April 1, 1994, WorldNet purchased certain assets of HAT and an
affiliated corporation for Can. $625,000 (approximately U.S. $470,000), payable
over five years. WorldNet also executed an agreement with HAT and OBC under
which WorldNet subcontracted HAT's obligations under certain service contracts
between HAT and OBC, and between HAT and other insurers. The note payable to HAT
required annual payments of Can. $125,000 (approximately U.S. $94,000) plus
accrued interest, beginning on April 1, 1994, and bore interest at 6%. In 1995,
substantially all of the assets of OBC (including the shares of OBC's subsidiary
HAT) were acquired by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Health"). In
February, 1996, WorldNet and Liberty Health agreed to terminate the service
agreement between OBC and WorldNet. In connection with the termination of the
service agreement, Liberty Health agreed to cancel the promissory notes executed
on April 1, 1994, which notes amounted to $370,000 at December 31, 1995. At the
same time, the Company wrote off the corresponding assets, including the value
of the service agreement, which assets amounted to approximately $170,000. The
resulting net income from this transaction was approximately $200,000 and will
be reflected in the Company's financial statements for the first quarter of
1996.

     Through December 31, 1995, the Company has provided approximately $3.4
million to WorldNet. These funds were used to support WorldNet's start-up costs,
a portion of the costs of acquiring the HAT assets and the cost of acquiring
WorldNet's Dallas, Texas facility and later closing it and relocating certain of
its operations to the facility purchased from HAT in Miami Beach, Florida.
WorldNet's revenues were $2,338,000, $4,068,000 and $3,071,000 for 1993, 1994
and 1995, respectively. WorldNet incurred a net loss of approximately $481,000,
$1,375,000 and $665,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The 1994 loss included a charge of approximately $500,000 related
to employee severance and relocation costs incurred in connection with the
consolidation of WorldNet's facilities. During 1993 and 1994, WorldNet incurred
approximately $144,000 and $190,000 respectively of organizational expenses
which are being amortized over a five-year period. In 1995 no organizational
expenses were incurred.

EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities", which is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993, with earlier
adoption permitted. Statement 115 requires that debt and equity securities be
classified into three categories and accounted for as follows:

          o Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and the
     ability to hold to maturity would be classified as "held to maturity" and
     reported at amortized cost.

          o Debt and equity securities that are held for current resale would be
     classified as "trading securities" and reported at fair value, with
     unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.

                                       34


<PAGE>



          o Debt and equity securities not classified as held to maturity or as
     trading securities would be classified as "available for sale" and reported
     at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses would not be reflected in
     earnings but would be reported as a separate component of stockholders'
     equity.

     The Company adopted Statement 115 on January 1, 1994, the effect of which
increased its unrealized gains by $494,541. In November, 1995, the FASB issued a
Special Report titled "A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", which report allows
enterprises to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all
securities held and account for any resulting reclassifications between the
investment accounts. This one-time reassessment had to be made prior to December
31, 1995 and be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements. In
December, 1995, the Company did reassess the appropriateness of the
classifications of its securities and reclassified all of the securities
contained in the held to maturity account to the available for sale account as
they may be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the asset/liability
management strategy. The carrying value of the securities reclassed to available
for sale amounted to $35,942,303 and the fair value amounted to $36,098,026.
This transfer resulted in the Company increasing its unrealized gains by
$155,723. As changes in interest rates occur, the carrying value of the
securities classified as available for sale, as well as any securities which may
in the future be classified as held for maturity, will be impacted. Typically,
as interest rates rise, the carrying value of these securities may decline.
Conversely, if interest rates decline, the carrying value of these securities
may increase. Management cannot predict the impact that changes in future
interest rates will have on the Company's financial statements.

     In October, 1995, the FASB issued Statement 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation" which requires disclosure of new employee stock
options in the form of a note to the financial statements based on the fair
value at the date of the grant and is effective for financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995, with earlier adoption permitted.
Companies also may base the recognition of compensation cost for new and
modified options on these fair values. The disclosures required in Statement 123
must include the pro forma effects on the Company's net income resulting from
the grant of these options and other stock awards. The Company will adopt
Statement 123 in its 1996 financial statements and intends to disclose the
impact in the footnotes to the financial statements rather than record these
charges in its statement of operations.

                          Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Universal Holding Corp.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Universal Holding Corp.
and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
consolidated financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statements schedules are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Holding
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year
period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for debt and equity securities in 1994 to adopt
the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities".

                    UNIVERSAL HOLDING CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND COMPANY BACKGROUND:

     Universal Holding Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of
the State of New York in August 1981, for the purpose of conducting insurance
and related business primarily through its then wholly-owned subsidiary, John
Adams Life Insurance Company of New York ("John Adams"). On May 17, 1991, the
Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of American Progressive
Life & Health Insurance Company of New York ("American Progressive") and on June
27, 1991 merged John Adams into American Progressive. In 1988, the Company
organized Quincy Coverage Corp. ("Quincy") an insurance agent and broker. In
January, 1992, the Company began operations in WorldNet Services Corp.
("WorldNet"), a provider of managed care and assistance to travelers. On May 26,
1993, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of American
Pioneer Life Insurance Company ("American Pioneer") (see Note 3).

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     a.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The significant accounting policies followed by
          Universal Holding Corp. and subsidiaries that materially affect
          financial reporting are summarized below. The accompanying
          consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
          with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which, as to
          American Progressive and American Pioneer, differs from statutory
          accounting practices permitted by regulatory authorities. The
          preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
          management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
          amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
          and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
          reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
          results could differ from those estimates.

     b.   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
          statements include the accounts of Universal Holding Corp. and its
          wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the results of American Pioneer's
          operations since May 26, 1993, the date of acquisition, which
          acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
          All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
          eliminated.

     c.   INVESTMENTS: Investments are shown on the following bases:

          In May, 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
          Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities" and
          is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993, with
          earlier adoption permitted. Statement 115 requires that debt and
          equity securities be classified into three categories and accounted
          for as follows:

          o    Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and the
               ability to hold to maturity would be classified as "held to
               maturity" and reported at amortized cost.

          o    Debt and equity securities that are held for current resale would
               be classified as "trading securities" and reported at fair value,
               with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.

          o    Debt and equity securities not classified as held to maturity or
               as trading securities would be classified as "available for sale"
               and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses would be
               excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
               stockholders' equity, net of tax.

                                       F-8

          The Company adopted Statement 115 on January 1, 1994, the effect of
          which was an increase in unrealized gains of $494,541. In November,
          1995, the FASB issued a Special Report titled "A Guide to
          Implementation of Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments
          in Debt and Equity Securities", which report allows enterprises to
          reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities
          held at the time of the Special Report issuance. In December, 1995,
          the Company did reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of
          its securities and reclassified all of the securities contained in the
          held to maturity account to the available for sale account as they may
          be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the
          asset/liability management strategy. The carrying value of the
          securities reclassed to available for sale amounted to $35,942,303 and
          the fair value amounted to $36,098,026. This transfer resulted in the
          Company increasing its unrealized gains by $155,723, net of tax and
          deferred policy acquisition cost adjustment.

          Fixed maturity securities classified as investments held to maturity
          prior to reclassification were carried at amortized cost because the
          Company had the positive intent and ability to hold such investments
          until maturity. All other fixed maturity securities were classified as
          available for sale and were carried at fair value, with the unrealized
          gain or loss, net of tax and other adjustments (deferred policy
          acquisition costs), included in stockholders' equity. As of December
          31, 1995, all fixed maturity securities were classified as available
          for sale. Equity securities are carried at current fair value. Policy
          loans and mortgage loans are stated at the unpaid principal balance.
          Short term investments are carried at cost which approximates fair
          value. Property tax liens are carried at cost. Investment income is
          recorded when earned. Realized investment gains and losses on the sale
          of securities are based on the specific identification method.
          Unrealized gains and losses from revaluation of equity investments and
          fixed maturity securities to current market value are reflected in
          stockholders' equity.

     d.   DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS: The cost of acquiring new business,
          principally commissions and certain expenses of the policy issuance
          and underwriting departments, all of which vary with, and are
          primarily related to the production of new and renewal business, have
          been deferred. These costs are being amortized in relation to the
          present value of expected gross profits on the policies arising
          principally from investment, mortality and expense margins for
          Statement No. 97 products and in proportion to premium revenue using
          the same assumptions used in estimating the liabilities for future
          policy benefits for Statement No. 60 products. Deferred policy
          acquisition costs would be written off to the extent that it is
          determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross
          profits would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses.
          There were no write offs for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1994
          and 1995. Details with respect to deferred policy acquisition costs
          for the three years ended December 31, 1995 are as follows:

     e.   RECOGNITION OF REVENUES, CONTRACT BENEFITS AND EXPENSES FOR INVESTMENT
          AND UNIVERSAL LIFE TYPE POLICIES: Revenues for universal life-type
          policies and investment products consist of mortality charges for the
          cost of insurance and surrender charges assessed against policyholder
          account balances during the period. Interest credited to policyholder
          account balances is netted against investment income. Benefit claims
          incurred in excess of policyholder account balances are expensed. The
          liability for policyholder account balances for universal life-type
          policies and investment products under Financial Accounting Standards
          Board Statement No. 97 are determined following a "retrospective
          deposit" method and consist principally of policy account values
          before any applicable surrender charges. Credited interest rates for
          these products range from 5.00% to 7.25%. For the three years ended
          December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995, one general agency of American
          Progressive produced $4,302,111, $3,645,611 and $4,477,034 of annuity
          receipts, respectively, which represented approximately 41%, 41% and
          33%, respectively, of total annuity receipts of American Progressive.

     f.   RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND POLICY BENEFITS FOR ACCIDENT AND
          HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS: Premiums are recorded when due and
          recognized as revenue over the period to which the premiums relate.
          Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to
          result in recognition of profits over the life of the policies. This
          association is accomplished by recording a provision for future policy
          benefits, establishing an unearned premium reserve and amortizing
          deferred policy acquisition costs. Claim reserves are established for
          future payments not yet due on claims already incurred, primarily
          relating to individual disability insurance and group long-term
          disability insurance products. These reserves are established based on
          past experience and are continuously reviewed and updated with any
          related adjustments recorded to current operations. Claim liabilities
          represent policy benefits due but unpaid at year end and primarily
          relate to individual health insurance products. Activity in the
          accident and health policy and contract claim liability is as follows:

     g.   DEFERRED REVENUE: The Company entered into a 75% quota share
          reinsurance agreement with an unaffiliated reinsurer on the $60,000
          retention of certain individual accident & health insurance policies
          in force as of June 30, 1995. The Company received $862,000 as a
          ceding commission, $625,000 of which was offset by the amortization of
          the deferred acquisition cost asset related to this business. The
          remaining $237,000 was recorded as deferred revenue and will be
          recognized as

                                      F-10


<PAGE>


          income over the expected life of the reinsured business. In 1995,
          $79,098 of this deferred revenue was amortized into income.

          The Company entered into a 90% quota share reinsurance agreement with
          an unaffiliated reinsurer on certain life insurance policies in force
          as of June 30, 1993. The Company ceded $3,696,101 of life insurance
          reserves and received $1,665,000 as a ceding commission, which ceding
          commission was recorded as deferred revenue. The Company amortized
          $800,536, $219,261 and $165,104 of deferred revenue during 1993, 1994
          and 1995 respectively.

     h.   WORLDNET SERVICES CORP.: WorldNet began operations in early 1992 and,
          on January 15, 1992, it purchased certain assets of Interclaim
          Services Corp. by assuming related liability commitments which totaled
          approximately $150,000. In 1993, WorldNet began operations in Canada
          to market its services. During 1993 and 1994, WorldNet capitalized
          $144,247 and $189,749, respectively, of organizational expenses, which
          expenses are being amortized over a five year period.

     i.   INCOME TAXES: The Company's method of accounting for income taxes is
          the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method,
          deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
          consequences attributable to differences between the financial
          statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
          their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
          measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
          in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
          recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
          liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
          period that includes the enactment date.

     j.   REINSURANCE ACCOUNTING: Amounts paid for a recoverable under
          reinsurance contracts are included in total assets as reinsurance
          recoverable amounts. The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration
          contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured
          policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for
          the underlying policies.

     k.   EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Net income per common share was computed by
          dividing the net income applicable to common shareholders by the
          weighted average number of common equivalent shares outstanding during
          each period. Income before extraordinary credit and net income were
          adjusted to deduct the dividend requirements of the Series A preferred
          stock for the two years ended December 31, 1994 and include the
          discount earned on the redemption of the Series A preferred stock in
          1994.

     l.   CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Included in cash and cash equivalents are cash
          on deposit, money market funds, and short term investments which had
          an original maturity of three months or less from the time of
          purchase.

     m.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT: In October, 1995, the FASB issued
          Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" which
          requires disclosure of new employee stock options in the form of a
          note to the financial statements based on the fair value at the date
          of the grant and is effective for financial statements for fiscal
          years beginning after December 15, 1995, with earlier adoption
          permitted. Companies also may base the recognition of compensation
          cost for new and modified options on these fair values. The
          disclosures required in Statement 123 must include the pro forma
          effects on the Company's net income resulting from the grant of these
          options and other stock awards. The Company will adopt Statement 123
          in its 1996 financial statements and intends to disclose the impact in
          the footnotes to the financial statements, rather than record these
          charges in its statement of operations.

     n.   RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
          years' financial statements to conform with current period
          classifications.

3. RECENT ACQUISITIONS:

     On May 26, 1993 the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, American
Progressive, acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of American Pioneer
from the Resolution Trust Company, in an auction sale. The Company paid
$6,827,064 in cash. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The
following proforma unaudited information reflects the revenues, net income to
common shareholders and earnings per share as if the acquisition had occurred on
January 1, 1993:

     On April 1, 1994, the Company, through WorldNet Services Corp., a newly
formed Florida corporation (WorldNet - Florida), purchased from Health
Assistance for Travelers, Inc. ("HAT") (a subsidiary of Ontario Blue Cross of
Canada ("OBC")) certain assets of HAT and an affiliated corporation for Canadian
$625,000 (approximately US $470,000), payable over five years. The note payable
to HAT requires annual payments of Canadian $125,000 plus accrued interest
beginning on April 1, 1994 and bears interest at 6%. WorldNet - Florida also
executed an agreement with HAT for the subcontracting of HAT's obligations under
certain service contracts between HAT and OBC, and other insurers. For the year
ended December 31, 1994 and 1995 the Company received $1,036,639 and $1,204,270,
respectively, under these service agreements. In 1995, substantially all of the
assets of OBC (including the shares of OBC's subsidiary HAT) was acquired by
Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Health"). In February, 1996, WorldNet
and Liberty Health agreed to terminate the service agreement between OBC and
WorldNet. In connection with the termination of the service agreement, Liberty
Health agreed to cancel the promissory notes executed on April 1, 1994, which
notes amounted to $370,000 at December 31, 1995. At the same time, the Company
wrote off corresponding assets, including the value of the service agreement,
which assets amounted to approximately $170,000. The resulting net income from
this transaction will be approximately $200,000 and will be reflected in the
Company's financial statements for the first quarter of 1996.

     The deferred tax benefits for 1993 and 1995 were $391,073 and $1,642,819,
which amounts were charged directly to the present value of future profits since
the benefits were derived from the recognition of acquired tax loss
carryforwards of American Pioneer that previously were included in the valuation
allowance.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 1994 and 1995 are as
follows:

     At December 31, 1994 and 1995, the Company has established valuation
allowances of $4,287,788 and $1,134,555, respectively, with respect to its
deferred tax assets. Based on the Company's future expectation of adjusted
taxable income and through its ability to change its investment strategy and use
of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, management believes it is more
likely than not that the Company will fully realize the net deferred tax assets.
As a result of these available strategies, management reduced the valuation
allowance with a portion charged directly to present value of future profits.
However, because of uncertainties inherent in estimating future taxable income,
management concluded that a valuation allowance of $1,134,555 with respect to
the deferred tax asset is appropriate. At December 31, 1994 the Company had
established a valuation allowance of $1,165,094 with respect to the deferred tax
asset attributed to unrealized investment losses which was realized through
stockholders' equity in 1995.

     A reconciliation of the "expected" tax expense at 34% with the Company's
actual tax expense applicable to operating income before taxes reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company (exclusive of American Progressive and
American Pioneer) has net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately
$5,900,000 which expire in the years 1996 to 2009.

     As of December 31, 1995, American Progressive has net operating tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $6,400,000 which expire in the years 2002 to
2007.

     As of December 31, 1995, American Pioneer has net operating tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $1,800,000 which expire in the years 1997 to 2004
and capital tax loss carryforwards of approximately $300,000, which expire in
1997. As a result of the change in ownership of American Pioneer in May, 1993,
use of all these loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations of
approximately $390,000.

6.       STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     Preferred Stock

     The Company has 2,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock to be issued
in series with 510,000 issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 400
shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

     Series A Preferred Stock

     On May 17, 1991, the Company issued 510,000 shares of Series A cumulative,
redeemable, convertible preferred stock ("Series A preferred stock") to Midland
National Life Insurance Company in connection with the acquisition of American
Progressive (see note 3). The Series A preferred stock had an initial
liquidating preference of $5,263,714 (which included accrued dividends of
$163,714 for the period January 1 to May 17, 1991), with dividends payable
quarterly at 8.5% per year on a cumulative basis since January 1, 1991.
Dividends were not required to be paid in cash and any unpaid dividend
accumulated as part of the Series A preferred stock liquidating preference.
During the two years ended December 31, 1993, $486,784 and $529,497,
respectively, of dividends accumulated and were added to the outstanding balance
of Series A preferred stock. At December 31, 1993, the Series A preferred stock
had a liquidating preference of $6,563,796. Prior to March, 1994, such preferred
stock was redeemable by the company at any time at its liquidating preference,
plus any accumulated dividends and preferred stock with liquidating preference
of up to $1,500,000 was convertible at any time into common stock at $1.00 per
share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. These redemption and conversion
features would have been reinstated if the Series A Preferred Stock had not been
redeemed by February 28, 1995. In addition, two-thirds of such preferred stock
outstanding at the end of five years from its issuance on May 17, 1991 (or
earlier upon the occurrence of defined events) was convertible into an amount of
common stock equal to two-thirds of the common stock outstanding immediately
after the conversion. The Series A preferred stock was non-voting.

     In March, 1994 Midland granted the Company the right, exercisable at any
time prior to March 1, 1995, to redeem the preferred stock in exchange for
$4,000,000 in cash and a $1,000,000 five year debenture, convertible to

                                      F-17


<PAGE>



either 666,667 shares of common stock (if the preferred stock was redeemed prior
to August 1, 1994) or 750,000 shares of common stock (if the preferred stock was
redeemed on or after August 1, 1994, but prior to March 1, 1995). The
liquidation preference of the Series A preferred stock as of December 30, 1994
was $7,139,757, and such stock was redeemed on that date for an aggregate
redemption price of $5,618,062 (the "Redemption Price"), paid by a cash payment
of $4,000,000 and the issuance of a convertible debenture with a fair value of
$1,618,062 and a face amount of $1,000,000 (the "Debenture"). The Debenture was
called for redemption on February 12, 1995, at which time $106,496 of principal
was paid in cash and the balance of the principal was converted into 671,807
shares of Common Stock.

Series B Preferred Stock

     As of December 30, 1994, the Company sold 400 shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, with a par value of $10,000 per share, to
Wand/Universal Investments L.P. ("Wand") for $4 million pursuant to a stock
subscription agreement entered into on August 12, 1994, under which Wand agreed
to purchase, at the Company's option, either 400 or 500 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock for a total purchase price of $4 million or $5 million,
respectively. Pursuant to the Stock Subscription Agreement, the Company paid
Wand $225,000 for its services and expenses incurred in structuring the Wand
Transaction and in due diligence related thereto. The proceeds of the sale were
used to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Stock discussed above.

     The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at $2.25 per
share (subject to adjustment) and is entitled to dividends as if already
converted, only when and if dividends are declared on the Common Stock. The
holder of the Series B Preferred Stock may not require the Company to redeem it
unless the Company engages in certain defined transactions. The Company has the
right to require a conversion if it raises additional equity from the public on
pricing terms that meet certain criteria.

     Pursuant to the stock subscription agreement, Wand, the Company and certain
shareholders of the Company, including BALP, entered into a shareholders'
agreement contemporaneously with the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to
Wand. Under the shareholders' agreement, the holder of the Series B Preferred
Stock agreed to vote such shares, and the Common Stock issued upon their
conversion, for the nominees of BALP for election as directors of the Company
and, after the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock to Common Stock, all
parties agreed to vote their shares for the election of one director designated
by Wand. The shareholders' agreement also contained "stand still," "tag along"
and registration rights provisions. The stand still provision will prohibit Wand
from acquiring more than an additional 5% of the Company's outstanding Common
Stock without the Company's consent, as long as BALP and certain partners in
BALP continue to hold at least certain percentages of the Company's Common
Stock, on an outstanding and fully diluted basis. The tag along will prohibit
BALP and certain of its partners from making private sales of their shares of
Common Stock unless Wand is given the opportunity to sell a proportionate part
of its holding on the same terms.

     The Company and Wand Partners L.P., an affiliate of Wand, have also entered
into a financial advisory agreement, under which such Wand affiliate is to
render advisory services to the Company and is to be paid a fee of $100,000 per
year for such services as long as Wand owns 500,000 shares of Common Stock, or
its common stock equivalent, reduced by any directors' fee paid to the director
designated by Wand.

     In connection with the determination by the New York Superintendent of
Insurance (the "Superintendent") that Wand is not controlling shareholder of
Company, within the meaning of the New York Insurance Law (see "Regulation"),
certain commitments were made to the Superintendent. These commitments included
a commitment by Wand, Wand's general partner and Wand's general partner's
shareholders that, as long as Wand owns 10% or more of the voting power of
Universal's outstanding stock, Wand will not acquire any additional shares of
Universal, except by exercise of its conversion rights, and will not attempt to
obtain or exercise control of Universal, without the consent of the Department.
Universal, American Progressive, BALP, BALP's general partner and certain
limited partners, and the shareholders of BALP's general partner also entered
into commitments, including commitments that as long as Wand owns 10% or more of
the voting power of Universal's outstanding shares, the size of Universal's
Board would not be

                                      F-18


<PAGE>



reduced below ten directors and that no transaction between Universal or
American Progressive, on the one hand, and Wand or its partners of controlling
parties, or on the other hand, would be entered without the approval of the
Superintendent, except for the shareholders agreement and the financial advisory
agreement referred to herein.

     Common Stock

     The par value of common stock is $.01 per share with 20,000,000 shares
authorized for issuance. The shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 1994
and 1995 were 6,176,290 and 6,957,532, respectively. During the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995, the Company issued 653,410, 930,017 and
781,242 shares, respectively, of its common stock.

     Common Stock Warrants

     The Company had 689,871 and 679,621 common stock warrants issued and
outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively, which are registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the years ended December 31,
1994 and 1995, 32,439 and 10,250 warrants, respectively, were converted into
common shares at $1.00. At December 31, 1995, the Company had 2,015,760 warrants
outstanding which are not registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The warrants have no par value, have an exercise price to purchase common stock
on a one to one basis at $1.00 and expire on December 31, 1999.

     Incentive Stock Option Plan

     In 1983, the Company adopted an incentive stock option plan which, as
amended, reserves 1,000,000 shares of common stock. Since its adoption, 121,500
shares have been exercised, leaving 878,500 shares reserved as of December 31,
1995. Stock options totaling 415,000 and 196,000 expire five years and ten
years, respectively, after the date granted or upon the earlier termination of
employment. Options are exercisable one year after grant, and at December 31,
1995, 546,000 options are exercisable. Additional information with respect to
the Company's stock option plan is as follows:

Other Stock Options

     On December 15, 1995, the Board of Directors approved a plan under which up
to 200,000 options may be granted to agents of the Company's subsidiaries
(subject to insurance law restrictions) and to other persons as to whom the
Board of Directors believes the grant of such options will serve the best
interests of the Corporation, provided that no options may be granted under this
plan to officers, directors or employees of the Company or of any subsidiary,
while they are serving as such. On December 15, 1995, the Board of Directors
granted options to three individuals, two of whom are members of the Company's
law firm and the other of whom is a consultant to the Company, to purchase a
total of 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at a price of $2.50 per
share, which was the quoted market price for the such shares at the time of the
grant. Such options will expire 10 years from the date of the grant.

7. STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

     American Progressive and American Pioneer are required to meet minimum
statutory capital requirements imposed by the Insurance Departments of the
states in which they are licensed in order to operate as an insurance company
without restrictions. The minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of
American Progressive and American Pioneer for the maintenance of authority to do
business at December 31, 1995 was $2,500,000 and $1,561,917, respectively. As of
December 31, 1995, the statutory capital and surplus amounts of American
Progressive and American Pioneer were $8,731,953 and $13,196,681, respectively.
Their statutory gain (loss) for the year ended December 31, 1995 were $(262,049)
and $1,694,711, respectively. The insurance companies have calculated their
risk- based capital ("RBC") requirements and, as of December 31, 1995, both
American Progressive and American Pioneer's ratios of total adjusted capital to
RBC are sufficiently in excess of the authorized control levels. Dividend
payments from American Progressive to the Company would require regulatory
approval which, in all likelihood, would not be obtained until American
Progressive generated enough statutory profits to offset its entire negative
unassigned surplus, which was approximately $9,025,000 at December 31, 1995.
American Pioneer may pay a dividend or make a distribution without the prior
written approval of the Florida Insurance Department when (a) the dividend is
equal to or less than the greater of (1) 10% of the insurer's surplus as to
policyholders derived from net operating profits on its business and net
realized capital gains ("policyholder surplus from operations"); or (2) the
insurer's entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived
during the immediately preceding calendar year but not more than its
policyholder surplus from operations; (b) the insurer will have surplus as to
policyholders equal to or exceeding 115% of the minimum required statutory
surplus as to policyholders after the dividend or distribution is made; and (c)
the insurer has filed notice with the department at least 10 business days prior
to the dividend payment or distribution. American Pioneer paid American
Progressive $1,000,000 and $500,000 in dividends during 1994 and 1995,
respectively. No dividends or distributions were made by American Progressive
during 1994 and 1995.

     8. REINSURANCE

     Life insurance risks which exceed the Company's retention or underwriting
limits are reinsured under yearly-renewable term insurance treaties to
unaffiliated insurers. Under yearly-renewable term treaties, the reinsuring
company receives premiums at an agreed upon rate and holds the required reserves
for its share of the risk on a yearly-renewable

                                      F-20


<PAGE>



term basis. A contingent liability exists with respect to reinsurance which may
become a liability of the Company in the unlikely event that the reinsurers
should be unable to meet the obligations which they assumed. The Company
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations
of credit risk to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
insolvencies. At December 31, 1995, reinsurance receivables with a total
carrying value of $7,886,768 were associated with two reinsurers, which
reinsurer was rated A+ by A.M. Best.

     A summary of reinsurance activity for the three years ended December 31,
1995 is presented below:

9.  SHORT-TERM DEBT

     On September 30, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with its
commercial bank, under which it borrowed $800,000 on a one year term loan, which
was extended by the Company for a second year. The borrowing under the agreement
was utilized to pay off the $400,000 borrowed under a prior $500,000 line of
credit with the same bank and as working capital for Universal and operating
expenses for WorldNet. The loan is secured by the pledge of 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Quincy, a subsidiary engaged in the insurance
brokerage business, the receivables of Quincy and WorldNet and 9.9% of the
outstanding common stock of American Progressive. As of December 31, 1995,
$800,000 was outstanding on this loan agreement. The loan bears interest at 2.0%
over prime.

11. UNIVERSAL HOLDING CORP. 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN:

     Effective April 1, 1992, the Company adopted the Universal Holding Corp.
401(k) Savings Plan ("Savings Plan"). The Savings Plan is a voluntary
contributory plan under which employees may elect to defer compensation for

                                      F-22


<PAGE>



federal income tax purposes under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986. The employee is entitled to participate in the Savings Plan by
contributing through payroll deductions up to 20% of the employee's
compensation. The Company may match the employee's contribution up to 1% of the
employee's compensation which contribution will be made with Company common
stock. As of December 31, 1995, 107,500 shares of the Company's common stock
were held by the Savings Plan.

     The participating employee is not taxed on these contributions until they
are distributed. Moreover, the employer's contributions vest at the rate of 25%
per plan year. Amounts credited to employee's accounts under the Savings Plan
are invested by the employer-appointed investment committee. Generally, a
participating employee is entitled to distributions from the Savings Plan upon
termination of employment, retirement, death or disability. Savings Plan
participants who qualify for distributions may receive a single lump sum, have
the assets transferred to another qualified plan or individual retirement
account, or receive a series of specified installment payments. Total matching
contributions by the Company under the Savings Plan were $28,049, $51,048 and
$42,325, in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK:

     For the three years ended December 31, 1995, the Company held unrated or

     The holdings of less-than-investment grade securities are widely
diversified and the investment in any one such security is currently less than
$1,000,000, which is approximately 0.6% of total assets.

13. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

          a.   Fixed maturities held to maturity and available for sale: For
               those securities held to maturity and available for sale, fair
               value equals quoted market price, if available. If a quoted
               market price is not available, fair value is estimated using
               quoted market prices for similar securities.

          b.   Equity securities: For equity securities carried at fair value,
               fair value equals quoted market price.

          c.   Cash and cash equivalents: For short-term investments, the
               carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

          d.   Investment contract liabilities: For annuity and universal life
               type contracts, cash surrender value is a reasonable estimate of
               fair value due to the deposit nature of the account.

          e.   Short term debt and notes payable: For short-term borrowings and
               notes payable, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of
               fair value due to their short-term nature.

                                      F-23

          f.   Accounts receivable and uncollected premiums: Accounts receivable
               and uncollected premiums are primarily insurance contract related
               receivables which are determined based upon the underlying
               insurance liabilities and added reinsurance amounts.

     The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments as of
December 31, 1994 and 1995 are as follows:

                                                       1994

          Notes payable..............       369,698                369,698

     (a) It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of policy loans as
they have no stated maturity and their rates are set at a fixed spread to
related policy liability rates. Policy loans are carried at the aggregate unpaid
principal balances in the consolidated balance sheets, and earn interest at
rates between 6% to 8%. Individual policy liabilities, in all cases, equal or
exceed outstanding policy loan balances.

     (b) Property tax liens are carried at cost. The determination of fair value
for these invested assets is not practical because there is no active trading
market for such invested assets. Individual liens in all cases are first
priority liens with collateral in excess of 300% of the carrying value of the
lien.

     (c) Mortgage loans are carried at the aggregate unpaid balances and the
fair market value was not determined as the amount involved was considered to be
immaterial.

     The interim financial data for 1995 vary from amounts previously reported
by the Company on Form 10-Q's due to a change in the application of FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The restatement did not affect
the amount of operating income before income taxes in any quarter and had no
impact on the annual financial statements.
