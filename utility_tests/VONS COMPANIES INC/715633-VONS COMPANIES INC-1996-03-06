                              PART I

ITEM 1: BUSINESS

General

     The Vons Companies, Inc. ("Vons" or the "Company") is one of
the largest supermarket chains in Southern California based on
sales.  As of December 31, 1995, Vons operated 328 supermarkets
and food and drug retail stores.  Vons also operates a fluid milk
processing facility, an ice cream plant, a bakery and
distribution facilities for meat, grocery, produce and general
merchandise.  Stores operate under the  "Vons"  and "Pavilions"
names.  The Company's marketing platform is built on offering the
customer greater value than found elsewhere by combining
competitive pricing with superior selection, quality, service and
convenience. 

     Vons grocery business was founded in 1906.  From 1969
until December 1985, it was owned, along with certain other
merchandising businesses, by Household International, Inc.  In
1985, these merchandising businesses were acquired in a leveraged
buyout by a newly formed corporation which kept the grocery
business and sold all of the other merchandising businesses.  The
newly formed corporation was subsequently merged in 1987 with and
into Allied Supermarkets, Inc., a Michigan corporation
("Allied"), and the surviving corporation was renamed The Vons
Companies, Inc., a Michigan corporation.  Simultaneously with the
merger, substantially all of the business previously operated by
Allied was sold to a company organized by the former management
of Allied, leaving the Company with operations located only
in Southern California, as they existed prior to the merger. 

     On August 29, 1988, the Company purchased substantially all
of the operations of Safeway, Inc. ("Safeway") in Southern
California.  At the time of the acquisition (the "Safeway
Acquisition"), these operations included 162 supermarkets and
manufacturing and distribution facilities.  As a result of the
Safeway Acquisition and other purchases of Vons common stock,
Safeway, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is Vons largest
shareholder, with approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of
Vons common stock.  Safeway is an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.

Strategic Repositioning and Restructuring

     In response to the weak economic environment in the regions
it serves and other factors having a negative impact on sales,
the Company commenced, in third quarter 1993, a strategic
repositioning program which emphasized lower everyday shelf
prices and improved customer service.  In addition, the Company
implemented a cost containment and strategic restructuring
program to partially offset the costs of the strategic
repositioning program.

     As part of the strategic repositioning program, the Company
introduced the "Vons Value Program" in January 1994.  Consistent
with the Vons Value Program, the 1995 marketing campaign
incorporated the slogan "Vons Is Value."  These programs
emphasize the Vons Value formula which combines competitive
prices with customer service and high quality products.  Newly
reduced prices, advertised weekly specials, free membership club
savings and double coupons are integral parts of the Vons
offering.  Another important component of the Vons Value Program
is an increase in the amount of labor allocated for customer
service and check-out which the Company believes has increased
customer satisfaction. 

     The cost containment and strategic restructuring program,
undertaken in 1993, included the accelerated closure of
underperforming facilities, a reduction in administrative and
support staff positions and the closure of a distribution
facility.  With the closure of the San Diego distribution
facility in 1995, substantially all of the cost containment and
strategic restructuring initiatives have been executed.

     The Company's programs are long-term strategies.  In
aggregate, these programs are initially intended to benefit sales
by funding lower prices and promotions, which in turn will
improve the Company's ability to achieve strong, sustainable
earnings growth.

Store Formats

     The Company operates under the Vons and Pavilions formats. 
Each format is designed for a different customer segment as
evidenced by the store location, appearance and product
offerings.  A key strategy of the Company is to tailor its store
and merchandise offerings to reflect its diverse customer base. 

     The Company supports its stores with centralized functions
for marketing, advertising, buying, real estate development,
management information systems, distribution, manufacturing,
accounting and administration to maximize operating leverage and
profitability.

     Both store formats, Vons and Pavilions,  offer extensive
assortments of food products, including departments for dry
groceries, produce, meat, seafood, dairy, wine and liquor.  The
majority of stores offer such service departments as hot
bakeries, service floral, delicatessens, service meat departments
and banking facilities.  While most Vons stores offer limited
assortments of general merchandise, including greeting cards and
health and beauty care items, many Pavilions stores offer a
larger health and beauty care department including cosmetics.
Selected stores offer a party shop, sausage and smoke shop, bagel
shop, sushi bar and high quality prepared Chinese food.
Approximately one-third of the stores offer full-service
pharmacies.

New Store Openings and Store Remodel Projects

     The Company will continue to augment sales growth through
the continuation of its new store opening program and ongoing
chainwide remodel program.  The Company plans to open 16 new
stores, including ten replacement stores, in 1996.  In 1995, the
Company maintained its goal of having 80% of its stores either
newly opened or remodeled within the preceding five years.

     The Company's new store opening program does not include the
effect of any possible store acquisition opportunities which
might arise in the future.

     Store remodel projects enable Vons to present a store
appearance consistent with Vons evolving store formats and to
continuously update the store base through the introduction,
where possible, of service departments and new merchandising
modules, which are intended to generate higher gross margins and
build store traffic.  Vons remodel program includes
remerchandising to reflect a contemporary design and decor
package including selected fixture replacements.  The Company
completed 37, 14 and 59 store remodel projects in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

     Vons capital expenditures for store projects were $130.5
million and $120.0 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  It is
anticipated that 1996 capital expenditures for Vons store
projects will be funded out of cash provided by operations,
revolving debt and/or through operating leases.  The capital
expenditure program has substantial flexibility and is subject to
revision based on various factors, including but not limited to
business conditions, changing time constraints, cash flow
requirements and competitive factors.

     The following table shows, by store format, the number of
Vons stores in operation at the end of each of the years
indicated and the number of stores opened, closed or converted
during each year:<PAGE>

     In response to negative sales trends, the Company critically
assessed the performance of its entire store network in 1993 and
1994 and identified 27 underperforming stores for closure, which
included the Tianguis and EXPO store formats.  Underperforming
stores are stores which do not satisfy the Company's strategic
requirements for growth, profitability, customer satisfaction,
market area penetration and/or other factors.  Management
believed that these stores would not meet these requirements at
any time in the foreseeable future, even with a significant
commitment of management and financial resources.  In
consideration of the Company's leaner management structure as a
result of its restructuring efforts and its commitment to its new
store capital program, the Company determined that its available
resources would be better utilized on the remaining store base. 
Additionally, the Company closes stores based on replacement
strategies or lease renewals.  Management expects to continue
these types of store closures in the future.

Marketing and Competition

     Southern California is one of the largest and most
competitive markets for retail grocery sales in the United
States.  Vons store network ranges from Fresno on the north to
the Mexican border on the south and from the Pacific Ocean on the
west to Clark County, Nevada on the east.  This market area
includes Fresno, Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Madera, Mono,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo,
Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties in California as well
as Clark County, Nevada. 

     Vons faces a number of major as well as smaller competitors
in its market.  The Company believes that in recent years the
increase in the number of competitors' stores and the entrance of
new competitors in its market area have intensified competition.
In addition, convenience stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers,
specialty stores, warehouse stores, membership stores as well as
discount stores and fast food and other restaurants compete for
the same customers.  This trend is expected to continue.  

     The merger of two of the Company's major competitors, Food 4
Less Supermarkets, Inc. and Ralphs Grocery Company (the "Ralphs
Merger") was completed on June 14, 1995.  This merger has
resulted in a change in the composition of the Company's
competitors as certain trade names were eliminated and store
format conversions occurred.  In addition in February 1996,
certain of the Smith's Food and Drug Centers in Southern
California were sold to other supermarket operators including 
the Company and others were closed awaiting sale for 
supermarket or other use (the "Smith's Southern 
California Disposition").  The Company does not believe 
that the effects of the Ralphs Merger or the Smith's 
Southern California Disposition on the already competitive
marketplace will have a material impact on the Company's 
sales and earnings prospects.

     Both of the Company's store formats utilize promotional
buying opportunities to pass along special values to their
customers.  Also, stores offer customers additional savings
through the use of double coupons, advertised weekly specials
and a free membership club.  This club offers customers
special values and programs and enables the Company and its
vendors to target specific customer segments and better
understand household buying behavior.  Vons is the only operator
in its market area to offer this free membership club to its
customers.  Vons marketing and communication strategy is based on
a combination of direct mail, newspaper, television and radio.

     The principal competitive factors in the retail supermarket
business include price, fast friendly service, quality of
products, breadth of product assortment, store condition and
store location.  Customers, in response to recessionary
conditions in Southern California, are placing greater emphasis
on price.  Vons has responded to this trend through the Vons
Value Program which entailed lowering prices on over 12,000
items in 1994.  Vons believes that its strength is its ability to
deliver a high value shopping experience through a blend of high
quality products, superior customer service and product
assortments at competitive prices combined with VonsClub, double
coupons and advertised weekly specials.

Merchandising and Store Operations

     An average store offers approximately 30,000 to 40,000
merchandise items.  Vons has historically emphasized brand-name
grocery products and quality and freshness in its produce, meat
and seafood selections.  Vons carries private brand
products as well as its proprietary Jerseymaid dairy products in
the grocery, delicatessen, frozen food, bakery, health and beauty
care and general merchandise departments of its stores.
The private brand "Select" was introduced in 1994.  This upscale
private brand offers additional opportunities for sales and
profits.  In 1994, the Company set a goal of increasing private
brand sales to 16% of sales.  In 1995, the Company surpassed this
goal with private brand sales accounting for 17% of sales.  The
Company intends to increase this percentage over time through
marketing its branded items and introducing additional
private brand items including those under the "Select" label.

     In conjunction with its restructuring program, Vons is
committed to being the low cost operator in the market areas it
serves.  Vons strategy is to continue to decrease its operating
costs through aggressive buying, introduction and maintenance
of various merchandising and technological innovations and
stringent cost controls.

     The Company is actively pursuing productivity and cost
reduction initiatives as part of an industry-wide effort known as
Efficient Consumer Response ("ECR").  As part of this effort, an
information-driven support system which tracks scanned purchases,
advertising and promotions on a store-specific basis is being
installed to provide information for efficient ordering.  This
system also assists category managers to achieve their goal of
efficient assortment which reduces the number of products
offered without compromising customer satisfaction.  A
neighborhood-specific product assortment with efficient space
management improves in-stock conditions and reduces inventory.

     Vons has developed systems to give store managers more
control over store merchandising needs.  The Company improves the
consistency of store operations through its policy to develop
store managers internally.  All store managers participate in a
bonus program which is based primarily upon their individual
store sales and profit as well and are included in the Company's
stock option program.

     Through technological innovation, Vons has experienced
improved operational efficiency.  All Vons stores are equipped
with an electronic receiving system for products delivered
directly to stores by vendors, electronic time and attendance
reporting and computerized labor scheduling.  Vons central
buying office monitors warehouse inventory levels and product
movement daily for buyer analysis and action.  Vons utilizes a
category management system which combines the buying and
merchandising functions.  The Company has upgraded these systems
to enable category managers to more effectively analyze data. 

Support and Other Services

     In 1995, the Company operated a fluid milk processing
facility, an ice cream plant and a central bakery.

     Vons operates distribution facilities in California, located
in El Monte and Santa Fe Springs.  The Company closed its San
Diego facility in third quarter 1995, eliminating redundant
distribution capacity.  The Company utilizes computerized
inventory and labor management systems throughout its
distribution network.  As of December 31, 1995, Vons operated
a fleet of 441 tractors and 1,160 trailers, of which 105 and 182,
respectively, were leased and the remainder were owned.  The
Company's transportation department utilizes on-board electronic
trip recorders to monitor travel times and a sophisticated
computerized routing system.  Approximately 77% of store sales in
1995 represented inventories supplied by these distribution
facilities, and the balance was delivered directly to the stores
by vendors.

Governmental Regulation

     Vons is subject to regulation by a variety of governmental
agencies, including the California Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control, the California State Board of Pharmacy, the
California Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state and
local health departments and weights and measures agencies. 

     In connection with the Safeway Acquisition, Vons, Safeway
and certain other parties entered into a consent order (the
"Consent Order") with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
whereby Vons divested three retail grocery stores and Safeway
divested nine retail grocery stores to competitors in Southern
California.  The Consent Order, among other things, also limits
for ten years the acquisition by Vons of existing supermarkets
from any other party in certain trade areas where both Vons and
Safeway operated stores prior to the Safeway Acquisition,
allowing a specified number of such acquisitions within any 12-
month period in some areas and prohibiting acquisitions in
others.

     In connection with the Williams Bros. acquisition, the
Company entered into a consent order with the FTC whereby the
Company divested one of the Williams Bros. store locations and
among other things, agreed to seek FTC approval before acquiring
any supermarket, or any interest in any company owning a
supermarket, in San Luis Obispo County for ten years.

Employees

     At December 31, 1995, Vons employed approximately 10,800
full-time and 18,800 part-time employees as follows:

     In the fall of 1994, the Company negotiated a four-year
contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters'
Union. 

     In the fall of 1995, the Company negotiated a four-year
contract with the United Food and Commercial Workers'
International Unions.

     Like its major competitors, pursuant to its various
collective bargaining agreements, Vons contributes to Taft-
Hartley multi-employer, joint pension plans.  Under pertinent
law, a participating employer which totally or partially
withdraws from such a pension plan could be liable for unfunded
vested benefits, which could be substantial.

Insurance

     Vons carries insurance customary in the supermarket industry
to protect the Company against catastrophic loss, including
earthquake insurance.  The Company is approved in both California
and Nevada to self-insure workers' compensation and general
liability exposures and maintains third-party insurance for loss
exposures in excess of self-insured retentions and deductibles.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

     As of December 31, 1995, the Company leased 239 of its
stores and owned 89 of its stores.  At December 31, 1995, 204 of
the Company's leases provided for contingent rental based on a
percentage of sales over specified amounts, which typically range
from 1.0% to 1.5% of total gross sales, less amounts expended for
common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance; the
balance had no percentage rent clauses.  Store leases have
various expiration dates through 2019.  Renewal options range up
to 40 years.  The following table lists the number of such
store leases for open stores that are due to expire (assuming
exercise of all renewal options) in each of the specified
periods:

</TABLE>

     The Company has a $113.0 million mortgage loan on 51
properties requiring monthly principal and interest payments
of approximately $1.0 million with a one-time payment of
approximately $111.0 million in July 1997.  The Company has other
real estate notes and mortgages covering seven properties
totaling $13.5 million due in varying monthly installments with
maturity dates from 1997 to 2009.

     The Company's stores are usually located in active shopping
centers and generally have several co-tenants, which typically
include a drugstore; although the newer stores, which are usually
food and drug combination stores, tend to be in shopping centers
without drugstores.

     The Company owns distribution and manufacturing facilities
in El Monte, California, which are located on approximately 63
acres of land.  The El Monte facilities include two warehouses
with an aggregate of 764,000 square feet and a meat cooking
facility, including a warehouse with an aggregate of 256,000
square feet.

     The Company leases a distribution facility located in Santa
Fe Springs, California.  This distribution facility includes
several warehouses and a maintenance operation.  The facility
covers approximately 1,040,000 square feet located on
approximately 78 acres of land.  The lease expires in 2001 with
two five-year and one one-year options to extend.

     The Company operates a 450,000-square-foot forward buy
warehouse located in the City of Industry, California under a
lease expiring in 1996 with two three-year options to extend. 
The Company also leases a 95,000-square-foot frozen food
distribution facility in Ontario, California under a lease
expiring in 1996 with three six-month options to extend.  The
Company closed its distribution facility in San Diego, California
in third quarter 1995.  The lease on the San Diego
facility is scheduled to expire in 2002, and the Company is in
the process of disposing of this property.

     The Company owns a 244,000-square-foot building in Arcadia,
California, used for its corporate administrative offices.

     The manufacturing operations consist of a fluid milk
processing facility, an ice cream plant and a bakery, all leased
and located in the City of Commerce, California.  The leases for
the fluid milk processing facility and ice cream plant expire in
1996 with two five-year options to extend.  The lease for the
bakery expires in 1997 with three five-year options to extend.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In addition to routine litigation incidental to the conduct
of its business, the Company has been named in a number of
lawsuits in state and Federal courts in Washington, Nevada, Idaho
and California arising from claims of food-borne illness that
allegedly was contracted from the consumption of hamburgers at
certain Jack-In-The-Box restaurants in early 1993.  The
restaurants involved were either directly operated by Jack-In-
The-Box, a division of Foodmaker, Inc. ("Foodmaker"), or through
franchisees.  The suits allege that the hamburger patties in
question were processed by the Company before being cooked and
served by a Jack-In-The-Box outlet.  The plaintiffs in these
actions seek unspecified damages for illnesses ranging from minor
diarrhea to serious kidney and intestinal infection.  Several
deaths are alleged to have resulted from the incidents and, in
those cases, the plaintiffs seek damages for wrongful death.  The
Company is insured against various losses, including those for
bodily injury.

     The Company also has been named as a defendant in a suit
filed on July 2, 1993, in the Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of San Diego, by franchisees of
Foodmaker who operate Jack-In-The-Box outlets in various states. 
Also named as defendants were Foodmaker and a number of meat
suppliers and slaughterhouses.  The complaint seeks an estimated
$100 million for lost profits and compensation for an alleged
reduction in the value of the franchisees' businesses, as well as
unspecified damages for alleged emotional distress.  On July 19,
1993, Foodmaker filed a cross-complaint against the Company and
subsequently voluntarily dismissed a separate action which it had
previously brought.  The cross-complaint asserts various tort and
contract theories and seeks, among other things, indemnity as
well as lost profits and compensation for a reduction in
Foodmaker's stock price.  Foodmaker's cross-complaint seeks
unspecified damages, although the Company has been advised that
Foodmaker may potentially claim damages of approximately $400
million, including the aforesaid claims of the franchisees.

     The Company is vigorously contesting the lawsuits against it
and has filed its own cross-complaint against Foodmaker and
certain of its franchisees seeking damages in an amount
substantially higher than the amount of damages claimed by
Foodmaker.

     In addition to the cases discussed above, the Company, along
with the other major supermarket chains in Southern California,
has been named as a defendant in three nearly identical class
action lawsuits filed in late November and early December 1992 in
the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of
Los Angeles.  In these cases the plaintiffs alleged claims for
antitrust violations, restraint of trade and false advertising in
connection with the pricing of fluid milk in Los Angeles County,
seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  While
admitting no liability, the Company has entered into a proposed
settlement agreement with respect to these cases, subject to the
approval of the court.

     The Company believes that the above-described lawsuits are
unlikely to result in liability which would be material to the
consolidated financial position of the Company.

ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to the security holders of
the Company for a vote during the quarter ended December 31,

     In late 1993, Vons began a company-wide cost containment and
strategic restructuring program to improve sales and
profitability.  The program generated cost savings which were
reinvested in shelf pricing, promotions and customer service. 
The most significant savings were generated from the accelerated
closure of 26 underperforming stores, the elimination of 700
administrative and support staff positions and the closing of a
distribution facility (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere herein).  With the closing of the
Company's San Diego distribution facility in third quarter of
1995, substantially all of the cost containment and strategic
restructuring initiatives have been executed.  However, key to
the Company's ongoing strategy is its commitment to cost
containment, productivity and efficiency in order to maintain its
competitive position.

     The Company's marketing focus and its commitment to a low
cost structure are long-term strategies, which are initially
intended to benefit sales by funding lower prices, which in turn
will improve the Company's ability to achieve strong, sustainable
earnings growth.

     The 1995 merger of two of the Company's major 
competitors, Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. and Ralphs 
Grocery Company, resulted in a change in the composition 
of the Company's competitors as certain trade names were
eliminated and store format conversions occurred.  The 
Company does not believe that the merger or its effect 
on the already competitive marketplace will have a 
material impact on the Company's sales and earnings 
prospects.  

     Comparison of Fifty-Two Weeks Ended December 31, 1995 with
     Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 1, 1995

     Sales.  Sales for 1995 were $5,070.7 million, an increase 
of $74.1 million, or 1.5%, over 1994.  Same store sales 
increased 3.5% over 1994 sales.  The increase in sales 
reflects the favorable consumer response to improved 
customer service, the "Vons Is Value" marketing campaign 
and the slowly improving economic environment in Southern
California offset by competitive new store, remodel and
conversion activity.  In 1995, the Company opened 13 new 
stores, closed 19 stores and completed 37 store remodel 
projects.

     Costs and Expenses.  Costs and expenses for 1995 
were $4,876.6 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 
0.1%, over the comparable 1994 period.

     Cost of sales and buying and occupancy expenses 
as a percentage of sales for 1995 were 74.8%, a decrease 
of 0.6  percentage point from 1994.  The impact of lower 
prices has been more than offset by decreased product 
costs achieved through better utilization of category 
management, more effective promotional offerings and 
increased private brand sales.

     Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of 
sales were 21.1% in 1995, comparable to 1994, which 
included a $5.0 million insurance deductible charge related 
to the Northridge earthquake.  This reflects higher 
service levels in the stores as well as negotiated union 
wage rate increases which were offset by a more efficient 
mix of store labor.

     The Company recorded restructuring charges of $33.0 
million, or $.45 per share, in 1994 (see Note 14 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere 
herein).  

     Operating Income.  Operating income for 1995 was 
$194.1 million, an increase of $68.3 million, or 54.3%, 
over 1994.  Operating margin increased to 3.8% in 1995 
versus 2.5% in 1994.  Excluding the 1994 restructuring 
charges, results for 1994 were $158.8 million, or 3.2% 
of sales.  These increases primarily reflect an increase 
in gross margin.  Operating income before depreciation 
and amortization of property, amortization of goodwill 
and other assets, LIFO charge, earthquake deductible 
and restructuring charges ("FIFO EBITDA") was $315.0 
million, or 6.2% of sales, in 1995 compared with $284.3 
million, or 5.7% of sales, in 1994.

     Interest Expense.  Net interest expense for 1995 was 
$67.3 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 4.9%, from 
1994.  This decrease was due to lower average revolving 
debt borrowings partially offset by higher weighted 
average interest cost on revolving debt.  The ratio of 
FIFO EBITDA to net interest expense increased to 4.7 times 
in 1995 versus 4.0 times in 1994.

     Income Tax Provision.  The income tax provision in 1995 
was $58.7 million, or a 46.3% effective tax rate.  The income 
tax provision in 1994 was $28.4 million, or a 51.6% effective 
tax rate.  Excluding the restructuring charge, the effective 
tax rate for 1994 was 48%.  The decrease in the 1995 effective
tax rate reflects the increase in income before income 
tax provision.  The effective tax rate is impacted by
amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired, the
majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes.

     Income.  Net income for 1995 was $68.1 million, or $1.55 
per share, compared with net income of $26.6 million, or $.61 
per share, for 1994.  In addition to improved operating results,
this increase reflects the impact of the 1994 restructuring
charges of $33.0 million, or $.45 per share. 

     New Pronouncements by Financial Accounting Standards 
Board.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 
("SFAS No. 123") "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" 
in October 1995 which is effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1995.  SFAS No. 123 
encourages companies to adopt the fair value method of 
accounting for employee stock compensation plans.  SFAS 
No. 123 allows companies to retain the current method of
accounting for stock compensation as set forth in 
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for 
Stock Issued to Employees."  SFAS No. 123 requires expanded
footnote disclosure for both methods of accounting.  The 
Company expects to retain the current method of accounting.
Accordingly, the expected impact of SFAS No. 123 on the 
Company's consolidated financial statements is expanded 
footnote disclosure.
 
     Comparison of Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 1, 1995 with
     Fifty-Two Weeks Ended January 2, 1994

     Sales.  Sales for 1994 were $5.0 billion, a decrease of
$77.9 million, or 1.5%, from 1993.  Same store sales decreased
2.4% from 1993 sales.  Sales reflect reduced prices as a result
of the Vons Value Program, deflation in perishables, the
continuing weak overall economic environment in Southern
California, competitive new store and remodel activity and the
diminished customer base in neighborhoods impacted by the
Northridge earthquake.  In 1994, the Company opened six new
stores, closed 17 stores and completed 14 store remodel projects.

     Costs and Expenses.  Costs and expenses for 1994 were $4.9
billion, a decrease of $67.9 million, or 1.4%, from 1993. 

     Cost of sales and buying and occupancy expenses as a
percentage of sales for 1994 were 75.4%, an increase of 0.5
percentage point over 1993.  The increase reflects the impact of
lower prices, increased promotional activities, and higher
occupancy costs, primarily depreciation expense related 
to the capital expenditure program.  The impact of price
reductions in 1994 was partially offset by better inventory
management and more effective purchasing initiatives 
undertaken in connection with the strategic restructuring
program.

     Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of 
sales were 21.1% in 1994, an increase of 0.1 percentage 
point over 1993.  This increase reflects a $5.0 million 
insurance deductible charge related to the Northridge 
earthquake.  Increased store labor expenses, related to the 
Vons Value Program, were substantially offset by a decrease 
in administrative expenses as a result of the reductions in 
work force and other cost savings initiatives in connection 
with the strategic restructuring program.  

     The Company recorded restructuring charges of $33.0 
million, or $.45 per share, and $56.9 million, or $.77 per 
share, in 1994 and 1993, respectively (see Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein).

     Operating Income.  Operating income for 1994 was 
$125.8 million, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 7.4%, from 
1993.  Operating margin decreased to 2.5% in 1994 versus 2.7% 
in 1993.  Excluding restructuring charges, results for 1994 
were $158.8 million, or 3.2% of sales, compared with $192.7
million, or 3.8% of sales for 1993. These decreases were 
due primarily to lower sales and lower gross margin as a 
result of price reductions and increased promotional 
activity.  FIFO EBITDA was $284.3 million, or 5.7% of sales, 
in 1994 compared with $305.8 million, or 6.0% of sales, in 
1993.

     Interest Expense.  Net interest expense for 1994 was 
$70.8 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 7.3%, over 
1993.  This increase was due to higher weighted average 
interest cost on revolving debt and higher average debt
borrowings partially offset by repurchases of higher 
interest cost subordinated debt.  The ratio of FIFO EBITDA 
to net interest expense decreased to 4.0 times in 1994 versus 
4.6 times in 1993.

     Income Tax Provision.  The income tax provision in 1994 
was $28.4 million, or a 51.6% effective tax rate.  The income 
tax provision in 1993 was $36.8 million, or a 52.7% effective 
tax rate.  The effective tax rate in both years was impacted 
by a decrease in earnings before restructuring charges, which 
was not offset by a comparable decrease in amortization of 
excess cost over net assets acquired, the majority of which 
is not deductible for tax purposes.  The 1993 effective tax 
rate was also impacted by a $2.0 million deferred tax 
provision which increased the prior year deferred income 
tax balance to the new Federal statutory tax rate. 

     Income.  Net income for 1994 was $26.6 million, or $.61 
per share, compared with net income of $31.6 million, or $.73 
per share, for 1993.  Net income includes restructuring 
charges of $33.0 million, or $.45 per share, and $56.9 
million, or $.77 per share, in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  
The decrease in net income excluding restructuring charges 
was caused by the decline in sales and gross margin, 
primarily due to price decreases and increased promotional
activity.  Net income for 1993 included an extraordinary 
after tax charge of $1.4 million, or $.03 per share, arising 
from debt refinancing.

     Labor Contract Status

     In the fall of 1994, the Company negotiated a four-year
contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union. 
In the fall of 1995, the Company negotiated a four-year 
contract with the Southern California United Food and 
Commercial Workers International Unions.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows
from  operations and available credit under its Revolving Loan.
Management believes that these sources adequately provide for 
its working capital, capital expenditure and debt service 
needs. 

     Net cash provided by operating activities was $239.4 
million in 1995 compared with $179.8 million in 1994.  This
change primarily reflects an increase in net income and 
changes in  assets and liabilities generally reflecting 
the timing of receipts and disbursements.  The ratio of 
current assets to current liabilities was 0.76 to 1 at 
December 31, 1995 compared with 0.83 to 1 at January 1, 1995.
The decrease in the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities reflects the maturity of $15.6 million of the 
6-5/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures in May 1996.

     Net cash used for investing activities was $91.2 million 
in 1995 compared with $117.5 million in 1994.  This decrease
reflects lower than anticipated 1995 capital expenditures 
since certain store projects were delayed until 1996.  Total
capital expenditures in 1995, including the present value 
of commitments under operating leases, were $142.6 million.

     The Company anticipates that total 1996 capital expenditures
will be approximately $225 million, of which approximately 
$160 million will be cash capital expenditures and approximately
$65 million will represent the present value of commitments
under operating leases.  This capital expenditure level
contemplates the opening of approximately 16 new stores,
including ten replacement stores, and the completion of
approximately 30 store remodel projects.  The capital 
expenditure program has substantial flexibility and is 
subject to revision based on various factors; including, 
but not limited to, business conditions, changing time
constraints, cash flow requirements and competitive factors.

     It is anticipated that 1996 cash capital expenditures 
will be funded out of cash provided by operations, the 
Revolving Loan, and/or through operating leases, although 
no assurance can be given that such sources will be 
sufficient.  In the near term, if Vons were to reduce
substantially or postpone its capital expenditure program, 
there would be no substantial impact on current operations 
and it is likely that more cash would be available for 
debt servicing.  In the long-term, if these programs 
were substantially reduced, in the Company's opinion, 
its operating business and ultimately its cash flow would 
be adversely impacted.

     Net cash used by financing activities was $147.8 million 
in 1995 compared with $61.8 million in 1994.  The level of
borrowings under the Company's revolving debt is 
dependent primarily upon cash flows from operations and 
capital expenditure requirements.

     At December 31, 1995, the Company's revolving debt
borrowings totaled $177.8 million and the Company had 
available unused credit of $446.4 million.  The weighted 
average interest cost for 1995 on the Company's revolving 
debt was 7.5%.  At December 31, 1995, the corresponding 
bank prime rate was 8.5%.

     The Company's involvement with derivative financial
instruments has been limited to interest rate cap contracts 
to reduce the impact of increases in interest rates on 
revolving debt.

     Impact of Changing Prices

     Vons primary costs, inventory and labor, are affected 
by a number of factors that are beyond the Company's 
control, including availability and price of merchandise, 
the competitive climate and regional economic conditions.  
As is typical of the supermarket industry, the Company 
has generally been able to maintain margins by adjusting 
its retail prices, but competitive conditions may from time 
to time render it unable to do so while maintaining its 
market share.

     Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 


     Note 1. Basis of Presentation 

     At December 31, 1995, the Company operated 328 
supermarkets and food and drug combination retail stores 
under the names Vons and Pavilions.  The Company's 
marketing territory includes Southern and Central California 
and Clark County, Nevada.  The Company also operates a fluid 
milk processing facility, an ice cream plant, a bakery, 
and distribution facilities for meat, grocery, produce 
and general merchandise to support the store network. 

     The Company's fiscal year is based on a 52-53 week 
fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31.  
Fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993 included 52 weeks which 
ended on December 31, 1995, January 1, 1995 and 
January 2, 1994, respectively.  

     Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1995 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1995.  Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS No. 121")
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for 
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" in March 1995 which 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.
SFAS No. 121 establishes accounting standards for the impairment
of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles and
goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and 
for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles 
to be disposed of.  The Company adopted the provisions of 
SFAS No. 121 in fiscal 1995 and experienced no financial 
impact on the consolidated financial statements.   

     Basis of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts 
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

  Inventories.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost 
or market.  The cost of substantially all inventories is
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  
 
     Property and Depreciation.  Property and equipment,
including assets under capital leases, are recorded at cost 
and depreciated or amortized over forty years for buildings, 
up to ten years for fixtures and equipment and generally 
between fifteen and twenty-five years, but not to exceed 
the lease term, for leasehold improvements using principally 
the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes 
and accelerated methods for tax purposes.  Major renewals 
and improvements are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs 
which do not improve or extend the life of the respective 
assets are charged to expense. 
 
     Amortization of Intangible Assets.  The excess of cost 
over net assets acquired is amortized on a straight-line 
basis over forty years.  The Company assesses the 
recoverability of the excess of cost over net assets 
acquired based on forecasted operating income.  Other 
noncurrent assets include an agreement not to compete acquired
in connection with the 1992 acquisition of the Williams Bros.
Markets, Inc. supermarket business.  The agreement not to 
compete is amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. 
     
     Income Tax Provision.  The income tax provision includes
amounts related to current taxable income and deferred income
taxes.  A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined 
by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to the 
expected reversals of the cumulative temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for
financial statement and income tax purposes.  The deferred 
income tax provision is measured by the change in the net
deferred income tax asset or liability during the year.  
The Company accounts for general business tax credits using 
the flow-through method. 
 
     Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share.  Income 
per common and common equivalent share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each year and
common equivalent shares arising from stock options when the
effect is dilutive. 

     Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The
fair value of the Company's financial instruments is based on 
the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on 
the current rates offered to the Company for financial
instruments of the same remaining maturities. 

     Derivatives.  Premiums paid for purchased interest rate 
cap contracts are amortized to interest expense over the terms 
of the contracts.  Unamortized premiums are included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
Amounts earned under the interest rate cap contracts are
reflected as a reduction of interest expense.
 
     Note 3. Inventories 

     The excess of estimated current cost over LIFO carrying
value of inventories was $32.3 million and $27.4 million 
at December 31, 1995 and January 1, 1995, respectively. 
Application of the LIFO method resulted in a charge to 
cost of sales, buying and occupancy of $4.9 million, 
$2.3 million and $3.6 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

</TABLE> 

     On February 17, 1995, the Company entered into an agreement
with a group of banks for a $625 million Revolving Loan Agreement
(the "Revolving Loan").  The Revolving Loan replaces the
Company's $475 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving
Credit Facility") and $150 million Senior Unsecured Term Loan
Facility (the "Term Loan Facility").  The Revolving Loan expires
on February 17, 2000; however, it provides that the Company may
request that the banks extend the maturity date by one year
beginning in September 1997 and each year thereafter.  Interest
for the revolving debt is at prime or Eurodollar rate plus
designated amounts.  At the Company's option, the revolving debt
may be used to support commercial paper borrowings, other
unsecured bank borrowings and standby letters of credit 
outside the revolving debt.  At December 31, 1995, borrowings
under the Revolving Loan were $177.8 million and available 
unused credit under the Revolving Loan was $446.4 million. 
Weighted average interest costs for 1995, including commitment
fees, for the Revolving Loan, Revolving Credit Facility and for
the Term Loan Facility were 7.5%.  At December 31, 1995, the
corresponding bank prime rate was 8.5%.  Commitment fees under
the Revolving Loan and Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities
were $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million for 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

     The Company's involvement with derivative financial
instruments has been limited to interest rate cap contracts 
to reduce the impact of increases in interest rates on 
revolving debt.  The contracts hedge principal amounts of 
$250 million for 1994, $200 million for 1995, and 
$100 million for 1996 and 1997 of interest rate exposure 
in excess of an approximate 8.375% effective borrowing rate 
under the revolving debt.  The Company records interest 
expense or interest income related to interest rate cap 
contracts on a monthly basis.  

     The Company's $113.0 million mortgage loan requires 
monthly principal and interest payments of approximately 
$1 million with a one-time payment of approximately $111 
million in July 1997. 

     The indenture related to the 6-5/8% Senior 
Subordinated Debentures (the "6-5/8% Debt") provides for
mandatory redemptions.  As of December 31, 1995, $15.6 
million, $25.0 million and $37.5 million are due on 
May 15, 1996, May 15, 1997 and May 15, 1998, respectively.
Interest on the 6-5/8% Debt is payable semiannually on 
May 15 and November 15.  The 6-5/8% Debt may be redeemed 
at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest.  The 6-5/8% Debt was issued at a discount which is
being amortized over the related term of the indebtedness. 

     The indenture related to the 9-5/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes (the "9-5/8% Debt") due April 1, 2002 provides for
principal repayment at maturity.  Interest on the 9-5/8% 
Debt is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1.  
The 9-5/8% Debt may be redeemed at the Company's option 
any time on or after April 1, 1997, at varying percentages 
above par of the principal amount plus accrued interest.  
The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or
sinking fund payments with respect to the 9-5/8% Debt prior 
to maturity. 

     The indenture related to the 8-3/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes (the "8-3/8% Debt") due October 1, 1999 provides 
for principal repayment at maturity.  Interest on the 8-3/8% 
Debt is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1.  
The 8-3/8% Debt may be redeemed at the Company's option 
any time on or after October 1, 1997, at 100% of the 
principal amount plus accrued interest.  The Company 
is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking 
fund payments with respect to the 8-3/8% Debt prior to maturity. 

     At December 31, 1995 and January 1, 1995, the carrying 
value of all financial instruments approximated fair value.

     During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company early retired
through repurchase and/or redemption $2.6 million, $6.8 million
and $27.1 million, respectively, of subordinated debt.  
These repurchases resulted in an extraordinary after tax 
charge of $1.4 million in 1993.

     The Company's debt agreements contain various 
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
payment or prepayment of senior subordinated and 
subordinated debt, investments, acquisitions, capital
expenditures, dividends, common stock redemptions and 
purchases and dispositions of assets.  The covenants also 
require the Company to meet certain shareholders' equity 
levels, debt leverage levels and fixed charge coverage 
ratios which can vary each fiscal year.  The Company is 
in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 1995. 
Under its most restrictive debt agreement, the Company had 
$83.0 million available for dividends and distributions at
December 31, 1995.  

     Principal payments required in future years are as 
follows (in millions of dollars):

     Note 7. Leases 

     The Company currently leases certain of its stores,
distribution facilities, vehicles and equipment for periods 
up to 50 years with various renewal options.  The majority 
of such leases are noncancellable operating leases.  Certain
operating and capital leases require contingent rentals 
based upon a percentage of sales over a specified amount.  
Rental expense under operating leases was as follows 
(in millions of dollars):

totaled $77.3 million at December 31, 1995. 

     Effective September 1993, the Company became a partner 
of a California general partnership.  This partnership has
obligations for 16 retail leases for periods up to 21 years 
with various renewal options.  It is the partnership's intent 
to assign or sublease its leasehold interest in all of these
sites.  Future minimum lease payments of the partnership 
under noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 1995

     Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans 

     The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for 
all nonunion employees.  An employee's benefit is based on 
years of credited service and the employee's final average 
pay calculated on the highest five years of compensation 
during the last ten years of employment.  The Company's 
funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum 
annual contribution required by Internal Revenue 
Service regulations. 

     The following table sets forth the defined benefit 
pension plan's funded status and amounts recognized in 
the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1995
and January 1, 1995 (in millions of dollars):

    The Company's supplemental executive retirement plan 
provides supplemental income payments for certain officers 
during retirement.  Total pension expense for all plans was 
$3.4 million, $5.1 million and $3.6 million for 1995, 1994 
and 1993, respectively. 

     The Company's contributory profit sharing plan for 
nonunion employees qualifies under Section 401(k) of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  For 1995, the Company's contribution 
to the profit sharing plan was equal to six percent of 
each eligible employee's pay.  In future years, the 
Company's contribution will be five percent of each 
eligible employee's pay plus a one percent matching 
contribution for each eligible employee who elects to 
contribute at least one percent of their pay.  For 1995, 
1994, and 1993 total expense related to the Company's 
profit sharing plan was $7.6 million, $5.3 million and 
$4.3 million, respectively.      

     The Company sponsors a retiree medical plan covering
substantially all nonunion employees who retire under 
certain age and service requirements.  The retiree medical 
plan provides outpatient, inpatient and various other 
covered services.  Participants in the retiree medical plan 
who retire after June 30, 1990 receive a benefit based upon 
years of service and a benefit value determined by the Company 
at the time of retirement.  Effective January 1, 1995, the
Company adopted modifications in its retiree medical plan 
which reduced the net retiree medical plan cost.  Unused 
benefits may be indexed each year to the social security 
cost of living, up to a maximum of 4.0%.  Such benefits 
are funded from the Company's general assets.  The Company 
has the right to modify or terminate the plan. 

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for 
the retiree medical plan as of December 31, 1995 and 
January 1, 1995 was as follows (in millions of dollars):

     For measurement purposes, a 7.0% increase in the cost 
of covered retiree medical benefits was assumed for 1995.  
The rate declined to 6.0% in 1996, and remained at that 
level thereafter.  A 1.0% increase in the retiree medical 
cost trend rate would increase the retiree medical benefit
obligation at December 31, 1995 by $.6 million and the 
1995 annual expense by $.1 million.  The weighted 
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated 
retiree medical benefit obligation was 7.25% and 8.5% at 
December 31, 1995 and January 1, 1995, respectively.  The 
net retiree medical plan cost for 1995, 1994 and 1993 
included the following components (in millions of dollars):

     The Company contributes to multi-employer joint 
pension plans and health and welfare plans administered 
by various trustees.  Contributions to these plans are based 
upon negotiated labor contracts.  The pension plans may be 
deemed to be defined benefit plans.  Information relating 
to accumulated benefits and fund assets as they may be 
allocable to the Company at December 31, 1995 is not 
available.  Total pension expense for the union plans was 
$19.8 million, $22.3 million and $30.3 million for 1995, 1994 
and 1993,  respectively.  The health and welfare plans provide
medical, dental and other benefits to certain employees covered
by union contracts.  Total health and welfare expense for 
these plans was $108.6 million, $125.9 million and $107.1 
million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.<PAGE>

     The Federal tax returns for all of the Company's fiscal
periods ended subsequent to and including December 31, 1989 
are open for examination by the Internal Revenue Service 
(the "IRS").  Additionally, certain tax returns of entities
acquired by the Company for earlier tax years are open for
examination by the IRS.  Management believes that any 
adjustments arising out of the examinations for which the 
Company would be liable would not have a material effect on 
the Company's consolidated financial position.  
 
     Note 10. Related Party Transactions 

     The Company leases a distribution facility from a 
California general partnership whose general partners are Vons
and a Texas general partnership, of which a director of the
Company is a general partner.  Vons and the Texas general
partnership each have a 50% interest in the California 
general partnership.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the 
Company paid rent of $1.9 million per year from which the
partnership distributed $250,000, $70,000 and $160,000 to 
the Texas general partnership in such years, respectively.  
This warehouse was closed in third quarter 1995 although 
rental obligations continue through 2002.

     A wholly owned subsidiary of Safeway owns approximately 
35% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company.  Safeway 
and its affiliates sold certain inventory and other items to 
the Company for an aggregate amount during 1995, 1994 and 1993 
of approximately $27.0 million, $21.3 million and $2.5 million,
respectively.  The Company sold certain inventory items to
Safeway and its affiliates for an aggregate amount during 1995,
1994 and 1993 of approximately $6.4 million, $6.6 million and
$2.4 million, respectively.  Three directors of the Company are
also directors of Safeway and a fourth director of the Company is
both a director and an officer of Safeway. 

     The Company leases eight properties from a partnership 
that is 80% owned by a subsidiary of Safeway and 20% owned by 
the principal stockholder of Safeway.  The rentals under the
leases were $.6 million, $.7 million and $.7 million in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  In addition, the Company is
secondarily liable to this partnership under four leases for
which the annual minimum rental is $.2 million, all of which is
currently being paid by assignees.  

     Another California general partnership whose general
partners include directors and management of the Company had 
the right to purchase several leaseholds of the Company.  The
Company paid the California general partnership $2.2 million 
in 1993 to cancel this purchase right. 

     A director of the Company borrowed a total of $118,000 
from the Company for the purchase of 5,000 shares of the
Company's common stock by notes dated January 3, 1992 
and July 22, 1992.  The notes are secured by a pledge of 
the 5,000 shares of common stock.  The notes accrue 
interest at the Federal mid term rate in effect under 
Internal Revenue Code Section 1274(d), compounded 
semiannually.  All payments of principal and interest 
are due and payable on December 31, 1997. 

     Note 11. Contingencies 

     The Company is a party to several pending legal 
proceedings and claims.  Although the outcome of such 
proceedings and claims cannot be determined with certainty,
management believes that their final outcome should not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated 
financial position. 

     As a result of the disposal of certain leasehold 
interests by the Company and by a partnership of which 
the Company is a general partner, the Company is 
contingently liable to certain landlords.
 
     Note 12. Shareholders' Equity 

     The Company has various stock option plans.  Options 
under the 1987 Stock Option Plan are fully vested.  Options 
under the 1990 Stock Option Plan vest as determined by 
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  
Generally, options vest 25% one year from the date of grant 
and 25% per year thereafter.  However, options granted in 
May 1995 vest 15% per year beginning one year from the date 
of grant and 15% per year thereafter until the options are 
100% vested.  Additionally, a limited number of options vest 
20% at the date of grant and 20% per year thereafter and 
others vest 33-1/3% per year beginning one year after 
grant.  Options under the Directors' Stock Option Plan 
vest 25% six months from the date of grant and 25% on 
the anniversary of the date of grant thereafter.  For all 
plans, the options expire ten years from the date of grant.

     The Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock
Purchase Plan") allows employees to purchase the Company's 
stock through payroll deductions.  The source of stock is 
weekly open market purchases by a third party administrator.
Administrative and purchase commission costs associated 
with the Stock Purchase Plan are borne and paid by the 
Company according to the agreement with the third party
administrator. 

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123")
"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" in October 1995 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 1995.  SFAS No. 123 encourages the fair value 
based method of accounting for employee stock compensation 
plans.  SFAS No. 123 allows companies to retain the 
current method of accounting for stock compensation as set 
forth in Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 "Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees."  SFAS No. 123 requires 
expanded footnote disclosure for both methods of accounting.  
The Company expects to retain the current method of 
accounting.  Accordingly, the expected impact of 
SFAS No. 123 on the Company's consolidated financial 
statements is expanded footnote disclosure.

     Note 13. Advertising Expense

     The Company expenses the costs of advertising as 
incurred.  Total advertising expense was $44.1 million,
$42.8 million and $43.3 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

     Note 14. Restructuring Charges

     During 1993, the Company recorded a restructuring charge 
of $56.9 million, or $.77 per share.  The 1993 charge 
reflected anticipated costs associated with a program 
to accelerate the closing of underperforming facilities,
including 11 stores, and to eliminate approximately 
300 administrative and support positions, which 
included 18 officers.  The 1993 restructuring charge 
included $42.7 million for expenses relating to facility 
closures and $14.2 million for severance and other 
related expenses. 

     In late 1994, the Company determined that the 
facility closures and reductions in work force undertaken 
in 1993 would not achieve the Company's cost reduction 
goals.  The Company undertook additional restructuring
initiatives resulting in further facility closures 
and reductions in work force.  During 1994, the Company 
recorded restructuring charges of $33.0 million, or $.45 
per share.  The 1994 restructuring charges included $27.4 
million for expenses related to facility closures, 
including 16 stores and the San Diego distribution center.  
The remaining $5.6 million of the charges relates to 
severance and other costs associated with the elimination 
of approximately 400 administrative and support positions.

     As of December 31, 1995, substantially all of the 
cost containment and strategic restructuring initiatives 
have been executed.  Of the total $89.9 million 
restructuring reserve, $72.1 million of costs and payments 
have been charged against the reserve as of December 31, 1995,
representing asset write-offs and lease obligations for 
closed facilities of $52.3 million and severance and other
related expenses of $19.8 million.

     Independent Auditors' Report 

 
     The Board of Directors  
     The Vons Companies, Inc.:
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of The Vons Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1995 and January 1, 1995, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
fifty-two week periods ended December 31, 1995, January 1, 1995
and January 2, 1994.  These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. 

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of The Vons Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries
at December 31, 1995 and January 1, 1995 and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the fifty-two week periods ended
December 31, 1995, January 1, 1995 and January 2, 1994,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                         AMENDMENT 1994-1

                            THE VONS COMPANIES,INC.
                            401(k) WRAPAROUND PLAN


          WHEREAS, The Vons Companies, Inc. ("Company") maintains
The Vons Companies, Inc, 401(k) Wraparound Plan ("Plan"); and 

          WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee has the right to 
amend the Plan; and

          WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee now desires to
amend the Plan to provide that the Investment Equivalents for
deferrals, Company Match and Discretionary Company Match made on
or after January 1, 1995 shall be determined on an annual basis,
and that future changes to the Investment Equivalents shall apply
to such amounts, except that such changes shall not apply to
amounts credited prior to January 1, 1995; and

          WHEREAS, the Compensation Committee also desires to 
amend the Plan to allow certain Participants the right to elect
installment payments and to allow Participants the ability to
withdraw funds by forfeiting certain amounts;

          NOW, THEREFORE, this Amendment 1994-1 is hereby adopted
effective December 31, 1994:


          1.   The following is hereby added after the first
paragraph of Section 5.4:

     "Effective for the deferrals, Company Match and
     Discretionary Company Match made on or after January 1,
     1995, the new rate of return established by the Compensation
     Committee as an Investment Equivalent shall apply both to
     the deferrals, Company Match and Discretionary Company Match
     made for the Plan Year for which the new rate of return is
     established, as well as the deferrals, Company Match and
     Discretionary Match previously credited for previous
     Plan Years.  The preceding sentence shall not apply,
     however, to the deferrals, Company Match and Discretionary
     Company Match made for Plan Years ending on or before 
     December 31, 1994."

          2.   The following is hereby added to the end of
Section 7.2:

     "Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant who
     satisfies the criteria specified below so elects, the
     Participant shall receive his benefits in the form of five 
     annual installments, calculated as described below.  In 
     order to make such election, the Participant must satisfy 
     all of the following requirements:

                                2

               (a)  The election must be made at least two years
          prior to the date benefit payments commence according
          to Section 7.1;

               (b)  As of the date benefit payments commence, the
          Participant must have completed at least ten "years of 
          vesting service," as such term is defined in the Vons 
          Personal Choice Profit Sharing Plan; and

               (c)  The amount of benefit which would, absent the
          election, be paid to the Participant as a lump sum,
          must exceed $25,000.

          The annual installments shall be paid in level annual
     installments, amortized at the rate set forth as a
     Investment Equivalent for the year in which the first
     installment payment is made (notwithstanding subsequent
     changes in the Installment Equivalent).

          3.   The following new section 7.5 is hereby added to
the Plan.  

          "7.5 Forfeiture Distribution.  The Plan Committee shall,
               -----------------------
     upon written request of a Participant, make a lump sum 
     payment to the Participant of up to 85% of the amount the
     Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan, but only
     if the Participant agrees to the following conditions:

               (a)  The Participant shall immediately and 
          irrevocably forfeit 15% of the amount withdrawn.  The 
          forfeiture shall reduce the Participant's remaining
          balance in the Plan;

               (b)  The Participant shall not be entitled to make
          a deferral election under Article IV for the following
          Plan Year, and his deferrals shall be suspended for the 
          remainder of the Plan Year; and

               (c)  The amount withdrawn shall not be credited
          with an Investment Equivalent for any Valuation Date

     The remaining portion of such Participant's Account, if any,
     shall be distributed in accordance with Sections 7.1 and 
     7.2.  This Section shall not be construed to allow
     distribution under the Plan of amounts greater than those
     the Participant would otherwise have received if no 
     distribution under this Section had been made."
