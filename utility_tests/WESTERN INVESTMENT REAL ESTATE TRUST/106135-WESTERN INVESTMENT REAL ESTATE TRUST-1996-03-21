              related lease expires and the tenant is no longer in legal
              possession, or (2) the related lease is formally terminated
              and the tenant is no longer in legal possession.

The Trust owns 23 unimproved pads located within or adjacent to the property
lines of its shopping centers that are available for development and leasing. 
Additionally, the Trust owns a total of 25 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to
its North Hills and Elko Shopping Centers in Nevada.

The weighted average age of the Trust's 62 properties is 12.5 years.  The
weighted average age of the Trust's commercial, industrial and retail properties
is 21.5 years, 15.4 years and 12.05 years, respectively.  This calculation is
weighted by Gross Leasable Area and is based on the original construction date
of the property.  As such, construction or renovation occurring subsequent to
the original construction date is not reflected in this calculation.

CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE

After a number of false starts in recent years, California's economy has 
experienced solid improvement.  Additionally, many economists believe 
California's future is brighter. According to the Center for Continuing Study 
of the California Economy (Palo Alto, California), total personal income rose 
7.2 percent during the first half of 1995.  This, in conjunction with a 1.8 
percent increase in consumer prices, produced the first substantial boost in 
real spending power since 1990.  Some economists believe that California is 
once again ready to take its place as an engine of growth for the U.S. 
economy. California's strengths of foreign trade, entertainment and business 
services are producing gains in jobs, income and spending that will likely 
continue into 1996 and the decade ahead.  While the strength of the 
California economic recovery is uncertain, improvement in economic conditions 
should help improve the Trust's operating results in 1996.  Recent property 
acquisitions and improvements have been completely or partially funded with 
advances under the Trust's variable rate line of credit.  If interest rates 
were to increase substantially the interest rate under the line of credit 
could approach, or exceed the yield on the property acquisitions.  However, 
improving economic conditions, which could lead to higher interest rates, 
should also lead to improved occupancy and rental rates.

COMPETITION

During the past several years, volume discount retailers, such as Wal-Mart and
Costco, have entered certain areas of California and Nevada where Trust
community shopping center properties are located.  The Trust expects that these
discounters may positively or negatively affect certain of the Trust's shopping
center tenants.  The Trust believes that its tenants could benefit if these
discounters attract additional customers to nearby Trust properties and thereby
generate increased sales for Trust tenants.  Conversely, the Trust's tenants
could be negatively affected if discounters draw customers away from the Trust's
properties.  The Trust believes that to date the trend has had no significant
impact on the Trust's results of operations.

The Trust competes for quality properties with other investors and engages in a
continuing effort to identify desirable properties for acquisition.  As the
number of prospective buyers of the types of properties the Trust considers for
purchase increases, the prices of such properties may increase and the yield
decrease.  The Trust believes it can continue to compete effectively in the
current real estate environment because of its experienced staff and management
team.

The Trust competes for tenants primarily on the basis of location, rental rates,
services provided and the design and condition of the properties.  In some of
the geographic areas in which the Trust owns properties, the available supply of
space for lease exceeds the demand by prospective tenants.  In order to compete
effectively, the Trust employs experienced property managers and leasing agents.

TENANTS

The Trust's principal shopping center and retail tenants include substantial,
well-recognized businesses such as Food-4-Less, Nob Hill Foods, PayLess Drugs,
Pak  N Save, Raley's, Safeway, Save Mart Supermarket and Thrifty Drug.  The
Trust's commercial tenants include Coast Federal Bank and Fireman's Fund
Insurance Company.  In addition, the Trust has other major retail tenants such
as Lucky Stores and J.C. Penney.

No single property investment accounted for more than 5% of total revenues in
1995.  At December 31, 1995, Raley's, the Trust's most significant tenant, a
supermarket and super drug retailer, was a lessee in nineteen of the Trust's
properties and accounted for 20% of the Trust's 1995 total revenues.  Raley's, a
privately owned company, currently operates 81 stores in Northern California and
Nevada.  The Raley's organization has released information indicating that its
sales exceeded $1.8 billion in its most recently reported fiscal year ended June
24, 1995.  The Trust receives audited financial statements annually from Raley's
and uses them to monitor Raley's financial position and results of operations.

The Trust receives sales and other information on a monthly, quarterly or annual
basis from its retail tenants, including Raley's, under leases which provide for
such reports.  The Trust uses this information to monitor the payment of
percentage rents where leases so provide.  The Trust recognized $559,000 and
$537,000 of percentage rents during 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Virtually all
of the Trust's existing leases include at least one of the following provisions
for payment of additional rent:  (1) scheduled fixed increases, (2) percentage
rent based on tenants' gross sales, or (3) CPI-based escalation clauses.  The
Trust endeavors to structure leases on a triple-net basis with the lessees being
responsible for most operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, certain
types of insurance, utilities, normal repairs and maintenance.  To the extent
such provisions cannot be negotiated and incorporated into a lease and in regard
to vacant space, the Trust pays such expenses from current operating income. 
Most of the Trust's leases require the tenant to carry liability insurance
coverage on their leased premises. The Trust monitors tenant compliance with
insurance coverage requirements. While the Trust believes its properties are
adequately insured, the Trust does not carry earthquake or flood coverage.  Most
of the Trust's properties are located in areas of California and Nevada where
earthquakes have been known to occur.  The Trust periodically considers the
merits of purchasing earthquake insurance.  To date the Trust has not purchased
earthquake insurance because of (i) the high premiums and deductibles and (ii)
the geographically diversified portfolio that reduces the likelihood of an
earthquake resulting in a material loss to the Trust.  Furthermore, the majority
of properties in the portfolio principally comprise single-story, relatively new
buildings.

TENANT LEASE EXPIRATIONS AND RENEWALS

ASSET MANAGEMENT

The Trust is a fully integrated REIT which provides full asset management
services to all but two of its properties. Asset management includes property
management, leasing, marketing and accounting support.  Internal management
provides for regular interaction between the Trust and its tenants and close
supervision of properties.


                                          7
<PAGE>

The Trust directly manages 60 of its 62 properties.  In order to facilitate its
present and future asset management activities, the Trust maintains two branch
offices which are centrally located to the properties.  The offices are located
at the Trust's Country Gables shopping center in Granite Bay, California and at
the Victorian Walk shopping center in Fresno, California.

Internal management permits the Trust to provide value added services to its
tenants.  For example, the Trust's marketing staff works with the Trust's
tenants on promotional and advertising activities to draw consumers to the
shopping centers.  These activities help the Trust attract and retain the
national, regional and local retail tenants which serve the Northern California
and Nevada markets.  The Trust believes the cost of internal property management
and leasing is generally less expensive than employing independent property
management, marketing and leasing firms due to lower commissions and fees and
certain economies of scale.

Two of the Trust's 62 properties are managed by independent property managers. 
G & W Management Co. provides management services for the property leased to
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, in Petaluma, California, for fees equal to
3.5% of gross receipts.  The Trust's property is part of a larger office park
which is managed by G & W Management Co.  Commercial Real Estate Service (CRES)
provides management services with respect to Serra Center, located in Colma,
California, for fees equal to 4% of gross rents plus tenant administrative and
management fees paid by the tenants attributable to the Trust's 30% interest in
the center.  CRES is an affiliate of the co-owner of the Serra Center and has
been managing the property for approximately 20 years.  Neither one of the
above-named property managers are affiliated with the Trust, its trustees,
officers or any shareholder owning 5% or more of the Trust's shares.  Repairs
and maintenance of the Trust's properties not undertaken by tenants under the
terms of the Trust's triple-net leases are performed by independent contractors
not affiliated with the Trust, its trustees or officers, or any shareholder
owning 5% or more of the Trust's shares.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Investments in real property create a potential for environmental liability on
the part of the owner of such real property.  If hazardous substances are
discovered on or emanating from any of the Trust's properties, the Trust and/or
others may be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to the
clean-up of such hazardous substances.

In order to mitigate environmental risks, in 1989 the Trust adopted a policy of
obtaining at least a Phase I environmental study (a preliminary site assessment
which does not include environmental sampling, monitoring or laboratory
analysis) on each property it seeks to acquire.  From time to time, when the
Trust deems it appropriate, we have acquired independent environmental analyses
on properties acquired prior to 1989.  Although the Trust has no knowledge that
any material environmental contamination has occurred, no assurance can be given
that hazardous substances are not located under any of the properties.  The
Trust carries no express insurance coverage for the type of environmental risk
described above.

The trust assesses on an ongoing basis measures necessary to comply with
environmental laws and regulations.  In conducting its assessments, the Trust
has identified the following matters:

OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA

During 1994, the Trust concluded the sale of its industrial property in Oakland,
California.  Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Trust is responsible for
environmental clean-up costs that exceed the sum of (i) $658,000, and (ii) any
amounts recovered by the buyer from third parties.  On the basis of the current
facts and circumstances, the Trust has not recorded a provision for any future
environmental liability resulting from this property because the Trust believes
the likelihood of incurring any liability is remote.  The Trust will continue to
monitor the environmental remediation activity and status of this property.



                                          8
<PAGE>

VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA

The Trust has agreed to guarantee the performance of the restoration work
related to disturbance of wetlands by, and to provide certain financial
accommodations to, the developer of the Trust's Park Place Shopping Center in
Vallejo, California.  During July 1995, the developer declared Chapter 11
bankruptcy.  The Trust received an initial estimate for the wetlands restoration
from an environmental consulting firm, which projected total costs of as much
as $250,000.  Approximately $200,000 has already been funded by the Trust.

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS

The Trust, as far as it is aware, owns only three properties which presently
contain underground storage tanks.  The Trust has no knowledge of any leakage or
contamination resulting from these tanks that will have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.  There are, however, reported low
levels of soil contamination from underground storage tanks removed from the
Heritage Place Shopping Center in Tulare, California, prior to its acquisition
by the Trust.  The prior owner has been ordered by the Tulare County
environmental officials to clean up suspected soil contamination and has been
approved for and received funding from the California Leaking Underground
Storage Tank Fund.  Should the prior owner fail to complete remediation, the
Trust's exposure could be as much as $230,000 per the initial estimate by an
environmental consultant.  In addition, there is a potential for contamination
from reported off-site leaking petroleum underground storage tanks located on
properties adjacent to certain Trust properties.

The probable overall costs of these measures cannot be determined at this time
due to uncertainty about the extent of environmental risks and the Trust's
responsibility, the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, and the
selection of alternative compliance approaches.  However, the Trust is not aware
of any environmental conditions that it believes will have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

    (1)  Revenues comprise minimum rents, percentage rents, recoveries from
         tenants and other income.

    (2)  The Trust, along with most industry analysts, considers Funds From
         Operations (FFO) to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the
         operating performance of an equity REIT.  Funds From Operations, as
         defined in 1991 by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
         Trusts (NAREIT), is:  net income excluding gains or losses from debt
         restructuring and sales of property, plus depreciation and
         amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. 
         Funds From Operations does not replace net income as a measure of
         performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure
         of liquidity.

         Funds From Operations presented in the Selected Financial Data
         schedule is calculated in accordance with the 1991 NAREIT definition
         of FFO.  In 1995, NAREIT interpreted its definition of Funds From
         Operations.  The effect of the 1995 interpretation on the Trust's
         calculation of FFO is to require exclusion from the add-backs to net
         income of: (i) amortization of deferred financing costs and (ii)
         depreciation of personal property.  When calculated in accordance with
         NAREIT'S 1995 interpretation, FFO would be $21,017,000, $20,084,000,
         $20,522,000, $20,017,000 and $22,566,000 for the year ended December
         31, 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The Trust will
         adopt the 1995 interpretation in 1996.

    (3)  Real estate owned reflects acquisition costs and capitalized costs of
         improvements before deduction of depreciation and amortization.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Trust anticipates that cash flows provided by operating activities will
continue to provide adequate funds for all current principal and interest
payments as well as dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements. Cash
on hand and borrowings under its existing bank line of credit, as well as other
debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary funds to achieve future
growth.  The Trust has only one loan secured by one of its properties. 
Additionally, the Trust jointly owns two properties where a co-owner is
obligated under a note that is secured by the property. 

Any incurrence of additional debt by the Trust would be subject to limitations
imposed by the Indenture Agreement executed in connection with the Trust's
senior notes and the bank line of credit.

As of December 31, 1995, the Trust had approximately $30.8 million available
under its $60 million bank line of credit.  This facility, which has certain
covenants (including minimum shareholders' equity, maximum ratio of debt to net
worth and income coverage requirements), could be used to fund acquisitions,
improvements to real estate and other cash requirements.  The interest rate on
the bank line of credit is either LIBOR plus 1.6% or the participating banks'
reference rate, at the Trust's election.  The weighted average interest rate on
the bank line of credit at December 31, 1995, was 7.57%.  This facility expires
May 31, 1996, at which time the Trust intends to renew it.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994

Net income decreased  $5 million to $10.3 million, or $0.61 per share, in 1995,
from $15.3 million, or $0.92 per share, in 1994.  This 33% decrease is
principally due to the 1994 gains realized from the sales of real estate
investments.  Additionally, the decrease is due to increased interest expense,
depreciation and amortization, and property operating costs, as well as
decreased other income, partially offset by the absence of the 1994 provision
for loss on real estate investment.

Funds From Operations (NAREIT 1991 definition) increased $969,000 to $21.5 
million in 1995, an increase of more than 4% over the 1994 figure of $20.6 
million.  The major components of this increase are increased minimum rents, 
increased recoveries from tenants and the absence of a 1994 provision for 
environmental costs relating to the Oakland, California, property, offset in 
part by increased interest expense, property operating costs and decreased 
other income. The Trust, along with most industry analysts, considers Funds 
From Operations to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating 
performance of an equity REIT. Funds From Operations does not replace net 
income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating 
activities as a measure of liquidity.

Minimum rents increased $3.5 million in 1995 to $37.6 million, a 10% increase
over $34.1 million in 1994.  This increase resulted from (i) the Trust's seven
acquisitions during 1994 and 1995, partially offset by five dispositions in 1994
and (ii) occupancy gains.

Recoveries from tenants increased by 12%, or $738,000, to $6.8 million in 1995
as compared to $6.1 million in 1994.  This increase is primarily the result of
the Trust's seven acquisitions and occupancy gains referred to above.

Other income decreased $1.4 million to $584,000 from the 1994 amount of
$2,017,000.  The contributing factors to this decrease are the absence in 1995
of (i) a $600,000 lease termination fee recorded in 1994, (ii) investment income
earned in 1994 from the senior notes net proceeds prior to the use of these
proceeds for several 1994 acquisitions and (iii) mortgage interest income earned
on a note retired during the second quarter of 1994.

Interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 14%, in 1995 to $11.5 million from
$10.1 million in 1994.  This increase primarily results from increased
borrowings and higher interest rates under the Trust's bank line of credit. 
Additionally, interest expense increased as a result of twelve months of
interest on the senior notes in 1995, compared to 10-1/2 months in 1994.

Property operating costs were $8.3 million in 1995 compared to $7.4 million in
1994.  This $899,000, or 12% increase from the prior year, is primarily due to
the 1994 and 1995 acquisitions. Ownership of the majority of these properties
commenced mid-year 1994.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1 million to $10.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995, from $9.9 million  in 1994.  This 10% increase
results from a net increase in the depreciable basis of the Trust's portfolio of
real estate investments due to additions made by the Trust beginning in mid-year
1994, net of dispositions.

Income from operations was $10.3 million, or $0.61 per share, for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1995, a $650,000 decrease from the comparable 1994
figure of $10.9 million, or $0.65 per share.  The primary reasons for this
decrease are increased interest expense, depreciation and amortization, property
operating costs, and decreased other income, partially offset by increased
minimum rents and increased recoveries from tenants.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1993

Net income increased $3.7 million, or 32%, to $15.3 million, or $0.92 per share,
in 1994 from $11.6 million, or $0.70 per share, in 1993.  This increase reflects
the gains realized from the sales of real estate investments and increases
achieved in revenues from the Trust's six 1994 acquisitions, offset by increased
interest expense and reduced revenues due to property dispositions.

Funds From Operations decreased $282,000, or 1%, to $20.6 million from $20.9
million.  The major components of this decrease are the provision for
environmental costs related to the Oakland, California, property and increased
interest expense partially offset by increased minimum rents.

Minimum rents increased $1.9 million to $34.1 million, a 6% increase over the
1993 total of $32.2 million.  This growth reflects rental revenues from the
acquisition of six properties, offset by reduced rental revenues due to the
dispositions of two retail properties, a commercial building, an industrial
building and a parcel of land.  The 1994 acquisitions and dispositions resulted
in a net increase of 324,000 square feet to the portfolio.

Other income increased $937,000 to $2,017,000 in 1994 from $1,080,000 for the 
comparable period in 1993.  Most of this increase is due to (i) a lease 
termination fee of $600,000 and (ii) investment income from the senior notes 
proceeds earned prior to the use of these proceeds for several 1994 
acquisitions.

Interest expense increased by $2.3 million in 1994 to $10.1 million from $7.8
million in 1993.  This 29% increase is due to the Trust's increased borrowings
to fund property acquisitions and higher interest rates.  On February 24, 1994,
the Trust issued $50 million of 7 7/8% senior notes due February 15, 2004. 
Proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used in part to pay the
outstanding balance on the previous bank line of credit of $17.6 million.  The
remaining proceeds were used to acquire additional properties.  On May 31, 1994,
the Trust obtained a two-year unsecured $60 million bank line of credit
(replacing the previous $35 million bank line of credit), which the Trust has
drawn upon to fund additional acquisitions. 

Income from operations was $10.9 million, or $0.65 per share, for the year ended
December 31, 1994, as compared to $11.6 million, or $0.70 per share, for the
same period in 1993.  This 6% decrease results from increased interest expense,
depreciation and amortization, and property operating costs partially offset by
increased minimum rents and other income.

IMPACT OF THE ECONOMY

Substantially all of the Trust's properties are leased on a triple-net basis,
which reduces the Trust's exposure to increases in property operating expenses
resulting from inflation.  Future increases in inflation would likely increase
revenues and thereby further protect the Trust from the impact of inflation. 
Revenue increases could be realized through CPI-based escalation of rents,
percentage rents based on tenants' gross sales and inflation-adjusted base rents
on new leases.

Increases in interest rates could increase the Trust's borrowing costs.  As of
December 31, 1995, the Trust had $29.3 million outstanding  under its unsecured
variable-rate bank line of credit.  This amount represents approximately 20% of
the Trust's total liabilities and approximately 7% of the Trust's historical
cost of real estate owned.

The continuing recovery of the California economy should lead to increases in
employment, personal income and retail spending.  Improving economic conditions
should help strengthen the Trust's operating results in 1996 as occupancy
continues to increase and rental rates continue to stabilize and improve.  


ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."

The Trust has adopted FAS 121 effective January 1, 1996, and believes that
adoption will not have a material impact on the Trust's 1996 financial
statements.  The Trust will adopt the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 in
1996, but continue to account for its stock option plan under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as
permitted under FAS 123.

Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants




To the Trustees and Shareholders
Western Investment Real Estate Trust:


We have audited the financial statements of Western Investment Real Estate Trust
(a California real estate investment trust) as listed in the accompanying index.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, we have also audited
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index.  These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Trust's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Western Investment Real Estate
Trust as of December 31, 1995, and 1994, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(A)    Description of Business

Western Investment Real Estate Trust, an equity real estate investment trust
(REIT), is a dominant owner of community shopping centers in Northern California
and Northern Nevada.  At December 31, 1995, the company's real estate portfolio
is comprised of 62 properties, of which 50 are retail properties.  The majority
of Western's retail properties are anchored by grocery superstores and major
drug stores.  Western, a self-administered and fully integrated real estate
operating company, owns and manages quality properties that offer opportunities
for growth in cash flow.

(B) Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(C) Real Estate Investments

Properties comprising real estate investments are stated at cost plus
capitalized improvements. Depreciation and amortization are calculated primarily
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 20-45 years
for buildings and 3-31 years for improvements. Included in real estate
investments are net investments in direct financing leases consisting of the
aggregate minimum lease payments to be received over the terms of the leases,
plus an estimated residual value, less unearned income.  In addition, third-
party leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the respective
terms of these leases.  Leasing commissions are included under "Accounts
receivable and other assets."

The Trust adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement (FAS) 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of," effective January 1, 1996.  Accordingly, in the normal course
of the Trust's business, when it determines that a property should be disposed
of, the Trust will discontinue the periodic depreciation of that property. 
Additionally, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the recoverability of the
carrying value of that property will be evaluated.  If the sum of the
undiscounted, expected future cash flows, exclusive of interest, is less than
the carrying value of that asset, a determination of fair market value of that
asset will be made.  If the fair market value is less than the carrying value of
that asset, an impairment charge will be recognized.  Adoption of FAS 121 is not
expected to have a material impact on 1996 operating results.

(D) Rental Income

The Trust accrues base rental income (minimum contractual lease payments) as
earned. Certain of the Trust's leases provide for additional rent based on
specified percentages of the lessee's revenues. Such percentage-based rental
income is recognized during the year based on estimates. The Trust recognizes
income from deferred rental receivables in accordance with FAS 13.  Deferred
rent receivable recognized as income was $1,065,000 in 1995, $692,000 in 1994
and $612,000 in 1993.

Unearned income on leases accounted for as direct financing leases -
representing the difference between the minimum lease payments and estimated
residual value, less the costs of the leased property -  is recognized over the
life of the lease using the interest rate implicit in the lease, which provides
a level rate of return on the net investment in the property.


                                          26

(E) Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents comprise certain highly liquid investments with maturities of
less than three months.

(F) Deferred Long-Term Debt Issuance Costs

The costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are amortized over
the term of the debt instruments.

(G) Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share have been computed using the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during each year.  Exercise of the outstanding stock options
would not have a material dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Most of the Trust's leases require the tenant to be responsible for, or
reimburse the Trust for, casualty and liability insurance coverage on the
properties.  The Trust also maintains umbrella liability insurance on all of its
properties.  The Trust monitors tenant compliance with insurance coverage
requirements.  While the Trust believes its properties are adequately insured,
the Trust does not carry earthquake, flood or pollution coverage.  Most of the
Trust's properties are located in areas of California and Nevada where
earthquakes have been known to occur.  In the event of a major earthquake, Trust
properties could suffer substantial damage or destruction.  Since it commenced
real estate operations in 1964, the Trust has not incurred any material expense
nor, to its knowledge, have any of its properties incurred any material damage
from earthquake or flood.


                                          27
<PAGE>

The Trust periodically considers the merits of purchasing earthquake insurance. 
To date the Trust has not purchased earthquake insurance because of (i) the high
premiums and deductibles and (ii) the geographically diversified portfolio that
reduces the likelihood of an earthquake resulting in a material loss to the
Trust.  Furthermore, the majority of properties in the portfolio principally
comprise single-story, relatively new buildings.

Note 3:     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

It is the Trust's practice to capitalize costs that exceed $4,000 and are
associated with the improvement of real estate investments. Capitalized costs
include third-party leasing commissions, tenant improvements and capital
expenditures. During 1995, the Trust capitalized $4,276,000 in such expenditures
(of which $3,775,000 relates to improvements and $501,000 relates to leasing
commissions).  This amount comprises $1,056,000 of build-to-suit capital
improvements; $225,000 of capitalized costs incurred in connection with the
leasing of previously unleased space; $2,319,000 of capitalized costs incurred
in connection with leasing previously leased space; and $676,000 of capitalized
costs that relate to general improvements to common areas.  The Trust's leasing
department costs, as well as legal and accounting costs associated with leasing,
are expensed as incurred.

The Trust has entered into several new leases that call for approximately
$4,080,000 in future real estate improvements and leasing commissions.  These
expenditures will be paid from operating cash flows or from borrowings under the
bank line of credit. These expenditures will expand the Trust's gross leasable
area by 58,900 square feet and improve an additional 189,000 square feet.

Note 4:     LEASES

Future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,
1995, are as follows:  1996 -- $36,788,000; 1997 -- $35,276,000; 1998 --
$32,753,000; 1999 -- $29,743,000; 2000 -- $27,540,000; thereafter --
$260,620,000.  The total minimum lease payments are $422,720,000.

Future minimum lease payments under direct financing leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,
1995, are as follows:  1996 -- $469,000; 1997 -- $469,000; 1998 -- $469,000;
1999 -- $469,000; 2000 -- $454,000; thereafter -- $0.  At December 31, 1995, the
Trust's investment in direct financing leases was $2,069,000, and was calculated
by adding the estimated residual value of $383,000 to the total remaining
minimum lease payments of $2,330,000, less unearned income of $644,000.  The
original cost of the properties subject to these direct financing leases is
$4,449,000.

Included in other income is income recorded under direct financing leases of
$233,000, $265,000 and  $292,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Note 5:  MAJOR TENANT

Total revenues attributable to leases with Raley's Supermarket, the Trust's most
significant tenant, were $9,009,000, $9,400,000 and $9,614,000 in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  These amounts represented 20%, 22% and 24% of total
revenues during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


                                          28

Note 6:    BANK LINE OF CREDIT

At December 31, 1995, the Trust had borrowed $29,250,000 under a $60 million
unsecured line of credit. Interest on funds drawn under this line of credit is
either LIBOR plus 1.6% or the participating banks' reference rate, at the
Trust's election, and is payable monthly on any outstanding balance. In
addition, the Trust pays an annual fee of $140,000.  At December 31, 1995, and
1994, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance under the
Trust's bank line of credit was 7.57% and 8.16%, respectively.  During the years
ended December 31, 1995, and 1994, the average balance outstanding on the bank
line of credit was $24,187,000 and $13,689,000, respectively.  The weighted
average interest rate during the year was 7.91% for 1995 and 7.17% for 1994. 
The Trust is not required to pledge any assets or maintain compensating balances
for this line of credit, although the Trust has agreed to certain covenants that
impose limitations on the incurrence of debt and other restrictions.
Additionally, if amounts due under the line of credit are not paid at maturity,
the lender, at its option, can require the Trust to provide security interests
in Trust properties.  This facility expires May 31, 1996, at which time the
Trust intends to renew it.

Note 7:    CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES

In August 1988, the Trust issued $75,000,000 of 8% convertible debentures (the
"debentures"), due in 2008. The debentures are convertible prior to maturity,
unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price equal to $22.23 per share. The
debentures are subject to limited mandatory redemption at 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued interest (i) on June 30 in any year, with the
consent of any holder thereof, or (ii) at any time within 60 days after the
receipt of a consent on behalf of a deceased holder. The Trust has the option
either to redeem debentures for cash or to exchange its shares in an amount
equal to 100% of the principal amount of such debentures. Such redemption
obligations are limited to a noncumulative maximum principal amount of $25,000
per holder and $2,250,000 in the aggregate for each twelve-month period ending
June 30, with priority being given to consents on behalf of deceased holders. 
In addition, the Trust has the option to redeem the debentures without the
consent of the holders, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of par.

On June 30, 1995, $1,827,000 of the debentures were presented for limited
mandatory redemption.  The Trust elected to exchange 158,785 shares at $11.50
for the debentures.  During 1995, an additional $471,000 of debentures were
presented for mandatory redemption on behalf of deceased debenture holders, and
the Trust elected to exchange (i) $426,000 for 35,604 shares and (ii) $45,000 in
cash.

On June 30, 1994, $212,000 of the debentures were presented for limited
mandatory redemption.  The Trust elected to exchange 15,216 shares at $14.00 for
the debentures.  During 1994, an additional $133,000 of debentures were
presented for mandatory redemption on behalf of deceased debenture holders, and
the Trust elected to exchange (i) $129,000 for 9,785 shares and (ii) $4,000 in
cash.

As of December 31, 1995, the debentures carried "investment grade" ratings from
Moody's Investor Service (Baa(3)) and Standard & Poor's (BBB).

Note 8:    SENIOR NOTES

In February 1994, the Trust sold $50 million of 7 7/8% senior notes in a public
offering. These notes are due in 2004 and contain certain covenants that impose
limitations on the incurrence of debt and other restrictions. These restrictions
include a cap on total borrowings, minimum shareholders' equity and income
coverage requirements. The notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.

As of December 31, 1995, the senior notes carried "investment grade" ratings
from Moody's Investor Service (Baa(3)) and Standard & Poor's (BBB).

Note 9:    REAL ESTATE LOAN PAYABLE

The Trust has only one loan secured by one of its properties. The real estate
loan balance was $1,294,000 and $1,362,000 at December 31, 1995, and 1994,
respectively. Principal payments for the years following December 31, 1995, are:
1996 -- $75,000; 1997 -- $83,000; 1998 -- $91,000; 1999 -- $100,000; 2000 -
$110,000; thereafter -- $835,000.  The interest rate on the real estate loan is
9.63%.  Additionally, the Trust jointly owns two properties where a co-owner is
obligated under a note secured by the property.

Note 10:   DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The carrying amount approximates fair value because
of the liquidity of this asset.

Marketable Securities - The fair value of marketable securities is based on
quoted market prices.

Bank Line of Credit - The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the
variable interest rate of this liability.

Convertible Debentures - The fair value of convertible debentures is based on
quoted market prices.

Senior Notes - The fair value of senior notes is based on quoted market prices.

Real Estate Loan Payable - The carrying value of this liability approximates
fair value.

The estimated fair values of the Trust's financial instruments as of December 31
are as follows (in thousands):

Note 11:   TRUSTEE AND OFFICER COMPENSATION

Trustee Emeritus, Death and Disability Programs

Under the Trustee Emeritus Program, O. A. Talmage, Bernard Etcheverry, and
Chester R. MacPhee, Jr. are eligible to become a Trustee Emeritus after reaching
age 65. A Trustee Emeritus shall serve the Trust in an advisory capacity and
will be compensated accordingly, up to a maximum of $60,000 annually.  Mr.
Etcheverry elected to become Trustee Emeritus on January 1, 1993.


                                          30
<PAGE>

O. A. Talmage, Bernard Etcheverry, and Chester R. MacPhee, Jr. are eligible to
participate in the Death and Disability Program. The Trust will pay an annual
death or disability obligation under the program based on a percentage of the
participant's average annual compensation for his 36 months of service as a
trustee during the time his compensation was the greatest up to a maximum of
$60,000 annually.  In the case of a participant's death, his eligible spouse
will be entitled to receive benefits under the program.  The Death and
Disability obligation was calculated using a discount rate of 7.0% and 8.5%
during 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Stock Option Plan

On May 12, 1988, the Trust instituted a non-qualified stock option plan (the
"Plan"). The purchase price of shares of beneficial interest purchased pursuant
to this Plan is to be not less than the fair market value of the shares on the
date of grant. Options granted under the Plan, which expire six years from the
grant date if not exercised, vest and become exercisable at a rate of 20% per
year from the date of grant until completely vested. A total of 300,000 shares
of beneficial interest have been authorized under the Plan.

The following options have been issued and are outstanding as of December 31,
1995:

</TABLE>

During the year ended December 31, 1994, 160 shares were issued at $11.44 per
share as a result of the exercise of stock options.

The Trust will adopt disclosure requirements of FAS 123 "Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation" in 1996.

Note 12:   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

In accordance with the Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan adopted by
the Trust in 1990, the Trust received $514,000 and $832,000 net of issuance
costs and issued 43,575 and 63,580 shares of beneficial interest in 1995 and
1994, respectively.  Additionally, in 1995, $184,000 in dividend reinvestment
proceeds  were used to purchase shares in the open market for the shareholders.

    (1)  In 1995, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
         (NAREIT) interpreted its definition of Funds From Operations.  The
         effect of the 1995 interpretation on the Trust's calculation of FFO is
         to require exclusion from the add-back of:  (i) amortization of
         deferred financing costs and (ii) depreciation of personal property.

    (2)  In 1991, NAREIT adopted a definition of Funds From Operations (FFO) in
         order to promote an industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating
         performance.  The 1991 definition is as follows:  "FUNDS FROM
         OPERATIONS means net income (computed in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting principles), excluding gains or losses from debt
         restructuring and sales of property, plus depreciation and
         amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships
         and joint ventures.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and
         joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on
         the same basis."


Note 15:   INCOME TAX STATUS OF TRUST

The Trust has qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a real estate
investment trust under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
and the comparable California statutes.  Under such provisions, the Trust will
not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income currently distributed to
shareholders, provided that at least 95% of its real estate investment trust
taxable income is distributed.  As the Trust intends to distribute all of its
taxable income currently, no provision has been made for federal or state income
taxes.

Federal taxable income of the Trust prior to the dividend-paid deductions for
the three years ended December 31, was:  1995 -- $12,727,000; 1994 --
$15,129,000 and 1993 -- $12,351,000.  The difference between net income for
financial reporting purposes and taxable income results primarily from different
methods of accounting for leases, depreciation of investment properties and
gains on property dispositions.

The taxable and nontaxable portions of distributions to shareholders for federal
income tax purposes in 1995 are as follows:

Note 16:    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Trust identifies and evaluates prospective investments on a continuous
basis.  In connection therewith, the Trust initiates letters of interest and
extends offers on a regular basis.  At December 31, 1995, the Trust was not
committed to fund any acquisition.

The Trust is routinely involved in various legal actions arising in the normal
course of business.  After taking into consideration legal counsel's evaluation
of such actions, management is of the opinion that such outcomes will not have a
material  adverse effect on the Trust's financial statements.


                                          33

Investments in real property create a potential for environmental liability on
the part of the owner of such real property.  If hazardous substances are
discovered on or emanating from any of the Trust's properties, the Trust and/or
others may be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to the
clean-up of such hazardous substances.  The Trust carries no express insurance
coverage for this type of environmental risk.

The Trust assesses on an ongoing basis measures necessary to comply with
environmental laws and regulations.  In conducting its assessments, the Trust
has identified the following matters:

OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA

During 1994, the Trust concluded the sale of its industrial property in Oakland,
California.  Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Trust is responsible for
any environmental clean-up costs that exceed the sum of (i) $658,000 and (ii)
any amounts recovered by the buyer from third parties.  On the basis of the
current facts and circumstances, the Trust has not recorded a provision for any
future environmental liability resulting from this property because the Trust
believes the likelihood of incurring any liability is remote.  The Trust will
continue to monitor the environmental remediation activity and status of this
property.

VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA

The Trust has agreed to guarantee the performance of the restoration work
related to the disturbance of wetlands by, and to provide certain financial
accommodations to, the developer of the Trust's Park Place Shopping Center in
Vallejo, California.  During July 1995, the developer declared Chapter 11
bankruptcy.  The Trust received an initial estimate for the wetlands restoration
from an environmental consulting firm, which projected total costs of as much as
$250,000.  Approximately $200,000 has already been funded by the Trust.

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS

The Trust, as far as it is aware, owns only three properties that presently
contain underground storage tanks.  The Trust has no knowledge of any leakage or
contamination resulting from these tanks that will have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.  There are, however, reported low
levels of soil contamination from underground storage tanks removed from the
Heritage Place Shopping Center in Tulare, California, prior to its acquisition
by the Trust.  The prior owner has been ordered by Tulare County environmental
officials to clean up suspected soil contamination and has been approved for and
received funding from the California Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund. 
Should the prior owner fail to complete remediation, the Trust's exposure could
be as much as $230,000 per the initial estimate by an environmental consultant. 
In addition, there is a potential for contamination from reported off-site
leaking petroleum underground storage tanks located on properties adjacent to
certain Trust properties.

The probable overall costs of these measures cannot be determined at this time
due to uncertainty about the extent of environmental risks and the Trust's
responsibility, the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, and the
selection of alternative compliance approaches.  However, the Trust is not aware
of any environmental conditions that it believes will have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.
