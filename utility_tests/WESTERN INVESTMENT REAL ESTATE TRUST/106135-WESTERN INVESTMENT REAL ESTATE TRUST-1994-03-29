     (1)  On January 27, 1994 the Trust sold its Marin General Hospital property
          in Larkspur, California, for $12,412,000 pursuant to a purchase
          option.
</TABLE>


In spite of a sluggish California economy, the Trust's occupancy rate at year-
end was stable at 90% in 1993 and 1992.  The Trust believes that it was unable
to increase occupancy above this rate during this period due to the economy
coupled with overbuilding in certain areas in which Trust properties are
located.  The smaller retail and service tenants at the Trust's community
shopping centers, which tend to be more dependent on discretionary spending,
have been more negatively impacted by the economy than the Trust's anchor
tenants.  The anchor tenants consist primarily of supermarkets and/or super
drugstores.  In the Trust's experience, these businesses tend to be impacted
less by economic downturns than other types of retailers.

The Trust is positioned to benefit from a general economic improvement which
should result in increased occupancy.   As occupancy increases, the Trust's
rental income should increase and expenses should decrease, as more tenants
assume responsibility for common area and other expenses presently absorbed by
the Trust.  Increased tenants' sales at its community shopping centers should
also increase rental income by generating greater percentage rents under some
leases.

During the past several years, volume discount retailers, such as Wal-Mart and
Costco, have entered certain areas of California and Nevada where Trust
community shopping center properties are located.  The Trust expects that these
discounters may positively or negatively affect certain of the Trust's shopping
center tenants.  The Trust believes that its tenants could benefit if these
discounters attract additional customers to nearby Trust properties and thereby
generate increased sales for Trust tenants.  Conversely, the Trust's tenants
could be negatively affected if discounters draw customers away from the Trust's
properties.  The Trust believes that to date the trend has had no measurable
impact on the Trust's results of operations.

The Trust's principal shopping center and retail tenants include substantial,
well-recognized businesses such as Kmart, Lucky Stores, Marshall's, J.C. Penney,
Raley's, Ross Stores, Save Mart and Thrifty.  The Trust's commercial tenants
include Coast Federal Bank and Fireman's Fund.

No single property investment accounted for more than 5% of operating revenues
in 1993.  However, at December 31, 1993, Raley's, a supermarket and super drug
retailer, was a tenant in nineteen of the Trust's investments.  Raley's, a
privately owned company, currently operates 85 stores in Northern California and
Nevada.  The Raley's organization has released information indicating that its
sales exceeded $1.58 billion in its most recently reported fiscal year ended
June 26, 1993.  The Trust receives sales and other information on a monthly,
quarterly or annual basis from its retail tenants, including Raley's, whose
leases provide for such reports.  The Trust uses this information to monitor the
payment of percentage rents. Virtually all of the Trust's existing leases
include at least one of the following provisions for payment of additional rent:
(1) scheduled and/or market rate increases, (2) percentage participation in
tenants'gross sales, (3) or CPI based escalation clauses.  The Trust endeavors
to structure leases on a triple net basis with the lessees being responsible for
most operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, certain types of insurance,
utilities, normal repairs and maintenance.  To the extent such provisions cannot
be negotiated and in regard to vacant space, the Trust pays such expenses from
current operating income.  Most of the Trust's leases require the tenant to
carry liability insurance coverage on their leased premises.  The Trust monitors
tenant compliance with insurance coverage requirements.  While the Trust
believes its properties are adequately insured, the Trust does not carry
earthquake or flood coverage.  Most of the Trust's properties are located in
areas of California and Nevada where earthquakes have been known to occur.

The Trust will consider future investments in existing or proposed shopping
centers, industrial and commercial buildings and office buildings, as well as
other kinds of income-producing properties which meet the Trust's return on
investment, appreciation and risk criteria.  The Trust may enter into
development agreements and development mortgage loans in order to obtain future
equity interests in properties.  As of December 31, 1993, no such loans were
outstanding. Although there may be attendant risks in such investments, the
Trust seeks to minimize these risks by evaluating the financial substance and
experience of developers and by obtaining construction, pre-leasing or other
guarantees from the developer or other parties to the transaction.  If a
developer of a project under construction defaults or fails to complete the
project, the Trust may incur substantial additional expense to complete
construction.

The Trust's investment focus has been in the Northern and Central areas of
California and Nevada, generally outside of major cities in areas which are
experiencing population growth. All but one of the Trust's properties are in
this geographic area.  The Trust's geographic focus and its experience in real
estate investments in Northern California and Nevada allow for efficient asset
management.  The Trust has made and will consider making investments in other
geographic locations if such investments have attractive returns, appreciation
potential and can be effectively managed.

The Trust competes for quality properties with other investors and engages in a
continuing effort to identify desirable properties for acquisition.  Management
believes that the Trust can continue to compete effectively in the current real
estate environment because of its experience in real estate investment, tenant
selection and lease negotiation.

The Trust plans to make additional investments in real properties, which will
provide attractive yields to the Trust.  The Trust has raised approximately
$127.5 million during the five year period ending March 31, 1994 through the
sale of additional shares and the issuance of senior notes, and will endeavor to
raise additional capital, either debt or equity, to fund future purchases.  The
cost of debt or equity capital will be weighed against the anticipated yields of
the investments which could be acquired with those funds.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Investments in real property create a potential for environmental liability on
the part of the owner of such real property.  If hazardous substances are
discovered on or emanating from any of the Trust's properties, the Trust and/or
others may be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to the
clean-up of such hazardous substances.

The Trust, as far as it is aware, owns only four properties which presently
contain underground storage tanks.  The Trust has no knowledge of any leakage or
contamination resulting from these tanks.  There are, however, reported low
levels of soil contamination from underground storage tanks removed from the
Heritage Place Shopping center in Tulare, California prior to its acquisition by
the Trust.  In addition, there is a potential for contamination from reported
off-site leaking petroleum underground storage tanks located on properties
adjacent to certain Trust properties.

In order to mitigate environmental risks, in 1989 the Trust adopted a policy of
requesting at least a Phase I environmental study (a preliminary site assessment
which does not include environmental sampling, monitoring or laboratory
analysis) on each property it seeks to acquire.  No independent environmental
analysis has been implemented by the Trust with respect to any of the properties
which the Trust acquired prior to 1989.  Although the Trust has no knowledge
that any material environmental contamination has occurred, no assurance can be
given that hazardous substances are not located under any of the properties.
The Trust carries no express insurance coverage for the type of environmental
risk described above.

The Trust assesses on an ongoing basis measures necessary to comply with
environmental laws and regulations.  The probable overall costs of these
measures cannot be determined at this time due to uncertainty about the extent
of environmental risks and the Trust's responsibility, the complexity of
environmental laws and regulations and the selection of alternative compliance
approaches.  However, the Trust is not aware of any environmental conditions
which will have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

The Trust is a fully integrated REIT which directly provides full asset
management services to all but three of its properties.  Asset management
includes property management, leasing, marketing, accounting and legal support.
Internal management provides for regular interaction between the Trust and its
tenants and close supervision of properties, while permitting the Trust to
provide its tenants with a range of value added services.

The Trust directly manages 55 of its 58 properties.  In order to facilitate its
present and future asset management activities the Trust has significantly
expanded its asset management staff, improved its systems and controls, and
opened two branch offices which are centrally located to the properties.  The
offices are located at the Trust's Country Gables shopping center in Granite
Bay, California and at the Victorian Walk shopping center in Fresno, California.
As part of its improved systems and controls, the Trust has implemented a state
of  the art computerized management information system which is capable of
providing the Trust with real time access to all property accounting, lease
administration and  property related information.

<PAGE>

Internal management permits the Trust to provide value added services to its
tenants.  For example, the Trust's marketing staff works with the Trust's
tenants on promotional and advertising activities to draw consumers to the
shopping centers.  These activities help the Trust attract and retain the
national, regional, and local retail tenants which serve the Northern and
Central California and Nevada markets.  In addition, the Trust believes that
over time the costs of internal property management and leasing should prove
less expensive than employing independent property management and leasing firms
due to lower commissions and fees and certain economies of scale.

Three of the 58 properties are managed by independent property managers.  G & W
Management Co. continues to provide management services for the property leased
to Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, in Petaluma, California, for fees equal to
3.5% of gross receipts.  The Trust's property is a part of a larger office park
which is managed in total by G & W Management Co.  Commercial Real Estate
Service (CRES) provides management services with respect to Serra Center,
located in Colma, California, for fees equal to 4% of gross receipts
attributable to the Trust's 30% interest in the center.  CRES is an affiliate of
the co-owner of the Serra Center and has been managing the property for
approximately 20 years.  The Trust and its co-owner have authorized the
employment of Terranomics Management Services to manage Mid-Peninsula Plaza, in
Redwood City, California for a fee equal to 6% of gross receipts.  The cost of
management services does not affect the Trust's priority return on this
property.  None of the above named property managers are affiliated with the
Trust, its trustees, officers or any  shareholder owning 5% or more of the
Trust's shares.  Repairs and maintenance of the Trust's properties not
undertaken by tenants under the terms of the Trust's triple net leases are
performed by independent contractors not affiliated with the Trust, its trustees
or officers, or any shareholder owning 5% or more of the Trust's shares.

(1)  Once a space is subject to an executed lease, the space is then included in
     occupied space.  A space continues to be incorporated in our occupancy
     percentage until: 1) the related lease expires and the tenant is no longer
     in legal possession, or 2) the related lease is formally terminated and the
     tenant is no longer in legal possession.
(2)  The occupancy of these properties includes space which is currently
     partially or wholly vacant but on which the  Trust receives rental payments
     under leases or other guarantees.
(3)  Agreements for the sale of the Trust's interests in the Mid-Peninsula Plaza
     shopping center and the Marshall's property in Redwood City have been
     executed.  However, there is no assurance that any such sales transaction
     will be completed.
(4)  Property consists of unimproved land currently under lease to Raley's which
     has an option to purchase expiring in November 1995.  Raley's has given the
     Trust written notice of their exercise of said option conditionally upon
     Raley's completing a sale to a third party.  There is no guarantee that the
     purchase will be consummated.
(5)  Property sold in January 1994.
(6)  Safeway has notified the Trust that it will terminate its lease with
     respect to the Oakland, California property as of September 30, 1994.
     Although Safeway will continue to pay rent on this property through
     September, it has vacated the premises and the Trust has initiated efforts
     to re-lease or sell the property.  The Trust believes that it is unlikely
     that it will be able to re-lease the property on terms as favorable as the
     terms with Safeway.  Furthermore, depending on the eventual use of the
     property, the Trust could be required to take a write down of up to $1.5
     million (book value).

Item 3.        Legal Proceedings


The Trust was named a defendant in two (2) lawsuits filed in the Second Judicial
District Court for the State of Nevada, County of Washoe.  One action was a
class action (Gomer vs. Realm Development Corp. et al., No. CV90-6108) and the
other was brought by 33 individuals (Bautista vs. Shaver Construction Co., Inc.,
No. CV92-01464).  Plaintiffs in both lawsuits alleged that they suffered
personal injury and/or property damage as the result of excessive dust generated
from construction of the Caughlin Ranch development in Reno, Nevada.  The Trust
has reached a settlement in regard to these lawsuits involving a payment of
$25,000 to the plaintiffs.

On January 11, 1993, a complaint was filed by the United States against the
Trust and other defendants with regard to an alleged disturbance of the wetlands
at the Park Place shopping center in Vallejo, California (U.S. vs. Connolly
Development Inc., et al., U.S. District Court, E.D. Cal No. S-93-044, WBS-GGH).
The complaint sought implementation of a restoration plan, assessment of civil
penalties, a permanent injunction prohibiting the discharge of fill materials
into the wetlands, and the government's costs of suit and disbursements.  This
lawsuit has been settled by the execution of a consent decree under which the
developer of the property is primarily liable for penalties and costs of
restoration, and the action was dismissed against the Trust on February 11,
1994.  However, the Trust has agreed to guarantee the performance of the
restoration by, and to provide a loan to, the developer.  In the event of a
default by the developer, the Trust's exposure could be as much as $250,000.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
          Condition and Results of Operations


OPERATING REVENUES

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

Rental income increased 5% to $33,179,000 from $31,716,000.  The increase
consists of additional rental income of $851,000 from increased rental rates and
collection of prior year rents and $612,000 of deferred rent receivable.

Operating revenues increased 3% to $33,813,000 from $32,879,000 as a result of
increased rental income of $1,463,000 (5%), partially offset by decreased
interest income on mortgage loans of $506,000 (-2%) and decreased direct
financing lease income of $23,000.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

Rental income increased 2% to $31,716,000 from $31,220,000.  The increase
consists of $1,149,000 (5%) in rental income generated from properties acquired
in 1991, $443,000 (2%) in rental income generated from the conversion of a loan
on a property in 1991, and increased rental income of $405,000 (1%) due to
increased rents and other income and collections from bankruptcy settlements of
two previous tenants, offset by a decrease of $1,344,000 (-5%) in rental income
due to the restructuring of master leases covering 17 of the Trust's shopping
center properties and a decrease of $157,000 (-1%) due to the increase in the
allowance for uncollectible accounts.

Operating revenues increased 1% to $32,879,000 from $32,591,000 as a result of
increased rental income of $496,000 (2%), partially offset by decreased interest
income on participating convertible and other mortgage loans of $188,000 (-1%)
and decreased direct financing lease income of $20,000.


OPERATING EXPENSES

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

Operating expenses increased 17% to $3,936,000 from $3,357,000.  The increase
consists of $19,000 of increased repair, maintenance and other operating
expenses and increased property management expense of $560,000 (17%) due
primarily to the increase in allocated administrative expense and the
development of internal asset management capabilities which include leasing,
marketing and property management.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

Operating expenses increased 85% to $3,357,000 from $1,810,000.  The increase
consists of $905,000 (50%) of increased repair, maintenance, and other operating
expenses and increased property management expense of $642,000 (35%) due
primarily to the restructuring of master leases covering 17 of the Trust's
shopping center properties and the reclassification of certain administrative
expenses to operating expenses in 1992.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5% to $9,078,000 from $8,610,000
due to additional depreciation from property improvements made in 1993 and a
full year's depreciation from property improvements made in 1992.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9% to $8,610,000 from $7,880,000
due to additional depreciation from improvements on properties in 1992 and a
full year's depreciation on properties purchased in 1991.


DEBENTURE AND OTHER INTEREST EXPENSE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

Debenture and other interest expense decreased $146,000 (-2%) primarily due to
debenture redemptions during 1993.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

Debenture and other interest expense increased $1,155,000 (17%) primarily due to
decreased capitalization of interest costs for projects under development in
1992 and increased levels of bank borrowings in 1992 as compared to 1991 offset
in part by debenture redemptions.


ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

The Trust's administrative expenses decreased 14% to $1,449,000 from $1,681,000.
The decrease is principally due to substantially lower legal fees and to the
allocation of certain administrative expenses to property management expenses.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

The Trust's administrative expenses increased 11% to $1,681,000 from $1,510,000
primarily as the result of increased legal fees and other expenses, offset in
part by a reallocation of certain administrative expenses to property management
expenses.


NET INCOME

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

Net income was $11,594,000 in 1993 compared to $11,323,000 in 1992, an increase
of $271,000 (2%).  The significant components of this change include increased
rental income ($1,463,000), offset by decreased interest on mortgage loans
(-$506,000), and increased property management expense (-$560,000).  Additional
significant components affecting net income are reduced legal fees ($218,000)
and increased depreciation and amortization expense (-$468,000).

Net income per share for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased to $0.70 on
average outstanding shares of 16,548,198 from $.69 on average outstanding shares
of 16,356,462 in 1992.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991

Net income was $11,323,000 in 1992 compared to $14,653,000 for the comparable
period in 1991, a decrease of $3,330,000 (-23%).  The significant components of
this change include increased rental income ($496,000), offset by increased
property operating expense (-$1,547,000), interest expense (-$1,155,000),
depreciation expense (-$730,000), administrative expenses (-$171,000), and
decreased mortgage interest and other income (-$223,000).

Net income per share  for the year ended December 31, 1992 decreased to $.69
from $.91 in 1991.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Trust has a $35,000,000 unsecured line of credit on which there was an
outstanding balance of $33,244,000 as of December 31, 1993.  On January 27,
1994,  the Trust sold its Marin General Hospital property, located in Larkspur,
California, for $12,412,000.  The  sales proceeds were used to reduce the
outstanding balance on the line of credit.

On February 24, 1994,  the Trust  issued  $50,000,000 of 7 7/8% senior notes due
February 15, 2004.  Proceeds from the sale of senior notes were used to pay the
remaining outstanding balance on the line of credit of $17,644,598.  The
remaining proceeds will be used to acquire properties as suitable opportunities
arise and to expand and improve existing properties.  The senior notes contain
certain covenants which impose limitations on the incurrence of debt and other
restrictions.

Funds from operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts, were $20,854,000 in 1993.  Dividends paid in 1993
totaled $18,531,000, resulting in a payout ratio of 88.9% of FFO.

The Trust believes that its current sources of funds will be sufficient to meet
its existing capital commitments and operating requirements.  The Trust's
unsecured $35 million line of credit expires May 31, 1994 and it intends to
renew or replace it.

As noted above, the entire amount of the line of credit is currently available.
Additionally, the Trust could borrow additional funds using its 55 properties
which do not have mortgage debt.  However, senior note borrowing limitations
impose a cap on total borrowings of 55% of undepreciated real estate assets.


IMPACT OF THE ECONOMY

Occupancy rates of the Trust's investments remained stable at year-end at 90%.
In spite of a sluggish California economy and some related tenant fall-out, the
Trust has continued to lease space to sustain its occupancy levels.  The Trust
is positioned to benefit from a general economic improvement which should result
in increased occupancy.  As occupancy increases, the Trust's rental income
should increase and expenses should decrease, as more tenants assume
responsibility for operating expenses presently absorbed by the Trust.

                                       17

During the last several years, high-volume discount retailers, such as Wal-Mart
and Costco, entered certain areas of California and Nevada where Trust community
shopping center properties are located.  The Trust expects that these
discounters may positively or negatively affect certain of the Trust's shopping
center tenants.  The Trust believes that its tenants could benefit if these
discounters attract additional customers to nearby Trust properties and thereby
generate increased sales for Trust tenants.  Conversely, the Trust's tenants
could be negatively affected if discounters draw customers away from the Trust's
tenants.  The Trust believes that to date this trend has had no measurable
impact on the Trust's results of operations.

Given the current level of inflation, the Trust believes the effect of inflation
on its results of operations is inconsequential.  Future increases in inflation
would likely increase Trust rental income by increasing tenant revenues upon
which percentage rents are based, increasing rents subject to CPI-based
escalation clauses and permitting an increase in base rents on new leases.


DIVIDENDS

On March 15, 1994, the Trust paid its 120th consecutive quarterly dividend since
it commenced real estate operations in 1964.  Dividends paid to shareholders
totaled $18,531,000 in 1993.  Since the 1993 distributions exceeded current and
accumulated earnings and profits, 28.55% is non-taxable and constitutes a return
of capital to shareholders.  The Trust declares and pays quarterly dividends
based on income and funds from operations and the Trust's anticipated ability to
maintain or increase such dividends in future years.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In February 1994, the Trust successfully completed a public offering of
$50,000,000 in senior notes with a coupon rate of 7 7/8%.  On January 27, 1994
the Trust sold its Marin General Hospital property in Larkspur, California, for
$12,412,000 resulting in a gain on sale of $3,629,000.  Additionally, the Trust
has executed agreements for the sale of its interests in the Mid-Peninsula Plaza
Shopping center and the  Marshall's property in Redwood City, California.  The
aggregate book value of these three investments at December 31, 1993 was
$16,972,000.  Interest rates for the short-term investment of the proceeds from
these property sales and the senior debt offering are substantially less than
the previous yields on these properties and the cost of the senior notes.  The
Trust will benefit as new properties are acquired with yields substantially
greater than yields on short-term investments.

Note 1:   Significant Accounting Policies


(A)  Properties

Properties comprising real estate investments are stated at cost. Depreciation
and amortization are provided primarily using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the properties as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Property Type                                                              Years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                     <C>
Buildings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20 to 45
Improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 to 25
</TABLE>

Interest and fee income relating to loans on property under development for
acquisition by the Trust are recorded as reductions of the Trust's investment in
those properties. Interest cost is capitalized on projects under development in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34.  During
1993, no interest was capitalized.  In 1992, interest cost of $46,000 was
capitalized.


(B)  Federal Income Tax Reporting

For Federal income tax reporting purposes, the Trust has elected to use a 15-
year straight-line accelerated cost recovery as provided by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981 for properties acquired after 1981, and for properties
acquired after March 1984, a 35-year, straight-line accelerated cost recovery as
provided by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.  Properties acquired after
December 1986 use a 31.5-year, straight-line method as provided by the 1986 Tax
Act. Properties acquired after 1989 are depreciated using a 40-year, straight-
line method.  Depreciation for financial statement reporting purposes is based
on the estimated economic useful life of the property.


(C)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with a
maturity of less than three months.


(D)  Direct Financing Leases

The net investment in direct financing leases consists of the aggregate minimum
lease payments to be received over the terms of the leases, plus an estimated
residual value, less unearned income.  Unearned income, representing the
difference between the minimum lease payments and estimated residual value, less
the costs of the leased property, is recognized over the life of the lease using
the interest rate implicit in the lease, which provides a level rate of return
on the net investment in the property.


(E)  Rental Income

The Trust accrues base rental income (minimum contractual lease payments) as
earned.  Certain of the Trust's leases provide for additional rent based on
specified percentages of the lessee's revenues.  Such percentage-based rental
income is recognized during the year based on estimates.  Beginning in 1993, the
Trust has begun recognizing income from deferred rental receivables in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 13.  During
1993, $612,000 of deferred rent receivable was recognized as income.

                                       26

<PAGE>

(F)  Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

The costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are amortized over
the term of the debt instruments.


(G)  Income Per Share

Income per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during each year.  There were no common stock equivalents that on
conversion or exercise would dilute income per share.


(H)  Impairment Accounting Policy

When the Trust concludes that recovery of the carrying value of a real estate
investment is permanently impaired, it reduces such carrying value to amounts
deemed recoverable.


(I)  Reclassification

Certain of the 1992 and 1991 financial statement amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 1993 presentation.

Safeway has notified the Trust that it will terminate its lease with respect to
the Oakland, California property as of September 30, 1994.  Although Safeway
will continue to pay rent on this property through September, it has vacated the
premises and the Trust has initiated efforts to re-lease or sell the property.
The Trust believes that it is unlikely that it will be able to release the
property on terms as favorable as the terms with Safeway. Furthermore, depending
on the eventual use of the property, the Trust could be required to take a
write down of up to $1.5 million (book value).

With respect to the Trust's property in Rocklin, California, Raley's has an
option to purchase  that expires in November of 1995.  Raley's has given the
Trust written notice of their exercise of said option conditionally upon Raley's
completing a sale to a third party.  There is no guarantee that the purchase
will be consummated.

The Trust sold its Marin General Hospital property in Larkspur, California, on
January 27, 1994.  The sales price was $12,412,000, resulting in a gain of
$3,629,000.  The Trust used the net proceeds of the sale to reduce the
outstanding balance on its line of credit.

Additionally, the Trust has executed agreements for the sale of its interests in
the Mid-Peninsula Plaza shopping center and the adjoining Marshall's property in
Redwood City, California.  If the sale occurs it will result in the Trust
receiving payment in full on the related mortgage loan (see Note 4).


Note 3:   Leases

Two of the Trust's investment properties are accounted for as direct financing
leases.  All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.  The following
is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under direct financing and
operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in
excess of one year as of December 31, 1993:

Note 5:   Major Tenants

Rental income attributable to leases with Raley's, our most significant tenant,
was $7,770,000, $7,734,000 and $7,393,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.


Note 6:   Note and Real Estate Loans Payable

The Trust has a $35,000,000 line of credit as of December 31, 1993.  Interest on
funds drawn under this line of credit is at a rate no greater than the bank's
reference rate plus one quarter of one percent (6 1/4% at December 31, 1993) and
is payable monthly on any outstanding balance.  In addition, the Trust pays an
annual fee of one quarter of one percent of the commitment.  The Trust is not
required to pledge any assets or maintain compensating balances for this line of
credit although the Trust has agreed not to further encumber any of its
properties or to sell or convey any of them except as permitted by the terms of
the line of credit.  Additionally, if amounts due under the line of credit are
not paid at maturity, the lender, at its option, can require the Trust to
provide security interests in Trust properties.  At December 31, 1993, the Trust
had borrowed $33,244,000 under this line of credit which, if not renewed,
expires May 31, 1994.  At December 31, 1992, the Trust had a $40 million line of
credit with an outstanding balance of $35,902,000.

The Trust has one real estate mortgage loan and one property subject to an
assessment bond aggregating $1,516,000 and $1,581,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  Aggregate principal maturities for the five years following
December 31, 1993 are: 1994 -- $74,000; 1995 -- $81,000; 1996 -- $88,000; 1997 -
- - $97,000; 1998 -- $107,000; thereafter -- $1,069,000.  Additionally, the Trust
owns a 50% interest in one property that is encumbered by a note and deed of
trust under which the co-owner is the borrower.

Note 7:   Convertible Debentures

In August, 1988 the Trust issued $75,000,000 of 8% convertible debentures (the
"debentures"), due 2008.  The debentures are convertible prior to maturity,
unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price equal to $22.23 per share.
The debentures are subject to limited mandatory redemption at 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued interest (i) on June 30 in any year, with the
consent of any holder thereof, or (ii) at any time within 60 days after the
receipt of a consent on behalf of a deceased holder.  The Trust has the option
either to redeem debentures for cash or to exchange its shares in an amount
equal to 100% of the principal amount of such debentures.  Such redemption
obligations are limited to an annual, non-cumulative maximum principal amount of
$25,000 per holder and $2,250,000 in the aggregate, with priority being given to
consents on behalf of deceased holders.  The Trust may redeem debentures
tendered in excess of the above limitations.  In addition, the Trust has the
option to redeem the debentures without the consent of the holders, in whole or
in part, at redemption prices declining from 102% of the principal balance of
the debentures until June 30, 1994, 101% until June 30, 1995, and at par
thereafter.

On June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, $1,657,000 and $1,656,000 of debentures
were presented for limited mandatory redemption.  The Trust elected to exchange
114,129 and 130,307 shares at $14.50 and $12.70, respectively, for the
debentures.  During 1993 and 1992, respectively, an additional $216,000 and
$646,000 of debentures were presented for mandatory redemption on behalf of
deceased debenture holders which at the Trust's option were paid in cash.


Note 8:   Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash - The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the liquidity of
this asset.

Loans Receivable - The Redwood City loan receivable has a fair value  equal to
the carrying amount  as the Trust expects to receive payment in full in 1994.
The face value of the Reno loan approximates its fair value.

Marketable Securities - The fair value of marketable securities is based on
quoted market prices.

Note Payable - The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of this liability.

Convertible Debenture - The fair value of convertible debentures is based on
quoted market prices.

Mortgage Payable - The carrying value of this asset approximates fair value.

The estimated fair values of the Trust's financial instruments for years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992 are (in thousands):

Stock Option Plan

On May 12, 1988, the Trust instituted a non-qualified stock option plan (the
"Plan").  The purchase price of shares of beneficial interest purchased pursuant
to the Plan is to be not less than the fair market value of the shares on the
date of grant.  Options granted under the Plan, which expire six years from the
grant date if not exercised, vest and become exercisable at a rate of 20% per
year from the date of grant until completely vested.  A total of 300,000 shares
of beneficial interest have been authorized under the Plan.

The following options have been issued and are outstanding as of December 31,
1993:

Note 12:  Income Tax Status of Trust

The Trust has qualified, and intends to continue to qualify, as a real estate
investment trust under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
and the comparable California statutes.  Under such provisions, the Trust will
not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income distributed currently to
shareholders, provided that at least 95% of its real estate investment trust
taxable income is distributed.  As the Trust intends to distribute all of its
income currently, no provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

Federal taxable income of the Trust prior to the dividend-paid deductions for
the three years ended December 31, 1993 is: 1993 -- $12,351,000; 1992 --
$11,368,000; 1991 -- $15,588,000.  The difference between net income for
financial reporting purposes and taxable income results primarily from different
methods of accounting for leases, depreciation of investment properties and
gains on property dispositions.

The taxable and nontaxable portions to shareholders for federal income tax
purposes in 1993 are as follows:

Note 13:       Commitments and Contingencies

The Trust identifies and evaluates prospective investments on a continuous
basis.  In connection therewith, the Trust initiates letters of interest and
extends offers on a regular basis.  At December 31, 1993, the Trust was not
committed to fund any acquisition.

The Trust is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising
in the normal course of business.  At December 31, 1993, one case involves
allegations that there was a disturbance of wetlands during the construction of
the Trust's Vallejo shopping center.  This lawsuit has been settled by the
execution of a consent decree under which the developer of the property is
primarily liable for penalties and costs of restoration.  However, the Trust has
agreed to guarantee the performance of the restoration by, and to provide a loan
to, the developer.  In the event of a default by the developer, the Trust's
exposure could be as much as $250,000.  The Trust has also reached settlement in
regard to two lawsuits alleging the generation of excessive dust during
construction of our Caughlin Ranch shopping center, for a payment of $25,000
payable to the plaintiffs.


Note 14:                   Subsequent Events

On February 24, 1994, the Trust completed a $50 million senior note offering.
The unsecured senior notes mature February 15, 2004, and carry a coupon of
7 7/8%.  Proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the line of credit of
approximately $17.6 million and the balance will be used to acquire properties
as suitable opportunities arise and to expand and improve existing properties.

(1)  Agreements for the sale of the Trust's interest in the Mid-Peninsula Plaza
     shopping center and the Marshall's property in Redwood City have been
     executed.  However, there is no assurance that any such sales transaction
     will be completed.
(2)  Pinecreek is encumbered by a note and deed of trust under which the 50%
     co-owner is the borrower.
(3)  Property consists of unimproved land currently under lease to Raley's which
     has an option to purchase expiring in November 1995.  Raley's has given the
     Trust written notice of its exercise of said option conditionally upon
     Raley's completing a sale to a third party.  There is no guarantee that the
     purchase will be consummated.
(4)  Property sold January 1994.
(5)  Safeway has notified the Trust that it will terminate its lease with
     respect to the Oakland, California property as of September 30, 1994.
     Although Safeway will continue to pay rent on this property through
     September, it has vacated the premises and the Trust has initiated efforts
     to re-lease or sell the property.  The Trust believes that it is unlikely
     that it will be able to re-lease the property on terms as favorable as the
     terms with Safeway.  Furthermore, depending on the eventual use of the
     property, the Trust could be required to take a write down of up to $1.5
     million (book value).
(6)  The aggregate cost or adjusted basis of rental property for federal income
     tax purposes reconciles to the amount reflected in the financial statements
     at December 31, 1993 as follows:
