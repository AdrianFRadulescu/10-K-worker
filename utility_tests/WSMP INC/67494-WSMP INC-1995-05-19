ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.
- ------------------


     The Company operates in three principal business segments:  restaurant
franchising, restaurant operations and food processing.  Information as to
revenue, operating profit, identifiable assets, depreciation and amortization
expense, and capital expenditures, for each of the Company's business segments
for fiscal 1995 is contained on page 18 of the Company's Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended February 24, 1995, under the caption
"Lines of Business", and is incorporated herein by reference.

RESTAURANT FRANCHISING
- ----------------------


RESTAURANT FRANCHISING - WESTERN STEER.   The most significant segment of the
- ---------------------------------------
Company's franchising operations centers around the Western Steer chain of
restaurants, which includes the Western Steer Family Restaurant concept and the
Western Steer - Steaks, Buffet & Bakery concept.  The Western Steer Family
Restaurant concept originated in 1975 as a family oriented, reasonably priced
steakhouse restaurant, and features a rustic western-style design, steaks and
other entrees cooked to order, and an "all-you-can-eat" buffet food bar.
Beginning in 1992, the Company began a extensive program of renovation of this
concept which included updating the buffet food bar, adding an in-house bakery
and changing the store appearance to highlight a new format.  Restaurants
updated to this new format have been renamed "Western Steer - Steaks, Buffet &
Bakery".

     The Company has 58 franchised Western Steer restaurants located in North
Carolina (28), Kentucky (7), West Virginia (5), Georgia (4), South Carolina (4),
Florida (3), Virginia (3), Tennessee (3), and Alabama (1).  Of this total, 26
are operated as Western Steer - Steaks, Buffet & Bakery restaurants.  The
Company no longer offers the Western Steer Family Restaurant franchise, and
believes that many of the existing units will eventually elect to convert to the
Western Steer - Steaks, Buffet & Bakery format.  Although the decision regarding
whether to renovate and the timing thereof rests with the franchisee, the
Company encourages its franchisees to renovate franchised restaurants and
provides assistance in doing so, primarily through consulting with franchisees
regarding the renovations and subsequent operational changes and training of
franchisee personnel.  The Company anticipates that most of the remaining 32
franchised restaurants will be renovated within the next twenty-four months.
The primary costs of renovating franchised restaurants are borne by the
franchisees.

     The average sales volume during the fiscal year ended February 24, 1995 for
franchised Western Steer - Steaks, Buffet & Bakery restaurants that have been  
open for one year or more was $1,237,000.  This represents a decrease of 3.6%
from the fiscal 1994 average of $1,283,000.  The average sales volume for fiscal
1995 for Western Steer Family Restaurant units that have been open for one year
or more was $1,011,000, representing an increase over average sales for fiscal
1994 which totaled $994,000.

     The Company granted no franchises during fiscal 1995 for Western Steer -
Steaks, Buffet & Bakery restaurants.  This was due to the Company's focus on
reformulating requirements for franchises, as well as improving sales and
profitability of existing restaurants.  Although the Company intends to support
any future interest in franchise expansion of this concept, it is felt that most
new franchising interest will center around the Prime Sirloin and Bennett's'
concepts discussed below.

     At February 24, 1995, major shareholders of the Company had ownership
interests in 19 of the 58 franchised restaurants.  See Item 13, "Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions."


RESTAURANT FRANCHISING - PRIME SIRLOIN    In 1987, the Company acquired Prime
- --------------------------------------
Sirloin, Inc., a regional franchised steakhouse chain composed of seven units
and headquartered in Morristown, Tennessee.  This concept, although similar to
Western Steer, was slightly more upscale, with larger building designs,
different interiors, and a higher average ticket price.   At February 24, 1995,
there were 10 franchised Prime Sirloin restaurants located in Tennessee (6),
North Carolina (1), South Carolina (1), Georgia (1), and Kentucky (1).  Major
shareholders of the Company have an ownership interest in four of the franchised
Prime Sirloin restaurants.  See Item 13 "Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions."

     Due to the success of the Western Steer redesign, management has offered
its Prime Sirloin franchise operators a remodel and redesign program similar to
the Western Steer reformat.  As of February 24, 1995, three of the franchised
units in Tennessee had been remodeled and the name changed to "Prime Sirloin -
Buffet, Bakery & Steaks."

     During fiscal 1995, management of the Company introduced a new Prime
Sirloin prototype designed to capitalize on the industry's success with larger
buffet style formats.  This "mega-sized" prototype centers around a budget steak
and buffet concept with seating for over 400 patrons.  Significant alterations
from the original Prime Sirloin design include a panoramic entry, which gives
customers a view of the buffet and dining area, a "double-line" system,
directing guests to the buffet floor quickly, and a "scatter-bar" buffet design
which allows guests to visit different areas for different phases of their meal.
The new Prime Sirloin design costs approximately $2.1 million per unit, and each
unit is anticipated to gross approximately  $3.1 million in first year sales.
One new prototype Prime Sirloin franchise was opened in Spartanburg, South
Carolina in August of 1994.  Management anticipates the opening of five
additional new prototype franchise units during fiscal 1996.


RESTAURANT FRANCHISING - BENNETT'S SMOKEHOUSE & SALOON   In 1990, WSMP became a
- ------------------------------------------------------
sub-franchiser of Denver-based Bennett's Bar-B-Que, Inc., with development
rights exclusively for Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia, and expansion
rights elsewhere in the United States, except for Colorado, Texas, and
metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia.  As a sub-franchiser, the Company pays royalty
fees to the franchiser equal to 1% of revenues for each Bennett's restaurant
owned or sub-franchised by the Company.

     In 1994, management redesigned the Bennett's Bar-B-Que concept into
Bennett's Smokehouse & Saloon, a Texas roadhouse theme concept merging steaks
and barbecue in a 186-seat casual dinner house.  This concept represents the
Company's first entry into the rapidly growing casual dining market.  At
February 24, 1995, the Company had four franchised Bennett's restaurants located
in Tennessee (3) and South Carolina (1).  The South Carolina franchise, which is
operated through a joint venture in which the Company owns 50%, was opened
during fiscal 1995 and incorporates the Bennett's Smokehouse & Saloon concept.

     Management feels that the Bennett's Smokehouse and Saloon concept offers a
promising vehicle for growth in franchise operations with five units being
planned for fiscal 1996.  Units operating under this concept are expected to
generate average annual revenues of $2.1 million per unit.  Management
anticipates the opening of five franchise units during fiscal 1996.

     The first of the five new Bennett's to open in fiscal 1996 will be a 50%
joint venture with an individual investor for a restaurant attached to the
Holiday Inn in Greenville, South Carolina.  The restaurant will operate the
total food service program for the hotel under a five-year lease, with three 5-
year renewal options.  In conjunction with this new location, Bennett's became
an approved foodservice operator for Holiday Inn.  As a result, there may be
opportunities to expand with Holiday Inn as the hotel company recently decided
to stop the ownership and management of on-site restaurants and will be turning
over such opportunities to independent, approved restaurant operators.  However,
future opportunities, if they arise, will be evaluated on an individual basis.


RESTAURANT FRANCHISING - OTHER.   WSMP has created the "Mom `n' Pop's Buffet and
- -------------------------------
Bakery" restaurant concept, to fit existing Western Steer buildings in areas in
which competition has grown, or in which past performance necessitates other
market approaches.  This restaurant concept consists of food bars from which
customers make selections.  At fiscal year end, there were only two franchised
units under this concept, both located in Georgia.  At the present time, the
Company does not consider these restaurants or their franchising as being
significant to its overall operations.


RESTAURANT FRANCHISING - FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.   Generally, older franchise
- ----------------------------------------------
agreements have a 20-year term and no advertising fee, although some franchisees
subsequently entered into supplementary agreements providing for advertising
fees.  Newer agreements have a 10-year term, with a right to renew for a 10-year
period at the franchisee's option, and an advertising fee of 2% of gross sales.
Franchise agreements provide for a royalty of 3% of gross sales.  All agreements
provide for an exclusive territory and for in-term and post-term non-competition
agreements.


     No single franchisee or groups of franchisees under common control provides
revenues equal to 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues.



RESTAURANT OPERATIONS.
- ----------------------


WESTERN STEER, PRIME SIRLOIN, AND BENNETT'S RESTAURANTS.  The Company and
- --------------------------------------------------------
certain consolidated subsidiaries own and operate 11 Western Steer - Steaks,
Buffet & Bakery restaurants and 4 Western Steer Family Restaurants.  These
restaurants are located in North Carolina (7), Georgia (3), Maryland (2), South
Carolina (1), Florida (1), and Tennessee (1).  The Company expects to complete
renovation of the four additional Company owned restaurants by the end of fiscal
1996 at an approximate aggregate cost to the Company of $550,000.  In addition,
the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries own and operate five
Prime Sirloin - Buffet, Bakery & Steaks restaurants in North Carolina (4) and
Florida(1).  One North Carolina unit was acquired during fiscal 1995 when the
Company purchased an additional 30% ownership interest in an existing
subsidiary, bring the total ownership to 80%.  One Bennett's Smokehouse & Saloon
restaurant is owned by the Company and is located in North Carolina.

     The Company does not intend to build or acquire any additional wholly-owned
Western Steer, Prime Sirloin, or Bennett's restaurants during fiscal 1996.
Expansion of these concepts is planned to be accomplished through franchising
activities.


OTHER RESTAURANTS. The Company owns one Mom 'n' Pop's Buffet & Bakery restaurant
- ------------------
in Florida.  One other restaurant in Morganton, North Carolina is operated in a
different format.  The Company also owns 50% interests in three "Sagebrush
Steakhouse & Saloon" restaurants in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Tennessee, with Charles F. Connor, Jr., a major shareholder of the Company,
whose company owns the "Sagebrush" concept.  See Item 13, "Certain Relationships
and Related Transactions."  The Company does not consider these restaurants, in
total, significant to its overall operation.


     The Company considers its restaurant segment to be somewhat seasonal in
nature, with stronger sales during the Christmas season and during Spring, and
weaker sales during the mid-summer and late winter months.




OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS.  The following is a summary of all Company-owned

RESTAURANT MEAL PRICES.  The average meal price for Company-owned Western Steer
- -----------------------
restaurants is $5.93 and the average meal price for Company-owned Prime Sirloin
restaurants is $6.12.  Meal prices vary depending on geographic location, degree
of renovation, and whether the restaurant is Company-owned or franchised.


SUPPLIERS.  The Company has established a purchase program with Institutional
- ----------
Food House, Inc. ("IFH") of Hickory, North Carolina.  This program allows
Company-owned restaurants and franchisees to obtain substantially all staple
items on a regular basis from one purchasing source and promotes the consistency
and high quality of goods delivered to its restaurants and participating
franchisees.  Any purchase program is voluntary for franchisees, and franchisees
are free to buy their food from IFH or elsewhere as long as it meets the
Company's specifications.  The Company does not feel that the loss of the IFH
agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company.



FOOD PRODUCTION.
- ----------------


MOM 'N' POP'S COUNTRY HAM.  The Company produces, through its Smokehouse
- --------------------------
Division, sugar-cured hams and ham products for the retail and institutional
markets.  In the Company's modern curing facilities in Claremont, North
Carolina, the atmospheric conditions of traditional air curing of pork hams are
simulated, resulting in a curing process that fully cures raw hams in a period
of approximately 70 days.  The Company cured over 10,009,000 pounds of ham
during fiscal 1995 in its 55,000 square foot facility.

     The Company produces whole cured hams, packaged cured ham slices, pre-
portioned ham for portion control customers, and various "side meat" products.
A portion of ham production is sold directly or through distributors to retail
supermarkets under the "Mom 'n' Pop's" brand name, primarily in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Georgia.  The remainder of production is
sold to institutional food distributors.  One supermarket customer accounted for
24.2% of cured ham sales during the past fiscal year.  The Company is confident,
based upon historical customer demand, that numerous other outlets exist for
these products.

     Raw hams are available from numerous sources, although the Company relies
upon four suppliers for most of its hams.  Loss of one or more of the four
suppliers would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.

     Sales for the Company's Smokehouse division are seasonal in nature, with
sales volume increases occurring around Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.  The
Company mitigates the seasonality of its sales by continuing to buy hams in non-
peak periods and storing them until peak seasons.


MOM 'N' POP'S BAKERY PRODUCTS.  The Company produces through its Mom `n' Pop's
- ------------------------------
Bakery Division, a variety of biscuits, yeast rolls and other flour-based
products.  The Company's biscuits are processed both plain and as sandwiches
filled with items such as sausage, cheese, eggs and country ham.  These frozen
products are directly marketed under the "Mom `n' Pop's" brand name to
institutional buyers, vending companies, delicatessens and supermarkets and are
also packed for several of the Company's customers under private labels.  The
Company's yeast rolls are used primarily in frozen microwavable sandwiches.  The
Company packs microwavable hamburger, cheeseburger, chicken, barbecue and other
sandwiches using its own fresh baked yeast rolls for two customers under custom
manufacturing agreements.  In addition, similar sandwiches are produced under
the "Mom `n' Pop's" brand name and marketed directly to supermarkets, vending
companies and institutional buyers.  The Company has also developed several pre-
mixed baking products for sale to institutional customers.  These pre-mixed
products include items such as cookie dough, biscuit and roll dough, dumplings
and pizza crust, most of which are prepared simply with the addition of water.

     During fiscal 1994, the Company completed a plant upfitting and expansion
for the Bakery Division, which cost approximately $8,000,000.  The expansion was
financed partially through a $4,000,000 Industrial Revenue Bond Offering.  This
project resulted in a 60% increase in the Company's capability to produce bakery
products.

     The ingredients used in this Division's products and mixes are purchased
primarily from five vendors but alternative sources are available.  Three
customers accounted for approximately 89.2% of sales during fiscal 1995.  One of
these customers, Hudson Foods, Inc., accounted for approximately 80.0% of bakery
sales, and the Company has entered into a contractual arrangement to supply that
company's requirements for those products.  The Company believes that a loss of
this customer would have an adverse short-term effect on the Company; however,
the long-term impact would be minimal due to the demand for the Company's food
products from other customers and potential customers.

     Although the Company does not consider its Bakery division to be seasonal,
its somewhat slower sales periods typically occur in the mid-summer months.


REVENUES.  Revenues for the two divisions that make up the Food Production
- ---------
segment of the Company's business, for the past three fiscal years, are as
follows:


 FISCAL YEAR ENDED     BAKERY DIVISION     HAM CURING DIVISION
 -----------------     ---------------     -------------------
       1995              $49,600,000           $12,800,000
       1994              $27,100,000           $11,900,000
       1993              $24,500,000           $13,500,000



EMPLOYEES.
- ----------

     The Company employed 1,624 persons (812 full time and 812 part time) in its
operations at February 24, 1995.  These included 85 administrative and
accounting personnel, 495 Bakery and Smokehouse employees, and 1,044 restaurant
workers.  The Company offers its employees various benefits, including major
medical coverage, and participation in its cafeteria plan, its profit-sharing
retirement plan, and its employee stock purchase plan.

     None of the Company's employees are represented by a union.  The Company
has experienced no work stoppage attributed to labor disputes and considers its
employee relations to be good.


WORKING CAPITAL.
- ----------------

     The Company's working capital needs in its restaurant segment do not vary
appreciably on a seasonal basis or from year to year.  All Company-owned and
most franchised restaurants participate in the Company's IFH purchase program
and do not carry substantial food inventories.  The Company does not provide
customers or franchisees with the right to return products, other than major
grocery store chains which it may supply, except where required under contract
law.  Also, the Company does not give extended payment terms to its customers or
franchisees.  The Company's food production segment working capital needs vary
with the seasonality of its revenues.

     The Company does provide standard Food and Drug Administration warranties
to its retailers and distributors of ham or bakery products, concerning the
unadulterated nature of its products and their introduction into interstate
commerce.


MARKETING AND ADVERTISING.
- --------------------------

     The Company relies upon advertising to help promote Western Steer and Prime
Sirloin restaurants.  Local advertising has been the responsibility of
individual restaurant operators.  The Company and its Western Steer and Prime
Sirloin franchisees have advertised their restaurants primarily in newspapers
and billboards and with point-of-sale materials.

     Most Western Steer franchisees, through franchise agreements or
supplementary agreements, are obligated to pay the Company an advertising fee of
two percent of the gross sales of each franchised restaurant.  This fee is
intended to provide funds for future national, regional and local advertising of
Western Steer restaurants.

     The Company actively markets its ham and bakery products to large grocery
distributors, institutional food brokers and in some cases, directly to retail
grocery chains.

     In 1990, the Company entered into an Endorsement Agreement with Dale
Earnhardt, Inc. and affiliated corporations by which the Company became an
endorsement sponsor of the Dale Earnhardt automobile racing team on the NASCAR
Winston Cup Series and the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series.  This agreement
has been extended through 1997.  Mr. Earnhardt is currently one of the best-
known and most successful stock car drivers on the Winston Cup circuit.  As part
of its sponsorship, the Company has the right to use Mr. Earnhardt's likeness
and that of his racing car in advertising campaigns, as well as his endorsement
of the Company's food products and restaurants.  The Company has developed and
intends to further develop advertising and promotional campaigns based upon Mr.
Earnhardt's association with Western Steer, Prime Sirloin, and Bennett's
restaurants and with Smokehouse and Bakery products.


COMPETITION.
- ------------

     The restaurant and food manufacturing businesses are highly competitive and
are often affected by changes in tastes and eating habits of the public, and
economic conditions affecting spending habits, population and traffic patterns.
Company-operated restaurants and Western Steer and Prime Sirloin restaurants
operated by franchisees generally compete with national and regional family-
oriented restaurant chains, local establishments and fast food restaurants.  The
Company believes that family-oriented steakhouses compete primarily on the basis
of consistency and quality of product, price and location of restaurants.  In
marketing franchises, the Company competes with numerous other family steakhouse
and restaurant franchisors, many of which have substantially greater financial
resources and higher sales volume than the Company.

     In its production of retail and institutional ham products, the Company
faces strong price competition from a variety of large meat processing concerns
and smaller local and regional operations.  The Company does not believe that
any one company is dominant in the sale of ham products.  The principal methods
of competition in the sale of ham products are price, quality, and name
recognition.  In sales of biscuit and yeast roll products, the Company competes
with a number of large bakeries in various parts of the country, as well as
national frozen meal manufacturers, with competition strongest for sales to
institutional food vendors.  The principal methods of competition for the sale
of bakery products are price and quality.


TRADEMARKS.
- -----------

     The Company has registered the Western Steer logotype and the names
"Western Steer", "Western Steer Family Restaurant", "Western Steer Steaks,
Buffet & Bakery", "Prime Sirloin - Buffet, Bakery & Steaks", the "Prime Sirloin"
logotype and the "Mom 'n' Pop's" logotype and variations thereof, as well as
several distinct Western Steer menu items, as trademarks and service marks with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  The Company actively uses these
trademarks to identify its restaurants and products and believes they are
important to its business.  Generally, trademarks remain valid as long as they
are used properly for identification purposes.


REGULATION.
- ----------

     The Company is subject to Federal Trade Commission regulations relating to
disclosure requirements in the sale of franchises.  Many states also have laws
regulating franchise operations, including registration and disclosure
requirements in the offer and sale of franchises and the application of
statutory standards regulating franchise relationships.  The Company believes it
is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations
governing its operations.

     The conduct of the Company's businesses is subject to various other federal
and state laws, including the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational
Safety and Health Act.  The Company is also subject to the Fair Labor Standards
Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working
conditions.  A significant portion of the Company's food service personnel are
paid at rates related to the Federal minimum wage, and, accordingly, future
increases in the minimum wage will increase the Company's labor cost.

     The Company believes itself to be in material compliance with federal,
state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and
feels that such compliance should not have a material effect on the Company's
capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.

WWSMP PROFILE

 
     WSMP, Inc., is a North Carolina-based food manufacturing and restaurant
company that in the last three decades has grown from humble origins in the
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains to become nationally recognized in the
food service industry with nearly $100 million in annual revenues. The 
Company is comprised of two separate food manufacturing divisions and a 
division that develops, owns, operates and franchises restaurants.     

     The Bakery Division is the larger of WSMP's food manufacturing operations
and includes the largest single-site microwaveable sandwich manufacturing
facility in the United States.  The facility in Claremont, N.C. has the capacity
to produce more than four million microwaveable sandwiches per week.  In
addition to manufacturing a wide variety of sandwiches, including meat-filled
biscuits, under private and company labels, the division also produces
buttermilk biscuit, yeast rolls and other items for institutional and retail
sales.

     The Ham Curing Division is one of the largest country ham producers in the
United States, with a capacity to cure 650,000 hams annually.  This division
traces its root to the earliest days of WSMP, and in the last two decades its
products have regularly won top national and regional prizes as being among the
best in the nation.  Its products are sold under the Mom `n' Pop's brand label
to both institutional and retail markets, and are provided whole and in packages
of slices for both retail and restaurant usage and in closely controlled sliced
portions for the restaurant and  fast-food industry.

     Restaurant operations comprise ninety-eight Company owned and
franchised units, primarily in the Southeast.  A majority of these restaurants
are Western Steer units, including the traditional Western Steer Family
Restaurant and new or remodeled Western Steer Steaks, Buffet and Bakery
restaurants.  Prime Sirloin and Bennett's  are the other two main segments of
the restaurant division.  Both of these concepts are growing and play an
important part in the Company's plans for the future.  Mega-sized Prime Sirloin
Buffet, Bakery and Steaks restaurants are being built to directly compete with
recognized leaders in the economy steak and buffet restaurant segment.
Bennett's Smokehouse and Saloon restaurants are a result of a partnership
between WSMP and Bennett's Bar-B-Que, Inc., of Denver, CO, and represent the
Company's entry into the growing Texas-style roadhouse themed category.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- -----------------------

To Our Shareholders and Friends:

     Fiscal 1995 was one of the more important in WSMP's history.  As you review
the financial performance of your company, you will find that we began to
receive benefits from the previous year's positioning of WSMP in all categories
for strong growth.  We generated record revenues during fiscal 1995 and recorded
a turnaround in profitability that equaled about $0.68 per share of common
stock.  WSMP also continued to focus on how best to position itself to respond
to the changing food service environment.  We recognize that the achievements of
fiscal 1995 are just the beginning steps of what WSMP must accomplish.  Let me
provide you some details about what we did in the last fiscal year and tell you
how we are trying to maximize our potential for the future.

     First, the $8.2 million expansion of the Bakery facilities completed just
prior to the beginning of fiscal 1995 helped this division achieve a significant
growth in operations of 17% compared to the preceding fiscal year.  The
expansion increased our bakery capacity by 60%.  We are using a significant
portion of this additional capacity to produce products to be sold under private
labels as well as our own Mom `n' Pop's label.

     As far as we can determine, the division is the largest single-site
sandwich maker in the United States, and is now producing three million
microwaveable sandwiches per week.  We feel sales of bakery products will
continue to grow and we have the capacity to manufacture an additional one and a
half million sandwiches per week.  Our Bakery Division maintains and excellent
customer base and as a result of new co-pack contracts, this year it will
introduce several line extensions to products now being produced for private
label sales.

     Secondly, in our Ham Curing Division we made appropriate adjustments to raw
ham purchasing procedures so that we could successfully deal with the abnormal
pork pricing problem that had a very negative effect on margins for Mom `n'
Pop's Country Ham during the preceding fiscal year.  In our last annual report,
we projected that the Ham Curing Division would recover and reach the level of
profitability it had reported in the five years immediately prior to fiscal
1994.  In fact, we totally reversed our margins on ham products compared to the
prior year, resulting in the division's most successful year since being founded
in 1972.

     Based on pork futures markets, it appears that prices for raw hams, also
called green hams, will remain low during the current fiscal year.  This should
provide the opportunity for another outstanding year for the division.  WSMP has
the capacity to cure 650,000 hams annually, which makes us one of the largest
country ham producers in the country.  During Fiscal 1995, we operated the Ham
Curing Division at total capacity and anticipate it will operate at capacity
again during the current year.

     Third, our restaurant operations met many of their objectives during
the year.  Our first prototype Prime Sirloin Buffet, Bakery & Steak restaurant,
featuring a large, up-to-date prototype building design, was opened in
Spartanburg, S.C., and five additional prototype Prime Sirloin restaurants will
open in the current fiscal year.  This concept has received favorable publicity
in national restaurant trade media, has generated inquires from potential
franchisees, and is successfully competing with leaders in the economy steak and
buffet restaurant segment, including the Ryan's and Golden Corral mega concept.

     WSMP also opened the first Bennett's Smokehouse and Saloon in Spartanburg
and converted its Conover, N.C., Bennett's Pit Barbeque restaurant to a
Bennett's Smokehouse & Saloon.  The parent company of Bennett's Pit Barbeque
also opened new Bennett's Smokehouse and Saloon restaurants in Colorado Springs,
CO, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Consumer acceptance and sales achieved by these
new units reinforced our decision to move forward with this concept of
merchandising Texas-style ribs, steaks and barbeque in a casual, saloon
atmosphere.  These restaurants are designed to compete directly with the
successful Western-style concepts such as Longhorn and Lone Star.

     WSMP feels that the concept has a unique menu-mix, and by offering a wide
range of western smoked barbeque as well as the steaks, salads, and other items
available at competing restaurants, we fit a nitch in the market that is not
served.  The Company, which has rights as Bennett's sub-franchisor in all areas
except Denver, CO, the state of Texas, and Atlanta, GA., has one Bennett's under
construction now and anticipated the opening of at least five new Bennett's
Smokehouse & Saloons during the fiscal year.

     WSMP's franchisees and the Company continued the program of remodeling
Western Steer Family Restaurant locations to convert them to Western Steer
Steaks, Buffet and Bakery restaurants during fiscal 1995.  Also, WSMP plans to
plans to convert the final four Company-owned traditional Western Steers to
bakery-style restaurants during the current fiscal year.  The remodeled Western
Steer bakery-style units have enjoyed an annualized same-store sales increase 
average of 20%.  Menu enhancement and marketing activities to support our
Western Steer concept and franchise community received significant emphasis 
during fiscal 1995 and plans for the promotion of these restaurants have been 
completed for the current fiscal year.

     In addition to focusing on the activities of its three operating segments,
WSMP's management has launched a program to closely examine all overhead costs.
This is part of the effect to further improve profitability by controlling
general and administrative expenses that directly affect revenue centers.

     Shortly after the end of fiscal 1995, WSMP's board of directors declared a
25% stock dividend and the distribution was made April 11,1995.  We feel this
was a good way to help recognize the loyalty of stock holders who continued to
support WSMP while we realigned to seek new level of sales and profitability.

     As we reported last year, the management of WSMP fully understand our
obligation to shareholders, employees and franchisees to not only be profitable
in all segments, but to maximize profits in all operating segments.
Accomplishing that obligation is our primary objective for fiscal 1996.

     WSMP's management and board want each of you to be comfortable with your
investment in our modern food service company.  Therefore, if you have questions
about anything disclosed in the annual report, including anything discussed in
this letter, please feel free to visit us in Claremont, NC, or telephone me
directly.

Sincerely,




James C. Richardson, Jr.
President and Chief Executive Officer




MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
- -----------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 
RESTAURANT REVENUES

Revenues from Company-owned restaurants for fiscal 1995 decreased $2.1 million,
or 6.9% in comparison with fiscal 1994.  This decrease in revenues is the direct
result of closing nine restaurant units during these years, four of which were
closed in fiscal 1995.  Offsetting this decrease are revenues received from a
unit acquired at the beginning of fiscal 1995 which totaled $1 million and an
increase in same store sales of $.9 million, or 3.8%.  This increase in same
store sales for fiscal 1995 compares with a 3.8% decrease for fiscal 1994 and
represents a turnaround in restaurant operations.  Management attributes this
turnaround to the renovations of Western Steer restaurant properties which have
occurred during the past three years, as well as enhancements during the current
year of the Bennett's and Prime Sirloin concepts.

Company-owned restaurant revenues for fiscal 1994 decreased by $4.4 million, or
12.5% in comparison with fiscal 1993.  This decrease is the result of the
decrease in same store sales, mentioned previously, as well as the closing of
several unprofitable restaurants units during fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993.


FOOD PROCESSING REVENUES

The food processing segment recorded record revenues of $62.3 million during
fiscal 1995 compared to revenues of $39.0 million in fiscal 1994 and $38.1
million in fiscal 1993.  A major reason for the increase in revenues in fiscal
1995 was a change in contract terms, which occurred in December of 1993, with
the Bakery's largest contract customer.  Prior to this contract change, the
customer provided the meat component and packaging material used in the
production of its meat-filled sandwiches.  Sales to this customer consisted only
of the bakery component and cost of production and packing.  In December 1993,
the Company entered into a new agreement with this customer whereby the Company
would purchase the meat components and packaging material from the customer and
adjust the sales price accordingly.  These amounts are subsequently reported as
sales and cost of goods sold.  Purchases by the Company of the meat component
and packaging from this customer during fiscal 1995 and 1994 totaled $23.4
million and $4.8 million, respectively.  Although this change does not affect
total gross profit for the years involved, it does impact total sales and cost
of goods sold.  Had this change not occurred, revenues relating to the food
processing segment during fiscal 1995 would have shown an increase over fiscal
1994 of only $4.6 million, or 13.5%.  Approximately $.9 million of this
increase is attributable to the ham curing operations which generated total
revenues of $12.8 million.  The remaining increase represent growth in the
bakery operations during fiscal 1995 and utilization of the increased capacity
in this division.

Fiscal 1994 revenues of the food processing segment totaled $39.0 million
compared to $38.1 million in fiscal 1993.  However, the contract change
discussed above also impacted food processing revenues in fiscal 1994.  Had this
contract change not occurred, revenues relating to this segment would have shown
a decrease in fiscal 1994 compared to fiscal 1993 of $3.9 million.
Approximately $1.6 million of the decrease was attributed to falling pork prices
which directly affected revenues of the ham curing operations.  The remaining
decrease resulted due to constraints on production in the bakery operations
during fiscal 1994 as the expansion project was completed.

Management anticipates continued long-term growth in the food processing
segment.  However, a decrease of approximately 15.3% in the level of  sales in
this segment is expected for the first quarter of fiscal 1996 as compared to the
first quarter of fiscal 1995.  This is due to the largest customer of the bakery
repositioning itself in certain of its own markets and , as a result,
discontinuing a line of product previously purchased from the Company.  The
customer has developed a well refined program to replace this volume, and
management believes that the impact will not extend significantly beyond the
first quarter of fiscal 1996.


FRANCHISE, ROYALTY AND OTHER FEES

Franchise, royalty and other fees have declined for the last three fiscal years
from $3.4 million in fiscal 1993, to $3.0 million in fiscal 1994, to $2.9
million in fiscal 1993.  This decrease is attributed to a reduction in the
number of operating franchised units during this same period.  During fiscal
1995 this decline was partially offset by a 2.8% increase in sales in franchised
restaurants that were opened for both fiscal 1995 and 1994.


COSTS AND EXPENSES

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of food sales was 72.4% in fiscal 1995
compared with 65.8% in fiscal 1994 and 62.4% in fiscal 1993.  The fluctuation
over this three year period is due to the contract change with the bakery
operation's largest customer which is discussed above as it relates to food
processing revenues.  As previously mentioned, this change affected revenues and
cost of goods sold, but has no net effect on total gross profit.  If the cost of
the meat component and packaging material purchased from this customer during
fiscal 1995 and 1994 were eliminated from food sales and cost of goods sold, and
these years were restated consistent with 1993, cost of goods sold as a
percentage of food sales would be 62.9% in fiscal 1995 and 63.3% in fiscal 1994.
The higher percentage for fiscal 1994 is attributed to higher raw material costs
in the ham-curing division during that year, as well as increased operating
costs in the bakery division associated with the plant expansion.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, operating
expenses include indirect costs associated with restaurant product sales and
other revenues, which consist primarily of franchise, royalty and other fees.
These expenses, as a percentage of revenues of the restaurant and franchising
segments were 45.7% in fiscal 1995, 45.4% in fiscal 1994 and 44.1% in fiscal
1993.  The gradual increase is primarily attributed to the decline in
franchising revenues which cannot be offset with corresponding reductions in
certain fixed costs in the franchising segment.

Selling, general and administrative expenses have shown little fluctuation
during the three years presented.  The small increase in fiscal 1994 over 1993
is primarily the result of the $.6 million increase in the management fee which
was approved by the Company's shareholders in fiscal 1994, offset by a
concentrated effort by management to control expenses in this category.  Further
cost control measures resulted in the decrease for fiscal 1995.


INFLATION

The effects of inflation on the cost of labor, material and supplies, and plant
and equipment have resulted in increased costs to the Company during the past
three years.  Ongoing programs of cost control and elimination of overhead
expenses have helped to offset much of the impact of inflation.   Although the
Company cannot determine the precise effect of inflation on its business, the
restaurant operations are believed to be the most susceptible to the adverse
effects of inflation as compared to other divisions of the Company.   This is
due to price discounting which has prevailed in the family and fast food
restaurant segments throughout the nation for the past three years, making it
difficult to cover increased costs by increasing menu prices.



FINANCIAL CONDITION


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity of WSMP, Inc., can be evaluated in light of the working capital
position and cash flows of the Company.  As of February 24, 1995 the Company had
net working capital of $904,000 which compares with $(450,000) at February 25,
1994 and $2,131,000 at February 26, 1993.  The working capital of the Company
was significantly reduced in fiscal 1994 by the major capital expansion of the
bakery facility.  This project was completed in December of 1993 at a total cost
of approximately $8 million.  Half of the project was financed by the issuance
of Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $4 million.  The remaining portion was
financed by internally generated cash and short-term borrowings which reduced
the net working capital of the Company.  During 1995, the Company was able to
restore approximately $1.35 million of this working capital, as well as provide
for necessary capital expenditures totaling $1.2 million and debt repayments
totaling $3.7 million.  This was accomplished  through profitable operations
during fiscal 1995 and the sale of certain under-performing restaurant
properties.

Operating activities continue to provide positive cash flow to the Company.
During fiscal 1995, net cash of $.8 million was provided by operations compared
to $2.8 million in fiscal 1994 and $2.5 million in fiscal 1993.   The decrease
in cash provided by operations in fiscal 1995 is due to repayments to certain
vendors who provided the Company with extended credit terms in fiscal 1994 in
order to assist in the cash flow requirements necessary to bring the bakery
project on line.  This is evidenced by the $1.4 million reduction in trade
accounts payable between February 25, 1994 and February 24, 1995.

Additional cash was generated in fiscal 1995 through the investing activities of
the Company.  Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.7 million in
fiscal 1995 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.5 million
and $5.1 million in fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1993.  Negative cash flows during
fiscal 1994 and 1993 were the result of capital expenditures relating to the
Company's expansion of its bakery facility and the renovation of certain
restaurants properties.  In fiscal 1995, the positive cash flows from investing
activities were generated through the sale of assets.  During the year,
approximately $.8 million was received from the sale of real estate classified
as "Properties held for sale" at February 25, 1994.  An additional $2.9
million was received from the sale of under-performing assets consisting
primarily of restaurants closed during fiscal 1995, which were sold without
adversely affecting the profitability of the Company.

Cash generated from operating and investing activities during fiscal 1995 was
used by the Company in financing activities.  Net cash used in financing
activities was $4.0 million in fiscal 1995 and $.5 million in fiscal 1994
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.4 million in fiscal
1993.   The use of cash in fiscal 1995 relates to repayments of debt totaling
$3.7 million.  In fiscal 1994, repayments of long term debt were offset by short
term borrowings of approximately $1.3 million and the proceeds from issuance of
stock totaling $.6 million.  Fiscal 1993 reflects the issuance of long-term debt
associated with the bakery plant expansion and the renovation program of the
Company's restaurant segment.

For fiscal 1996, management feels that continued profitable operations and the
sales of additional non-core properties, will generate cash and working capital
levels sufficient for the needs of the Company.  At February 24, 1995, the
Company had $3.3 million in real estate held for sale.  The recent improved real
estate environment in the Southeastern United States allowed the Company to
dispose of several excess properties during fiscal 1995, and the Company views
the remaining properties as a valuable source of future working capital.
Approximately $1.0 million is expected to be generated in fiscal 1996 from the
sales of excess real estate.

In addition, the Company is currently seeking to refinance amounts outstanding
under its Senior Notes and short-term secured note on an intermediate to long
term basis through a private placement of debt.  The Senior Notes require semi-
annual principal payments of $769,230 and mature on October 1, 1996 with a
balloon payment of approximately $9,231,000.  The short-term secured note
represents line of credit borrowings which were utilized as partial funding for
the $8 million bakery expansion.  Refinancing of these amounts will allow the
Company to replenish working capital as well as provide capital to sustain and
grow all segments of the Company.  Management feels that an agreement will be
completed prior to the end of fiscal 1996.

The Company believes that revenues from operations, together with available
sources of financing, will be sufficient to provide the necessary long-term
capital resources required to fund the Company's capital requirements for the
coming three years.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include

      Naples Foods, Inc. (55%)               Virginia WSMP, Inc.
      Prime Sirloin, Inc.



      All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.

      FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION - Financial statements for fiscal 1994
and 1993 have been reclassified, where applicable, to conform to the financial
statement presentation used in fiscal 1995.

      FISCAL YEAR - The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Friday in
February.  All fiscal years presented represent fifty-two week periods.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -  The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

     INVESTMENTS - Effective February 26, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This statement requires that
investments in debt and equity securities be classified in the following three
categories: trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale.  Securities
classified as trading securities are carried at fair market value with
unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings.  Debt securities classified
as held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.  Securities
classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair market value with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings but shown as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.  All investments of the Company are comprised
of marketable equity securities held in broker managed accounts.  The Company
has classified all investments as available-for-sale.  At February 25, 1994,
investments are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.  Realized
and unrealized gains and losses on investments were not significant in fiscal
1995, 1994 and 1993.

     INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-
out) or market.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not significantly
extend useful lives of assets are charged to earnings whereas additions and
betterments, including interest costs incurred during construction, are
capitalized.  Gains and losses on dispositions are reflected in other income
except for gains on traded properties which are reflected in the basis of the
new asset.

     Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets on the straight-line basis.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or terms of the respective leases.  Property under capital leases
is amortized in accordance with the Company's normal depreciation policy.

     Depreciation and other expenses on properties leased to others are deducted
from rental income and reported net as other income.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS - The excess of cost over fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired is being amortized on the straight-line method over periods
of fifteen and forty years ($294,297 over fifteen years and $933,100 over forty
years as of February 24, 1995).

     INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES - Investments in common stock of unconsolidated
affiliates are accounted for using the equity method.

     COSTS AND EXPENSES - Cost of goods sold includes the direct and indirect
costs of tangible products sold by the food processing segment and the direct
costs of tangible products sold through restaurant operations.  Operating
expenses include additional indirect costs such as labor, insurance and
occupancy costs, other than depreciation, associated with restaurant product
sales and other revenues.  Selling, general and administrative expenses reflect
costs of marketing, selling and general administration not included in cost of
goods sold or operating expenses.

     PREOPENING EXPENSES - Preopening expenses associated with new restaurant
openings are expensed as incurred.

     INCOME TAXES - Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), required a change from the deferral
method to the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under
the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial accounting
bases of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates
applicable to the years when such differences are scheduled to reverse.  Under
SFAS 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the period that includes the enactment date.  The Company adopted SFAS 109
during the year beginning February 27, 1993 and has reported the cumulative
effect on prior years of the change in the consolidated statement of operations
for the fiscal year ended February 25, 1994.  Under the deferral method, prior
to February 27, 1993, deferred taxes were recognized using the tax rate
applicable to the year of the calculation and were not adjusted for subsequent
changes in tax rates.

     FRANCHISE, ROYALTY AND OTHER FEES - Initial franchise fees are recognized
as revenue when substantially all of the services required of the Company by the
franchise agreement have been performed, which is generally the date the
franchised unit opens.  Royalty and other fees are accrued as earned based on
franchisees' sales.

     EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during
each fiscal year.  Common equivalent shares relate to outstanding stock options.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are 2,879,021 in
fiscal 1995, 2,624,015 in fiscal 1994 and 2,875,100 in fiscal 1993.  Amounts for
1994 and 1993 have been restated to reflect a five-for-four stock split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend declared in 1995.  (See note 19).

Noncurrent notes receivable have maturities ranging from 1996 to 2001.

  Trade accounts receivable are generated by sales of the food processing
segment and have terms ranging between fourteen and thirty days.  A
concentration of receivables exists relating to one Bakery customer which
accounted for 63% of the food processing segment sales in fiscal 1995.
Receivables from this customer totaled $1,625,738 at February 24, 1995 and
represent 43.8% of the total.

     Depreciation and amortization expense of property, plant and equipment
was $3,198,638, $3,184,365 and $3,020,514 for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Accumulated depreciation applicable to property under
capital leases was $445,006, $365,366 and $330,552 for fiscal 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.  Approximately $266,792 and $186,000 in interest
costs were capitalized in fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.  No interest
costs were capitalized in fiscal 1995.


NOTE 5 - PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE:

     During fiscal 1991, the Company began a restructuring of its owned
restaurant operations to improve profitability by, among other things,
updating restaurant formats and disposing of less profitable stores. As a
result of this restructuring, the Company has closed various stores and
transferred the related real properties, in addition to certain undeveloped
land holdings, from the classification of property, plant and equipment to
other assets as properties held for sale.  The Company is selling these
properties as reasonable purchase offers are received.  At February 24, 1995,
the Company had $3,322,372 in properties held for sale.  These properties are
being carried at their net book value which does not exceed their estimated
net realizable value.

     The Company has evaluated the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ``Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of'' and does not believe that
this new standard will have any material effect on the Company's financial
statements as it relates to properties held for sale or other long-lived
assets.


NOTE 6 - SHORT -TERM NOTES PAYABLE:

     The Company has agreements with various banks which provide for short-
term secured borrowings up to $3,000,000, all of which was  utilized at
February 24, 1995.  Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing
inventory and receivables (approximately $7,900,000 in the aggregate) are
pledged as collateral under these borrowings.

     The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 9.75% and
6.75% at February 24, 1995 and February 25, 1994, respectively.


NOTE 7 - LONG-TERM DEBT:

     Long-term debt is comprised of the following:

     The applicable prime interest rate at February 24, 1995 was 9%.  The
variable rate payable on the Industrial Revenue Bonds at February 24, 1995 was
4%.  At February 24, 1995, the net book value of the Company's property, plant
and equipment pledged as collateral under the above obligations was
$19,989,000.

     The Senior Notes provide for monthly interest payments and semi-annual
principal payments of $769,230 beginning on October 1, 1991; a maturity date
of October 1, 1996; a security interest in certain of the Company's real
properties; and the annual payment of additional amounts that may be available
from excess cash flows (as defined).  All payments made under the excess cash
flow provision will be applied to the reduction of principal.  A balloon
payment of approximately $9,231,000, less any payments previously made under
the excess cash flow provision, will be required at October 1, 1996.
Additionally, the Senior Note terms require a current ratio of at least 125%
and the adjusted funded debt to adjusted equity ratio to not exceed 135%.  At
February 24, 1995, the Company's ratio of adjusted funded debt to adjusted
shareholders' equity was 85.8%.  No payments under the excess cash flow
provisions were required in fiscal 1995 and no such payments are anticipated
in fiscal 1996.

     The  Senior Note agreement also restricts future cash dividend payments
to shareholders to 25% of accumulated net earnings, with certain adjustments,
subsequent to February 28, 1986. After giving effect to such adjustments and
payment of cash dividends since February 28, 1986, there are no consolidated
retained earnings available for payment of cash dividends as of February 24,
1995.

     The Industrial Revenue Bond agreements require the Company to maintain
tangible net worth (as defined) at specified levels, to maintain a ratio of
total liabilities to tangible net worth not greater than 240%, a current ratio
of at least 90% at February 24, 1995, and 125% thereafter, and a fixed charges
ratio (as defined) of at least 110% for the year ended February 24, 1995, and
125% thereafter.  The agreements also place limitations on capital
expenditures and investments.

     At February 24, 1995, the Company was not in compliance with certain loan
covenants relating to the Senior Notes and the Industrial Revenue Bonds.  The
Company has received waivers of these violations and the lenders have agreed
to amend certain of the covenants to enable compliance for fiscal 1995 and to
facilitate compliance in fiscal 1996.

     Long-term debt maturities, including capital leases (note 10), for the
five years subsequent to February 24, 1995 are as follows:

                     Fiscal Year

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES:

     As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS 109 as of February 27,
1993.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 on the Company's financial
statements was to decrease net earnings by $245,000 for the fiscal year ended
February 25, 1994.  Prior years' financial statements have not been restated
to apply the provisions of SFAS 109.

     As of February 24, 1995, operating loss carryovers of approximately
$7,800,000 are available to offset future taxable income in various states.
The carryover periods range from five to fifteen years which will result in
expirations of varying amounts beginning in fiscal 1996 and continuing through
fiscal 2010.

     Various credits and loss carryforwards also exist to offset future
federal income taxes.  As of February 24, 1995, alternative minimum tax credit
carryovers are approximately $206,421 and general business credit
carryforwards are approximately $212,054.  The general business credits will
expire in varying amounts beginning in fiscal 2008.  In addition, pre-
acquisition (SRLY) loss carryforwards of approximately $245,000 are available
to offset future taxable income of certain consolidated subsidiaries and
expire in varying amounts beginning in fiscal 2002.


NOTE 10 - LEASED PROPERTIES:

     Nine of the Company's restaurant locations are operated in leased
premises. The related leases are classified as operating leases and their
terms are effective for varying periods until 2007, except for one lease for
land which expires in 2022.  Most contain terms that provide for a modest
increase in rental payments at specified intervals within the lease term.
     As of February 24, 1995, future minimum rental payments required under
these leases and under capital leases, which are for machinery and equipment,
are summarized as follows:

NOTE 11 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:

     On March 1, 1994, the Company established an employee stock purchase plan
through which employees, after meeting minimum eligibility requirements, may
contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the purchase of the
Company's common stock.  The plan provides that the Company will make matching
contributions of 25% of the employee's contribution.  Participation in the
plan is voluntary and all contributions of the Company are funded monthly and
vest immediately.  The Company's contributions to the plan totaled $10,091 in
1995.  The Company also maintains a 401-k Retirement Plan for its employees.
The Plan provides that the Company will make a matching contribution of up to
25% of an employee's voluntary contribution, limited to the lesser of 8% of
that employee's annual compensation or $9,240 for fiscal 1995.  The Company's
contributions to this Plan were $67,869, $52,042 and $47,112 in fiscal 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company also provides employee health
insurance benefits under a 501-c(9) trust arrangement.  These benefits are
partially self-funded by the Company.  The Company has $45,000 per claim and
$1,000,000 annual aggregate stop loss coverage on group medical claims with an
insurance carrier.  A third-party administrator handles all claims.  Company
contributions to this plan were $388,488, $504,500 and $536,827 in fiscal
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Certain officers of the Company are
trustees of the stock purchase plan, the retirement plan and the employee
health plan.

     The Company also has two Employee Stock Option Plans as described in Note
12.


NOTE 12 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS:

     The Company's 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance
of up to 625,000 shares of common stock to key employees, including officers,
of the Company.  The Company may grant Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs") or
nonqualified stock options to eligible employees.

     The Company's 1987 Special Stock Option Plan, as amended, provides for
the issuance of up to 625,000 shares of common stock to key management
employees, including officers of the Company.  All options granted under this
Plan are nonqualified stock options.  During fiscal 1994, options for 100,000
shares were repriced from $9.50 to the fair market value at the date of
repricing.

     All options must be granted at not less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the date of the grant and must be exercised no
later than ten years from the date of grant.

     A summary of the changes in shares under option for both Plans follows:

<FN>

   (1) Intersegment sales are recorded based on prevailing prices and relate
          solely to the food processing segment.
</TABLE>


     In December 1993, the Company entered into a new agreement with its
largest customer of bakery products whereby the Company would purchase the
meat components and the customer's brand name packaging material from the
customer, produce and pack the final meat-filled bakery product and sell the
finished product to the customer.  Prior to this agreement, sales to this
customer consisted only of the bakery component and cost of production and
packing.  The meat component and packaging were supplied and owned by the
customer throughout the process.  Purchases by the Company of the meat
component and packaging totaled $23,441,000 in fiscal 1995 and $4,764,000 in
fiscal 1994.  These amounts are reported as both sales and cost of goods sold,
thus approximately $18,677,000 of the fiscal 1995 increase in food sales is
attributable to this agreement.

     During fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, a single customer of the Company's
bakery products accounted for 63%, 47% and 40%, respectively, of the food
processing segment sales and 42%, 25% and 20%, respectively, of the Company's
total operating revenues.

NOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

     On May 3, 1994, the Company guaranteed a loan obligation of one of its

certain restaurant equipment purchased by the franchisee.

     During fiscal 1995, the Company entered into two 50% joint ventures
involving the construction and operation of two restaurant units.  Remaining
capital investments required under these two agreements totaled $311,000 at

     During fiscal 1995, the Company was required to provide a secured letter
of credit in the amount of $500,000 to its insurance carrier for outstanding
worker's compensation and general liability claims.  This letter of credit is
being secured by $500,000 on deposit with the issuing financial institution.
Since this deposit is restricted and will not be available for current
operations in fiscal 1996, the amount has been reclassified from current
assets, and is presented in other non-current assets at February 24, 1995.


     Effective December 1, 1993, the Company entered into a three year
endorsement agreement with Richard Childress Racing Enterprises, Inc. and Dale
Earnhardt, Inc.  The agreement calls for total payments of $1,200,000 over the

     Litigation involving an unrelated party holding a security interest in
the trade receivables of a bankrupt company, which was one of the Company's
significant customers and vendors, was settled in May 1993.  Under the terms
of this settlement the Company agreed to pay $1,200,000, comprised of an
initial payment of $230,000 in 1993, four annual payments of $180,000 each on
April 1 beginning in 1994 and a final payment of $250,000 on April 1, 1998.
Interest on the unpaid principal balance is payable quarterly at 4.5%.  Under
the terms of a guaranty and hold harmless agreement with the Company's
president, who was a former principal of the bankrupt company, the Company
obtained unsecured promissory notes from the president in amounts sufficient
to reimburse the Company for all payments of principal and interest required
by the Settlement Agreement and to liquidate the net receivable and accrued
interest thereon arising from the initial set-off discussed above.  The terms
of the promissory notes correspond to the payment terms stipulated by the
Settlement Agreement.  The Company's financial statements as of February 24,
1995 reflect both the remaining settlement liability of $790,000 and the

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Shareholders and Board of Directors
WSMP, Inc.
Claremont, North Carolina

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WSMP,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 24, 1995 and February 25, 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 24,
1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of WSMP, Inc. and subsidiaries
at February 24, 1995 and February 25, 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended February 24, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in
fiscal 1994 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes
effective February 27, 1993 to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109.

    Company repurchased 10,000 common shares for $50,004, issued 47,395 common
    shares for $319,916 pursuant to a shareholder rights offering, and 100,000
    stock option shares were exercised by a former officer at a gross price of

    9,062 common shares for $71,680 and issued 62,251 common shares for $420,194

    shares for $343,350. In addition, 622,762 treasury shares were retired.

(3) Earnings (loss) per share are based on the weighted average number of
    common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each
    fiscal year.  The weighted average number of shares used in the calculations
    are 2,879,021 in 1995; 2,624,015 in 1994; 2,875,100 in 1993; 2,649,336 in
    1992; and 2,570,618 in 1991.

(4) Due to limitations imposed by debt covenants, the Company suspended the
    payments of its regular 4 cents per share quarterly dividend beginning with
    the third quarter of fiscal 1990.


(5) The net loss for February 25, 1994 includes a charge against earnings
    reflecting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes
    in the amount of $245,000 related to the adoption of SFAS 109 "Accounting for
    Income Taxes."

(6) Per share amounts have been restated to reflect the five-for-four stock
    split, effected in the form of a stock dividend declared in 1995.

(7) In December 1993, the Company entered into a new agreement with its largest
    customer of bakery products whereby the Company would purchase the meat
    components and the customer's brand name packaging from the customer, produce
    and package the final meat-filled bakery product and sell the finished
    product to the customer.  Prior to this agreement, sales to this customer
    consisted only of the bakery component and cost of production and packaging.
    The meat component and packaging were supplied and owned by the customer
    throughout the process.  Purchases by the Company of the meat component and
    packaging during fiscal 1995 and 1994 totaled $23,441,000 and $4,764,000,
    respectively.  These amounts are reported as both sales and cost of goods
    sold during 1995 and 1994, and affect the comparability of food sales for the
    five years presented.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


WSMP, Inc. 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Claremont, North Carolina

   We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition of WSMP,
Inc. 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of February 24, 1995, and the related
statement of income and changes in plan equity for the fiscal year then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

   We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Plan at February 24, 1995, and the
results of its operations for the fiscal year then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

WSMP, INC. 1994 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Notes to Financial Statements
For the Fiscal Year Ended February 24, 1995


NOTE 1  GENERAL INFORMATION:

   WSMP, Inc. (''the Company'') established WSMP, Inc. 1994 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the ''Plan'') on March 1, 1994.  The Plan is not a ''qualified''
plan as such is defined pursuant to section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code,
nor is the Plan subject to compliance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  The plan is administered by the Plan's trustee which is
an independent third-party bank.  The Plan trust is not subject to federal
income tax since all tax burden is borne by the participants (See note 5).

   Employees, officers, and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
eligible to participate in the Plan subject to certain minimal requirements.
All participants must be at least 21 years of age and must have been employed by
the Company (or have been an officer or director) for at least 90 days.
Eligible individuals who wish to enroll in the Plan may do so January 1 or July
1 of each year.  Participants contribute amounts of not less than $10.00 per
week and not more than 10% of weekly salary, wages and bonuses through biweekly
after-tax payroll deductions.  Participants may elect to change the rate of
contribution as of January 1 and July 1 of each year.  The Company is required
to contribute monthly to the Plan an amount equal to 25% of the participants'
contributions.  Participants are immediately vested in their after-tax
contribution as well as the amount matched by the Company.

   Contributions are submitted to the trustee of the Plan who purchases common
stock of the Company at the prevailing market price.  The trustee delivers the
stock to the participant subsequent to voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from
the Plan along with cash for any fractional shares.  Participants may
voluntarily elect to withdraw from the Plan as of January 1 or July 1 each year
and then or at any time thereafter, request the distribution of their account.
Death or termination of a participant results in an involuntary withdrawal and
an immediate distribution of the participant's account.

   The plan is responsible for all administrative costs.  However, the Company
may elect to pay these expenses on behalf of the plan.  For the fiscal year
ended February 24, 1995, all costs of administrating the plan were borne by the
Company.

   At February 24, 1995, there were 204 active participants in the Plan.


NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES:

   VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS - Investments in securities are valued at current
market value (closing bid quotation).

   STOCK DIVIDEND - On February 22, 1995, WSMP, Inc. declared a five-for-four
stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend which was distributed on
April 11, 1995 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 1995.  Since the ex-
dividend date for this stock dividend was subsequent to the Plan's fiscal year
end, the number of share of WSMP, Inc. common stock held by the Plan at February
24, 1995 has not been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

   PAYMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS - Distributions are recorded when paid.  At February
24, 1995, distributions payable to participants who had withdrawn from the Plan
totaled $3,088.


NOTE 3  INVESTMENTS:

   All of the Plan's investments are in common stock of WSMP, Inc.  At February
24, 1995, the Plan held 5,717 shares with a market value of $37,161.  The cost
of these shares totaled $40,779, resulting in the recognition of unrealized
depreciation in the amount of $3,618.  There were no sales or disbursements of
WSMP, Inc., common stock during the fiscal year ended February 24, 1995.

NOTE 4  CONTRIBUTIONS:

   Contributions by WSMP, Inc. and subsidiary companies and employees for the
period ended February 24, 1995 are as follows:

NOTE 5  INCOME TAX STATUS OF PARTICIPANTS:

  Employee contributions to the Plan are made from after-tax payroll earnings.
In addition, the Participants are taxed currently on investment earnings of the
Plan.  The Participant's tax basis in any Company stock received in a
distribution is equal to the value of the stock at the time at which it was
purchased and credited to his account by the trustee.  Upon subsequent sale of
the stock, the participant will recognize income in the amount of the difference
in the selling price and the tax basis.

  The foregoing is only a brief description of the federal income tax
consequences of participation in the Plan.  For a complete understanding of the
tax consequences, a participant should consult their own tax advisor.
