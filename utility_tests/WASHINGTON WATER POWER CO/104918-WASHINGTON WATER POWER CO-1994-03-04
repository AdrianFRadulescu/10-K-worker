UTILITY OVERVIEW

The Company owns and operates nine hydroelectric projects, a wood-waste fueled
generating station and a natural gas combustion turbine.  The Company also
retains a 15% ownership in two coal-fired generating facilities, one in
southwestern Washington and one in southeastern Montana.  In addition the
Company is in the process of constructing a natural gas combustion turbine
peaking unit in northern Idaho.  Four natural gas pipelines provide the Company
access to both domestic and Canadian natural gas supplies.  With this diverse
resource portfolio, the Company remains one of the nation's lowest-cost
producers and sellers of energy services.

At December 31, 1993, electric service was supplied to approximately 267,000
customers in eastern Washington and northern Idaho.  The Company's average
hourly load for 1993 was 900 aMW.  The Company's annual peak load, including
firm contractual obligations, was 2,126 MW.  This peak occurred on January 13,
1993, at which time the maximum capacity available from the Company's
generating facilities, contracts and non-firm purchases was 2,335 MW.

At December 31, 1993, the Company's natural gas operations served approximately
196,000 customers in four states.  The Company's natural gas business has more
than doubled since 1990 due primarily to the acquisition of the natural gas
distribution properties of CP National in Oregon and South Lake Tahoe,
California in September, 1991.  The peak load in 1993 occurred on February 16,
1993 when 2.7 million therms were required.  During that peak 3.5 million
therms were available under firm transportation and storage contracts.

NON-UTILITY OVERVIEW

The Company's principal subsidiary, Pentzer, is the parent company of all the
Company's non-utility subsidiaries except for three non-operating subsidiaries.
Wholly-owned Pentzer is a company with approximately $130 million in total
assets and about $86 million in shareholder equity.  Pentzer's business
strategy is to acquire controlling interests in a broad range of middle market
companies, to help these companies grow through internal development and
strategic acquisitions, and to sell the portfolio investments either to the
public or to strategic buyers when it becomes most advantageous in meeting
Pentzer's return on invested capital objectives.

ELECTRIC SERVICE

ELECTRIC COMPETITION AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The electric utility business is undergoing numerous changes and is becoming
increasingly competitive as a result of economic, regulatory, and technological
changes.  The Company believes that it is well positioned to meet the
challenges described below due to its low production costs, close proximity to
major transmission lines, experience in the wholesale market and its commitment
to high levels of customer satisfaction, cost reduction and continuous
improvement of work processes.

The Company currently competes for new retail electric customers with various
rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts.  Challenges facing
the electric retail business include changing technologies which reduce energy
consumption, self- generation and fuel switching by industrial and other large
retail customers, the potential for retail wheeling (described below) and the
costs of increasingly stringent environmental laws.  Cogeneration has had only
a minor impact on the Company to date.  See "Purchases, Exchanges and Sales"
for additional detail on cogeneration purchases and sales.  In addition, if
electric utility companies are eventually required to provide retail wheeling
service, which is the transmission by an electric utility of electric power
from another supplier to a customer located within such utility's service area,
the Company believes it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed
to remaining one of the country's lowest-cost providers of electric energy.

The Company also competes in the wholesale electric market with other western
utilities, including the BPA.  Challenges facing the electric wholesale
business include new entrants in the wholesale market and competition from
lower cost generation being developed by independent power producers.

The National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) enacted in 1992 addresses a wide range of
issues affecting the wholesale electric business.  NEPA gives the FERC expanded
authority to order electric utilities (a) to transmit electric power to or for
wholesale purchasers and sellers if the result would not unreasonably impair
the continuing reliability of the affected electric systems and (b) to increase
transmission capacity to provide access for wholesale purchasers and sellers of
electric power at prices that permit the recovery by the utility of all costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services.  NEPA also created
Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWG's), a new class of independent power plant
owners who are able to sell generation only at the wholesale level.  The
Company believes NEPA provides future transmission, energy production and sales
opportunities to the Company and complements the Company's commitment to the
wholesale electric business.

The Company's wholesale electric business remains an important part of the
Company's overall business.  Since 1987 the Company has entered into a number
of long-term firm power sales contracts that have increased its wholesale
electric business and the Company intends to continue active pursuit of
wholesale business opportunities.  In 1993, 31% of total KWH sales were to
wholesale customers with 55% of these sales under firm contracts.

ELECTRIC SYSTEM

The Company owns and operates nine hydroelectric projects, a wood-waste fueled
generating station and a natural gas combustion turbine in addition to
retaining a 15% ownership in two coal-fired generating facilities.

Hydroelectric Resources  Hydroelectric generation is the Company's lowest cost
source of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a
significant effect on the Company's total power costs.  The Company expects to
meet about 49% of its total system requirements with its own hydroelectric
generation and long-term hydro contracts in normal water years.  The
streamflows in the Company's drainage systems were 86%, 64% and 116% of normal
in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  For the years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, the Company's own hydroelectric generation facilities provided
33%, 28% and 38%, while long-term hydro contracts provided approximately 10%,
12% and 14% of the Company's total system requirements.

Thermal Resources  The Company has a 15% interest in two coal-fired facilities
- - the Centralia Power Plant (Centralia) in southwestern Washington and Units 3
and 4 of the Colstrip Generating Project (Colstrip) in southeastern Montana.
In addition, the Company owns a woodwaste-fired facility known as the Kettle
Falls Generating Station (Kettle Falls) in northeastern Washington and a
natural gas-fired combustion turbine (CT) in Spokane.  The CT is primarily used
for peaking needs.  In a normal water year about 32% of the Company's total
system requirements are met by thermal sources.  Company-owned thermal
facilities provided 25%, 31% and 26% of the Company's total electricity
requirements for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Centralia, which is operated by PacifiCorp, is supplied with coal under a fuel
supply agreement in effect through December 31, 2020.  In 1993, 1992 and 1991
Centralia provided approximately 46%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of the
Company's thermal generation.

Colstrip is supplied with fuel under coal supply and transportation agreements
in effect through December 2019, from adjacent coal reserves owned and
controlled by Entech, Inc. (Entech).  Entech is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Montana Power Company, which is also the operator of Colstrip.  In 1993,
1992 and 1991 Colstrip provided approximately 43%, 51%, and 51% of the
Company's thermal generation, respectively.

Kettle Falls' primary fuel is waste wood generated as a by-product of forest
product processing facilities such as sawmills within an approximate one
hundred mile radius of the plant.  Natural gas may be used as an alternate
fuel.  The cost of waste wood fuel is heavily influenced by operations of the
forest products industry as well as transportation costs and, therefore, is
subject to significant price variations.  Current fuel supplies are adequate
through the remainder of 1994.  A combination of long term contracts already in
place plus spot purchases allow the Company the flexibility to meet all
expected future fuel requirements for the plant.  In 1993, 1992 and 1991 Kettle
Falls provided approximately 11%, 9% and 9% of the Company's thermal
generation, respectively.

Purchases, Exchanges and Sales  In addition to the Company-owned hydro,
long-term hydro contracts and thermal generating resources discussed above,
total system requirements are met with other long-term purchases and exchanges
of power.  Other power purchases and exchanges for the years 1993, 1992 and
1991 provided approximately 32%, 29% and 22%, respectively, of the Company's
total system requirements.

The following table summarizes the Company's major long-term wholesale power
agreements as of December 31, 1993 (1):

        additional information

Under PURPA, the Company is required to purchase generation from qualifying
facilities, including small hydro and cogeneration projects, at avoided cost
rates adopted by the WUTC and IPUC.  The Company purchased approximately 623
million KWH, or about 6% of the Company's total energy requirements, from these
sources at a cost of approximately $26 million in 1993.  The largest such
contract is a ten-year power purchase contract between the Company and
Potlatch, one of the Company's major industrial customers, which became
effective on January 1, 1992.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
purchases 50-55 aMW of Potlatch's electric generation and makes available
approximately 95 aMW of firm energy for sale.  In addition, the Company makes
available 25 aMW of interruptible energy and Potlatch must provide an
equivalent amount of reserve generation capacity in case of interruption.

ELECTRIC REGULATORY ISSUES

The Company, as a public utility, is currently subject to regulation by state
utility commissions with respect to rates, accounting, the issuance of
securities and other matters.  The electric retail operations are subject to
the jurisdiction of the WUTC and IPUC.  The Company is also subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC for its accounting procedures and its wholesale
transmission rates.

In each regulatory jurisdiction, the prices the Company may charge for utility
services (other than certain wholesale sales and specially negotiated retail
rates for industrial or large commercial customers) are determined on a "cost
of service" basis and are designed to provide, after recovery of allowable
operating expenses, an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on "rate base"
or assets employed in the business.  "Rate base" is generally determined by
reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation) of utility
plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other
items.  Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in
service and reduced by depreciation and retirements of utility plant from
service.

The Company is a licensee under the Federal Power Act and its licensed projects
are subject to the provisions of Part I of that Act.  See "Properties -
Electric Properties" for additional information.  These provisions include
payment for headwater

benefits, condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation
and take-over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment
of the lesser of "net investment" or "fair value" of the project, in either
case plus severance damages.

General Rate Cases

The Company does not currently plan to file for any general electric rate
increases in 1994.  The following table summarizes information for the
Company's most recent general electric rate cases:

    (1)  Anticipated annual revenue effect.
    (2)  Through June 30, 1994, the IPUC has approved a power cost adjustment
         (PCA) mechanism

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)  IRP is a process required by both the WUTC
and IPUC and represents the Company's responsibility to meet customer demand
for reliable energy services at the lowest total cost to both the Company and
its customers.  The process entails (1) the forecasting of future energy needs,
(2) the assessment of energy supplies, conservation options, customer costs,
and social and environmental impacts and (3) the development of action plans
which support a least cost resource strategy.  The Company's need for future
electric resources to serve retail loads is very minimal.  The electric
integrated resource plan accepted by both the IPUC and the WUTC in 1993 showed
that, through the year 1998, the Company's additional electric load
requirements will be met for the most part by a combination of demand side
management, including conversions to natural gas, and the redevelopment of
existing hydro generating plants.  The cost of these resources is generally
competitive with the costs of resources being developed by independent power
producers.

Demand Side Management (DSM)  Energy efficiency programs, which include
residential space and water heat conversion programs, are material components
of the Company's long-term resource strategy.  In 1992 the Company filed a
request with both the WUTC and IPUC for approval of new electric DSM tariffs
which would provide for the implementation of new and revised energy efficiency
programs including the "Energy Exchanger" program, which offers incentives to
the Company's electric space and/or hot water heating customers to convert to
natural gas.   In conjunction with the request for tariff approval, DSM
accounting treatment was requested which would allow the Company to defer the
costs in new program investments until the next general rate case.  With only
minor modifications, the applications were approved and the effective dates for
implementation were May 1 and July 17, 1992 in Washington and Idaho,
respectively.   Reductions in the DSM incentives were approved by both the IPUC
and WUTC in 1993.  Justification will be required for continuation of the
programs beyond December 31, 1994.  Approximately 18 aMW were saved in 1993
under these programs and over 23 aMW have been saved since the program's
inception.

Power Cost Adjustment (PCA)  The Company's PCA surcharge of $2.3 million in
Idaho expired on November 1, 1993.  The current balance in the account has not
yet triggered either a surcharge or a refund.  In June 1993 the IPUC approved
an extension of the PCA to June 30, 1994.  See Note 1 to Financial Statements
for additional details.

NATURAL GAS SERVICE

NATURAL GAS COMPETITION AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Natural gas is priced competitively compared to other alternative fuel sources
for both residential and commercial customers.  The Company provides programs
that encourage electric customers to convert to natural gas.  Significant
growth has occurred in the Company's natural gas business in recent years due
to these conversions.  The Company also makes sales or provides transportation
service directly to large natural gas customers.

Challenges facing the Company's natural gas business include the potential for
customers to by-pass the Company and securing competitively priced natural gas
supplies for the future.  Since 1988 one of the Company's large industrial
customers has built its own pipeline interconnection.  However, this customer
still purchases some natural gas services from the Company.  The Company prices
its natural gas services, including transportation contracts, competitively and
has varying degrees of flexibility to price its transportation and delivery
rates by means of special contracts to assist in retaining potential by-pass
customers.  The Company has signed long-term transportation contracts with two
of its largest industrial customers which minimizes the chances of these
customers by-passing the Company's system.

Order 636B adopted by FERC in 1992 provides the Company more flexibility in
optimizing its natural gas transportation and supply portfolios.  While rate
design changes have increased the costs of firm transportation to low load
factor pipeline customers such as the Company, flexible receipt and delivery
points and capacity releases allow temporarily under-utilized transportation to
be released to others when not needed to serve the Company's customers.

NATURAL GAS SYSTEM

The Company's natural gas operations are operated as separate divisions, with
the WWP service territory including the Washington and Idaho properties and the
WPNG service territory including Oregon and California properties.

Natural Gas Supply  The Company has access to four natural gas pipelines,
Northwest Pipeline Company (NWP), Pacific Gas Transmission (PGT), Paiute
Pipeline (Paiute) and Alberta Natural Gas Co. Ltd. (ANG), which provide the
Company access to both domestic and Canadian natural gas supplies.  Due to this
resource portfolio, the Company remains one of the nation's lowest-cost local
distribution companies.  Both WWP and WPNG contract with (1) NWP for three
types of firm service:  transportation, liquefied natural gas storage and
underground storage and (2) PGT and ANG for firm transportation.  WPNG also
contracts with Paiute for firm transportation and liquefied natural gas storage
to deliver natural gas to its California customers.

Firm winter natural gas supplies are purchased by the Company through
negotiated agreements having terms ranging between one month and eleven years
with a variety of natural gas suppliers.  As a result of FERC Order 636B, WWP
has completed the process of converting its NWP natural gas sales to firm
transportation and assuming its share of NWP's natural gas supply contracts.

In January 1993, the Company contracted with ANG, PGT, NWP and Paiute for
additional transportation capacity to be available by November 1995 for service
in the Oregon and California service territory of WPNG.  The Company has also
contracted with PGT and ANG for additional capacity for service beginning in
1995 for its Washington and Idaho properties.

Jackson Prairie Natural Gas Storage Project (Storage Project)  The Company
retains a one-third ownership interest in the Storage Project, which is an
underground natural gas storage field located near Chehalis, Washington.  Under
FERC's open access policy the role of the Storage Project in providing flexible
natural gas supplies is increasingly important to the Company's natural gas
operations.  The Storage Project enables the Company to place natural gas into
storage when prices are low or to meet minimum natural gas purchasing
requirements, as well as to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices
are high or as needed to meet high demand periods.  The Company has released
some of its Storage Project capacity to two other utilities until 1995 and 1996
with a provision under one of the releases to partially recall the released
capacity if the Company determines additional natural gas is required for its
own system supply.

Natural Gas Transportation Services  The Company provides transportation
service to customers who obtain their own natural gas supplies.  Transportation
service continued to be a significant component of the Company's total system
deliveries in 1993.  The competitive nature of the spot natural gas market
results in savings in the cost of purchased natural gas, which encourages large
customers with fuel-switching capabilities to continue to utilize natural gas
for their energy needs.  The total volume transported on behalf of
transportation customers was approximately 197.5 million therms in 1993.  This
total volume represented approximately 40% of the Company's total system
deliveries in 1993.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

NATURAL GAS REGULATORY ISSUES

The Company, as a public utility, is currently subject to regulation by several
state utility commissions with respect to rates, accounting, the issuance of
securities and other matters.  The natural gas operations are subject to the
jurisdiction of the WUTC, IPUC, OPUC and CPUC in addition to the FERC with
respect to natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity from the
Storage Project.  Refer to Electric Regulatory Issues for additional details
regarding the rate setting process.

General Rate Cases

The Company has no current plans to file for any natural gas general rate cases
in 1994.  The following table summarizes information for the Company's most
recent general natural gas rate cases (1):

</TABLE>                                                                       

    (1) In addition, the Company from time to time, upon request, receives
        regulatory approval from the WUTC, the IPUC, the OPUC and the CPUC to 
        adjust rates to reflect changes in the cost of purchased natural gas 
        between general rate cases.
    (2) Anticipated annual revenue effect.

In September 1991, the Company commenced operations in both California and
Oregon upon the acquisition of the natural gas properties of CP National.  The
conditions of the CPUC order approving the acquisition included an exemption
from filing a general rate case until January 1, 1994 and a rate "freeze" until
January 1, 1995.  On October 20, 1993, the CPUC granted a one year extension to
January 1, 1995 before the Company is required to file a general rate case.  As
a result, the existing rate "freeze" will continue until at least January 1,
1996.  The OPUC also authorized a general rate "freeze" which extends to
December 31, 1995.  Purchased natural gas costs will continue to be tracked
through to customers in both jurisdictions during the rate "freeze" period.

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)  In 1993 biannual natural gas IRP reports
were accepted by both the WUTC and OPUC.  Refer to Electric Regulatory Issues
for a description of the IRP process.

Demand Side Management (DSM)  Included with the WUTC and IPUC electric DSM
applications discussed above under Electric Regulatory Issues, the Company
requested approval of new natural gas tariffs which would provide for the
implementation of new and revised energy efficiency programs for the Company's
residential, commercial and industrial natural gas customers.  In conjunction
with the request for tariff approval, the Company requested approval of
associated natural gas DSM accounting treatment.  With only minor
modifications, the applications were approved.  The effective dates for
implementation were May 1 and July 17, 1992 in Washington and Idaho,
respectively, with revisions made in July 1993 and future justification
required for continuance of programs beyond December 31, 1994.

On December 21, 1993, the OPUC authorized the Company to defer revenue
requirement amounts associated with its WPNG DSM investments, and established
an annual rate adjustment mechanism to reflect the deferred costs on a timely
basis.  Under this authorization, each December 1 the Company will file a rate
adjustment to recover DSM program costs and margin losses.  This filing will be
concurrent with the Company's annual natural gas tracker filing.  The effective
date for both the deferrals and the rate adjustment mechanism was January 1,
1994.

Natural Gas Trackers  In the second quarter of 1993, the Company filed special
natural gas trackers with the WUTC, IPUC, OPUC and CPUC due primarily to the
increased costs from the pipelines related to the implementation of FERC Order
636B.  The increases range from 3% to 25% but will result in no additional net
income to the Company.  The trackers were approved by all four state
commissions.

In a separate proceeding, the annual Oregon natural gas tracker became
effective on December 1, 1993.  The tracker will increase overall revenue by
about $3.1 million or 8.74% in Oregon but will result in no additional net
income to the Company as it is only a passthrough of changes in the cost of
purchased natural gas and amortization rates pursuant to the Company's natural
gas tracker.  The filing also included the acquisition of additional capacity
over the PGT system.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company is subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local
authorities.  The generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage
facilities in which the Company has an ownership interest have been designed to
comply with all environmental laws presently applicable.

The Company was named a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund") at the Coal Creek site in Chehalis, Washington.  The estimated
cost of clean-up is $12,000,000, which is being shared by over 90 utilities.
The Company is responsible for approximately $800,000 of this cost, the
majority of which was spent in 1993.

In 1993 the EPA referred a matter to the U.S. Justice Department requesting the
Company and other potentially responsible parties to enter into negotiations
for the recovery of costs incurred by EPA and for initiation of action in
connection with the clean-up at the Spokane Junk Yard Site located in Spokane,
Washington.  If an action is commenced, the claim is expected to be for $2.4
million in site stabilization costs plus additional costs including attorneys'
fees and site rehabilitation costs.  The Company has no records showing that
any Company equipment was ever deposited at the Spokane Junk Yard Site or that
PCB contaminated equipment was delivered to any company which disposed of
materials at the site.  Therefore, the Company has disclaimed any liability
with respect to the Spokane Junk Yard Site.  If an action is commenced, the
Company will vigorously defend against such claim.

Refer to both Note 11 to Financial Statements:  Commitments and Contingencies
and Significant Trends in Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.

NON-UTILITY BUSINESS

As of December 31, 1993, the Company had an investment of approximately $93
million in non-utility operations, of which about $86 million was invested in
Pentzer.  The remainder was invested in three non-operating subsidiaries, the
largest of which is WIDCo, which maintains a small investment portfolio.
Substantially all of the non-utility operations are controlled by Pentzer, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

As of December 31, 1993, Pentzer had approximately $130 million in total
assets, or about 7% of the Company's consolidated assets.  Pentzer's portfolio
of investments includes companies involved in advertising display
manufacturing, electronic technology, energy services, financial services, real
estate development and telecommunications.

Pentzer's current investment profile focuses on manufacturers and distributors
of industrial and consumer products as well as service businesses.  The Company
seeks businesses with above average records of earnings growth in industries
that are not cyclical or dependent upon high levels of research and
development.  Emphasis is placed on leading companies with strong market
franchises, dominant or proprietary product lines or other significant
competitive advantages.  Pentzer is particularly interested in companies
serving niche markets.  Total investment in any one company is generally
limited to $15 million, and control of the acquired company's board of
directors is generally required.

Pentzer's business strategy is to acquire controlling interests in a broad
range of middle market companies, to help these companies grow through internal
development and strategic acquisitions, and to sell the portfolio investments
either to the public or to strategic buyers when it becomes most advantageous
in meeting Pentzer's return on invested capital objectives.  Pentzer's goal is
to produce financial returns for the Company's shareholders that, over the long
term, should be higher than that of the utility operations.  From time to time,
a significant portion of Pentzer's earnings contributions may be the result of
transactional gains.  Accordingly, although the income stream is expected to be
positive, it may be uneven from year to year.

Distribution and Transmission Plant

The Company operates approximately 11,250 miles of distribution lines in its
electric system.  The Company's transmission system consists of approximately
550 miles of 230 KV line and 1,500 miles of 115 KV line.  The Company also owns
a 10% interest in 495 miles of a 500 KV line from Colstrip, Montana and a 15%
interest in 3 miles of a 500 KV line from Centralia, Washington to the nearest
BPA interconnections.

The 230 KV lines are used primarily to transmit power from the Company's Noxon
Rapids and Cabinet Gorge hydro generating stations to major load centers in the
Company's service area.  The 230 KV lines also transmit to points of
interconnection with adjoining electric transmission systems for bulk power
transfers.  These lines interconnect with BPA

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY



at five locations and at one location each with PacifiCorp, Montana Power and
Idaho Power Company.  The BPA interconnections serve as points of delivery for
power from the Colstrip and Centralia generating stations as well as for the
interchange of power with the Southwest.  The interconnection with PacifiCorp
is the point of delivery for power purchased by the Company from Mid-Columbia
projects' hydro generating stations.

The 115 KV lines provide for transmission of energy as well as providing for
the integration of the Spokane River hydro and Kettle Falls wood-waste
generating stations with service area load centers.  These lines interconnect
with BPA at nine locations, Grant County PUD at three locations, Seattle City
Light and Tacoma City Light at two locations and one each with Chelan County
PUD, PacifiCorp, and Montana Power.

Electric Projects Under Construction

Rathdrum Combustion Turbine  On October 5, 1993, the IPUC issued an order
approving the combustion turbine project consisting of two 88 MW units.
Construction has begun on the project, which is designed to meet the Company's
peaking needs for both its retail and wholesale obligations.  The air quality
permit that has been issued, which allows for the operation of the project as
scheduled, has been challenged and is currently under administrative review.
Natural gas will be used as both the primary and back-up fuel.  The Company has
obtained separate construction and long-term lease financing for this project.
The project is currently expected to be completed by early 1995 at an expected
cost of $66 million, of which $29 million had been spent as of December 31,
1993.

Company Hydro  The Company continues to study its hydroelectric facilities on
both the Spokane and Clark Fork Rivers to identify additional economic
hydroelectric generating potential.  Turbine efficiency improvements are
underway at the Nine Mile project that would increase generating capacity by 12
MW to a total of 29 MW by mid-1994 at an expected cost of $20 million.  Similar
improvements are underway at the Cabinet Gorge powerhouse that would increase
capacity by approximately 10 MW to a total of 240 MW at an expected cost of $12
million; it is expected back on-line by the end of the first quarter 1994.
Feasibility studies for upgrading the Company's other hydroelectric facilities
are continuing.

Proposed Acquisition

On February 15, 1994, the Company announced it had reached agreement to acquire
the northern Idaho electric properties of Pacific Power and Light Company, an
operating division of PacifiCorp.  The cash purchase price will be $26 million,
subject to closing adjustments, and includes a premium above the book value of
the net assets acquired.  Pacific Power's northern Idaho electric system
currently serves approximately 9,300 residential, commercial and industrial
customers.  The purchase is subject to regulatory approval by the IPUC and the
FERC.  Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the summer of
1994.  See Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional information related
to this acquisition.

NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES

The WWP and WPNG service territories' natural gas properties have natural gas
distribution mains of approximately 2,912 miles and 1,410 miles, respectively.

The Company, NWP and Washington Natural Gas Company each own a one-third
undivided interest in the Storage Project.  The Storage Project has a total
peak day deliverability of 4.6 million therms, with a total working natural gas
inventory of 155.2 million therms.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Outstanding shares of Common Stock are listed on the New York and Pacific Stock
Exchanges.  As of February 25, 1994, there were approximately 36,000 registered
shareholders of the Company's no par value Common Stock.

It is the intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay dividends
quarterly on the Common Stock, but the amount of such dividends is dependent on
future earnings, the financial position of the Company and other factors.

For further information, see Notes 8 and 15 to Financial Statements.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

In 1992, Pentzer's common stock ownership in ITRON was reduced from
approximately 60% to approximately 40% as a result of the issuance of common
stock by ITRON in an acquisition.  Accordingly, beginning in 1992, Pentzer's
share of ITRON's earnings is accounted for by the equity method and is included
in Other Income-Net and its investment in ITRON is reflected on the balance
sheet under Other Property and Investments.  ITRON's initial public offering in
November 1993 and Pentzer's sale of a portion of its ITRON stock resulted in a
reduction in Pentzer's ownership interest in ITRON to approximately 25%.

The Company purchased natural gas distribution properties in Oregon and
California from CP National Corporation on September 30, 1991.  The 1991
financial information reflects three months of operations of these properties.

On July 31, 1990, WIDCo sold its 50% interest in its coal mining properties.
The consolidated financial statements, notes and selected financial data have
been reclassified to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.  The
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations have
been reclassified from those categories and netted into single line items in
the income statements and balance sheets.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY



ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company is primarily engaged as a utility in the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy and the purchase,
transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.  Natural gas operations
are affected to a significant degree by weather conditions and customer growth.
The Company's electric operations are highly dependent upon hydroelectric
generation for its power supply.  As a result, the electric operations of the
Company are significantly affected by weather and streamflow conditions and, to
a lesser degree, by customer growth.  Revenues from the sale of surplus energy
to other utilities and the cost of power purchases vary from year to year
depending on streamflow conditions and the wholesale power market.  The
wholesale power market in the Northwest region is affected by several factors,
including the availability of water for hydroelectric generation, the
availability of base load plants in the region and the demand for power from
the Southwest region.  Usage by retail customers varies from year to year
primarily as a result of weather conditions, the economy in the Company's
service area, customer growth and conservation.

The Company will continue to emphasize the efficient use of energy by its
customers, increase efforts to grow its customer base, especially natural gas,
and continue to manage its operating costs, increase revenues and improve
margins.  The Company will also pursue resource opportunities through demand
side management, system upgrades, purchases and other options that will result
in obtaining electric power and natural gas supplies at the lowest possible
cost.

The Company purchased natural gas distribution properties in Oregon and
California from CP National Corporation on September 30, 1991.  The 1991
financial statements reflect three months of operations of these properties.
See Note 14 to Financial Statements for further information.

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.   All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERALL OPERATIONS

Overall earnings per share for 1993 were $1.44, compared to $1.37 in 1992 and
$1.34 in 1991.  The 1993 results include transactional gains totaling $12.8
million recorded by Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer) as a result of the sale of
several investments in its portfolio and the sale of stock in the initial
public offering by ITRON, Inc. (ITRON) in November 1993.  The 1992 results
include an after-tax gain of $4.4 million, or $0.09 per share, due to the
issuance of common stock by ITRON in an acquisition and a transactional gain of
$1.2 million due to the sale of Pentzer's interest in a company involved in
power plant maintenance.  Discontinued coal mining operations contributed $2.4
million to net income, or $0.05 per share, in 1992 and $1.6 million, or $0.03
per share, in 1991.

Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.44 for 1993, $1.32 for
1992 and $1.31 for 1991.  Utility income available for common stock increased
$4.0 million, or 7.0%, in 1993 after decreasing $2.8 million, or 4.6%, in 1992.
Utility income available for common stock contributed $1.19 to earnings per
share in 1993, compared to $1.15 in 1992 and $1.28 in 1991.  Non-utility income
available for common stock from continuing operations increased $5.0 million in
1993 and $6.9 million in 1992 and contributed $0.25 to earnings per share in
1993, compared to $0.17 in 1992 and $0.03 in 1991.

Slightly colder-than-normal weather during 1993 impacted both electric and
natural gas operations as compared to 1992.  Income from electric operations
decreased $1.8 million in 1993, as compared to 1992, primarily as a result of
increases in purchased power costs due to thermal plant outages, a large sale
of wholesale energy and lower hydroelectric generation due to below normal
streamflows, and increases in other operating and maintenance expenses.  Income
from natural gas operations increased $9.3 million in 1993 over 1992 due
primarily to increased customer usage from the colder weather and customer
growth.  Warmer-than-normal weather throughout most of 1992 significantly
impacted both electric and natural gas operations during the year.  Increased
purchased power and fuel costs, due to low hydroelectric generation and reduced
streamflows, combined with decreased customer usage, were responsible for a
decrease of $10.2 million in 1992 income from electric operations as compared
to 1991.  Income from natural gas operations decreased $2.3 million in 1992, as
compared to 1991, due primarily to reduced revenues as a result of the
warmer-than-normal temperatures.

Electric revenues and expenses were both impacted by a ten-year power purchase
contract, effective January 1992, with Potlatch Corporation (Potlatch), one of
the Company's major industrial customers.  Under terms of the agreement, the
Company purchases 50-55 average MW of Potlatch's electric generation and makes
available up to approximately 95 average MW of firm energy for sale.  In
addition, the Company makes available 25 average MW of interruptible energy and
Potlatch must provide an equivalent amount of reserve generation capacity in
case of interruption.  The increased KWH sales to Potlatch result in increased
industrial revenues to the Company, while the purchase of Potlatch's generating
output increases purchased power expense.

Non-recurring adjustments were made in 1991 to establish reserves for potential
write-offs related to the recovery of costs associated with the Creston
Project, a proposed 2,000 MW coal-fired generating station located near
Creston, Washington, and related transmission.  The reserves were calculated
assuming regulators would allow the Company to recover its investment, but
would not allow the Company to earn a return on the investment during a
recovery period.  Through December 31, 1993, the Company had invested $11.0
million in the Creston Project.  These adjustments decreased Other Income net
of taxes in 1991 by $3.2 million.  A non-recurring adjustment was also made
during 1991 to adjust previous accruals of deferred federal income tax related
to electric operations.  This adjustment decreased income taxes by $4.0 million
in 1991.

Interest expense decreased $3.4 million in 1993 and $1.0 million in 1992.  From
1991 through 1993, $69 million of long-term debt matured and $344 million of
higher-cost debt was redeemed and refinanced at lower interest rates.

Preferred stock dividend requirements increased $1.5 million, or 22.3%, in 1993
due to the issuance of preferred stock in late 1992.  Preferred stock dividend
requirements decreased $2.5 million, or 26.6%, in 1992.  The redemption of
preferred stock in early 1992, combined with an issuance later in the year at a
lower dividend rate and lower rates on variable rate preferred stock were the
primary reasons for the 1992 decrease.

Electric revenues increased in all classes for 1993, as compared to 1992, as a
result of customer growth, increased wholesale sales and a slight increase in
customer usage due to colder than normal weather.  As the Company's Demand Side
Management programs grow, the electric load is becoming less weather-sensitive
as a result of the shifting of a greater portion of the heat load to natural
gas.  Residential and commercial revenues increased by $12.8 million, primarily
as a result of a 3% growth in customers in 1993.  Industrial sales during 1993
increased by $6.2 million, or 12%, primarily due to increased KWH sales under
the Potlatch agreement discussed earlier.  Wholesale revenues increased by
$16.8 million, or 18%, due primarily to a large sale of wholesale energy over a
six-week period in the first quarter of 1993.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY



Electric revenues increased by 3% in 1992, compared to 1991, due to a
combination of increased industrial sales and customer growth, which offset the
decrease in residential usage due to warm weather.  The Company's electric
customer base grew by 2% in 1992, in both the residential and commercial
sectors, which helped to reduce the weather-related impact on revenues.
Industrial sales increased by $11.5 million, or 29%, primarily due to increased
KWH sales under the Potlatch agreement discussed earlier.  Commercial sales
increased $4.7 million, or 4%, in 1992, as compared to 1991, due to customer
growth.  Residential revenues decreased by $3.1 million, despite a 2% increase
in customers, due to warm weather throughout most of 1992.  Wholesale KWH sales
were down 23% in 1992, reflecting low streamflow conditions during the year.
However, increased prices in the secondary market resulted in decreased
wholesale revenues of only $0.6 million, or 1%, in 1992 from 1991.

Below-normal streamflow conditions and thermal plant outages significantly
affected 1993 electric operating results. Hydroelectric generation was 11%
below normal, caused by streamflows which were 86% of normal.  Purchased power
increased by $27.1 million, or 30%, in 1993 primarily due to reduced
hydroelectric generation early in the year, a large sale of wholesale energy in
the first quarter and to replace lost thermal generation due to plant outages.
In October 1989, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) approved the
Company's filing for a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) designed to allow the
Company to change rates to recover or rebate a portion of the difference
between actual and allowed net power supply costs.  Net PCA adjustments
accounted for $4.6 million of the increase in other operating and maintenance
expenses from 1992.  Higher levels of purchased power resulted in higher
transmission costs which also contributed to the increase in other operating
and maintenance expenses in 1993 over 1992.  Shutdowns at thermal generation
plants and improved streamflows in the latter part of 1993 were the primary
reasons for the $2.9 million decrease in fuel costs, and repairs at the plants
resulted in an increase of nearly $2.0 million in other operating and
maintenance expenses.

Warmer-than-normal weather and below-normal streamflow conditions significantly
affected 1992 electric operating results.  Hydroelectric generation was 22%
below normal, caused by streamflows which were 64% of normal in 1992.  In 1991,
streamflows were 116% of normal.  Fuel costs and purchased power costs in 1992
were a combined $27.6 million, or 27%, over levels incurred during 1991, due to
low hydroelectric generation and the Potlatch agreement previously discussed.
Transmission and distribution costs, which decreased $2.2 million and $1.5
million, respectively, contributed to the $7.9 million, or 12%, decrease in
other operating and maintenance expenses.  Transmission expenses decreased in
1992 over 1991 due to decreased wholesale KWH sales.  Distribution expense was
lower in 1992, compared to 1991, due to mild weather and fewer storm-related
damages.  Net PCA adjustments, resulting from low hydroelectric conditions and
prices of secondary energy, accounted for $3.3 million of the decrease in other
operating and maintenance expenses from 1991.

On September 30, 1991, the Company purchased the Oregon and South Lake Tahoe,
California, natural gas distribution assets of CP National Corporation.  The
Company's natural gas operations are operated as separate divisions, with the
WWP service territory including the Washington and Idaho properties and the WP
Natural Gas (WPNG) service territory including the Oregon and California
properties.  As of December 31, 1993, there were approximately 73,300 WPNG
natural gas customers and 122,500 WWP natural gas customers.

The Company's natural gas business experienced weather-related impacts on
operating results in both 1993 and 1992.  In 1993, weather in the Washington
and Idaho service territory was 5% colder than normal, compared to 11% warmer
than normal in 1992.  The Oregon service territory experienced temperatures
only 8% warmer than normal in 1993, compared to 24% warmer in 1992.
Substantial customer growth of 9% in 1993, along with colder weather,
contributed to increased revenues.   The 7% growth in customers in 1992 helped
offset the impact of the weather.

Total natural gas operating revenues increased $37.0 million, or 37%, in 1993.
WPNG revenues accounted for an increase of $10.1 million, while WWP revenues
increased $26.9 million.  Total therm sales increased by 18% in 1993 due to
customer growth in all service classes except transportation and higher
customer usage due to colder weather in 1993 as compared to 1992.
Approximately 40% of the customer growth in the WWP service area during 1993
was the result of the Company's emphasis on conversion from electric space and
water heating to natural gas through Demand Side Management programs.

Total natural gas revenues increased in all customer classes in 1992 from 1991
due to the WPNG acquisition.  WPNG revenues accounted for an increase of $24.5
million in overall natural gas operating revenues, as compared to 1991.  In
1992, natural gas revenues from WWP residential and commercial customers rose
by $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, due to growth in the number of
customers, as usage per customer decreased as a result of warm temperatures.

Natural gas purchased expense increased $23.7 million, or 49%, in 1993 as
compared to 1992, primarily as a result of an increase in therm sales of 76.3
million, or 18%, across all customer classes due to customer growth and colder
weather.  Taxes other than income and income taxes also increased substantially
in 1993 due to increased revenues and income.

Natural gas purchased expense and other operating and maintenance expenses
increased $17.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in 1992 from 1991.  All
other expenses also increased substantially over 1991, primarily as a result of
the operation of the WPNG properties, combined with the Company's continued
emphasis on conversions from electric energy to natural gas.

Non-utility operations include the results of Pentzer and three non-operating
subsidiary companies.  Pentzer's business strategy is to acquire controlling
interests in a broad range of middle-market companies, to help these companies
grow through internal development and strategic acquisitions, and to sell the
portfolio investments to the public or to strategic buyers when it becomes most
advantageous in meeting Pentzer's return on invested capital objectives.
Pentzer's goal is to produce financial returns for the Company's shareholders
that, over the long term, should be higher than that of the utility operations.
From time to time, a significant portion of Pentzer's earnings contributions
may be the result of transactional gains.  Accordingly, although the income
stream is expected to be positive, it may be uneven from year to year.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, Pentzer had consolidated earnings of
$19.7 million before provision for possible losses.  At the end of the year,
Pentzer established a $7.0 million provision for possible write-off of a
portion of its investment portfolio.  The provision was recorded based on the
determination that future cashflows may be lower than expected, impairing the
value of certain investments.  After deducting this provision, Pentzer reported
consolidated earnings of $12.7 million, which represents a 50% increase over
Pentzer's 1992 earnings of $8.5 million.  Pentzer's return on invested capital
increased from 12% in 1992 to 17% in 1993 due, in part, to transactional gains.

Pentzer earnings for 1993 were significantly impacted by transactional gains of
$7.1 million as a result of the sale of companies involved in
telecommunications, technology and energy and by a transactional gain of $5.7
million resulting from the successful completion by ITRON, a company in which
Pentzer is the largest shareholder, of an initial public offering which also
resulted in the sale of a portion of the ITRON shares owned by Pentzer.  This
transaction reduced Pentzer's investment in ITRON from approximately 40% to
approximately 25%.  Included in other income, total 1993 transactional gains of
$12.8 million compares with transactional gains of $5.6 million in 1992.

In addition to the transactional gains from ITRON in 1993, Pentzer also
recorded a $3.0 million increase in net income as a result of improved earnings
at ITRON.

Pentzer's earnings increase from 1991 to 1992 was primarily attributable to the
1992 transactional gains of $5.6 million relating to ITRON's issuance of common
stock in an acquisition and the sale of Pentzer's interest in a company
involved in power plant maintenance.  This issuance of common stock reduced
Pentzer's ownership from approximately 60% to approximately 40%.  Accordingly,
Pentzer's investment in ITRON after 1991 is accounted for by the equity method.
The 1991 results presented include ITRON on a fully consolidated basis.  The
decrease in revenues and expenses from 1991 to 1992 was primarily due to the
change to the equity method of accounting for ITRON.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

UTILITY

Capital expenditures, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC) and Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (AFUCE, a carrying
charge similar to AFUDC for conservation-related capital expenditures), were
$378 million for the 1991-1993 period.  In addition, $69 million of long-term
debt matured and $344 million of higher-cost debt and preferred stock was
redeemed and refinanced at lower cost during the 1991-1993 period.

Capital expenditures are funded with internally-generated cash and external
financing.  The level of cash generated internally and the amount that is
available for capital expenditures fluctuates from year to year.

During 1993, $274 million of long-term debt, with an average interest rate of
8.67% and 13.6 years remaining to maturity, was redeemed or matured and $250
million of long-term debt was issued at an average interest rate of 6.59% and
with 16.1 years remaining to maturity.  In January 1994, authorization was
received for $250 million of Secured Medium Term Notes, Series B, which brings
the total authorized but unissued Secured Medium Term Notes to $275
million as of February 28, 1994.

Capital expenditures are financed on an interim basis with short-term debt.
The Company has $160 million in committed lines of credit, a portion of which
backs up a $50 million commercial paper facility.  In addition, the Company may
borrow up to $60 million through other borrowing arrangements with banks.  As
of December 31, 1993, $20 million in commercial paper was outstanding, $4
million was outstanding under the committed lines of credit and $44 million was
outstanding under other short-term borrowing arrangements.

The Company's total common equity increased by $47 million to $634 million at
the end of 1993.  The 1993 increase was primarily due to the issuance of
approximately 1,900,000 shares of common stock through the Periodic Offering
Program, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the Investment and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan for proceeds of $36 million.  The utility capital structure at
December 31, 1993, was 49% debt, 10% preferred stock and 41% common equity as
compared to 48% debt, 11% preferred stock and 41% common equity at year-end
1992.

The Company is restricted under various agreements as to the additional
securities it can issue.  Under the most restrictive test of the Company's
Mortgage, an additional $431 million of First Mortgage Bonds could be issued as
of December 31, 1993.  As of December 31, 1993, under its Restated Articles of
Incorporation, approximately $670 million of additional preferred stock could
be issued at an assumed dividend rate of 7.00%.

During the 1994-1996 period, capital expenditures are expected to be $334
million, and $90 million will be required for long-term debt maturities and
preferred stock sinking fund requirements.  During this three-year period, the
Company expects that internally- generated funds will provide approximately 50%
of the funds for its capital expenditures.  External financing will be required
to fund maturing long-term debt, preferred stock sinking fund requirements and
the remaining portion of capital expenditures.

See Notes 4 through 8 to Financial Statements, inclusive, for additional
details related to financing activities.

NON-UTILITY

Capital expenditures for the non-utility operations were $15 million for the
1991-1993 period.  These capital expenditure requirements were financed
primarily with internally-generated funds.  In addition, $2 million of debt
either matured or was redeemed during that same period.  The non-utility
operations have $26 million in borrowing arrangements ($20 million outstanding
as of December 31, 1993) to fund capital expenditures and other corporate
requirements on an interim basis.  At December 31, 1993, the non-utility
operations had $32 million in cash and marketable securities.

The 1994-1996 non-utility capital expenditures are expected to be $8 million,
and $1 million in debt maturities will also occur.  During the next three
years, internally-generated cash and other debt obligations are expected to
provide the majority of the funds for the non-utility capital expenditure
requirements.

SIGNIFICANT TRENDS

Competition

The electric and natural gas utility businesses are undergoing numerous changes
and are becoming increasingly competitive as a result of economic, regulatory
and technological changes.  The Company believes that it is well positioned to
meet future challenges due to its low production costs, close proximity to
major transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, experience in the wholesale
electric market and its commitment to high levels of customer satisfaction,
cost reduction and continuous improvement of work processes.

The Company currently competes for new retail electric customers with various
rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts.  Challenges facing
the electric retail business include changing technologies which reduce energy
consumption, self-generation and fuel switching by industrial and other large
retail customers, the potential for retail wheeling and the costs of
increasingly stringent environmental laws.  In addition, if electric utility
companies are eventually required to provide retail wheeling service, which is
the transmission by an electric utility of electric power from another supplier
to a customer located within such utility's service area, the Company believes
it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed to remaining one of
the country's lowest-cost providers of electric energy.

The Company also competes in the wholesale electric market with other Western
utilities, including the Bonneville Power Administration.  Challenges facing
the electric wholesale business include new entrants in the wholesale market
and competition from lower cost generation being developed by independent power
producers.

The National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) enacted in 1992 addresses a wide range of
issues affecting the wholesale electric business.  The Company believes NEPA
provides future transmission, energy production and sales opportunities to the
Company and complements the Company's commitment to the wholesale electric
business.

Natural gas is priced competitively compared to other alternative fuel sources
for both residential and commercial customers.  Challenges facing the Company's
natural gas business include the potential for customers to by-pass the Company
and securing competitively priced natural gas supplies for the future.  Since
1988 one of the Company's large industrial customers has built its own pipeline
interconnection.  However, this customer still purchases some





                                       21

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY



natural gas services from the Company.  The Company prices its natural gas
services, including transportation contracts, competitively and has varying
degrees of flexibility to price its transportation and delivery rates by means
of special contracts to assist in retaining potential by-pass customers.  The
Company has signed long-term transportation contracts with two of its largest
industrial customers which minimizes the risks of these customers by-passing
the Company's system.

Order 636B adopted by FERC in 1992 provides the Company more flexibility in
optimizing its natural gas transportation and supply portfolios.  While rate
design changes have increased the costs of firm transportation to low load
factor pipeline customers such as the Company, flexible receipt and delivery
points and capacity releases allow temporarily under-utilized transportation to
be released to others when not needed to serve the Company's customers.

Least cost planning for both the electric and natural gas businesses has been
integrated so that the Company's customers are provided the most efficient and
cost-effective products possible for all their energy requirements.  The
Company's need for future electric resources to serve retail loads is very
minimal.  The electric integrated resource plan accepted by both the IPUC and
the Washington Utility and Transportation Commission (WUTC) in 1993 showed
that, through the year 1998, the Company's additional electric load
requirements will be met for the most part by a combination of demand side
management, including conversions to natural gas, and the redevelopment of
existing hydro generating plants.  The cost of these resources is generally
less than costs of resources being developed by independent power producers and
other exempt wholesale generators.  The Company's natural gas integrated
resource plan was accepted by both the WUTC and Public Utility Commission of
Oregon (OPUC) in 1993 and insures adequate supplies of natural gas are
available at the least possible cost.  The switching of electric heating
customers to natural gas requires increased efforts on the Company's part in
negotiating and securing competitively-priced natural gas supplies for the
future.

Economic and Load Growth

The Company expects economic growth to continue in its eastern Washington and
northern Idaho service area, although at a slower pace than seen in the past
couple of years.  The Company, along with others in the service area, continues
its efforts to expand existing businesses and attract new businesses to the
Inland Northwest.  In the past, agriculture, mining and lumber have been the
primary industries.  However, health care, electronic and other manufacturing,
tourism and the service sectors have become increasingly important industries
that operate in the Company's service area.  In addition, the Company also
expects economic growth to continue in its Oregon and California service areas.

The Company anticipates electric retail load growth to average approximately
0.4% annually for the next five years.  Although the number of electric
customers is expected to increase, the average annual usage by residential
customers is expected to continue to decline on a weather-adjusted basis due to
newer technologies, construction and appliance efficiency standards and
continued conversions to natural gas where available.  The Company anticipates
natural gas load growth, including transportation volumes, in its Washington
and Idaho service area to average approximately 2.7% annually for the next five
years.  The Oregon and South Lake Tahoe, California service area is anticipated
to realize 2.6% growth annually during that same period.

Environmental Matters

The Company continues to assess both the potential and actual impact of the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) on its thermal generating plants.  The
Centralia Power Plant (Centralia), which is operated by PacifiCorp, is
classified as a "Phase II" coal-fired plant under the CAAA and as such, will be
required to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by approximately 40% by the
year 2000.  Several methods to meet CAAA compliance by reducing SO2 are being
evaluated and a plan is expected to be completed by early 1995.  The
alternatives most likely to be used in meeting the compliance standards will be
some combination of lower sulfur coal, SO2 reduction through clean coal
technology and SO2 allowances either purchased or pooled, if available, among
the Centralia owners.  The Colstrip Generating Project (Colstrip), which is
also a "Phase II" coal-fired plant operated by Montana Power, is not expected
to be required to implement any additional SO2 mitigation in the foreseeable
future in order to continue operations.  Reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOX)
will be required at both Centralia and Colstrip prior to the year 2000.  The
anticipated costs for NOX compliance will have a minor economic impact on the
Company.

Since December 1991, a number of species of fish, including the Snake River
sockeye salmon and chinook salmon, the Kootenai River white sturgeon and the
bull trout have either been added to the endangered species list under the
Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), listed as "threatened" under the ESA or
been petitioned for listing under the ESA.  Thus far, measures which have been
adopted and implemented to save both the Snake River sockeye and chinook salmon
have not directly impacted generation levels at any of the Company's
hydroelectric dams.  The Company does, however, purchase power from four
projects on the Columbia River that are being directly impacted by this
operation.  The reduction in generation is relatively small resulting in
minimal economic impact on the Company.  Future actions to save the Snake River
salmon, Kootenai River white sturgeon and bull trout could further impact the
Company's hydroelectric resources.  However, it is unknown at this time what
impact, if any, will occur from the processes discussed above on the Company's
operations.

matters.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS
The accounting records of The Washington Water Power Company (Company) utility
operations are maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and adopted by
the appropriate state regulatory commissions.

BASIS OF REPORTING
The accompanying financial statements include the Company's proportionate share
of utility plant and related operations resulting from its interests in jointly
owned plants (See Note 12).

The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and, as such,
include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer), Washington Irrigation
and Development Company (WIDCo), The Limestone Company and WP Finance Company.
All material intercompany transactions that are not allowed recovery under
regulation have been eliminated in the consolidation.  On July 31, 1990, WIDCo
sold its 50% interest in the Centralia coal mining properties for $40.8
million.  As discussed in Note 14, operating results for ITRON are no longer
consolidated and are accounted for on the equity method.

The financial activity of each of the Company's segments is reported in the
"Schedule of Information by Business Segments."  Such information is an
integral part of these financial statements.

UTILITY PLANT
The cost of additions to utility plant, including internally developed
information systems, an allowance for funds used during construction and
replacements of units of property and betterments, is capitalized.  Maintenance
and repairs of property and replacements determined to be less than units of
property are charged to operating expenses.  Costs of depreciable units of
property retired plus costs of removal less salvage are charged to accumulated
depreciation.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
The Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) represents the cost of
both the debt (Interest Capitalized) and equity funds used to finance utility
plant additions during the construction period.  In accordance with the uniform
system of accounts prescribed by regulatory authorities, AFUDC is capitalized
as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited currently as a noncash
item to Other Income and Interest Capitalized (see Other Income below).  The
Company generally is permitted, under established regulatory rate practices, to
recover the capitalized AFUDC and a fair return thereon through its inclusion
in rate base and the provision for depreciation after the related utility plant
has been placed in service.  Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until
the related utility plant is placed in service.

The effective AFUDC rate was 10.67% in 1993, 1992 and 1991.  The Company's
AFUDC rates do not exceed the maximum allowable rates as determined in
accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED TO CONSERVE ENERGY
The Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (AFUCE) rate recovers carrying
costs associated with Demand Side Management (DSM) program expenditures until
such investment is included in rate base.  AFUCE is capitalized as a part of
the cost of the DSM investment and is credited currently as a noncash item to
Other Income and Interest Capitalized.  The AFUCE rate in effect is the last
authorized, or otherwise stipulated, rate of return from the Company's
proceeding for natural gas or electric operations.  The rate for Washington is
adjusted for the tax effect of interest.  Cash inflow related to AFUCE does not
occur until the related DSM investment is placed in service.

DEPRECIATION
For utility operations, depreciation provisions are computed by a method of
depreciation accounting utilizing unit rates for hydroelectric plants and
composite rates for other properties.  Such rates are designed to provide for
retirements of properties at the expiration of their service lives.  The rates
for hydroelectric plants include annuity and interest components, in which the
interest component is 6%.  For utility operations, the ratio of depreciation
provisions to average depreciable property was 2.68% in 1993,  2.37% in 1992
and 2.44% in 1991.

AMORTIZATION
Deferred charges include regulatory assets which are amortized primarily over
periods allowed by regulators.  Also included in Deferred Charges, Other are
debt issuance and redemption costs which are amortized over the terms of the
respective debt issues.

POWER AND NATURAL GAS COST ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS
In 1989, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) approved the Company's
filing for a power cost adjustment mechanism (PCA).  The PCA is designed to
allow the Company to change electric rates to recover or rebate a portion of
the difference between actual and allowed net power supply costs.  In 1993 and
1991, the Company deferred $4.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of net
power supply cost savings, which resulted in like increases in electric
operating expenses.  In 1992, the Company deferred $3.3 million of net power
supply costs, which resulted in like decreases in electric operating expenses.
Rate changes are triggered when the deferred balance reaches $2.2 million.  A
rate increase was implemented in November 1992 to pass through accumulated
costs.  A rate reduction was implemented in May 1991 to pass through
accumulated cost savings.  As of December 31, 1993, $0.6 million of costs not
yet subject to a rate increase had accumulated in the PCA deferral account.
The PCA is currently scheduled to end on June 30, 1994.

Under established regulatory practices, the Company is also allowed to adjust
its natural gas rates from time to time to reflect increases or decreases in
the cost of natural gas purchased.  Differences between actual natural gas
costs and the natural gas costs allowed in rates are deferred and charged or
credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in
rates.

OPERATING REVENUES
The Company accrues estimated unbilled revenues for services provided through
month-end.

INCOME TAXES
Provisions for income taxes are based generally on income and expense as
reported for financial statement purposes adjusted principally for the excess
of tax depreciation over book depreciation.

Beginning with 1981 property additions, deferred income taxes are provided for
the tax effect of Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) depreciation over
straight-line depreciation.  Investment tax credits (ITC) are amortized over
the period established by regulators.

The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax
returns.  Subsidiaries are charged or credited with the tax effects of their
operations on a stand alone basis.  The Company's federal income tax returns
have been examined with all issues resolved, and all payments made, through the
1990 return.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Earnings per common share have been computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period.  On November 9, 1993,
the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on October 25, 1993, shares
of its common stock, without par value, under a two-for-one stock split
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All references to number of
shares and per share information have been adjusted to reflect the common stock
split on a retroactive basis.

CASH
For the purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company
considers all temporary investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

</TABLE>

Non-recurring adjustments were made in 1991 to establish reserves for a
potential write-off related to the recovery of costs associated with the
Creston Project and related transmission.  The reserves were calculated
assuming regulators would not allow the Company to earn a return during a
recovery period.  These adjustments decreased other income by $4.8 million
before income taxes and decreased income net of taxes by $3.2 million.  The
Company's costs of $10,990,000 less a reserve for a potential write-off of
$3,967,000 related to this project as of December 31, 1993, are included in
Other Deferred Charges on the Balance Sheet.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FAS No. 112, entitled "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," was
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in November 1992 and is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.  This Statement
requires the accrual of the expected cost of providing benefits to former or
inactive employees after employment but before retirement.  It has been
determined that the liabilities related to the Company's Long-Term Disability
and Workers' Compensation programs are affected by this Statement.  The Company
does not expect FAS No. 112 to have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2. RETIREMENT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." FAS No. 106
requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit
payments during the years the employee provides services.  The Company
previously expensed the cost of these benefits, which are principally health
care, as claims were incurred.  FAS No. 106 allows recognition of the
unrecognized transition obligation in the year of adoption or the amortization
of such obligation over a period of up to twenty years.  The Company has
elected to amortize this obligation of approximately $39,600,000 over a period
of twenty years.  Income from continuing operations during 1993 was not changed
by the implementation of this Statement.

The Company has received accounting orders from the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission (WUTC) and the IPUC allowing the current deferral of
expense accruals under this Statement as a regulatory asset for future
recovery.  At such time that rate recovery is requested and allowed, cumulative
deferrals will be amortized over the remainder of the twenty-year amortization
period.  The Company expects to be able to recover the amortized amounts.
Therefore, the Company's cash flows are not affected by implementation of this
Statement.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
substantially all of its retired employees.  In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the
Company recognized $1,250,000, $1,290,000 and $1,233,000, respectively, as an
expense for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits.  The
following table sets forth the health care plan's funded status at December 31,
1993.

Net postretirement benefit cost for 1993 consisted of the following components:

<TABLE>
             <S>                                                                <C>
             Service cost -  benefits earned during the period                  $  776,000
             Return on the plan assets (if any)                                        -
             Interest cost on accumulated                                      
                   postretirement benefit obligation                            $2,018,000
             Amortization of transition obligation                              $1,187,000
</TABLE>

The currently assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 12.0% for 1993, decreasing
linearly each successive year until it reaches 6.0% in 1997.  A
one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 1993 and net postretirement health care cost by approximately
$3,079,000.  The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%.

The Company has a pension plan covering substantially all of its regular
full-time employees.  Some of the Company's subsidiaries also participate in
this plan.  Individual benefits under this plan are based upon years of service
and the employee's average compensation as specified in the Plan.  The
Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount equal to the net
periodic pension cost, provided that such contributions are not less than the
minimum amounts required to be funded under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, nor more than the maximum amounts which are currently deductible
for tax purposes.  Pension fund assets are invested primarily in marketable
debt and equity securities.

Net pension credit for 1993, 1992 and 1991 is summarized as follows:

NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1993, which supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 11 previously adopted by the Company.  FAS
No. 109 establishes revised financial accounting and reporting standards for
the effects of income taxes.

As of January 1, 1993, the Company accrued net regulatory assets of
$171,365,000 related to the probable recovery of FAS No. 109 deferred tax
liabilities from customers through future rates.  In the third quarter,  the
balance was adjusted to account for the 35% federal income tax rate, which
brought the accrued net regulatory assets balance to $182,196,000.  As such,
the Company's adoption of FAS No. 109 has no effect on income for 1993.  The
regulatory assets and deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the
estimated remaining life of the associated assets.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) tax credit
carryforwards.  The tax effects of significant items comprising the Company's
net deferred tax liability as of January 1, 1993, restated to reflect the 35%
federal income tax rate, are as follows:

CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION:

Redemption requirements:
        
    $8.625, Series I - On June 15, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, the
    Company must redeem 100,000 shares at $100 per share plus accumulated
    dividends.  The Company may, at its option, redeem up to 100,000 shares in
    addition to the required redemption on any redemption date.  

    $6.95, Series K - On September 15, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the
    Company must redeem 17,500 shares at $100 per share plus accumulated
    dividends through a mandatory sinking fund.  Remaining shares must be
    redeemed on September 15, 2007. The Company has the right to redeem an
    additional 17,500 shares on each September 15 redemption date.

There are $30 million in mandatory redemption requirements during the 1994-1998
period.

In accordance with FAS No. 107 "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments," the fair value of the Company's preferred stock at December 31,
1993 and 1992 is estimated to be $93.8 million, or 110% of the carrying value,
and $89.4 million, or 105% of the carrying value, respectively.  These

methodologies.

NOTE 8. COMMON STOCK

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

In April 1990, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to the
Trustee of the Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Employees of
the Company (Plan) for the benefit of the participants and beneficiaries of the
Plan.  In payment for the shares of Common Stock, the Trustee issued a
promissory note payable to the Company in the amount of $14,125,000.  Dividends
paid on the stock held by the Trustee, plus Company contributions to the Plan,
if any, are used by the Trustee to make interest and principal payments on the
promissory note.  The balance of the promissory note receivable from the
Trustee ($12,755,500 at December 31, 1993) is reflected as a reduction to
common equity.  The shares of Common Stock are allocated to the accounts of
participants in the Plan as the note is repaid.  During 1993, the cost recorded
for the Plan was $2,216,000.  This included the cost for an additional 165,335
shares which were issued for ongoing employee and Company contributions to the
Plan.  Interest on the note payable, cash and stock contributions to the Plan
and dividends on the shares held by the Trustee were $1,238,000, $1,776,000 and
$1,231,000, respectively.

In February 1990, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to
which holders of Common Stock outstanding on March 2, 1990, or issued
thereafter, have been granted one preferred share purchase right ("Right") on
each outstanding share of Common Stock.  Each Right, initially evidenced by and
traded with the shares of Common Stock, entitles the registered holder to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock of the Company,
without par value, at an exercise price of $40, subject to certain adjustments,
regulatory approval and other specified conditions.  The Rights will be
exercisable only if a person or group acquires 10% or more of the Common Stock
or announces a tender offer, the consummation of which would result in the
beneficial ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of the Common Stock.
The Rights may be redeemed, at a redemption price of $0.01 per Right, by the
Board of Directors of the Company at any time until any person or group has
acquired 10% or more of the Common Stock.  The Rights will expire on February
16, 2000.

this program for net proceeds of $18.0 million.  In the second half of 1992,

NOTE 10. DISCONTINUED COAL MINING OPERATIONS

Washington Irrigation & Development Company (WIDCo) owned an undivided one-half
interest in coal mining properties near Centralia, Washington, which it
operated and which supplied coal to the Centralia Steam Electric Generating
Plant owned 15% by the Company.  On July 31, 1990, WIDCo sold its 50% interest
in the Centralia coal mining properties for $40.8 million.  A tax adjustment of
$1.6 million related to the sale was recorded in 1991.  Net income of $2.4
million in 1992 resulted from accounting adjustments and a refund of federal
income taxes for years prior to the sale.  The consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to reflect the continuing operations of the
Company.  The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the discontinued
operations have been reclassified from those categories and netted into single
line items for discontinued operations in the Balance Sheets and Income
Statements.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

SUPPLY SYSTEM PROJECT 3

In 1985, the Company and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) reached a
settlement surrounding litigation related to the suspension of construction of
Washington Public Power Supply System (Supply System) Project 3.  Project 3 is
a partially constructed 1,240 MW nuclear generating plant in which the Company
has a 5% interest.  Under the settlement agreement, the Company receives power
deliveries from BPA from 1987 to 2017 in proportion to the Company's investment
in Project 3.

The settlement with BPA and other parties does not affect the Company's
obligations under the Ownership Agreement among the owners of Project 3.  In
connection with its 1993 rate proceedings, BPA has proposed termination of
Project 1 and 3.  Termination of Project 3 will require proposal of a
termination budget and approval by BPA and the Project 3 Owners under the
Ownership Agreement.  The Company would be reimbursed for the cost of
termination under the settlement with BPA.

The only material claim against the Company arising out of the Company's
involvement in Project 3, which is still pending in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Washington (District Court), is the claim of
Chemical Bank, as bond fund trustee for Supply System Projects 4 and 5, against
all owners of Projects 1, 2 and 3 for unjust enrichment in the allocation of
certain costs of common services and facilities among the Supply System's five
nuclear projects.  Projects 4 and 5 were being constructed adjacent to Projects
1 and 3, respectively, under a plan to share certain costs.  Chemical Bank is
seeking a reallocation of $495 million in costs (plus interest since
commencement of construction in 1976) originally allocated to Projects 4 and 5.

On October 7, 1992, the District Court issued an order ruling in favor of the
defendants, including the Company, that the "proportional" allocation
methodology actually employed by the Supply System was permitted by the
Projects 4 and 5 bond resolution.  This ruling does not resolve all cost
reallocation claims pending in the District Court, including whether the Supply
System correctly followed its methodology.  Chemical Bank has indicated its
intent to assert claims for cost reallocations based upon other theories which
have not been litigated.  The case is now in the discovery phase on those
claims, as settlement talks were not successful.

The Company cannot predict whether Chemical Bank will ultimately be successful
in its claim for reallocation of any of the costs of Supply System projects,
nor can the Company predict any amounts which might be reallocated to Project 3
or to the Company due to its 5% ownership interest therein.  The Company also
has claims pending against the Supply System and Chemical Bank with respect to
a subordinated loan made by the Company to Projects 4 and 5 in 1981, in the
amount of approximately $11 million including interest.  The District Court has
deferred ruling on the Company's motion to set-off the amount due on the loan,
including interest, against any recovery by Chemical Bank on its cost
reallocation claims.  The Company intends to continue to defend this suit
vigorously.  Since the discovery is not yet complete, the Company is unable to
assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome in this litigation, or estimate an
amount or range of potential loss in the event of an adverse outcome.

NEZ PERCE TRIBE

On December 6, 1991, the Nez Perce Tribe filed an action against the Company in
U. S. District Court for the District of Idaho alleging, among other things,
that two dams formerly operated by the Company, the Lewiston Dam on the
Clearwater River and the Grangeville Dam on the South Fork of the Clearwater
River, provided inadequate passage to migrating anadromous fish in violation of
rights under treaties between the Tribe and the United States made in 1855 and
1863.  The Lewiston and Grangeville Dams, which had been owned and operated by
other utilities under hydroelectric licenses from the Federal Power Commission
(the "FPC", predecessor of the FERC) prior to acquisition by the Company, were
acquired by the Company in 1937 with the approval of the FPC, but were
dismantled and removed in 1973 and 1963, respectively.  The Tribe initially
indicated through expert opinion disclosures that they were seeking actual and
punitive damages of $208 million.  However, supplemental disclosures reflect
allegations of actual loss under different assumptions of between $425 million
and $650 million.  Discovery in this case has been stayed pending a decision by
the Court on a case involving some similar issues between Idaho Power Company
and the Nez Perce Tribe.  The case is not yet set for trial.  The Company
intends to vigorously defend against the Tribe's claims.  Since the discovery
is not yet complete, the Company is unable to assess the likelihood of an
adverse outcome in this litigation, or estimate an amount or range of potential
loss in the event of an adverse outcome.

LITTLE FALLS PROJECT

Pending before the U. S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington
is the case of Spokane Tribe of Indians v. WWP.  This matter involves a claim
of the Spokane Tribe of Indians for damages arising out of the Company's Little
Falls Hydroelectric Development that was constructed on the Spokane River
pursuant to a 1905 Act of Congress.  The Tribe is claiming the Company's dam
interfered with Indian fishing rights.  The Tribe is also seeking a declaratory
judgment and quiet title to part of the property comprising the Little Falls
Hydroelectric Development.  Discovery conducted by the Company revealed that
the Tribe may seek damages in the range of $100 million to $1.4 billion, to
compensate them for the alleged loss of fishing rights, alleged lost
opportunity to develop the properties, and alleged damage to the Tribe's
cultural heritage.  The trial of these matters is currently scheduled for April
1994 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Washington, in Spokane, Washington.  On the merits, the Company claims that it
has all of the right, title and interest necessary for the construction,
operation and maintenance of the Little Falls Development, which rights, title
and interest were duly acquired from the United States pursuant to a 1905 Act
of Congress.  The Company intends to vigorously defend against the Tribe's
claims.  The Company is unable to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome
in this litigation, or estimate an amount or range of potential loss in the
event of an adverse outcome.

STEAM HEAT PLANT

The Company recently completed an updated investigation of an oil spill that
occurred several years ago in downtown Spokane at the site of the Company's
steam heat plant.  The Company purchased the plant in 1916 and operated it as a
non-regulated plant until it was deactivated in 1986 in a business decision
unrelated to the leak.  After the Bunker C fuel oil spill, initial studies
suggested that the oil was being adequately contained by both geological
features and man-made structures.  The Washington State Department of Ecology
(DOE) concurred with these findings.  However, more recent tests confirm that
the oil has migrated beyond the steam plant property.  On December 6, 1993, the
Company asked the DOE to approve a voluntary proposal to begin extracting the
underground oil.  The extraction process is intended to remove quantities of
the oil and relieve any pressure on the deposit which might cause it to move.
In December 1993, the Company established a reserve of $2.0 million, which is
the current best estimate of mitigation costs.

FIRESTORM

On October 16, 1991, gale-force winds struck a five-county area in eastern
Washington and a seven-county area in northern Idaho.  These winds were
responsible for causing 92 separate wildland fires, resulting in two deaths and
the loss of 114 homes and other structures, some of which were located in the
Company's service territory.  On October 13, 1993, three separate class action
lawsuits were filed by private individuals in the Superior Court of Spokane
County in connection with fires occurring in the Midway, Nine Mile and
Chattaroy regions of eastern Washington.  Service of these suits, together with
a fourth suit, occurred on January 7, 1994.  Complainants allege various
theories of tortious conduct, including negligence, creation of a public
nuisance, strict liability and trespass.  The lawsuits seek recovery for
property damage, emotional and mental distress, lost income and punitive
damages, but do not specify the amount of damages being sought.  The Superior
Court has yet to certify these lawsuits as class actions.  The Company intends
to vigorously defend against all such pending claims.  Since the discovery is
not yet complete, the Company is unable to assess the likelihood of an adverse
outcome in this litigation, or estimate an amount or range of potential loss in
the event of an adverse outcome.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

The Company has long-term contracts related to the purchase of fuel for thermal
generation, natural gas and hydroelectric power.  Terms of the natural gas
purchase contracts range from one month to five years and the majority provide
for minimum purchases at the then effective market rate.  The Company also has
various agreements for the purchase, sale or exchange of power with other
utilities, cogenerators, small power producers and government agencies.  For
information relating to certain long-term purchased power contracts, see Note
13.

NOTE 13. LONG-TERM PURCHASED POWER CONTRACTS WITH REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENTS

Under fixed contracts with Public Utility Districts, the Company has agreed to
purchase portions of the output of certain generating facilities.  Although the
Company has no investment in such facilities, these contracts provide that the
Company pay certain minimum amounts (which are based at least in part on the
debt service requirements of the supplier) whether or not the facility is
operating.  The cost of power obtained under the contracts, including payments
made when a facility is not operating, is included in operations and
maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Information as
of December 31, 1993, pertaining to these contracts is summarized in the

NOTE 14. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

During 1993, Pentzer acquired three companies, two involved in financial
services and one in point-of-purchase display manufacturing.  Sales of
companies involved in telecommunications, technology and energy services
resulted in transactional gains of $7.1 million.  At December 31, 1993, Pentzer
had approximately $130 million in assets compared to $103 million at the end of
1992.

In 1992, Pentzer's common stock ownership in ITRON was reduced from
approximately 60% to approximately 40% as a result of the issuance of common
stock by ITRON in an acquisition.  Accordingly, beginning in 1992, Pentzer's
share of ITRON's earnings is accounted for by the equity method and is included
in Other Income-Net and its investment in ITRON is reflected on the balance
sheet under Other Property and Investments.  As a result of ITRON's initial
public offering in November 1993 and Pentzer's sale of a portion of its ITRON
stock, Pentzer's ownership interest in ITRON was reduced to approximately 25%.

In December 1992, the Company completed the purchase of the northern Idaho
electric distribution assets of Citizens Utilities.  The cash purchase price of
$1.2 million included a premium above the book value of the net assets
acquired.  The premium will be amortized over a 19-month period.  The purchase
provided approximately 2,100 additional electric customers.  The Company
believes that this acquisition will not have a material impact on its revenues
or its operations.

On September 30, 1991, the Company completed the purchase of the Oregon and
South Lake Tahoe, California, natural gas assets of CP National Corporation, a
subsidiary of ALLTEL Corporation, for approximately $67.9 million.  The cash
purchase included a premium of approximately $24.9 million above the book value
of the net assets acquired.  The premium and other costs associated with
acquiring the properties will be amortized under a straight-line method over 20
years and the amortization may be accelerated depending upon earnings.  The
California and Oregon Commissions have agreed to a general rate "freeze" which
extends to January 1, 1996, in California and to December 31, 1995, in Oregon.
Purchased natural gas costs will continue to be tracked through to customers
during the rate "freeze" period.

On February 15, 1994, the Company announced it had reached agreement to acquire
the northern Idaho electric properties of Pacific Power & Light Company, an
operating division of PacifiCorp.  The cash purchase price will be $26 million,
subject to adjustments upon closing.  The approximate book value of the assets
is $19 million.  The purchase agreement is subject to approval by the IPUC and
FERC.  It is anticipated the acquisition will be completed mid-year 1994.
Pacific Power's northern Idaho electric system currently serves approximately
9,300 customers.  The Company believes this acquisition will not have a
material impact on its revenues or its operations.

                       THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

                                   ARTICLE I.
                                    Offices

    The principal office of the Corporation shall be in the City of Spokane,
Washington. The Corporation may have such other offices, either within or
without the State of Washington, as the Board of Directors may designate from
time to time.

                                  ARTICLE II.
                                 Shareholders

    Section 1. Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be
held on the second Friday in the month of May in each year, for the purpose of
electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come
before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal
holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day.

    Section 2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the President, the Chairman of the Board, the majority of the Board
of Directors, the Executive Committee of the Board, and shall be called by the
President at the request of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of
the voting power of all shares of the voting stock voting together as a single
class.  Only those matters that are specified in the call of or request for a
special meeting may be considered or voted at such meeting.

    Section 3. Place of Meeting. Meetings of the shareholders, whether they be
annual or special, shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation,
unless a place, either within or without the state, is otherwise designated by
the Board of Directors in the notice provided to shareholders of such meetings.

    Section 4. Notice of Meeting. Written or printed notice of every meeting of
shareholders shall be mailed by the Corporate Secretary or any Assistant
Corporate Secretary, not less than ten (10) nor more than fifty (50) days
before the date of the meeting, to each holder of record of stock entitled to
vote at the meeting. The notice shall be mailed to each shareholder at his last
known post office address, provided, however, that if a shareholder is present
at a meeting, or waives notice thereof in writing before or after the meeting,
the notice of the meeting to such shareholders shall be unnecessary.

    Section 5. Voting of Shares. At every meeting of shareholders each holder
of stock entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of such stock held in his name on the books of the Corporation, subject to the
provisions of applicable law and the Articles of Incorporation, and may vote
and otherwise act in person or by proxy; provided, however, that in elections
of directors there shall be cumulative voting as provided by law and by the
Articles of Incorporation.

    Section 6. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the number of outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or by proxy at any meeting, shall constitute a quorum, but less than a quorum
shall have power to adjourn any meeting from time to time without notice. No
change shall be made in this Section 6 without the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to
vote.

    Section 7. Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date. For the
purposes of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of
shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a
stated period but not to exceed, in any case, fifty (50) days. If the stock
transfer books shall be closed for the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall
be closed for at least ten (10) days immediately preceding such meeting. In
lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board of Directors may fix in
advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders,
such date in any

case to be not more than fifty (50) days and, in case of a meeting of
shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the
particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be
taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination
shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

    Section 8. Voting Record. The officer or agent having charge of the stock
transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make, at least ten (10) days
before each meeting of shareholders, a complete record of the shareholders
entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged in
alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each,
which record, for a period of ten (10) days prior to such meeting, shall be
kept on file at the registered office of the Corporation. Such record shall be
produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be
subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of the
meeting for the purposes thereof.

    Section 9. Conduct of Proceedings. The Chairman of the Board shall preside
at all meetings of the shareholders. In the absence of the Chairman, the
President shall preside and in the absence of both, the Executive Vice
President shall preside. The members of the Board of Directors present at the
meeting may appoint any officer of the Corporation or member of the Board to
act as Chairman of any meeting in the absence of the Chairman, the President,
or Executive Vice President. The Corporate Secretary of the Corporation, or in
his absence, an Assistant Corporate Secretary, shall act as Secretary at all
meetings of the shareholders. In the absence of the Corporate Secretary or
Assistant Corporate Secretary at any meeting of the shareholders, the presiding
officer may appoint any person to act as Secretary of the meeting.

    Section 10. Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may
vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his
duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Corporate
Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                               Board of Directors

    Section 1. General Powers. The powers of the Corporation shall be exercised
by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise
provided by the laws of the State of Washington and the Articles of
Incorporation.

    Section 2. Number and Tenure. The number of Directors of the Corporation
shall be eleven (11); provided, however, that if the right to elect a majority
of the Board of Directors shall have accrued to the holders of the Preferred
Stock as provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (j) of Article THIRD of the
Articles of Incorporation, then, during such period as such holders shall have
such right, the number of directors may exceed eleven. Directors shall be
divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. At each
Annual Meeting of Shareholders, directors elected to succeed those directors
whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third
succeeding Annual Meeting of Shareholders after their election. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, directors elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock in
accordance with paragraph (l) of subdivision (j) of Article THIRD of the
Articles of Incorporation shall be elected for a term which shall expire not
later than the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All directors shall hold
office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until their
successors shall have been elected and qualified.

    Section 3. Regular Meetings. The regular annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held immediately following the adjournment of the annual
meeting of the shareholders. At such meeting the Board of Directors, including
directors newly elected, shall organize itself for the coming year, shall elect
officers of the Corporation for the ensuing year, and shall transact all such
further business as may be necessary or appropriate. The Board shall hold
regular quarterly meetings, without call or notice, on the first Friday in the
months of August, November and February throughout the year. If any such date
shall fall on a legal holiday, the meeting scheduled for that date shall be
held on the next ensuing business day that is not a legal holiday. At such
quarterly meetings the Board of Directors shall transact all business properly
brought before the Board. Written notice of the annual and quarterly meetings
of the Board shall be given to each director at least two (2) full days in
advance of the meeting.

    Section 4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the President, the
Executive Vice President or any three (3) directors. Notice of any special

    Section 5. Emergency Meetings. In the event of a catastrophe or a disaster
causing the injury or death to members of the Board of Directors and the
principal officers of the Corporation, any director or officer may call an
emergency meeting of the Board of Directors. Notice of the time and place of
the emergency meeting shall be given not less than two (2) days prior to the
meeting and may be given by any available means of communication. The director
or directors present at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purpose
of filling vacancies determined to exist. The directors present at the
emergency meeting may appoint such officers as necessary to fill any vacancies
determined to exist. All appointments under this section shall be temporary
until a special meeting of the shareholders and directors is held as provided
in these Bylaws.

    Section 6. Conference by Telephone. The members of the Board of Directors,
or of any committee created by the Board, may participate in a meeting of the
Board or of the committee by means of a conference telephone or similar
communication equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by
such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting.

    Section 7. Quorum. A majority of the number of directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of
Directors. The action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall be the action of the Board.

    Section 8. Action Without a Meeting. Any action required by law to be taken
at a meeting of the directors of the Corporation, or any action which may be
taken at a meeting of the directors or of a committee, may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all of the directors, or all of the members of the committee, as the
case may be. Such consent shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote.

    Section 9. Vacancies. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (j) of Article THIRD of the Articles of Incorporation, (a) any
vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the
Board of Directors and any director so elected to fill a vacancy shall be
elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office and (b) any
directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors
may be filled by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only
until the next election of directors by the shareholders.

    Section 10. Resignation of Director. Any director or member of any
committee may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and
shall take effect at the time specified therein. If no time is specified, it
shall take effect from the time of its receipt by the Corporate Secretary, who
shall record such resignation, noting the day, hour and minute of its
reception. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

    Section 11. Removal. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (j) of Article THIRD of the Articles of Incorporation, any director
may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled generally to
vote in the election of directors voting together as a single class, at a
meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose; provided, however,
that if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no one of the
directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal of such director
would be sufficient to elect such director if then cumulatively voted at an
election of the class of directors of which such director is a part. No
decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall
shorten the term of any incumbent director.

    Section 12. Order of Business. The Chairman of the Board shall preside at
all meetings of the directors. In the absence of the Chairman, the officer or
member of the Board designated by the Board of Directors shall preside. At
meetings of the Board of Directors, business shall be transacted in such order
as the Board may determine. Minutes of all proceedings of the Board of
Directors, or committees appointed by it, shall be prepared and maintained by
the Corporate Secretary or an Assistant Corporate Secretary and the original
shall be maintained in the principal office of the Corporation.

    Section 13. Nomination of Directors. Subject to the provisions of paragraph
(1) of subdivision (j) of Article THIRD of the Articles of Incorporation,
nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of
Directors, or a nominating committee appointed by the Board of Directors, or by
any holder of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled generally
to vote in the election of directors (such stock being hereinafter in this

Section called "Voting Stock"). However, any holder of shares of the Voting
Stock may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting
only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nomination or
nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States
mail, postage prepaid, to the Corporate Secretary not later than (i) with
respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, ninety
(90) days in advance of such meeting and (ii) with respect to an election to be
held at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the

the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and
of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that such
shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Voting Stock of the
Corporation and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons identified in the notice; (c) a description of
all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and each nominee
and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to
which the nomination or nominations are to be made by such shareholder; (d)
such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as
would be required to be included in a proxy statement under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (or
any subsequent revisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations) if the
nominee(s) had been nominated, or were intended to be nominated, by the Board
of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the
Corporation if so elected. The Chairman of the meeting may refuse to
acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the
foregoing procedure.

    Section 14. Presumption of Assent. A director of the Corporation who is
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or of a committee thereof, at
which action on any corporate matter is taken, shall be presumed to have
assented to the action unless his dissent shall be entered in the minutes of
the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent to such action with the
person acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or
shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the Corporate Secretary of the
Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to
dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

    Section 15. Retirement of Directors. Directors who are 70 years of age or
more shall retire from the Board effective at the conclusion of the Annual
Meeting of Shareholders held in the year in which their term expires, and any
such Director shall not be nominated for election at such Annual Meeting. The
foregoing shall be effective in 1988 and thereafter as to any Director who is
70 years of age or more during the year in which his or her term expires.

    Section 2. Authority. The Executive Committee, when the Board of Directors
is not in session, shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the

Directors may, by resolution, designate one or more other committees, each such

                 IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS, for the same purposes and upon the same

covenants as set forth in the Mortgage, as supplemented, this Twenty-seventh
Supplemental Indenture being supplemental to the Mortgage.

                 AND IT IS HEREBY COVENANTED by the Company that all the terms,

                 The Company further covenants and agrees to and with the
Trustee and its successor or successors in such trust under the Mortgage, as

                                   ARTICLE I

                          TWENTY-FIFTH SERIES OF BONDS

                 SECTION 1.  (I) There shall be a series of bonds designated
"Secured Medium-Term Notes, Series B (being a series of First Mortgage Bonds)"
(herein sometimes referred to as the "Twenty-fifth Series"), each of which
shall also bear the descriptive title First Mortgage Bond, and the form
thereof, which shall be established by Resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Company, shall contain suitable provisions with respect to the matters
hereinafter in this Section specified.  Bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series shall
be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars and, at the option of the Company, any amount in excess thereof which
is an integral multiple of Ten Thousand Dollars (the exercise of such option to
be evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof) and shall be dated as in
Section 10 of the Mortgage provided.  Each bond of the Twenty-fifth Series
shall (a) be issued in such principal amount, (b) mature on such date (with
respect to each such bond the "Stated Maturity Date") not less than nine months
nor more than 40 years from its Original Issue Date (as defined below), (c)
bear interest at such rate, computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting
of twelve 30-day months, payable semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 in each
year, commencing July 1, 1994 (each such date being hereinafter called an
"Interest Payment Date") and at Maturity (as hereinafter defined) and (d) have
such other terms and provisions, all as shall be specified by the Company in a
written order, or orders, executed by the Chairman of the Board, the President,
any Vice President, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company,
delivered to the Trustee referring to the bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series
(each such written order being hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "Company
Order"), such specification by such an officer of the Company having been
heretofore authorized in a Resolution filed with the Trustee referring to this
Twenty-seventh Supplemental Indenture.  Each bond of the Twenty-fifth Series
shall bear interest from its Original Issue Date, if the date of such bond is
prior to the first Interest Payment Date after such Original Issue Date, or, if
the date of such Bond is after such first Interest Payment Date, from the
Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of such bond.  The principal of
and premium, if any, and interest on each bond of the Twenty-fifth Series
payable at Maturity shall be





                                       
                                       
<PAGE>   6
                                      -6-


payable upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency as at the
time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.  The interest on
each bond of the Twenty- fifth Series (other than interest payable at Maturity)
shall be payable by check, in similar coin or currency, mailed to the
registered owner thereof as of the close of business on December 15 or June 15,
as the case may be, next preceding each Interest Payment Date (each such date
being herein called a "Record Date"); provided, however, that if such
registered owner shall be a securities depository, such payment may be made by
such other means in lieu of check as shall be agreed upon by the Company, the
Trustee and such registered owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Original Issue Date of a bond of the Twenty-fifth Series is after a Record Date
and before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the first payment of
interest on such bond shall be made on the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date to the person in whose name such bond was registered on the Record Date
with respect to such next succeeding Interest Payment Date.  Interest payable
at Maturity shall be paid to the person to whom principal shall be paid.

                 As used herein, the term "Original Issue Date" shall mean,
with respect to any bond of the Twenty-fifth Series, the date of authentication
and delivery hereunder of such bond, or, in the case of any particular bond
which has been authenticated and delivered upon the registration of transfer or
exchange of, or in substitution for, another bond, the date of the original
authentication and delivery hereunder of the first bond authenticated and
delivered hereunder representing all or a portion of the same obligation as
that evidenced by such particular bond; and the term "Maturity" shall mean,
with respect to any bond of the Twenty-fifth Series, the date on which the
principal of such bond becomes due and payable, whether on the Stated Maturity
Date, upon redemption or otherwise.

                 (II)  Bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series may be redeemable in
whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to the respective Stated
Maturity Dates thereof, either at the option of the Company or by the
application (either at the option of the Company or pursuant to the
requirements of the Mortgage) of cash deposited with the Trustee pursuant to
the provisions of Section 38, Section 39 or Section 64 of the Mortgage or with
the Proceeds of Released Property, upon notice mailed as provided in Section 52
of the Mortgage, to such extent, at such times, at such prices and upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as shall be specified in one or more Company
Orders delivered to the Trustee.

                 (III)  At the option of the registered owner, any bonds of the
Twenty-fifth Series, upon surrender thereof for cancellation at the office or
agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, shall
be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of bonds of the same
series of other authorized denominations which have the same Original Issue
Date, Stated Maturity Date, redemption provisions, if any, and which bear
interest at the same rate.

                 Bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series shall be transferable, upon
the surrender thereof for cancellation, together with a written instrument of
transfer in form approved by the registrar duly executed by the registered
owner or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or agency of the
Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.

                 Upon any exchange or transfer of bonds of the Twenty-fifth
Series, the Company may make a charge therefor sufficient to reimburse it for
any tax or taxes or other governmental charge, as provided in Section 12 of the
Mortgage, but the Company hereby waives any right to make a charge in addition
thereto for any exchange or transfer of bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make any transfer
or exchange of any bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series for a period of 10 days
next preceding any selection of such bonds for redemption, nor shall it be
required to make transfers or exchanges of any bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series
which shall have been selected for redemption in whole or in part or as to





                                       
<PAGE>   7
                                      -7-


which the Company shall have received a notice for the redemption thereof in
whole or in part at the option of the registered owner.

                 Upon the delivery of this Twenty-seventh Supplemental
Indenture, bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series in an aggregate principal amount
initially not to exceed $250,000,000 are to be issued from time to time, and
upon issuance and delivery, will be Outstanding, in addition to (a)
$318,700,000 aggregate principal amount of bonds of prior series Outstanding at
the date of delivery of this Twenty-seventh Supplemental Indenture and (b)
$25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of bonds of the Twenty-fourth Series
remaining to be issued from time to time, out of $250,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount initially authorized.


                                   ARTICLE II

                 SECTION 2.  The Company reserves the right, subject to
appropriate corporate action, but without any consent or other action by
holders of bonds of the Twenty-fifth Series, to make such amendments to the
Mortgage as shall be necessary in order to make any or all of the amendments to
the Mortgage set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8) of
Exhibit C to the Twenty-sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 1,
1993.

                 The Company confirms its reservation, contained in Article III

right, subject to appropriate corporate action but without any consent or other
action by holders of bonds of the Twelfth Series (as defined therein), or of
any subsequently created series, to make such amendments to the Mortgage as
shall be necessary in order to amend Article XVIII of the Mortgage to read as
set forth in said Article III of said Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture.  In
addition, the Company hereby reserves the right, subject to appropriate
corporate action but without any consent or other action by holders of bonds of
the Twenty-fifth Series, to make such amendments to the Mortgage as shall be
necessary in order to make the amendments to the Mortgage set forth in
paragraph (7) of Exhibit C to the Twenty-sixth Supplemental Indenture.


                                  ARTICLE III
