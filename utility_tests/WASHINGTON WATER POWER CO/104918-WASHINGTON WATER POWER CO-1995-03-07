ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW

The Washington Water Power Company (WWP, the Company), which was incorporated
in the State of Washington in 1889, primarily operates in the electric and
natural gas utility businesses.  As of January 1, 1995, the Company provides
electricity and natural gas in a 26,000 square mile area in eastern Washington
and northern Idaho with a population of approximately 765,000.  The Company's
electric service territory now includes Bonner County in northern Idaho as a
result of the acquisition of electric properties from PacifiCorp, which was
finalized on December 30, 1994.  See Note 14 to Financial Statements for
additional information.  Through a separate operating division called WP
Natural Gas (WPNG), the Company also provides natural gas service in northeast
and southwest Oregon and in the South Lake Tahoe region of California with a
population of approximately 460,000.

The Company's wholesale and retail utility businesses include the generation,
purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy plus the
purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.  In addition to
its utility businesses, the Company owns Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer), parent
company to the majority of the Company's non-utility businesses.

At December 31, 1994, the Company's employees included 1,420 people in its
utility operations and 775 people in its majority-owned non-utility businesses.
The Company's corporate headquarters are in Spokane, Washington (Spokane),
which serves as the Inland Northwest's center for manufacturing,
transportation, health care, education, communication, agricultural and service
businesses.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, the
Company derived operating revenues and income from operations in the following
proportions:

MERGER AGREEMENT OVERVIEW

In June 1994, the Company, Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power
Company (SPPC), a subsidiary of SPR, and Resources West Energy Corporation, a
newly formed subsidiary of the Company (Resources West), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, as subsequently amended
(Merger Agreement), which provides for the merger of WWP, SPR and SPPC into
Resources West.  SPR and SPPC are both Nevada corporations with headquarters in
Reno, Nevada (Reno).  The Merger Agreement provides that after the effective
date of the Merger, Resources West's corporate headquarters offices and
principal executive offices will be located in Spokane and that the
headquarters of its Washington Water Power and Sierra Pacific operating
divisions will be in Spokane and Reno, respectively.  As a result of the Merger
Agreement, holders of WWP Common Stock would receive one share and holders of
SPR Common Stock would receive 1.44 shares of Resources West Common Stock,
respectively.  Each outstanding share of Preferred Stock of WWP and SPPC,
respectively, will be converted into the right to receive one share of
Resources West Preferred Stock with equal stated value and dividends and like
redemption provisions and rights upon liquidation.

WWP, SPR and SPPC believe that the proposed merger offers significant strategic
and financial benefits to each of the companies and to their respective
stakeholders including an enhanced competitive position, a larger and more
diverse service territory, an expanded resource base, improved resource
planning and coordination, and cost savings.  The cost savings for the new
company are estimated to approximate $450 million, net of merger transaction
and transition costs, over the 10 years following the consummation of the
merger.   The cost savings should be achieved from, among other things, the
integration of corporate management and administrative functions, the
consolidation of distribution operations, the integration of gas purchasing
requirements, the reduction of capacity requirements, the reduction of non-firm
transmission expense, the avoidance of expenditures for operating systems, and
the streamlining of inventories and purchasing economies.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

UTILITY OPERATIONS OVERVIEW

The Company owns and operates nine hydroelectric projects in addition to a
wood-waste fueled generating station.  The Company also owns a 15% share in two
coal-fired generating facilities, one in western Washington State and one in
southeastern Montana.  In addition the Company owns one natural gas combustion
turbine (CT) peaking unit located near Spokane and completed the construction
of two additional natural gas CT peaking units in northern Idaho in early
January 1995.  The Company contracts with five natural gas pipeline companies
for access to domestic and Canadian natural gas supplies.  With this diverse
energy resource portfolio, the Company remains one of the nation's lowest-cost
producers and sellers of energy services.

At December 31, 1994, electric service was supplied to approximately 275,000
customers in eastern Washington and northern Idaho.  The Company's average
hourly load for 1994 was 886 aMW.  The Company's annual peak load, including
firm contractual obligations, was 2,233 MW.  This peak occurred on February 8,
1994, at which time the maximum capacity available from the Company's
generating facilities, in addition to firm and non-firm purchases, was 2,468
MW.

At December 31, 1994, the Company's natural gas operations served approximately
212,000 customers in its natural gas service territory located in parts of four
states.  The peak load in 1994 occurred on February 7, 1994 when 2.7 million
therms were required.  During that peak 3.5 million therms were available under
firm transportation and storage contracts.

NON-UTILITY OVERVIEW

The Company's principal subsidiary is Pentzer, a wholly-owned private
investment company whose current portfolio of investments includes companies
involved in consumer product promotion, specialty tool manufacturing, financial
services, industrial real estate development and electronic technology.

Pentzer's business strategy is to acquire controlling interest in a broad range
of middle-market companies, to help these companies grow through internal
development and strategic acquisitions, and to sell the portfolio investments
to the public or to strategic buyers.  Pentzer's objective is to produce
current returns from its portfolio investments that are higher than that of the
utility operations and to supplement these current returns by generating
transactional gains through the sale of portfolio investments when
appropriate.

As of December 31, 1994, Pentzer had approximately $167 million in total assets
or about 8% of the Company's consolidated assets.

ELECTRIC SERVICE

COMPETITION AND BUSINESS RISK

Regulatory, economic and technological changes have brought about the
accelerating transformation of the electric utility industry from a vertically
integrated monopoly to a business that is much more market driven in each
segment of its business.  The Company believes that it is well positioned to
meet the challenges of increased competition due to its low production costs,
close proximity to major transmission lines, active participation in wholesale
power markets and its dedication to high levels of customer satisfaction, cost
reduction and continuous improvement of work processes.

The Company continues to compete for new retail electric customers with various
rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to its
service territories.  Challenges facing the electric retail business include
evolving technologies which provide alternate energy supplies, reduced energy
consumption and the cost of the energy supplied, self-generation and fuel
switching by commercial and industrial customers, the potential for retail
wheeling (described below), the costs of increasingly stringent environmental
laws and the potential for stranded or nonrecoverable utility assets.  If
electric utility companies are eventually required to provide retail wheeling
service, which is the transmission by an electric utility of electric power
from another supplier to a customer located within such utility's service area,
the Company believes it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed
to remaining one of the country's lowest-cost providers of electric energy.
Similarly the Company believes it faces minimal risk for stranded generation,
transmission or distribution assets due to its low cost structure.

The National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) enacted in 1992 addresses a wide range of
issues affecting the wholesale electric business.  NEPA gives the FERC expanded
authority to order electric utilities (a) to transmit electric power to or for
wholesale purchasers and sellers if the result would not unreasonably impair
the continuing reliability of the affected electric systems and (b) to increase
transmission capacity to provide access for wholesale purchasers and sellers of
electric power at prices that permit the recovery by the utility of all costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services.  NEPA also created a new
exception from the provisions of the Holding Company Act for Exempt Wholesale
Generators (EWG).  Subject to satisfying various regulatory requirements, EWGs
may own generating facilities and make wholesale sales.  The Company believes
NEPA provides future transmission, energy production and sales opportunities to
the Company and complements the Company's commitment to the wholesale electric
business.  The Company has filed for open access transmission tariffs with the
FERC and is exploring options as a member of the newly forming Regional
Transmission Groups, which are designed to enable the market for electric power
to operate in a more competitive and efficient manner.

The Company continues to compete in the wholesale electric market with other
western utilities, including the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) which is
forecasting significant price increases in the near future.  Business
challenges affecting the wholesale electric business include new entrants in
the wholesale market, such as power brokers and marketers, competition from low
cost generation being developed by independent power producers and declining
margins.  However, the Company's wholesale electric business remains an
important part of the Company's overall business strategy.  Since 1987 the
Company has entered into a number of long-term firm power sales contracts that
have increased its wholesale electric business and the Company intends to
continue active pursuit of electric wholesale business opportunities.  In 1994,
29% of total KWH sales were to wholesale customers with 53% of these sales
under firm contracts.

ELECTRIC SYSTEM

Hydroelectric Resources.  Hydroelectric generation is the Company's lowest cost
source of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a
significant effect on the Company's total power costs.  The Company expects to
meet about 49% of its total system requirements with its own hydroelectric
generation and long-term hydroelectric contracts in normal water years.  The
streamflows in the Company's drainage systems were 65%, 86% and 64% of normal
in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  For the years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, 38%, 43% and 40% of the Company's total system requirements were
met by these hydroelectric resources.

Thermal Resources.  The Company has a 15% interest in two coal-fired facilities
- - the Centralia Power Plant (Centralia) in western Washington and Units 3 and 4
of the Colstrip Generating Project (Colstrip) in southeastern Montana.  In
addition, the Company owns a woodwaste-fired facility known as the Kettle Falls
Generating Station (Kettle Falls) in northeastern Washington and a natural
gas-fired combustion turbine (CT) in Spokane; the Company also completed the
construction of two additional natural gas CT units in northern Idaho in early
January 1995.  The CTs are primarily used for peaking needs.  Company-owned
thermal facilities provided 32%, 25% and 31% of the Company's total electricity
requirements for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


                                       3

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Centralia, which is operated by PacifiCorp, is supplied with coal under both a
fuel supply agreement in effect through December 2020 and various spot market
purchases.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992 Centralia provided approximately 42%, 46%
and 40%, respectively, of the Company's thermal generation.

Colstrip is supplied with fuel under coal supply and transportation agreements
in effect through December 2019, from adjacent coal reserves owned and
controlled by Entech, Inc. (Entech).  Entech is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Montana Power Company, which is the operator of Colstrip.  In 1994, 1993
and 1992 Colstrip provided approximately 48%, 43%, and 51% of the Company's
thermal generation, respectively.

Kettle Falls' primary fuel is wood-waste generated as a by-product of forest
industry operations within one hundred miles of the plant.  Natural gas may be
used as an alternate fuel.  The cost of wood-waste fuel is heavily influenced
by operations of the forest products industry as well as transportation costs
and, therefore, is subject to significant price variations.  Even with the
increased competition for wood-waste, a combination of long-term contracts
already in place plus spot purchases allow the Company the flexibility to meet
all expected future fuel requirements for the plant.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992
Kettle Falls provided approximately 10%, 11% and 9% of the Company's thermal
generation, respectively.

Purchases, Exchanges and Sales.  In addition to the Company-owned hydroelectric
projects, long-term hydroelectric contracts and thermal generating resources
discussed above, total system requirements are met with other purchases and
exchanges of power.  Other power purchases and exchanges for the years 1994,
1993 and 1992 provided approximately 30%, 32% and 29%, respectively, of the
Company's total system requirements.

The following table summarizes the Company's major long-term wholesale power
agreements as of December 31, 1994 (1):

       information.

Under PURPA, the Company is required to purchase generation from qualifying
facilities, including small hydroelectric and cogeneration projects, at avoided
cost rates adopted by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission
(WUTC) and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC).  The Company purchased
approximately 612 million KWH, or about 6% of the Company's total energy
requirements, from these sources at a cost of approximately $25 million in
1994.  Current avoided costs range from 2.2 to 5.5 cents per KWH in Washington,
depending on the terms and length of the contract in addition to the period in
which the project commences delivery of power to the Company.  Avoided cost
rates ranging from 1.9 to 3.7 cents per KWH in Idaho were proposed in an
amended filing made to the IPUC in early March 1995.

The largest such contract is a ten-year power purchase contract between the
Company and Potlatch, one of the Company's major industrial customers, which
became effective on January 1, 1992.  Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company purchases 50-55 aMW of Potlatch's electric generation and makes
available approximately 95 aMW of firm energy for sale.  In addition, the
Company makes available 25 aMW of interruptible energy and Potlatch provides an
equivalent amount of reserve generation capacity in case of interruption.

ELECTRIC REGULATORY ISSUES

The Company, as a public utility, is currently subject to regulation by state
utility commissions with respect to rates, accounting, the issuance of
securities and other matters.  The electric retail operations are subject to
the jurisdiction of the WUTC and IPUC.  The Company is also subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC for its accounting procedures and its wholesale
transmission rates.

In each regulatory jurisdiction, the price the Company may charge for utility
services (other than certain wholesale sales and specially negotiated retail
rates for industrial or large commercial customers) is currently determined on
a "cost of service" basis and is designed to provide, after recovery of
allowable operating expenses, an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on
"rate base" or assets employed in the business.  "Rate base" is generally
determined by reference to the original cost (net of accumulated depreciation)
of utility plant in service, subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes
and other items.


                                       4
<PAGE>   8
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Over time, rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and
reduced by depreciation and retirements of utility plant from service.

The Company is a licensee under the Federal Power Act and its licensed projects
are subject to the provisions of Part I of that Act.  These provisions include
payment for headwater benefits, condemnation of licensed projects upon payment
of just compensation and take-over of such projects after the expiration of the
license upon payment of the lesser of "net investment" or "fair value" of the
project, in either case plus severance damages.  See Item 2.  Properties -
Electric Properties for additional information.

General Rate Cases

The Company does not currently plan to file for any general electric rate
increases in 1995.  See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations:  Future Outlook for additional
information regarding rate freezes related to the proposed merger between the
Company and SPPC.  The following table summarizes information for the Company's
most recent general electric rate cases:

    (2)  The IPUC has approved an indefinite extension of the power cost

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)  IRP is a process required by both the WUTC
and IPUC and represents the Company's responsibility to meet customer demand
for reliable energy services at the lowest total cost to both the Company and
its customers.  The process entails (1) the forecasting of future energy needs,
(2) the assessment of energy supplies, conservation options, customer costs,
and social and environmental impacts and (3) the development of action plans
which support a least cost resource strategy.  Both the WUTC and IPUC
acknowledge the plans as part of a public hearing process but do not approve
the resource plans due to concerns about pre-approval outside of actual rate
cases.  The state commissions place an emphasis on the IRP as an informational
tool for long-term planning.  As discussed below, the WUTC has issued a Notice
of Inquiry to, in part, determine if the IRP rule should be modified in light
of the changing electric industry.  The Company is required to file an updated
IRP every two years and will be filing with both the WUTC and IPUC in April
1995.

Notice of Inquiry (NOI)  In December 1994, the WUTC initiated an NOI entitled,
"Examining Regulation of Electric Utilities in the Face of Change in the
Electric Industry."  The NOI seeks comments on the structural change in the
electric industry, the implications of industry changes for utility regulation,
and recommendations concerning specific rules and regulations currently used by
the WUTC.  The WUTC states that it will use the information generated by the
inquiry to "review and, if necessary, revise regulatory procedures and rules
concerning least-cost planning, competitive bidding for utility resources, and
review of the prudence of utility expenditures."  Comments were submitted in
February 1995 with technical workshops planned for later in 1995.  To date
there has been no similar plan initiated by the IPUC.

Demand Side Management (DSM) Programs  The WUTC and IPUC approved as filed,
effective January 1, 1995, the Company's proposed electric and natural gas DSM
programs for a two year period ending December 31, 1996.  The Company's DSM
programs focus on both the continuation of selected existing programs available
to broad customer classes and the development of specifically structured
programs to influence market demand.  The Company's programs, while maintaining
a residential electric weatherization program and fuel efficiency awareness
programs, now places a greater emphasis on commercial and industrial programs.

DSM Riders  In a two year experimental program the WUTC approved the Company's
requested DSM Tariff Rider as filed, effective January 1, 1995.  The tariff
rider is a separate revenue source and represents a 1.55% electric revenue
increase and a 0.52% natural gas increase.  The revenues will be used to fund
the Company's 1995 and 1996 DSM program expenditures.  Under previous
accounting treatment, DSM investments, including the applicable interest charge
known as Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (AFUCE), were recorded as
deferred assets until an application was made in a future general rate case.
The new treatment will treat 1995 and 1996 DSM expenditures as operating
expenses during the two year experimental period.  The IPUC approved a similar
proposal on March 3, 1995.

Power Cost Adjustment (PCA)  In 1989 the IPUC approved the Company's filing for
a PCA whereby the Company is allowed to modify electric rates to recover or
rebate a portion of the difference between actual and allowed net power supply
costs.  In July of 1994, the IPUC approved an indefinite extension of the
Company's proposed modifications to the PCA.  The modified PCA tracks changes
in hydroelectric generation, secondary prices, related changes in thermal
generation and PURPA contracts but it no longer tracks changes in revenues or
costs associated with other wheeling or power contracts.  On January 1, 1995, a
$2.2 million, or 2.5%, surcharge was implemented for the next twelve months to
recover costs resulting from low streamflow conditions during 1994.  Since its
implementation the PCA has triggered two surcharges and two rebates.  See Note
1 to Financial Statements for additional details.

Northern Idaho Acquisition  On December 30, 1994, the IPUC approved the
transfer of ownership of all PacifiCorp's electric properties in northern Idaho
to the Company for the purchase price of approximately $33 million, subject to
customary closing adjustments.  The purchase adds about 9,800 electric
customers to the 82,000 electric customers already served by the Company in
Idaho.  The purchase will not require major changes in the Company's
transmission system and the Company has the generating resources to meet the 54
megawatt peak load.  The Company has reduced most customers' energy prices to
1% below PacifiCorp's previous rates and has instituted a rate freeze until
January 1, 1999.  At the end of the four-year rate freeze, energy prices will
be adjusted to the levels then in effect in the Company's other service areas
in northern Idaho.  See Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional details.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

NATURAL GAS SERVICE

COMPETITION AND BUSINESS RISK

Natural gas remains competitively priced compared to other alternative fuel
sources for residential, commercial and industrial customers and is projected
to remain so well into the future due to increasing supplies and competition.
The Company continues to advise electricity customers as to the cost advantages
of converting space and water heating needs to natural gas.  Significant growth
has occurred in the Company's natural gas business in recent years due to these
conversions and increased demand for natural gas in new construction.  The
Company also makes sales or provides transportation service directly to large
natural gas customers.

Challenges facing the Company's natural gas business include the continuing
potential for customers to by-pass the Company's natural gas system.  Since
1988 two of the Company's large industrial customers have built their own
pipeline interconnection.  However, these customers continue to purchase
natural gas services from the Company.  To reduce the potential for such
by-pass, the Company prices its natural gas services, including transportation
contracts, competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price its
transportation and delivery rates by means of special contracts.  The Company
has also signed long-term transportation contracts with two of its largest
industrial customers which minimizes the chances of these customers by-passing
the Company's system in the foreseeable future.

Order 636B adopted by FERC in 1992 provides the Company more flexibility in
optimizing its natural gas transportation and supply portfolios.  While rate
design changes have increased the costs of firm transportation to low
load-factor pipeline customers such as the Company, flexible receipt and
delivery points and capacity releases allow temporarily under-utilized
transportation to be released to others when not needed to serve the Company's
customers.  The Company is also able to optimize its natural gas portfolio by
engaging in some off-system sales.

NATURAL GAS SYSTEM

The Company's natural gas operations are operated as separate divisions, with
the WWP service territory including the Washington and Idaho properties and the
WPNG service territory including Oregon and California properties.

Natural Gas Supply  The Company has access to five natural gas pipelines,
Northwest Pipeline Company (NWP), Pacific Gas Transmission (PGT), Paiute
Pipeline (Paiute), NOVA Pipeline, Ltd. (NOVA) and Alberta Natural Gas Co. Ltd.
(ANG), which provide the Company access to both domestic and Canadian natural
gas supplies.  Due to this resource portfolio, the Company remains one of the
nation's lowest-cost local distribution companies.

Both WWP and WPNG contract with NWP for three types of firm service
(transportation, liquefied natural gas storage and underground storage) and
with PGT, NOVA and ANG for firm transportation only.  The Company contracted
with NOVA, ANG and PGT for additional transportation capacity to be available
by November 1995 for service in its Washington, Idaho and Oregon natural gas
properties.  WPNG also contracts with Paiute for firm transportation and
liquefied natural gas storage to deliver natural gas to its California
customers.

Firm natural gas supplies are purchased by the Company through negotiated
agreements having terms ranging between one month and ten years with a variety
of natural gas suppliers.  As a result of FERC Order 636B, WWP has completed
the process of converting its NWP natural gas sales to firm transportation and
assuming its share of NWP's natural gas supply contracts.

Jackson Prairie Natural Gas Storage Project (Storage Project)  The Company owns
a one-third interest in the Storage Project, which is an underground natural
gas storage field located near Chehalis, Washington.  Under FERC's open access
policy the role of the Storage Project in providing flexible natural gas
supplies is increasingly important to the Company's natural gas operations.
The Storage Project enables the Company to place natural gas into storage when
prices are low or to meet minimum natural gas purchasing requirements, as well
as to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are high or as needed
to meet high demand periods.  The Company, together with the other owners, is
pursuing alternatives to increase the potential for both capacity and
deliverability at the Storage Project.

The Company has contracted to release some of its Storage Project capacity to
two other utilities until mid-1995 and 1996, respectively, with a provision
under one of the releases to partially recall the released capacity if the
Company determines additional natural gas is required for its own system
supply.  The Company is currently negotiating the extension of these contracts
until 1998 and 2001, respectively.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Natural Gas Transportation Services  The Company provides transportation
service to customers who obtain their own natural gas supplies.  Transportation
service continued to be a significant component of the Company's total system
deliveries in 1994.  The competitive nature of the spot natural gas market
results in savings in the cost of purchased natural gas, which encourages large
customers with fuel-switching capabilities to continue to utilize natural gas
for their energy needs.  The total volume transported on behalf of
transportation customers was approximately 195.5 million therms in 1994.  This
total volume represented approximately 39% of the Company's total system
deliveries in 1994.

NATURAL GAS REGULATORY ISSUES

The Company, as a public utility, is currently subject to regulation by several
state utility commissions with respect to rates, accounting, the issuance of
securities and other matters.  The natural gas operations are subject to the
jurisdiction of the WUTC, IPUC, OPUC and CPUC in addition to the jurisdiction
of FERC with respect to natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity
from the Storage Project.

General Rate Cases

The Company has no current plans to file for any natural gas general rate cases
in 1995.  See Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations:  Future Outlook for additional information
regarding rate freezes related to the proposed merger with SPPC.  The following
table summarizes information for the Company's most recent general natural gas
rate cases (1):

    (1)  In addition, the Company from time to time, upon request, receives
         regulatory approval from the WUTC, the IPUC, the OPUC and the CPUC 
         to adjust rates to reflect changes in the cost of purchased natural 
         gas between general rate cases.
    (2)  Anticipated annual revenue effect.

In September 1991, the Company commenced operations in both California and
Oregon upon the acquisition of the natural gas properties of CP National.  The
conditions of the CPUC order approving the acquisition included an exemption
from filing a general rate case until January 1, 1994 and a rate freeze until
January 1, 1995.  On February 8, 1995, the CPUC granted an additional one year
extension to January 1, 1996 before the Company is required to file a general
rate case.  As a result, the existing rate freeze will continue until at least
January 1, 1997.  The OPUC also authorized a general rate freeze which extends
to December 31, 1995.  Purchased natural gas costs will continue to be tracked
through to customers in both jurisdictions during the rate freeze period.

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)  See Electric Service - Electric Regulatory
Issues for a detailed description of the IRP process.  The natural gas IRP is a
process required by the WUTC, IPUC and the OPUC.  The 1995 natural gas IRP
reports were submitted to these commissions in January 1995 with
acknowledgments anticipated by the end of 1995.  The natural gas IRP is
provided to the CPUC for informational purposes only.

Demand Side Management (DSM)  See Electric Service - Electric Regulatory Issues
regarding the WUTC and IPUC DSM applications.  In 1993 the OPUC authorized the
Company to defer revenue requirements associated with its WPNG DSM investments,
and established an annual rate adjustment mechanism to reflect the deferred
costs on a timely basis.  Under this authorization, the Company files annually,
concurrent with the Company's annual natural gas tracker filing, a rate
adjustment to recover DSM program costs and margin losses.  On December 1, 1994
the OPUC approved the Company's annual tracker increase which included such a
rate adjustment.

Natural Gas Trackers  Natural gas trackers are designed to pass through changes
in purchased natural gas costs and do not result in any changes in net income
to the Company.  In mid-July, the Company filed a natural gas tracker with the
WUTC primarily to reflect changes in the cost of purchased natural gas during
the past year.  At the same time a natural gas tracker was filed with the IPUC
for a decrease primarily due to a change in cost determination methodology.
The trackers in Washington and Idaho were both approved effective September 1,
1994 and authorized a $5.7 million or 8.75% increase and a $1.0 million or
3.98% decrease, respectively, in the two jurisdictions.  The annual Oregon
natural gas tracker became

effective on December 1, 1994, which authorized a $2.4 million or 5.74%
increase.  A Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) or natural gas tracker filing was
approved by the CPUC effective January 5, 1995 which authorized a $0.8 million
or 7.71% increase in California.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

The Company is subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local
authorities.  The generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage
facilities in which the Company has an ownership interest have been designed to
comply with all environmental laws presently applicable.  Furthermore the
Company conducts vigilant and periodic reviews of all its facilities and
operations to anticipate emerging environmental issues.

Air Quality.  The Company continues to assess both the potential and actual
impact of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) on the thermal generating
plants in which it maintains an ownership interest.  Centralia, which is
operated by PacifiCorp, is classified as a "Phase II" coal-fired plant under
the CAAA and as such, will be required to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
by approximately 40% by the year 2000.  Several methods to meet CAAA SO2
reduction standards are being evaluated and a plan is expected to be completed
by the operator by mid-1995.  The alternatives most likely to be used in
meeting the compliance standards will be some combination of lower sulfur coal,
SO2 reduction through clean coal technology and SO2 allowances either purchased
or pooled, if available, among the Centralia owners.  The anticipated share of
costs for SO2 compliance are not expected to have a major economic impact on
the Company.

Colstrip, which is also a "Phase II" coal-fired plant and is operated by
Montana Power, is not expected to be required to implement any additional SO2
mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations.
Reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOX) will be required at both Centralia and
Colstrip prior to the year 2000.  The anticipated share of costs for NOX
compliance are not expected to have a major economic impact on the Company.

The Company's other thermal projects also are subject to various CAAA
standards.  Every five years each project requires an updated operating permit
(known as a Title V permit) which addresses, among other things, the compliance
of the plant with the CAAA.  Permit applications for the Company's Kettle Falls
plant and the Northeast CT are due in June of 1995.  The new Rathdrum CT in
northern Idaho has an operating permit application currently under
consideration.  The Company expects to be able to obtain these permits under
the CAAA.  See Electric Service - Electric System for additional information.

Superfund Sites.  The Company was named a potentially responsible party under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980 ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") at the Coal Creek site in Chehalis, Washington.
The clean-up is now essentially complete, with the exception of some long-term
maintenance efforts, at a cost of approximately $14 million.  This cost was
shared by approximately 90 utilities and the Company's portion, which has
already been paid, was about $1.1 million.

In 1993 the EPA referred a matter to the U.S. Justice Department requesting the
Company and other potentially responsible parties to enter into negotiations
for the recovery of costs incurred by EPA and for initiation of action in
connection with the clean-up at the Spokane Junk Yard Site located in Spokane,
Washington.  If an action is commenced, the claim is expected to be for $2.7
million in initial clean-up and site stabilization costs plus additional costs
including attorneys' fees and further site rehabilitation costs.  The Company
has no records showing that any Company equipment was ever deposited at the
Spokane Junk Yard Site or that PCB contaminated equipment was delivered to any
company which disposed of materials at the site.  In consultations with the
EPA, the Company is continuing to evaluate its potential liability, if any,
with respect to this site.

and Results of Operations: Future Outlook and Note 11 to Financial Statements
for additional information.

NON-UTILITY BUSINESS

The majority of all of the non-utility businesses are owned by Pentzer, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company
had an equity investment of approximately $114 million in non-utility
businesses, of which about $107 million was invested in Pentzer.  The remainder
was invested in three other subsidiaries, the largest of which is Washington
Irrigation and Development Company (WIDCo), which maintains a small investment
portfolio.

As of December 31, 1994, Pentzer had approximately $167 million in total
assets, or about 8% of the Company's consolidated assets.  Pentzer's portfolio
of investments includes companies involved in consumer product promotion,
specialty tool manufacturing, financial services, industrial real estate
development and electronic technology.

Pentzer's current investment profile focuses on manufacturers and distributors
of industrial and consumer products as well as service businesses.  The Company
seeks businesses with above average records of earnings growth in industries
that are not cyclical or dependent upon high levels of research and
development.  Emphasis is placed on leading companies with strong market
franchises, dominant or proprietary product lines or other significant
competitive advantages.  Pentzer is particularly

                                      12
<PAGE>   16
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

interested in companies serving niche markets.  Total investment in any one 
company is generally limited to $15 million, and control of the acquired 
company's board of directors is generally required.

Pentzer's business strategy is to acquire controlling interest in a broad range
of middle market companies, to help these companies grow through internal
development and strategic acquisitions, and to sell the portfolio investments
to the public or to strategic buyers.  Pentzer's objective is to produce
current returns from its portfolio investments that are higher than that of the
utility operations and to supplement these current returns by generating
transactional gains through the sale of portfolio investments when appropriate.
From time to time, a significant portion of Pentzer's earnings contributions
may be the result of transactional gains.  Accordingly, although the income
stream is expected to be positive, it may be uneven from year to year.

Distribution and Transmission Plant

The Company operates approximately 11,350 miles of primary and secondary
distribution lines in its electric system in addition to a transmission system
of approximately 550 miles of 230 KV line and 1,530 miles of 115 KV line.
These electric system mileages do not yet include the properties recently
acquired from PacifiCorp in Bonner County in northern Idaho.  The Company also
owns a 10% interest in 495 miles of a 500 KV line from Colstrip, Montana and a
15% interest in 3 miles of a 500 KV line from Centralia, Washington to the
nearest BPA interconnections.

The 230 KV lines are used primarily to transmit power from the Company's Noxon
Rapids and Cabinet Gorge hydroelectric generating stations to major load
centers in the Company's service area.  The 230 KV lines also transmit to
points of

                                      14
<PAGE>   18
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

interconnection with adjoining electric transmission systems for bulk
power transfers.  These lines interconnect with BPA at five locations and at
one location each with PacifiCorp, Montana Power and Idaho Power Company.  The
BPA interconnections serve as points of delivery for power from the Colstrip
and Centralia generating stations as well as for the interchange of power with
the Southwest.  The interconnection with PacifiCorp is the point of delivery
for power purchased by the Company from Mid-Columbia projects' hydroelectric
generating stations.

The 115 KV lines provide for transmission of energy as well as providing for
the integration of the Spokane River hydroelectric and Kettle Falls wood-waste
generating stations with service area load centers.  These lines interconnect
with BPA at nine locations, Grant County PUD, Seattle City Light and Tacoma
City Light at two locations and one interconnect location each with Chelan
County PUD, PacifiCorp, and Montana Power.

See Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Future Outlook for additional information regarding the
potential transmission interconnections between the Company and SPPC.

NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES

The WWP and WPNG service territories' natural gas properties have natural gas
distribution mains of approximately 3,100 miles and 1,500 miles, respectively,
as of December 31, 1994.

The Company, NWP and Washington Natural Gas Company each own a one-third
undivided interest in the Storage Project.  The Storage Project has a total
peak day deliverability of 4.6 million therms, with a total working natural gas
inventory of 155.2 million therms.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

A Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company was held on November 18, 1994.
The only matter voted upon at the meeting was the approval of the Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization and Merger dated as of June 27, 1994, as amended October
4, 1994, by and among the Company, SPR, SPPC and Resources West, and the
transactions contemplated thereby (Merger Proposal), pursuant to which, among
other things, each of the Company, SPR and SPPC will be merged with and into
Resources West.

As of September 22, 1994, the record date for determining shareholders entitled
to notice of and to vote at the meeting, 54,017,035 shares of Common Stock of
the Company and 850,500 shares of Preferred Stock of the Company were issued
and outstanding, with 43,088,852 shares of Common Stock and 641,686 shares of
Preferred Stock represented at said meeting.  Approval of the Merger Proposal
required the affirmative vote of (i) not less than two thirds of all votes
entitled to be cast by all holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) not less
than two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by all holders of Company
Preferred Stock, in each case voting separately as a class.  The Merger
Proposal was approved by the requisite shareholder votes.  The details of the
voting are shown below:

                                    PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Outstanding shares of Common Stock are listed on the New York and Pacific Stock
Exchanges.  As of February 28, 1995, there were approximately 34,155 registered
shareholders of the Company's no par value Common Stock.

It is the intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay dividends
quarterly on the Common Stock, but the amount of such dividends is dependent on
future earnings, the financial position of the Company and other factors.

Refer to Notes 1, 8 and 17 to Financial Statements for additional information.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

In 1992, Pentzer's common stock ownership in ITRON was reduced from
approximately 60% to approximately 40% as a result of the issuance of common
stock by ITRON in an acquisition.  Accordingly, beginning in 1992, Pentzer's
share of ITRON's earnings was accounted for by the equity method and was
included in Other Income-Net and its investment in ITRON was reflected on the
balance sheet under Other Property and Investments.  ITRON's initial public
offering in November 1993 and Pentzer's sales of ITRON stock during 1993 and
1994 resulted in a reduction in Pentzer's ownership interest to approximately
14%.  As a result, Pentzer's investment in ITRON, beginning in December 1994,
is accounted for by the cost method.  Therefore, income from ongoing ITRON
operations will no longer be recorded by Pentzer.

The Company purchased natural gas distribution properties in Oregon and
California from CP National Corporation on September 30, 1991.  The 1991
financial information reflects three months of operations of these properties.
Total assets for 1994 include the northern Idaho electric properties purchased
by the Company from PacifiCorp on December 30, 1994.

On July 31, 1990, WIDCo sold its 50% interest in its coal mining properties.
The consolidated financial statements, notes and selected financial data have
been reclassified to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.  The
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations have
been reclassified from those categories and netted into single line items in
the income statements and balance sheets.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company is primarily engaged as a utility in the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy and the purchase,
transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.  Natural gas operations
are affected to a significant degree by weather conditions and customer growth.
The Company's electric operations are highly dependent upon hydroelectric
generation for its power supply.  As a result, the electric operations of the
Company are significantly affected by weather and streamflow conditions and, to
a lesser degree, by customer growth.  Revenues from the sale of surplus energy
to other utilities and the cost of power purchases vary from year to year
depending on streamflow conditions and the wholesale power market.  The
wholesale power market in the Northwest region is affected by several factors,
including the availability of water for hydroelectric generation, the
availability of base load plants in the region and the demand for power in the
Southwest region.  Other factors affecting the wholesale power market include
new entrants in the wholesale market, such as power brokers and marketers,
competition from low cost generation being developed by independent power
producers and declining margins.  Usage by retail customers varies from year to
year primarily as a result of weather conditions, the economy in the Company's
service area, customer growth, conservation, appliance efficiency and other
technology.

The Company intends to continue to emphasize the efficient use of energy by its
customers, increase efforts to grow its customer base, especially natural gas,
and continue to manage its operating costs, increase revenues and improve
margins.  The Company also intends to pursue resource opportunities through
system upgrades, purchases, demand side management and other options that will
result in obtaining electric power and natural gas supplies at the lowest
possible cost.

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.   All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERALL OPERATIONS

Overall earnings per share for 1994 were $1.28, compared to $1.44 in 1993 and
$1.37 in 1992.  The 1994 results include $8.0 million of gains recorded by
Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer) primarily as a result of the sale of stock in
ITRON, Inc. (ITRON).  The 1993 results include gains totaling $12.8 million
recorded by Pentzer as a result of the sale of several investments in its
portfolio and the sale of stock in the initial public offering by ITRON in
November 1993.  The 1992 results include gains of $4.4 million, or $0.09 per
share, due to the issuance of common stock by ITRON in an acquisition and $1.2
million due to the sale of Pentzer's interest in a company involved in power
plant maintenance.  Discontinued coal mining operations contributed $2.4
million to net income, or $0.05 per share, in 1992.

Utility income available for common stock decreased $6.3 million, or 10.2%, in
1994 after increasing $4.0 million, or 7.0%, in 1993.  Utility income available
for common stock contributed $1.03 to earnings per share in 1994, compared to
$1.19 in 1993 and $1.15 in 1992.  Non-utility income available for common stock
from continuing operations increased $0.4 million in 1994 and $5.0 million in
1993 and contributed $0.25 to earnings per share in both 1994 and 1993 and
$0.17 in 1992.

Weather that was 9% warmer than normal during 1994 reduced residential usage
for both electric and natural gas customers.  Income from electric operations
decreased $0.6 million in 1994 over 1993 primarily as a result of a $12.9
million decline in revenues due to decreased KWh sales that was nearly offset
by decreased purchased power expense.  Income from natural gas operations
decreased $0.2 million in 1994, as compared to 1993, due primarily to increased
purchased gas costs that were offset substantially by increased revenues due to
customer growth.  Slightly colder-than-normal weather during 1993 affected both
electric and natural gas operations as compared to 1992.  Income from electric
operations decreased $5.4 million in 1993, as compared to 1992, primarily as a
result of increases in purchased power costs due to thermal plant outages, a
significant short-term sale of wholesale energy, lower hydroelectric generation
due to below normal streamflows and increases in other operating and
maintenance expenses.  Income from natural gas operations increased $6.7
million in 1993 over 1992 due primarily to increased customer usage from the
colder weather and customer growth.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Interest expense increased $2.9 million in 1994 after a decrease of $3.4
million in 1993.  In 1994, $88.0 million in long-term debt was issued, while
$7.5 million of long-term debt matured or was redeemed.  At December 31, 1994,
long-term debt outstanding was $73.9 million higher than at December 31, 1993.
In 1993, $274.1 million of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, while only
$254.1 million was issued.

Preferred stock dividend requirements increased $0.3 million in 1994, primarily
due to higher dividend rates on the Company's Auction Preferred Stock, and $1.5
million, or 22.3%, in 1993 due to the issuance of preferred stock in late 1992.
A redemption of preferred stock in early 1992, which was not replaced until an
issuance later in the year was the primary reason for the reduced preferred
dividend requirement in 1992.

(1) Does not include interest expense or other income.

Electric revenues decreased by 3% in 1994, as compared to 1993, due to a
combination of decreased residential sales and wholesale sales, partially
offset by increased commercial sales and higher wheeling revenues.  Residential
revenues decreased by $7.0 million, despite a 3% increase in customers, due to
warm weather throughout most of 1994.  Residential usage was also affected by
new appliance efficiency and other technology which has decreased customers'
base load requirements.  Commercial revenues increased $5.0 million, or 4%, in
1994, as compared to 1993, due to 3% customer growth and the slightly
warmer-than-normal weather which increased air conditioning load.  Commercial
customers tend to use air conditioning systems at much cooler temperatures than
residential customers, with the result that air conditioning load can be up
within the commercial sector and not within the residential sector, as during
the fall of 1994.  Wholesale revenues decreased $17.2 million during 1994,
compared to 1993, primarily due to a significant short-term sale of wholesale
energy in 1993 which increased wholesale revenues in that period, low
streamflow conditions during 1994 which led to decreased KWh sales and lower
wholesale prices.

Electric revenues increased in all classes for 1993, as compared to 1992, as a
result of customer growth, increased wholesale sales and a slight increase in
customer usage due to colder than normal weather.  As the Company's Demand Side
Management programs have grown, the electric load has become less
weather-sensitive as a result of the shifting of a greater portion of the heat
load to natural gas.  Residential and commercial revenues increased by $12.8
million, primarily as a result of a 3% growth in customers in 1993.  Industrial
sales during 1993 increased by $6.2 million, or 12%, primarily due to increased
KWh sales under a sales agreement with a large customer.  Wholesale revenues
increased by $16.8 million, or 18%, due primarily to a significant sale of
wholesale energy over a six-week period in the first quarter of 1993.

</TABLE>

Warmer-than-normal weather and below-normal streamflow conditions affected 1994
electric operating results.  Hydroelectric generation was 23% below normal,
caused by streamflows which were 65% of normal in 1994.  Fuel costs increased
$4.9 million over 1993 due to increased thermal generation as a result of the
low streamflows in 1994 and shutdowns at thermal plants during 1993 which
decreased fuel expense for that year.  Purchased power costs in 1994 decreased
$12.5 million, or 11%, over levels incurred during 1993, primarily due to
increased purchases during 1993 to complete a significant short-term sale of
wholesale energy and to replace lost thermal generation due to plant outages.
Transmission and distribution costs, which decreased $1.0 million and $2.3
million, respectively, contributed to the $7.3 million, or 11%, decrease in
other operating and maintenance expenses.  Transmission expenses decreased in
1994 over 1993 due to decreased wholesale KWh sales and the associated wheeling
costs.  Distribution expense was lower in 1994, compared to 1993, due to
increased expenses during 1993 for repairs at thermal plants.  In October 1989,
the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) approved the Company's filing for
a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) designed to allow the Company to change rates to
recover or rebate a portion of the difference between actual and allowed net
power supply costs.  Net PCA adjustments, resulting from low hydroelectric
conditions, accounted for $4.1 million of the decrease in other operating and
maintenance expenses from 1993.  Administrative and general expenses increased
by $2.8 million in 1994, compared to 1993, primarily due to labor-related
costs.

Below-normal streamflow conditions and thermal plant outages significantly
affected 1993 electric operating results.  Hydroelectric generation was 11%
below normal, caused by streamflows which were 86% of normal.  Purchased power
increased by $27.1 million, or 30%, in 1993 primarily due to reduced    
hydroelectric generation early in the year, a significant sale of wholesale
energy in the first quarter and to replace lost thermal generation due to plant
outages. Net PCA adjustments accounted for $4.6 million of the increase in
other operating and maintenance expenses from 1992.  Higher levels of purchased
power resulted in higher transmission costs which also contributed to the
increase in other operating and maintenance expenses in 1993 over 1992. 
Shutdowns at thermal generation plants and improved streamflows in the latter
part of 1993 were the primary reasons for the $2.9 million decrease in fuel
costs, and repairs at the plants resulted in an increase of nearly $2.0 million
in other operating and maintenance expenses.

The Company's natural gas business experienced the effects of weather on
operating results in both 1994 and 1993.  In 1994, weather in the Washington
and Idaho service territory was 9% warmer than normal, compared to 5% colder
than normal in 1993.  The Oregon service territory experienced temperatures 6%
warmer than normal in 1994, compared to 8% warmer in 1993.  The 8% growth in
customers in 1994 helped offset the impact of the weather.  Substantial
customer growth of 9% in 1993, along with colder weather, contributed to
increased revenues.

Total natural gas revenues increased in all customer classes except industrial
in 1994 from 1993.  WPNG revenues accounted for an increase of $4.6 million in
overall natural gas operating revenues, as compared to 1993.  In 1994, natural
gas revenues from WWP residential and commercial customers rose by $5.2 million
and $5.9 million, respectively.  The increased revenues were due to customer
growth and higher average prices than in 1993, which were offset in part by
lower usage per customer as a result of warm temperatures.  Much of the
customer growth in the WWP service area during the early part of 1994 was the
result of the Company's emphasis on conversions from electric service to
natural gas.  Recent revisions in the Company's Demand Side Management programs
may lessen the pace of conversions in the future.  During 1994, the Company
sold natural gas on an off-system sales basis.  The revenues from these sales
were offset by like increases in purchased gas expense.  Margins from these
transactions will be credited back to customers through rate changes for the
cost of gas.

Total natural gas revenues increased $37.0 million, or 37%, in 1993.  WPNG
revenues accounted for an increase of $10.1 million, while WWP revenues
increased $26.9 million.  Total therm sales increased by 18% in 1993 due to
customer growth in all service classes except transportation and higher
customer usage due to colder weather in 1993 as compared to 1992.
Approximately 40% of the customer growth in the WWP service area during 1993
was the result of the Company's emphasis on conversion from electric space and
water heating to natural gas through Demand Side Management programs.

A large portion of purchased gas expense is variable costs, with the result
that increases in revenues are offset by like increases in purchased gas
expense.  Natural gas purchased expense increased $19.4 million in 1994 from
1993, primarily due to the increase in therm sales of 32.1 million, or 6%.
Administrative and general expenses increased by $0.9 million in 1994, compared
to 1993, primarily due to labor-related costs.

Natural gas purchased expense increased $23.7 million, or 49%, in 1993 as
compared to 1992, primarily as a result of an increase in therm sales of 76.3
million, or 18%, across all customer classes due to customer growth and colder
weather.  Taxes other than income and income taxes also increased substantially
in 1993 due to increased revenues and income.

Non-utility operations include the results of Pentzer and three other
subsidiary companies.  Pentzer's business strategy is to acquire controlling
interest in a broad range of middle-market companies, to help these companies
grow through internal development and strategic acquisitions, and to sell the
portfolio investments to the public or to strategic buyers.   Pentzer's
objective is to produce current returns from its portfolio investments that are
higher than that of the utility operations and to supplement these current
returns by generating transactional gains through the sale of portfolio
investments when appropriate.  From time to time, a significant portion of
Pentzer's earnings

                                       22
<PAGE>   26
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

contributions may be the result of transactional gains.  Accordingly, although
the income stream is expected to be positive, it may be uneven from year to
year.

Non-utility net income for 1994 was $13.6 million, which was a 3% increase over
1993.  The 1993 net income of $13.3 million was a 60% increase over 1992.  The
increase in 1993 over 1992 was primarily due to transactional gains recorded by
Pentzer during 1993.

Transactional gains of $8.0 million in 1994 declined by $4.8 million as
compared to 1993.  The 1994 transactional gains were primarily the result of
gains of $7.7 million from the sale of ITRON stock.  The 1993 transactional
gains included gains of $7.1 million from the sale of companies involved in
telecommunications, technology and energy and a transactional gain of $5.7
million from the sale of ITRON stock.

Excluding transactional gains, earnings of $5.7 million in 1994 from Pentzer
operations exceeded 1993 earnings by $5.8 million.  For the year ended December
31, 1993, Pentzer had consolidated earnings of $19.7 million before provision
for possible losses.  At the end of the year, Pentzer established a $7.0
million provision for possible write-off of a portion of its investment
portfolio.  The provision was recorded based on the determination that future
cashflows may be lower than expected, impairing the value of certain
investments.  After deducting this provision, Pentzer reported consolidated
earnings of $12.7 million, which represents a 50% increase over Pentzer's 1992
earnings of $8.5 million.  Transactional gains during 1993 totalled $12.8
million compared to $5.6 million in 1992.  In addition to the transactional
gains from ITRON in 1993, Pentzer also recorded a $3.0 million increase in net
income as a result of improved earnings at ITRON and recognized an income tax
benefit of $2.2 million due to tax loss carryforwards in a subsidiary.
Pentzer's return on invested capital increased from 12% in 1992 to 17% in 1993
due, in part, to transactional gains.

Non-utility operating revenues and expenses increased substantially in 1994 as
compared to 1993, and to a lesser degree in 1993 as compared to 1992.  These
increases in both revenues and expenses have been the result of the
acquisitions by Pentzer in 1994 and 1993.  Pentzer acquired two companies in
1994 and three companies in 1993. Income taxes also increased substantially in
1994 due to increased revenues and income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

UTILITY

The Company funds capital expenditures with a combination of
internally-generated cash and external financing.  The level of cash generated
internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates
annually.  Cash provided by operating activities remains the Company's primary
source of funds for operating needs, dividends and construction expenditures.

Operating Activities  Cash from operating activities less cash dividends paid
provided 66% of utility capital expenditures in 1994 as compared to 67% in 1993
and 82% in 1992.  Cash available from operating activities in 1994 declined
from 1993 primarily due to both a reduction in operating income related to
warmer than normal weather and an increase in various working capital
components.  The decline was partially offset by the positive effect of the PCA
mechanism in 1994.  See Note 1 to Financial Statements for additional
information.

Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities increased in 1994 over
1993, despite a 14% decrease in construction expenditures, primarily due to the
acquisition of the northern Idaho properties of PacifiCorp for $33 million.
See Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional information.  Utility
capital expenditures, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC) and Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (AFUCE, a carrying
charge similar to AFUDC for conservation-related capital expenditures), were
$356 million for the 1992-1994 period.

Financing Activities  During the 1992-1994 period, $60 million of long-term
debt matured and $352 million of higher-cost debt and preferred stock was
redeemed and refinanced at lower cost.  In January 1994, the Company received
authorization to issue $250 million in First Mortgage Bonds which are being
issued in the form of Secured Medium Term Notes, Series B (Series B Notes).
During 1994, $7.5 million of long-term debt, with an average interest rate of
8.93% and an average maturity of 5 years, were redeemed and $88 million of
secured long-term debt were issued at an average interest rate of 7.99% and an
average maturity of 9 years.  On March 6, 1995, $15 million of Series B Notes
were issued with an average interest rate of 7.60% and an average maturity of 6
years.  As of March 6, 1995, $157 million of Series B Notes remained to be
issued.

Capital expenditures are financed on an interim basis with notes payable (due
within one year).  The Company has $160 million in committed lines of credit.
In addition, the Company may borrow up to $60 million through other borrowing
arrangements with banks.  As of December 31, 1994, $25 million was outstanding
under the committed lines of credit and $33 million was outstanding under other
short-term borrowing arrangements.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company
eliminated its commercial paper program.

From time to time the Company enters into sale/leaseback arrangements for
various long-term assets which provide additional sources of funds.  See Note 9
to Financial Statements for additional information.

The Company's total common equity increased by $29 million during the year to
$663 million at the end of 1994.  The 1994 increase was primarily due to the
issuance of 1.7 million shares of common stock through both the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan and the Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for
proceeds of $26 million.  No shares were issued under the Company's Periodic
Offering Program in 1994.  The utility capital structure at December 31, 1994,
was 50% debt, 10% preferred stock and 40% common equity as compared to 49%
debt, 10% preferred stock and 41% common equity at year-end 1993.

The Company is restricted under various agreements as to the additional
securities it can issue.  Under the most restrictive test of the Company's
Mortgage, an additional $464 million of First Mortgage Bonds could be issued as
of December 31, 1994.  As of December 31, 1994, under its Restated Articles of
Incorporation, approximately $469 million of additional preferred stock could
be issued at an assumed dividend rate of 9.00%.

During the 1995-1997 period, utility capital expenditures are expected to be
$228 million, and $132 million will be required for long-term debt maturities
and preferred stock sinking fund requirements.  During this three-year period,
the Company estimates that internally-generated funds will average 90% of the
funds needed for its capital expenditure program.  External financing will be
required to fund maturing long-term debt, preferred stock sinking fund
requirements and the remaining portion of capital expenditures.  These
projections relate to the Company on a stand-alone basis and do not reflect any
adjustment for the effects of the proposed merger of the Company, Sierra
Pacific Resources (SPR) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (SPPC) with and into
Resources West Energy Corporation (Resources West).  See below for details.

See Note 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to Financial Statements for additional details
related to financing activities.

NON-UTILITY

Capital expenditures for the non-utility operations were $16 million for the
1992-1994 period.  During this period, $1 million of debt was repaid and
capital expenditures were partially financed by the $9 million in proceeds from
new long-term debt.

The non-utility operations have $43 million in borrowing arrangements ($22
million outstanding as of December 31, 1994) to fund corporate requirements on
an interim basis.  At December 31, 1994, the non-utility operations had $34
million in cash and marketable securities with $13 million in long-term debt
outstanding.

The 1995-1997 non-utility capital expenditures are expected to be $5 million,
and $7 million in debt maturities will also occur.  During the next three
years, internally-generated cash and other debt obligations are expected to
provide the majority of the funds for the non-utility capital expenditure
requirements.

FUTURE OUTLOOK

Merger

In June 1994, the Company, Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power
Company (SPPC), a subsidiary of SPR, and Resources West Energy Corporation, a
newly formed subsidiary of the Company (Resources West), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, as subsequently amended
(Merger Agreement), which provides for the merger of WWP, SPR and SPPC into
Resources West.  SPR and SPPC are both Nevada corporations with headquarters in
Reno.  The Merger Agreement provides that after the effective date of the
merger, Resources West's corporate headquarters offices and principal executive
offices will be located in Spokane and that the headquarters of its Washington
Water Power and Sierra Pacific operating divisions will be in Spokane and Reno,
respectively.  As a result of the Merger Agreement, holders of WWP Common Stock
would receive one share and holders of SPR Common Stock would receive 1.44
shares of Resources West Common Stock, respectively.  Each outstanding share of
Preferred Stock of WWP and SPPC, respectively, will be converted into the right
to receive one share of Resources West Preferred Stock with equal stated value
and dividends and like redemption provisions and rights upon liquidation.

Approval of the proposed merger was obtained from WWP, SPR and SPPC
shareholders at meetings held on November 18, 1994.  The Merger Agreement is
also subject to certain customary closing conditions, including,


                                       25
<PAGE>   29
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

without limitation, the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals,
including approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
state utility commissions of California (CPUC), Idaho (IPUC), Montana (MPSC),
Nevada (PSCN), Oregon (OPUC) and Washington (WUTC).  Applications were filed
with each of the state commissions and the FERC in the third quarter of 1994.
An order was issued by the MPSC on October 17, 1994, stating that they would
not exercise jurisdiction over the proposed merger.  Each of the other five
states has set a separate calendar for filings and hearings.  The FERC has not
yet established a procedural schedule for this proposed merger but it is
expected to be within the same timeframes as the state commissions.  A number
of entities have intervened or expressed their intent to intervene either at
the Federal level or before the various state commissions.  However, the
Company anticipates receiving final orders from all jurisdictions and closing
the merger transaction by the end of 1995.

WWP, SPR and SPPC believe that the proposed merger offers significant strategic
and financial benefits to each of the companies and to their respective
stakeholders including an enhanced competitive position, a larger and more
diverse service territory, an expanded resource base, improved resource
planning and coordination, and cost savings.  Specifically, the Board of
Directors of the Company believes that the merger would afford the following
distinct benefits to the Company and its shareholders over the long term:  (i)
the potential for higher growth in revenues and earnings due to the higher load
growth forecast in SPPC's retail electric service territory in comparison to
the load growth forecast for the area now served by the Company, (ii)
transmission access to additional western markets which would offer increased
opportunities for wholesale power sales, (iii) moderation of future rate
increases through estimated cost savings and increased retail and wholesale
sales, (iv) a significant increase in the proportion of net income available
for common stock represented by core utility cash earnings as opposed to
non-utility earnings and non-cash items, and (v) a lower dividend payout ratio
than the Company might be able to achieve on a stand-alone basis.

The cost savings are estimated to approximate $450 million, net of merger
transaction and transition costs, over a 10 year period following the
consummation of the merger.  The cost savings should be achieved from, among
other things, the integration of corporate management and administrative
functions, the consolidation of distribution operations, the integration of
natural gas purchasing requirements, the reduction of capacity requirements,
the reduction of non-firm transmission expense, the avoidance of expenditures
for operating systems, and the streamlining of inventories and purchasing
economies.  Since there will be an integration of corporate management and
administrative functions, severance options and a voluntary early retirement
plan are being offered to employees of the Company.

The analyses employed in order to develop estimates of specific amounts of
savings to be achieved as a result of the merger were necessarily based upon
various assumptions which involve judgments with respect to, among other
things, future national and regional economic and competitive conditions,
inflation rates, regulatory treatment, weather conditions, financial market
conditions, interest rates, future business decisions, and other uncertainties,
all of which are difficult to predict, and many of which are beyond the control
of the Company, SPR, SPPC and Resources West.  The Company believes that these
assumptions are reasonable for the purpose of the development of estimates of
cost savings but there is no assurance that such assumptions will approximate
actual experience or that all such savings will be realized.  Additionally, the
treatment of the benefits and cost savings will depend on the terms of the
regulatory approvals received in the various jurisdictions in which the Company
and SPPC operate their businesses.

The regulatory plan proposed by the Company and SPPC includes a commitment to
freeze base rates at their current levels in each jurisdiction until at least
December 31, 1999, except for commodity cost increases and a small general
increase in Nevada in 1997 for capital additions previously approved for SPPC
by the PSCN.  Ratemaking and regulation, in general, are anticipated to
continue as before the merger with resources, costs and benefits allocated to
each jurisdiction according to allocation methodologies agreed upon with each
state commission.  If the merger were consummated, the Company would avoid
having to request retail rate increases effective between now and January 2000.
These filings would otherwise be anticipated to request additional annual
revenues of approximately $20 million.  Resources West plans to develop, with
its respective regulatory commissions, a longer-term regulatory plan for
continued merger benefit savings commencing January 2000.

The service territories of WWP and SPPC are not physically connected.  The only
overlap in service territories is the South Lake Tahoe area in California where
the Company provides natural gas service and SPPC provides the electric
service.  Both companies are jointly pursuing transmission access options and
contracts, including Regional Transmission Groups, which will provide for the
necessary interconnections to realize a portion of the expected merger-related
savings.  In February 1995, the Company and SPPC completed negotiations and
have entered into letters of intent with the Idaho Power Company and Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA) to acquire transmission rights between the two
companies.  The letters of intent contemplate new firm transmission purchases
with Resources West having flexibility to exercise certain options in the
future to expand its use of the transmission capabilities.  The


                                       26
<PAGE>   30
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

actual cost of the transmission rights will not vary significantly from that
assumed in the original estimate of merger costs and benefits.  Operational
transmission interconnections are expected to be in place by the time the
proposed merger is effective.

In the event that the merger is not completed due to circumstances beyond the
Company's control, the Company would continue to operate as a separate utility
and expense the merger costs that were incurred.  The Merger Agreement does
provide for the payment of a $25 million termination fee plus expenses to be
made in certain circumstances where one party accepts another business
combination proposal and, as a result, the Merger Agreement is terminated.

See Note 15 to Financial Statements for additional details.

Competition and Business Risk

The electric and natural gas utility businesses continue to undergo numerous
transformations and are becoming increasingly competitive as a result of
economic, regulatory and technological changes.  The Company believes that it
is well positioned to meet future challenges due to its low production costs,
close proximity to major transmission lines and natural gas pipelines, active
participation in the wholesale electric market and its commitment to high
levels of customer satisfaction, cost reduction and continuous improvement of
work processes.  Additionally the Company continually evaluates merger and
acquisition opportunities that will allow it to expand its economies of scale
and diversify its risk posed by weather and economic conditions.

The Company continues to compete for new retail electric customers with various
rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to its
service territories.  Challenges facing the electric retail business include
evolving technologies which provide alternate energy supplies, reduced energy
consumption and the cost of the energy supplied, self-generation and fuel
switching by commercial and industrial customers, the potential for retail
wheeling, the costs of increasingly stringent environmental laws and the
potential for stranded or nonrecoverable utility assets.  If electric utility
companies are eventually required to provide retail wheeling service, which is
the transmission by an electric utility of electric power from another supplier
to a customer located within such utility's service area, the Company believes
it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed to remaining one of
the country's lowest-cost providers of electric energy.  Similarly the Company
does not believe it has much risk for stranded generation, transmission or
distribution assets due to its low cost structure.

The National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) enacted in 1992 addresses a wide range of
issues affecting the wholesale electric business.  The Company believes NEPA
provides future transmission, energy production and sales opportunities to the
Company and complements the Company's commitment to the wholesale electric
business.

The Company continues to compete in the wholesale electric market with other
western utilities, including the BPA.  Business challenges affecting the
wholesale electric business include new entrants in the wholesale market, such
as power brokers and marketers, competition from low cost generation being
developed by independent power producers and declining margins.  However, the
Company's wholesale electric business remains an important part of the
Company's overall business strategy.

Natural gas remains priced competitively compared to other alternative fuel
sources for residential, commercial and industrial customers and is projected
to remain so well into the future due to increasing supplies and competition.
Challenges facing the Company's natural gas business include the potential for
customers to by-pass the Company's natural gas system.  Since 1988 two of the
Company's large industrial customers have built their own pipeline
interconnection.  However, these customers continue to purchase natural gas
services from the Company.  To reduce the potential for such by-pass, the
Company prices its natural gas services, including transportation contracts,
competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price its
transportation and delivery rates by means of special contracts.  The Company
has also signed long-term transportation contracts with two of its largest
industrial customers which minimizes the risks of these customers by-passing
the Company's system in the foreseeable future.

Order 636B adopted by FERC provides the Company more flexibility in optimizing
its natural gas transportation and supply portfolios.  While rate design
changes have increased the costs of firm transportation to low load factor
pipeline customers such as the Company, flexible receipt and delivery points
and capacity releases allow temporarily under-utilized transportation to be
released to others when not needed to serve the Company's customers.  The
Company is also able to optimize its natural gas supply portfolio by engaging
in some off-system sales.

Resource planning for both the electric and natural gas businesses has been
integrated so that the Company's customers are provided the most efficient and
cost-effective products possible for all their energy requirements.  The


                                       27
<PAGE>   31
THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

Company's need for future electric resources to serve retail loads is expected
to remain very minimal.  The Company will be filing electric integrated
resource plans with both the WUTC and IPUC in April 1995.  The switching of
electric heating customers to natural gas requires increased efforts on the
Company's part in negotiating and securing competitively-priced natural gas
supplies for the future.  The 1995 natural gas integrated resource plan reports
were submitted to the WUTC, IPUC and OPUC in January 1995 with acceptance
anticipated by the end of 1995.  The natural gas integrated resource plan is
provided to the CPUC for informational purposes only.

Economic and Load Growth

The Company expects economic growth to increase in its eastern Washington and
northern Idaho service area.  The Company, along with others in the service
area, continues its efforts to expand existing businesses and attract new
businesses to the Inland Northwest.  In the past, agriculture, mining and
lumber have been the primary industries.  However, health care, electronic and
other manufacturing, tourism and the service sectors have become increasingly
important industries that operate in the Company's service area.  In addition,
the Company also anticipates strong economic growth to continue in its Oregon
and South Lake Tahoe, California service areas.

The Company anticipates electric retail load growth to average approximately
1.0% annually for the next five years primarily due to increases in both
population and the number of businesses in its service territory.  Although the
number of electric customers is expected to increase, the average annual usage
by residential customers is expected to continue to decline on a
weather-adjusted basis due to newer technologies, construction and appliance
efficiency standards and continued conversions to natural gas where available.

The Company anticipates natural gas load growth, including transportation
volumes, in its Washington and Idaho service area to average approximately 3.1%
annually for the next five years.  The Oregon and South Lake Tahoe, California
service areas are anticipated to realize 5.1% growth annually during that same
period.  These growth forecasts have increased from the forecasts issued last
year primarily due to fuel switching to natural gas necessitated by more
stringent environmental laws that are being enacted.

Environmental Issues

Since December 1991, a number of species of fish in the Northwest, including
the Snake River sockeye salmon and chinook salmon, the Kootenai River white
sturgeon and the bull trout have either been added to the endangered species
list under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), listed as "threatened"
under the ESA or been petitioned for listing under the ESA.  Thus far, measures
which have been adopted and implemented to save both the Snake River sockeye
salmon and chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any
of the Company's hydroelectric dams.  The Company does, however, purchase power
from four projects on the Columbia River that are being directly impacted by
these ongoing mitigation measures.  The reduction in generation at these
projects is relatively minor, resulting in minimal economic impact on the
Company at this time.  Future actions to save these, and other as yet
unidentified fish or wildlife species, could further impact the Company's
operations or the operations of some of its major customers.  However, it is
currently impossible to predict likely economic costs to the Company resulting
from these actions.

Electro-magnetic field (EMF) exposure, and its potential health hazards,
continues to be an evolving issue facing electrical utilities.  Studies are
continuing by dozens of governmental and scientific agencies but the results to
date are at best conflicting.  Public concerns regarding EMF may cause the
siting and construction of new power lines and substations to be more
expensive.  The Company is unable to determine at this time whether its
operations may be adversely impacted by EMF issues.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS
The accounting records of The Washington Water Power Company (Company) utility
operations are maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and adopted by
the appropriate state regulatory commissions.

BASIS OF REPORTING
The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and, as such,
include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer), Washington Irrigation
and Development Company (WIDCo), The Limestone Company and WP Finance Company.
All material intercompany transactions that are not allowed recovery under
regulation have been eliminated in the consolidation.  As discussed in Note 14,
the 1993 and 1994 operating results for ITRON are no longer consolidated and
were accounted for on the equity method, and as of December 31, 1994 are now
accounted for on the cost method.

The accompanying financial statements include the Company's proportionate share
of utility plant and related operations resulting from its interests in jointly
owned plants (See Note 12).

The financial activity of each of the Company's segments is reported in the
"Schedule of Information by Business Segments."  Such information is an
integral part of these financial statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts related to segment information have been
reclassified due to a current year change in the allocation method for common
plant, plant-related costs and administrative and general expenses.

UTILITY PLANT
The cost of additions to utility plant, including internally developed
information systems, an allowance for funds used during construction and
replacements of units of property and betterments, is capitalized.  Maintenance
and repairs of property and replacements determined to be less than units of
property are charged to operating expenses.  Costs of depreciable units of
property retired plus costs of removal less salvage are charged to accumulated
depreciation.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION
The Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) represents the cost of
both the debt (Interest Capitalized) and equity funds used to finance utility
plant additions during the construction period.  In accordance with the uniform
system of accounts prescribed by regulatory authorities, AFUDC is capitalized
as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited currently as a noncash
item to Other Income and Interest Capitalized (see Other Income below).  The
Company generally is permitted, under established regulatory rate practices, to
recover the capitalized AFUDC and a fair return thereon through its inclusion
in rate base and the provision for depreciation after the related utility plant
has been placed in service.  Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until
the related utility plant is placed in service.

The effective AFUDC rate was 10.67% in 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The Company's
AFUDC rates do not exceed the maximum allowable rates as determined in
accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.

ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED TO CONSERVE ENERGY
The Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (AFUCE) rate recovers carrying
costs associated with Demand Side Management (DSM) program expenditures until
such investment is included in rate base or amortized into rates.  AFUCE is
capitalized as a part of the cost of the DSM investment and is credited
currently as a noncash item to Other Income and Interest Capitalized.  The
AFUCE rate in effect is the last authorized, or otherwise stipulated, rate of
return from the Company's proceeding for natural gas or electric operations.
The rate for Washington is adjusted for the tax effect of interest.  Cash
inflow related to AFUCE does not occur until the related DSM investment is
placed in service.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

DEFERRED CHARGES AND CREDITS    
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with the
provisions of FAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation." FAS No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated company to
reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements. In
certain circumstances, certain costs and obligations, such as incurred costs
not currently recovered through rates but expected to be recovered in the       
future, must be reflected in a deferred account in the balance sheet and not be
reflected in income until matching revenues are recognized.

The primary regulatory assets include Investment in Exchange Power, Demand Side
Management costs, the FAS 109 income tax deferral, the provision for FAS 106,
and unrecovered purchased gas costs. Included in Deferred Charges, Other are
debt issuance and redemption costs, which are amortized over the terms of the
respective debt issues. Deferred credits include the gain on the general office
building sale/leaseback being amortized over the life of the lease.

DEPRECIATION
For utility operations, depreciation provisions are computed by a method of
depreciation accounting utilizing unit rates for hydroelectric plants and
composite rates for other properties.  Such rates are designed to provide for
retirements of properties at the expiration of their service lives.  The rates
for hydroelectric plants include annuity and interest components, in which the
interest component is 6%.  For utility operations, the ratio of depreciation
provisions to average depreciable property was 2.56% in 1994,  2.68% in 1993
and 2.37% in 1992.

POWER AND NATURAL GAS COST ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS
In 1989, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) approved the Company's
filing for a power cost adjustment mechanism (PCA).  The PCA is designed to
allow the Company to change electric rates to recover or rebate a portion of
the difference between actual and allowed net power supply costs.  In 1994 and
1992, the Company deferred $4.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of net
power supply costs, which resulted in like decreases in electric operating
expenses.  In 1993, the Company deferred $4.6 million of net power supply cost
savings, which resulted in like increases in electric operating expenses.  Rate
changes are triggered when the deferred balance reaches $2.2 million.  On
January 1, 1995, a $2.2 million surcharge was implemented for the next twelve
months to recover costs resulting from low streamflow conditions during 1994.
A rate increase was also implemented in November 1992 to pass through
accumulated costs.  As of December 31, 1994, $1.4 million of costs not yet
subject to a rate increase had accumulated in the PCA deferral account.  On
July 18, 1994, the IPUC approved an indefinite extension of the PCA.

Under established regulatory practices, the Company is also allowed to adjust
its natural gas rates from time to time to reflect increases or decreases in
the cost of natural gas purchased.  Differences between actual natural gas
costs and the natural gas costs allowed in rates are deferred and charged or
credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in
rates.

OPERATING REVENUES
The Company accrues estimated unbilled revenues for services provided through
month-end.

INCOME TAXES
The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax
returns.  Subsidiaries are charged or credited with the tax effects of their
operations on a stand alone basis.  The Company's federal income tax returns
have been examined with all issues resolved, and all payments made, through the
1990 return.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share have been computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period.  On November 9, 1993, the Company
distributed, to shareholders of record on October 25, 1993, shares of its
common stock, without par value, under a two-for-one stock split effected in
the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All references to number of shares and per
share information have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split on a
retroactive basis.

CASH
For the purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company
considers all temporary investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company's one involvement with derivative financial instruments is an
interest rate cap agreement effective January 1995, for a three-year period,
that sets a ceiling on the interest rate associated with a lease.  Payments
made under this agreement are being amortized to rent expense.

OTHER INCOME -- NET
Other income-net is composed of the following items:

</TABLE>

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted FAS No. 115, entitled
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  Under FAS
No. 115, investments in debt and marketable equity securities are classified as
"available for sale" and are recorded at fair value.  Investments totalling
$34.1 million and $27.9 million are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
as other property and investments and current assets, respectively.  Unrealized
investment gains, net of taxes, added $14.3 million to the Consolidated
Statements of Capitalization as of December 31, 1994 as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.


NOTE 2. RETIREMENT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  FAS No.  106
requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit
payments during the years the employee provides services.  The Company
previously expensed the cost of these benefits, which are principally health
care, as claims were incurred.  FAS No. 106 allows recognition of the
unrecognized transition obligation in the year of adoption or the amortization
of such obligation over a period of up to twenty years.  The Company elected to
amortize this obligation of approximately $34,500,000 over a period of twenty
years.

The Company has received accounting orders from the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission (WUTC) and the IPUC allowing the current deferral of
expense accruals under this Statement as a regulatory asset for future
recovery.  At such time that rate recovery is requested and allowed, cumulative
deferrals will be amortized over the remainder of the twenty-year amortization
period.  The Company expects to be able to recover the amortized amounts.
Therefore, the Company's cash flows and income from operations are not affected
by implementation of this Statement.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
substantially all of its retired employees.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the
Company recognized $1,270,000, $1,250,000 and $1,290,000, respectively, as an
expense for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits.  The
following table sets forth the health care plan's funded status at December 31,
1994 and 1993.

</TABLE>

The currently assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is 12% for 1994, decreasing
linearly each successive year until it reaches 7% in 1998.  A
one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 1994 and net postretirement health care cost by approximately
$1,552,000.  The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 8.5%.

The Company has a pension plan covering substantially all of its regular
full-time employees.  Some of the Company's subsidiaries also participate in
this plan.  Individual benefits under this plan are based upon years of service
and the employee's average compensation as specified in the Plan.  The
Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount equal to the net
periodic pension cost, provided that such contributions are not less than the
minimum amounts required to be funded under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, nor more than the maximum amounts which are currently deductible
for tax purposes.  Pension fund assets are invested primarily in marketable

(1) The Company has received accounting orders from regulatory authorities 
requiring the Company to defer the difference between pension cost as
determined under FAS 87 and that determined for ratemaking purposes.

NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1993, which supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 11 previously adopted by the Company.  FAS
No. 109 establishes revised financial accounting and reporting standards for
the effects of income taxes.

As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, the Company had recorded net
regulatory assets of $174,349,000 and $177,786,000 related to the probable
recovery of FAS No. 109 deferred tax liabilities from customers through future
rates. Such net regulatory assets will be adjusted by amounts recovered through
rates.  

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) tax credit
carryforwards.  The net deferred federal income tax liability consists of the
following (thousands of dollars):

and $690.0 million, or 107% of the carrying value, respectively.  These
estimates are based on available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies.

banks under two separate credit agreements amounting to $160,000,000.  The
Company has a revolving line of credit expiring December 9, 1997, which
provides a total credit commitment of $70,000,000.  The second revolving credit
agreement is composed of two tranches totaling $90,000,000.  The one-year

per annum on the average daily unused portion of each credit agreement.

In addition, under various agreements with banks, the Company can have up to
$60,000,000 in loans outstanding at any one time, with the loans available at
the banks' discretion.  These arrangements provide, if funds are made

         Company must redeem 100,000 shares at $100 per share plus accumulated
         dividends.  The Company may, at its option, redeem up to 100,000
         shares in addition to the required redemption on any redemption date.

         $6.95, Series K - On September 15, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006,

         right to redeem an additional 17,500 shares on each September 15
         redemption date.

There are $40 million in mandatory redemption requirements during the 1995-1999
period.

In accordance with FAS No. 107 "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments," the fair value of the Company's preferred stock at December 31,
1994 and 1993 is estimated to be $135.1 million, or 100% of the carrying value
and $93.8 million, or 110% of the carrying value, respectively.  These
estimates are based on available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies.


NOTE 8. COMMON STOCK

On November 9, 1993, the Company distributed, to shareholders of record on
October 25, 1993, shares of its common stock, without par value, under a
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  All
references to number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to
reflect the common stock split on a retroactive basis.

In April 1990, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to the
Trustee of the Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Employees of
the Company (Plan) for the benefit of the participants and beneficiaries of the
Plan.  In payment for the shares of Common Stock, the Trustee issued a
promissory note payable to the Company in the amount of $14,125,000.  Dividends
paid on the stock held by the Trustee, plus Company contributions to the Plan,
if any, are used by the Trustee to make interest and principal payments on the
promissory note.  The balance of the promissory note receivable from the
Trustee ($12,266,750 at December 31, 1994) is reflected as a reduction to
common equity.  The shares of Common Stock are allocated to the accounts of
participants in the Plan as the note is repaid.  During 1994, the cost recorded
for the Plan was $2,724,000.  This included the cost for an additional 272,278
shares which were issued for ongoing employee and Company contributions to the
Plan.  Interest on the note payable, cash and stock contributions to the Plan
and dividends on the shares held by the Trustee were $1,195,000, $2,264,000 and
$1,224,000, respectively.

In February 1990, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan, which was
subsequently amended, pursuant to which holders of Common Stock outstanding on
March 2, 1990, or issued thereafter, have been granted one preferred share
purchase right ("Right") on each outstanding share of Common Stock.  Each
Right, initially evidenced by and traded with the shares of Common Stock,
entitles the registered holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
Preferred Stock of the Company, without par value, at an exercise price of $40,
subject to certain adjustments, regulatory approval and other specified
conditions.  The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires
10% or more of the Common Stock or announces a tender offer, the consummation
of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 10%
or more of the Common Stock.  The Rights may be redeemed, at a redemption price
of $0.005 per Right, by the Board of Directors of the Company at any time until
any person or group has acquired 10% or more of the Common Stock.  The Rights
will expire on the earlier of February 16, 2000 and the effective time of the
merger with SPR, SPPC and Resources West.

1,500,000 shares of Common Stock under a Periodic Offering Program (POP).
During 1992, the remaining 1,107,600 shares of the first POP were issued under
this program for net proceeds of $18.0 million.  In the second half of 1992,
the Company received authorization to issue a second 1,500,000 shares of common
stock under the POP.  Through December 31, 1994, 927,600 shares of the second

NOTE 9. LEASES

The Company has entered into several lease arrangements involving various
assets, with minimum terms ranging from eleven months to seventeen years and
expiration dates from 1995 to 2011.  The lease provisions obligate the Company  
to sell on behalf of the lessor or purchase the associated asset at a specified
percentage of the asset's fair value if the lease is not renewed.  Rent expense
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $2.3 million, $1.9
million and $1.8 million, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments
(thousands of dollars) required under operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,
1994 are estimated as follows:

NOTE 10. DISCONTINUED COAL MINING OPERATIONS

Washington Irrigation & Development Company (WIDCo) owned an undivided one-half
interest in coal mining properties near Centralia, Washington, which it
operated and which supplied coal to the Centralia Steam Electric Generating
Plant owned 15% by the Company.  On July 31, 1990, WIDCo sold its 50% interest
in the Centralia coal mining properties for $40.8 million.  Net income of $2.4
million in 1992 resulted from accounting adjustments and a refund of federal
income taxes for years prior to the sale.  The consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to reflect the continuing operations of the
Company.  The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the discontinued
operations have been reclassified from those categories and netted into single
line items for discontinued operations in the Balance Sheets and Income
Statements.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

SUPPLY SYSTEM PROJECT 3

In 1985, the Company and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) reached a
settlement surrounding litigation related to the suspension of construction of
Washington Public Power Supply System (Supply System) Project 3.  Project 3 is
a partially constructed 1,240 MW nuclear generating plant in which the Company
has a 5% interest.  Under the settlement agreement, the Company receives power
deliveries from BPA from 1987 to 2017 in proportion to the Company's investment
in Project 3.

The only material claim against the Company arising out of the Company's
involvement in Project 3, which has been pending since October 1982 in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (District
Court), is the claim of Chemical Bank, as bond fund trustee for Supply System
Projects 4 and 5, against all owners of Projects 1, 2 and 3 for unjust
enrichment in the allocation of certain costs of common services and facilities
among the Supply System's five nuclear projects.  Projects 4 and 5 were being
constructed adjacent to Projects 1 and 3, respectively, under a plan to share
certain costs.  Chemical Bank was seeking a reallocation of $495 million in
costs (plus interest since commencement of construction in 1976) originally
allocated to Projects 4 and 5.

On January 24, 1995, the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
which is intended to settle all remaining claims in the "cost sharing"
litigation.  The other parties to the MOU are expected to include Chemical
Bank, as trustee for the holder of Supply System Projects 4 and 5 bonds; the
Supply System; BPA; certain public utility participants in those projects; and
Puget Sound Power & Light Company (Puget), and Portland General Electric
Company (PGE), Puget and PGE being two of the other three investor-owned
utilities which held minority ownership interests in Project 3.

The MOU provides for the Company to pay $500,000 in settlement of all claims,
and as part of a total $55,000,000 payment to Chemical Bank.  In the MOU, the
Company also agrees to give up any claims relating to the Company's bridge
loans made to the Supply System in 1981.  In exchange, the Company would be
released from all pending cost-sharing litigation claims.  The MOU contemplates
and provides agreement on consolidation of the Project 5 and Project 3 sites
for site restoration purposes, if BPA and the Supply System decide to thus
consolidate the site.  In the event that occurs, the Company would be
completely indemnified from any additional costs by a separate agreement with
BPA.  Under the MOU, the Company's payment to Chemical Bank is due in July,
1995, and it is expected that a final settlement agreement and dismissal of the
litigation will occur before or contemporaneously with that payment.

NEZ PERCE TRIBE

On December 6, 1991, the Nez Perce Tribe filed an action against the Company in
U. S. District Court for the District of Idaho alleging, among other things,
that two dams formerly operated by the Company, the Lewiston Dam on the
Clearwater River and the Grangeville Dam on the South Fork of the Clearwater
River, provided inadequate passage to migrating anadromous fish in violation of
rights under treaties between the Tribe and the United States made in 1855 and
1863.  The Lewiston and Grangeville Dams, which had been owned and operated by
other utilities under hydroelectric licenses from the Federal Power Commission
(the "FPC", predecessor of the FERC) prior to acquisition by the Company, were
acquired by the Company in 1937 with the approval of the FPC, but were
dismantled and removed in 1973 and 1963, respectively.  The Tribe initially
indicated through expert opinion disclosures that they were seeking actual and
punitive damages of $208 million.  However, supplemental disclosures reflect
allegations of actual loss under different assumptions of between $425 million
and $650 million.

Discovery had been stayed pending a decision by the Court on a case involving
some similar issues brought by the Tribe against Idaho Power Company.  The
Court has since decided these issues and has dismissed all claims against Idaho
Power.  The Idaho Power case has now been appealed by the Nez Perce Tribe to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  On November 21, 1994, the Company filed
its Motion and Brief in Support of Summary Judgment of Dismissal.  The Nez
Perce Tribe has filed a reply brief, and has requested oral argument.  No
hearing on the Company's Motion for Summary Judgment has been scheduled by the
Court and the matter is not set for trial.  The Company is presently unable to
assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome in this litigation, or estimate an
amount or range of potential loss in the event of an adverse outcome.

LITTLE FALLS PROJECT

Pending before the U. S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington
is the case of Spokane Tribe of Indians v. WWP, which was filed in 1982.  This
matter involves a claim of the Spokane Tribe of Indians for damages arising out
of the Company's Little Falls Hydroelectric Development that was constructed on
the Spokane River pursuant to a 1905 Act of Congress.  The Tribe claimed the
Company's dam interfered with Indian fishing rights and sought a declaratory
judgment and quiet title to part of the property comprising the Little Falls
Hydroelectric Development.  However, the Company, the Tribe and the Bureau of
Indian Affairs signed a settlement agreement on September 9, 1994.  The
Secretary of the Interior and the Tribe have executed an irrevocable easement
and license to WWP to the property comprising the Little Falls Hydroelectric
Development.  The lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice.    The settlement
agreement provides for an initial payment of $1.0 million to the Tribe plus an
additional $3.2 million to be paid over the next five years for fish and
wildlife enhancement projects. An accrual of $4.2 million was made during June
1994 and is reflected in the Company's financial statements.  Annual payments
will also be made to the Tribe, which will be tied to generation at the Little
Falls Project and escalate at the rate of 4.1 percent per year, with the first
installment of $375,000 expected to be paid by mid-April 1995.

OIL SPILL

The Company recently completed an updated investigation of an oil spill that
occurred several years ago in downtown Spokane at the site of the Company's
steam heat plant.  The Company purchased the plant in 1916 and operated it as a
non-regulated plant until it was deactivated in 1986 in a business decision
unrelated to the spill.  After the Bunker C fuel oil spill, initial studies
suggested that the oil was being adequately contained by both geological
features and man-made structures.  The Washington State Department of Ecology
(DOE) concurred with these findings.  However, more recent tests confirm that
the oil has migrated approximately one city block beyond the steam plant
property.  On December 6, 1993, the Company asked the DOE to enter into
negotiations for a Consent Decree which will provide for additional remedial
investigation and a feasibility study.  The Consent Decree, entered on November
8, 1994, provided for 22 additional soil borings to be made around the site,
which have been completed.  In December 1993, the Company established a reserve
of $2.0 million, and in December 1994 increased it to $3.1 million based on
more current estimates.

FIRESTORM

On October 16, 1991, gale-force winds struck a five-county area in eastern
Washington and a seven-county area in northern Idaho.  These winds were
responsible for causing 92 separate wildland fires, resulting in two deaths and
the loss of 114 homes and other structures, some of which were located in the
Company's service territory.  Four separate class action lawsuits were filed
against the Company by private individuals in the Superior Court of Spokane
County on October 13, 1993.  These suits concern fires identified as Midway,
Golden Cirrus, Nine Mile and Chattaroy.  All of these suits were certified as
class actions on September 16, 1994, and bifurcated for trial of liability and
damage issues by order of the same date.  The Company's Motion for
Reconsideration was denied on October 21, 1994, and a Motion for Discretionary
Review of the Court's decision on certification of class actions was timely
filed with the Washington Court of Appeals (Division III) on November 14, 1994.

The Company was also served with two suits in Spokane County Superior Court
filed on April 20, 1994 and on September 15, 1994, both of which sought 
individual damages from separate fires within the Chattaroy Fire complex.  Five
additional and separate suits were brought by Grange Insurance Company, and
were filed in Spokane County Superior Court on October 10, 1994, for
approximately $2.2 million paid to Grange insureds for the same fire areas.
Two additional class action suits were also filed - one in Lincoln County
Superior Court, filed on October 14, 1994, for a fire known as "Nine Mile West"
(previously included in the Spokane County Nine Mile suit certified as a class
action), and the second in Spokane County Superior Court, filed on October 14,
1994, for the Ponderosa Fire area (which had not been the subject of previous
suit).  Neither of these suits has yet been certified as a class action,
although the Lincoln County suit has been transferred to Spokane County
pursuant to decision of the Lincoln County Superior Court on February 21, 1995.

Complainants in all cases allege various theories of tortious conduct,
including negligence, creation of a public nuisance, strict liability and
trespass; in most cases, complainants allege that fires were caused by electric
distribution lines downed by the wind.  The lawsuits seek recovery for property
damage, emotional and mental distress, lost income and punitive damages, but do
not specify the amount of damages being sought.  Since little discovery has
been conducted and the classes are not yet formed, the Company is presently
unable to assess the

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate an amount or range of potential
loss in the event of an adverse outcome.  The Company was previously presented
with a claim from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
for fire suppression costs associated with five of these fires in eastern
Washington.  The total of the DNR claim was $1.0 million.  On July 22, 1993,
the Company entered into a settlement with the DNR whereby the Company agreed
to pay $200,000 to DNR in full settlement of any and all DNR claims; however,
there was no admission of liability on the part of the Company.

WILLIAMS LAKE LAWSUIT

On February 2, 1995, a lawsuit was commenced in Spokane County Superior Court
against the Company and its subsidiary, Pentzer, by Tondu Energy Systems, Inc.
and T.E.S. Williams Lake Partnership alleging contract violations, conspiracy,
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duties in regard to the 1993 sale of
Pentzer Energy Services, Inc. to B.C. Gas, Inc.  The suit claims damages in
excess of $10 million, plus exemplary damages, prejudgment interest, costs and
attorneys' fees.  Also named as defendants are B.C. Gas, Inc., Inland Pacific
Energy (Williams Lake) Corp. and the former Pentzer Energy Services, Inc.,
subsidiaries involved in the sale, WP Energy Company, WP Energy Canada, Ltd.
and WP Energy Canada (Williams Lake) Ltd.  The claims involve an alleged first
right to purchase interests in the Williams Lake, British Columbia wood-fired
generating station.  Discovery with regard to the lawsuit has not yet
commenced.  The Company and Pentzer intend to vigorously defend against all of
the claims.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

The Company has long-term contracts related to the purchase of fuel for thermal
generation, natural gas and hydroelectric power.  Terms of the natural gas
purchase contracts range from one month to five years and the majority provide
for minimum purchases at the then effective market rate.  The Company also has
various agreements for the purchase, sale or exchange of power with other
utilities, cogenerators, small power producers and government agencies.  For
information relating to certain long-term purchased power contracts, see Note
13.


NOTE 12. JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITIES

The Company is involved in several jointly owned generating plants.  Financing
for the Company's ownership in the projects is provided by the Company.  The
Company's share of related operating and maintenance expenses for plants in
service is included in corresponding accounts in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.  The following table indicates the Company's percentage ownership and
the extent of the Company's investment in such plants at December 31, 1994:

NOTE 13. LONG-TERM PURCHASED POWER CONTRACTS WITH REQUIRED MINIMUM PAYMENTS

Under fixed contracts with Public Utility Districts, the Company has agreed to
purchase portions of the output of certain generating facilities.  Although the
Company has no investment in such facilities, these contracts provide that the
Company pay certain minimum amounts (which are based at least in part on the
debt service requirements of the supplier) whether or not the facility is
operating.  The cost of power obtained under the contracts, including payments
made when a facility is not operating, is included in operations and
maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Information as
of December 31, 1994, pertaining to these contracts is summarized in the
following table:

    operating costs for the year 1994.
(3) Included in annual costs.

Actual expenses for payments made under the above contracts for the years 1994,
1993 and 1992, were $8,717,000 $8,721,000 and $8,433,000, respectively.  The
estimated aggregate amounts of required minimum payments (the Company's share
of debt service costs) under the above contracts for the next five years are
$3,829,000 in 1995, $3,750,000 in 1996, $3,616,000 in 1997, $5,355,000 in 1998
and $5,392,000 in 1999 (minimum payments thereafter are dependent on then
market conditions).  In addition, the Company will be required to pay its
proportionate share of the variable operating expenses of these projects.


NOTE 14. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

During 1994, Pentzer acquired two companies, one involved in bindery services
for the advertising, printing, publishing and direct mail industries and the
other in the design and manufacture of panel saws, panel routers and
accessories.  During 1993, Pentzer acquired three companies, two involved in
financial services and one in point-of-purchase display manufacturing.  Sales
of companies involved in telecommunications, technology and energy services
resulted in transactional gains of $7.1 million in 1993.  At December 31, 1994,
Pentzer had approximately $167 million in assets compared to $130 million at
the end of 1993.

In 1992, Pentzer's common stock ownership in ITRON was reduced from
approximately 60% to approximately 40% as a result of the issuance of common
stock by ITRON in an acquisition.  Accordingly, beginning in 1992, Pentzer's
share of ITRON's earnings was accounted for by the equity method and was
included in Other Income-Net and its investment in ITRON was reflected on the
balance sheet under Other Property and Investments.  ITRON's initial public
offering in November 1993 and Pentzer's sales of ITRON stock during 1993 and
1994 resulted in a reduction in Pentzer's ownership interest to approximately
14%.  As a result, Pentzer's investment in ITRON, beginning in December 1994,
is accounted for by the cost method.

THE WASHINGTON WATER POWER COMPANY

On December 30, 1994, the IPUC approved the transfer of ownership of all
PacifiCorp's electric properties in northern Idaho to the Company.  The cash
purchase price was approximately $33 million.  The Company commenced operations
of the properties on January 1, 1995.  The purchase adds approximately 9,800
customers.  The Company reduced most customers' rates to 1% below PacifiCorp's
current rates and instituted a four-year rate freeze.  At the end of the rate
freeze, rates will be adjusted to the levels then in effect in the Company's
other service areas in northern Idaho.  The Company believes this acquisition
will not have a material impact on its operating revenues or its results of
operations.


NOTE 15. PROPOSED MERGER

In June 1994, the Company, Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power
Company, a subsidiary of SPR (SPPC), and Resources West Energy Corporation, a
newly formed subsidiary of the Company (Resources West) entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of June 27, 1994, as
amended October 4, 1994 which provides for the merger of the Company, SPR and
SPPC with and into Resources West.  The merger is designed to qualify as a
pooling-of-interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes.  Under
this method of accounting, the recorded assets and liabilities of WWP, SPR and
SPPC will be carried forward to the consolidated financial statements of
Resources West at their recorded amounts; income of Resources West will include
income of WWP, SPR and SPPC for the entire fiscal year in which the merger
occurs; and the reported income of the separate corporations for prior periods
will be combined and restated as income of Resources West.

The cost savings from the merger are estimated to approximate $450 million, net
of merger transaction and transition costs, over a 10 year period following the
consummation of the merger.

The following pro forma condensed financial information combines the
historical consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of WWP and SPR
after giving effect to the merger.  The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1994 gives effect to the merger as
if it had occurred at December 31, 1994.  The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of income for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994 give effect to the merger as if it had occurred at
January 1, 1992. These statements are prepared on the basis of accounting for
the merger as a pooling-of-interests and are based on the assumptions set forth
in the paragraph below. The pro forma condensed financial information has been
prepared from, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical
consolidated audited financial statements and related notes thereto of which
this note is a part and SPR's historical consolidated audited financial
statements and related notes thereto included in reports filed by SPR pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act, as amended.  The information contained herein
with respect to SPR and its subsidiaries has been supplied by SPR.  The
information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or
operating results that would have occurred had the merger been consummated on
the date, or at the beginning of the periods, for which the merger is being
given effect, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or
financial position.

Intercompany transactions (including purchased and exchanged power
transactions) between WWP and SPR during the periods presented were not
material and, accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were made to eliminate such
transactions.  For comparative purposes, certain historical amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the pro forma condensed financial statement format.
The $450 million net cost savings estimated to be achieved by the merger are
not reflected in the pro forma financial statements.  All references to per
share information for WWP have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one common
stock split which became effective on November 9, 1993.  Pro forma per share
data and common shares outstanding for Resources West give effect to the
conversion of each share of WWP Common Stock into one share of Resources West
Common Stock and the conversion of each share of SPR Common Stock into 1.44
shares of Resources West Common Stock.

NOTE 17. SELECTED QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

The Company's electric and natural gas operations are significantly affected by
weather conditions.  Consequently, there can be large variances in revenues,
expenses and net income between quarters based on seasonal factors such as
temperatures and streamflow conditions.

A summary of quarterly operations (in thousands of dollars except for per share
amounts) for 1994 and 1993 follows.  All references to number of shares and per
share information have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split on a
retroactive basis.

         order to reflect increases in the cost of living.  Annual Base Salary
         shall not be reduced after any increase thereof.  Any increase in 
         Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other 
         obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans. The
         Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to the
         Company's CEO Incentive Plan and/or Executive Incentive Compensation
         Plan.  The terms of such awards shall be determined by the
         Compensation Committee at the time of grant.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit, savings,
         retirement and welfare plans, practices, policies and programs
         applicable generally to employees and/or other senior executives of
         the Company, except with respect to any benefits under any plan,
         practice, policy or program to which the Executive has waived his
         rights in writing.  The Executive shall be entitled to receive
         pursuant to the Company's Unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement
         Plan, or otherwise, benefits in the amount and at the rate of accrual
         at least as generous as that provided to him at the date hereof.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Board.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period and so
         long as the Executive is employed by the Company, he shall be entitled
         to the following fringe benefits: (A) the Company shall pay the annual
         dues, assessments and other membership charges of the Executive with
         respect to the Executive's membership in the clubs and associations of
         the Executive's choice that are used for business purposes; and (B)
         the Company shall provide not less than thirty-eight (38) days paid
         leave for the Executive pursuant to the Company's One-Leave Program;
         in the case of paragraphs (A) and (B) on a basis substantially
         equivalent to such fringe benefits provided to the Executive in the
         past.  In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to receive fringe
         benefits in accordance with the plans, practices, programs and
         policies of the Company from time to time in effect, commensurate with
         his position and at least comparable to those received by other senior
         executives of the Company.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the conviction of the Executive for the
commission of a felony which, at the time of such commission, has a materially
adverse effect on the Company.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                     (ii)         the change without his consent of the
                 Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities as
                 specified in Section 2(a) of this Agreement;

                    (iii)         the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                     (iv)         any breach by the Company of any other
                 material provision of this Agreement.

                                     -3-

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate his employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)     the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)         in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death, then (a) the Company shall
                 pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to three (3)
                 times the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
                 Termination is given, within thirty (30) days of such Date of
                 Termination or, at the option of the Executive, in
                 installments over a period not to exceed thirty-six (36)
                 months; (b) the Company shall pay to or cause to be paid to
                 the Executive, pursuant to the terms of the respective plans,
                 based on the Executive's Annual Base Salary at the time Notice
                 of Termination is given, the value of all benefits to which
                 the Executive would have been entitled had he remained in the
                 employment of the Company until the end of the Employment
                 Period, under the Company's pension plan(s) supplemental
                 executive retirement plan(s), disability plan(s) and such
                 other benefit plans as may be adopted from time to time during
                 the Executive's employment with the Company; (c) the Company
                 shall continue medical and welfare benefits for the life of
                 the Executive and/or for the life of the Executive's spouse at
                 least equal to those which would have been provided if the
                 Executive's employment had not been terminated (excluding
                 benefits to which the Executive has

<PAGE>   4
                                     -4-

                 waived his rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 senior executives of the Company and their families during the
                 90-day period immediately preceding the Date of Termination
                 or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or his spouse, as
                 in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to
                 other senior executives of the Company and their spouses (but
                 on a prospective basis only unless and then only to the extent
                 such more favorable M&W Plans are by their terms retroactive);
                 provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed
                 (or, in the case of spousal benefits, the spouse is or becomes
                 employed) with another employer and is eligible to receive
                 medical or other welfare benefits under another employer
                 provided plan, the benefits under the M&W Plans shall be
                 secondary to those provided under such other plan during such
                 applicable period of eligibility; provided, however, that
                 these provisions shall not operate to reduce any rights the
                 Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
                 Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal legislation,
                 but shall be in addition to such rights; and (d) with respect
                 to any incentive or similar plan awards, all options shall
                 vest in full and become immediately exercisable, all
                 restrictions shall lapse with respect to restricted stock, and
                 any other types of awards, including but not limited to stock
                 appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares,
                 shall vest in full and become immediately exercisable or
                 payable; provided, however, that if the Executive's
                 entitlement to any of the stock options, restricted stock or
                 other awards referred to above is subject to fulfillment of
                 performance criteria, either corporate or individual, over a
                 performance period, then payment of such awards shall be made,
                 if at all, at the end of the performance period, based upon
                 the achievement of goals for the entire period, prorated from
                 the beginning of the performance period to the Date of
                 Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof with
the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                                     -5-

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(c) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company and that shall not have been or hereafter
have become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the
Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by
the Executive otherwise than by will or laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may
not be amended, modified, repealed, waived, extended or discharged except by an
agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such
amendment, modification, repeal, waiver, extension or discharge is sought.  No
person, other than pursuant to a resolution of the Board or a committee
thereof, shall have authority on behalf of the Company to agree to amend,
modify, repeal, waive, extend or discharge any provision of this Agreement or
anything in reference thereto.

terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4(c) of this
Agreement, or the right of the Company to terminate the Executive's employment

                   AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made and entered
into as of the 24th day of June, 1994, by and between The Washington Water
Power Company, a Washington corporation whose principal place of business is
located at East 1411 Mission Avenue, Spokane, Washington (the "Company"), and
W. Lester Bryan (the "Executive");

                 WHEREAS, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with
the Executive, dated August 5, 1988 (the "Prior Employment Agreement");

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the services of the
Executive for its business and the Executive is willing to continue such
employment; and

                 WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into
this Employment Agreement amending and restating the Prior Employment Agreement
and setting forth the terms and conditions of continued employment;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants herein contained, the sufficiency of such consideration being
expressly acknowledged by the parties, the Company hereby continues employment
of the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts employment upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth:

                 1.       Employment and Term.

                 (a)      The Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, and any successor
thereto, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement for the
period set forth below (the "Employment Period").

                 (b)      The Employment Period shall be for a term of
thirty-six (36) months, commencing on the date of this Agreement, subject,
however, to termination as provided herein.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall serve as an elected executive officer, with
<PAGE>   2
                                     -2-
such authority, duties and responsibilities as are determined from time to time
by the Company for such position with the Company. The Executive's services
shall be performed at the location where the Executive is currently employed;
provided, however, that if the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to
receive all benefits and other amounts described in Section 3(e) hereof.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for his services hereunder to the Company:  until a termination of
employment, pursuant to Section 4, the Company will continue the Executive's
salary, benefits, and incentive award opportunities at levels not less than
those in effect on the date this Agreement was executed, subject to such
reductions as may be required to maintain qualified plan compliance with
applicable federal or state laws.


                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than that paid
         on the date hereof.  Such Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at
         least annually.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
         may from time to time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base
         Salary as the Board deems to be necessary or desirable including
         without limitation adjustments in order to reflect increases in the
         cost of living.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any
         increase thereof.  Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve
         to limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company under this
         Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.  The
         Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to the
         Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The
         terms of such awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee
         at the time of grant.  The Executive shall also be entitled to receive
         benefits pursuant to such supplemental executive programs as are or
         may be established by the Company.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit, savings,
         retirement and welfare plans, practices, policies and programs
         applicable generally to employees and/or other executives of the
         Company, except with respect to any benefits under any plan, practice,
         policy or program to which the Executive has waived his rights in
         writing.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Company.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period,  the
         Executive shall be entitled to receive fringe benefits in accordance
         with the plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company from
         time to time in effect, commensurate with his position and at least
         comparable to those received by other executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to reimbursement from
         the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
         relocation and as preapproved by the Chief Executive Officer or the
         Chief Operating Officer of the Company.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" for termination by the Company shall include, but is
not limited to, acts of theft, embezzlement, fraud, moral turpitude, as well as

                          (i)     material breach of any provision of this
                 Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured by the
                 Executive within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
                 of said breach;

                          (ii)    misconduct as an Executive of the Company,
                 including but not limited to:  misappropriating any funds or
                 property of the Company; attempting to obtain any personal
                 profit from any transaction in which the Executive has an
                 interest which is adverse to the interests of the Company; or
                 any other act or omission which substantially impairs the
                 Company's ability to conduct its ordinary business in its
                 usual manner;

                          (iii)   conviction of a felony; or

                          (iv)    any other acts or omission which subject the
                 Company to public disrespect, scandal, or ridicule.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the Executive not receiving salary increases
                 and incentive awards comparable to those received by other
                 executives in comparable positions with comparable performance
                 evaluations in the current year;

                          (iii)   the diminution without his consent of the
                 Executive's status, working conditions, authority, duties or
                 responsibilities from those in effect on the date of this
                 Agreement;

                          (iv)    the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                          (v)     any breach by the Company of any other
                 material provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate his employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)     the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)         in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death  or Disability, then (a) the
                 Company shall pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to
                 (1) the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement through the end of the Employment Period and (2) one
                 month's salary for each full or partial year of service with
                 the Company with a minimum of twelve (12) months' salary
                 payable under this clause (2), in each case at the rate in
                 effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, within
                 thirty (30) days of such Date of Termination, or, at the
                 option of the Executive, in installments over a period not to
                 exceed thirty-six (36) months; (b) the Company shall continue
                 medical and welfare benefits for the Executive for eighteen
                 (18) months after Termination at least equal to those which
                 would have been provided if the Executive's employment had not
                 been terminated (excluding benefits to which the Executive has
                 waived his rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 executives of the Company and their families during the 90-day
                 period immediately preceding the Date of Termination or as in
                 effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
                 executives of the Company; provided, however, that if the
                 Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is
                 eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
                 another employer provided plan, the benefits under the M&W
                 Plans shall be secondary to those provided under such other
                 plan during such applicable period of eligibility; provided,
                 however, that these provisions shall not operate to reduce any
                 rights the Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code,
                 Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal
                 legislation, but shall be in addition to such rights; and (c)
                 with respect to any incentive or similar plan awards, awards
                 shall be handled as the plan so provides; provided, however,
                 that if the Executive's entitlement to any plan award is
                 subject to fulfillment of performance criteria, either
                 corporate or individual, over a performance period, then
                 payment of such awards shall be made, if at all, at the end of
                 the performance period, based upon the achievement of goals
                 for the entire period, prorated from the beginning of the
                 performance period to the Date of Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof with
the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(b) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company and that shall not have been or hereafter
have become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the
Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may

                 (d)      The Company may withhold from any amounts payable
under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to
be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

                 (e)      The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist
upon strict compliance with any provision hereof or any other provision of this
Agreement or the failure to assert any right the Executive or the Company may
have hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the Executive to
terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4(c) of this
Agreement, or the right of the Company to terminate the Executive's employment
for Cause pursuant to Section 4(b) of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be
a waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this
Agreement.

                 (f)      This instrument contains the entire agreement of the
Executive and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all
promises, representations, understandings, arrangements and prior agreements
are merged herein and superseded hereby.

                 (g)      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event of any payment made to the Executive which is
contingent upon a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company,
or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets, as
described in Section 280G of the Code, or in any regulation promulgated
thereunder, the aggregate amount of such payments, whether or not made pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, shall not exceed an amount equal to the
Executive's Base Amount (as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) and the
regulations thereunder) multiplied by three (3), less one dollar ($1.00).

                   AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made and entered
into as of the 24th day of June, 1994, by and between The Washington Water
Power Company, a Washington corporation whose principal place of business is
located at East 1411 Mission Avenue, Spokane, Washington (the "Company"), and
Nancy J. Racicot (the "Executive");

                 WHEREAS, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with
the Executive, dated May 10, 1991 (the "Prior Employment Agreement");

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the services of the
Executive for its business and the Executive is willing to continue such
employment; and

                 WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into
this Employment Agreement amending and restating the Prior Employment Agreement
and setting forth the terms and conditions of continued employment;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants herein contained, the sufficiency of such consideration being
expressly acknowledged by the parties, the Company hereby continues employment
of the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts employment upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth:

                 1.       Employment and Term.

                 (a)      The Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, and any successor
thereto, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement for the
period set forth below (the "Employment Period").

                 (b)      The Employment Period shall be for a term of
thirty-six (36) months, commencing on the date of this Agreement, subject,
however, to termination as provided herein.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall serve as an elected executive officer, with
<PAGE>   2
                                     -2-
such authority, duties and responsibilities as are determined from time to time
by the Company for such position with the Company. The Executive's services
shall be performed at the location where the Executive is currently employed;
provided, however, that if the Executive is relocated, she shall be entitled to
receive all benefits and other amounts described in Section 3(e) hereof.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for her services hereunder to the Company:  until a termination of
employment, pursuant to Section 4, the Company will continue the Executive's
salary, benefits, and incentive award opportunities at levels not less than
those in effect on the date this Agreement was executed, subject to such
reductions as may be required to maintain qualified plan compliance with
applicable federal or state laws.


                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than that paid
         on the date hereof.  Such Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at
         least annually.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
         may from time to time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base
         Salary as the Board deems to be necessary or desirable including
         without limitation adjustments in order to reflect increases in the
         cost of living.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any
         increase thereof.  Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve
         to limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company under this
         Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.  The
         Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to the
         Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The
         terms of such awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee
         at the time of grant.  The Executive shall also be entitled to receive
         benefits pursuant to such supplemental executive programs as are or
         may be established by the Company.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, she shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit, savings,
         retirement and welfare plans, practices, policies and programs
         applicable generally to employees and/or other executives of the
         Company, except with
<PAGE>   3
                                      -3-


         respect to any benefits under any plan, practice, policy or program to
         which the Executive has waived her rights in writing.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by her in the performance of her
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Company.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period,  the
         Executive shall be entitled to receive fringe benefits in accordance
         with the plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company from
         time to time in effect, commensurate with her position and at least
         comparable to those received by other executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated, she shall be entitled to reimbursement
         from the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
         the relocation and as preapproved by the Chief Executive Officer or
         the Chief Operating Officer of the Company.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" for termination by the Company shall include, but is
not limited to, acts of theft, embezzlement, fraud, moral turpitude, as well as
the following conduct of the Executive:

                          (i)     material breach of any provision of this
                 Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured by the
                 Executive within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
                 of said breach;

                          (ii)    misconduct as an Executive of the Company,
                 including but not limited to:  misappropriating any funds or
                 property of the Company; attempting to obtain any personal
                 profit from any transaction in which the Executive has an
                 interest which is adverse to the interests of the Company; or
                 any other act or omission





<PAGE>   4
                                      -4-


                 which substantially impairs the Company's ability to conduct
                 its ordinary business in its usual manner;

                          (iii) conviction of a felony; or

                          (iv)    any other acts or omission which subject the
                 Company to public disrespect, scandal, or ridicule.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate her employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the Executive not receiving salary increases
                 and incentive awards comparable to those received by other
                 executives in comparable positions with comparable performance
                 evaluations in the current year;

                          (iii)   the diminution without her consent of the
                 Executive's status, working conditions, authority, duties or
                 responsibilities from those in effect on the date of this
                 Agreement;

                          (iv)    the Company requiring the Executive without
                 her consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                          (v)     any breach by the Company of any other
                 material provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate her employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)     the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 her beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of





<PAGE>   5
                                      -5-


                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)  in the event of Termination other than by reason of
                 the Executive's death  or Disability, then (a) the Company
                 shall pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to
                 (1) the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement through the end of the Employment Period and (2) one
                 month's salary for each full or partial year of service with
                 the Company with a minimum of twelve (12) months' salary
                 payable under this clause (2), in each case at the rate in
                 effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, within
                 thirty (30) days of such Date of Termination, or, at the
                 option of the Executive, in installments over a period not to
                 exceed thirty-six (36) months; (b) the Company shall continue
                 medical and welfare benefits for the Executive for eighteen
                 (18) months after Termination at least equal to those which
                 would have been provided if the Executive's employment had not
                 been terminated (excluding benefits to which the Executive has
                 waived her rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 executives of the Company and their families during the 90-day
                 period immediately preceding the Date of Termination or as in
                 effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
                 executives of the Company; provided, however, that if the
                 Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is
                 eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
                 another employer provided plan, the benefits under the M&W
                 Plans shall be secondary to those provided under such other
                 plan during such applicable period of eligibility; provided,
                 however, that these provisions shall not operate to reduce any
                 rights the Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code,
                 Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal
                 legislation, but shall be in addition to such rights; and (c)
                 with respect to any incentive or similar plan awards, awards
                 shall be handled as the plan so provides; provided, however,
                 that if the Executive's entitlement to any plan award is
                 subject to fulfillment of performance criteria, either
                 corporate or individual, over a performance period, then
                 payment of such awards shall be made, if at all, at the end of
                 the performance period, based upon the achievement of goals
                 for the entire period, prorated from the beginning of the
                 performance period to the Date of Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived her rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof with
the Company.  Amounts which are





<PAGE>   6
                                      -6-


vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under
any benefit, plan, policy, practice or program of, or any contract or agreement
entered into after the date hereof with, the Company at or subsequent to the
Date of Termination, shall be payable in accordance with such benefit, plan,
policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly
modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(b) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company and that shall not have been or hereafter
have become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the
Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                   AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made and entered
into as of the 24th day of June, 1994, by and between The Washington Water
Power Company, a Washington corporation whose principal place of business is
located at East 1411 Mission Avenue, Spokane, Washington (the "Company"), and
Jon E. Eliassen (the "Executive");

                 WHEREAS, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with
the Executive, dated August 5, 1988 (the "Prior Employment Agreement");

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the services of the
Executive for its business and the Executive is willing to continue such
employment; and

                 WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into
this Employment Agreement amending and restating the Prior Employment Agreement
and setting forth the terms and conditions of continued employment;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants herein contained, the sufficiency of such consideration being
expressly acknowledged by the parties, the Company hereby continues employment
of the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts employment upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth:

                 1.       Employment and Term.

                 (a)      The Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, and any successor
thereto, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement for the
period set forth below (the "Employment Period").

                 (b)      The Employment Period shall be for a term of
thirty-six (36) months, commencing on the date of this Agreement, subject,
however, to termination as provided herein.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall serve as an elected executive officer, with
<PAGE>   2
                                     -2-

such authority, duties and responsibilities as are determined from time to time
by the Company for such position with the Company. The Executive's services
shall be performed at the location where the Executive is currently employed;
provided, however, that if the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to
receive all benefits and other amounts described in Section 3(e) hereof.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for his services hereunder to the Company:  until a termination of
employment, pursuant to Section 4, the Company will continue the Executive's
salary, benefits, and incentive award opportunities at levels not less than
those in effect on the date this Agreement was executed, subject to such
reductions as may be required to maintain qualified plan compliance with
applicable federal or state laws.


                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than that paid
         on the date hereof.  Such Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at
         least annually.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
         may from time to time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base
         Salary as the Board deems to be necessary or desirable including
         without limitation adjustments in order to reflect increases in the
         cost of living.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any
         increase thereof.  Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve
         to limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company under this
         Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.  The
         Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to the
         Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The
         terms of such awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee
         at the time of grant.  The Executive shall also be entitled to receive
         benefits pursuant to such supplemental executive programs as are or
         may be established by the Company.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit, savings,
         retirement and welfare plans, practices, policies and programs
         applicable generally to employees and/or other executives of the
         Company, except with respect to any benefits under any plan, practice,
         policy or program to which the Executive has waived his rights in
         writing.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Company.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period,  the
         Executive shall be entitled to receive fringe benefits in accordance
         with the plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company from
         time to time in effect, commensurate with his position and at least
         comparable to those received by other executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to reimbursement from
         the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
         relocation and as preapproved by the Chief Executive Officer or the
         Chief Operating Officer of the Company.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" for termination by the Company shall include, but is
not limited to, acts of theft, embezzlement, fraud, moral turpitude, as well as

                                      -3-


                          (i)     material breach of any provision of this
                 Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured by the
                 Executive within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
                 of said breach;

                          (ii)    misconduct as an Executive of the Company,
                 including but not limited to:  misappropriating any funds or
                 property of the Company; attempting to obtain any personal
                 profit from any transaction in which the Executive has an
                 interest which is adverse to the interests of the Company; or
                 any other act or omission which substantially impairs the
                 Company's ability to conduct its ordinary business in its
                 usual manner;

                          (iii) conviction of a felony; or

                          (iv)    any other acts or omission which subject the
                 Company to public disrespect, scandal, or ridicule.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the Executive not receiving salary increases
                 and incentive awards comparable to those received by other
                 executives in comparable positions with comparable performance
                 evaluations in the current year;

                          (iii)   the diminution without his consent of the
                 Executive's status, working conditions, authority, duties or
                 responsibilities from those in effect on the date of this
                 Agreement;

                          (iv)    the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                          (v)     any breach by the Company of any other
                 material provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                                      -4-


                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate his employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)  the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                        (ii)   in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death  or Disability, then (a) the
                 Company shall pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to
                 (1) the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement through the end of the Employment Period and (2) one
                 month's salary for each full or partial year of service with
                 the Company with a minimum of twelve (12) months' salary
                 payable under this clause (2), in each case at the rate in
                 effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, within
                 thirty (30) days of such Date of Termination, or, at the
                 option of the Executive, in installments over a period not to
                 exceed thirty-six (36) months; (b) the Company shall continue
                 medical and welfare benefits for the Executive for eighteen
                 (18) months after Termination at least equal to those which
                 would have been provided if the Executive's employment had not
                 been terminated (excluding benefits to which the Executive has
                 waived his rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 executives of the Company and their families during the 90-day
                 period immediately preceding the Date of Termination or as in
                 effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
                 executives of the Company; provided, however, that if the
                 Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is
                 eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
                 another employer provided plan, the benefits under the M&W
                 Plans shall be secondary to those provided under such other
                 plan during such applicable period of eligibility; provided,
                 however, that these provisions shall not operate to reduce any
                 rights the Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code,
                 Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal
                 legislation, but shall be in addition to such rights; and (c)
                 with respect to any incentive or similar plan awards, awards
                 shall be handled as the plan so provides; provided, however,
                 that if the Executive's entitlement to any plan award is
                 subject to fulfillment of performance criteria, either
                 corporate or individual, over a performance period, then
                 payment of such awards shall be made, if at all, at the end of
                 the performance period, based upon the achievement of goals
                 for the entire period, prorated from the beginning of the
                 performance period to the Date of Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof with
the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(b) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company and that shall not have been or hereafter
have become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the
Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may

                   AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                 AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made and entered
into as of the 24th day of June, 1994, by and between The Washington Water
Power Company, a Washington corporation whose principal place of business is
located at East 1411 Mission Avenue, Spokane, Washington (the "Company"), and
Robert D. Fukai (the "Executive");

                 WHEREAS, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with
the Executive, dated August 5, 1988 (the "Prior Employment Agreement");

                 WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue the services of the
Executive for its business and the Executive is willing to continue such
employment; and

                 WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to enter into
this Employment Agreement amending and restating the Prior Employment Agreement
and setting forth the terms and conditions of continued employment;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants herein contained, the sufficiency of such consideration being
expressly acknowledged by the parties, the Company hereby continues employment
of the Executive and the Executive hereby accepts employment upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth:

                 1.       Employment and Term.

                 (a)      The Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the
Executive agrees to remain in the employ of the Company, and any successor
thereto, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement for the
period set forth below (the "Employment Period").

                 (b)      The Employment Period shall be for a term of
thirty-six (36) months, commencing on the date of this Agreement, subject,
however, to termination as provided herein.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall serve as an elected executive officer, with
<PAGE>   2
                                     -2-


such authority, duties and responsibilities as are determined from time to time
by the Company for such position with the Company. The Executive's services
shall be performed at the location where the Executive is currently employed;
provided, however, that if the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to
receive all benefits and other amounts described in Section 3(e) hereof.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for his services hereunder to the Company:  until a termination of
employment, pursuant to Section 4, the Company will continue the Executive's
salary, benefits, and incentive award opportunities at levels not less than
those in effect on the date this Agreement was executed, subject to such
reductions as may be required to maintain qualified plan compliance with
applicable federal or state laws.


                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than that paid
         on the date hereof.  Such Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at
         least annually.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board")
         may from time to time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base
         Salary as the Board deems to be necessary or desirable including
         without limitation adjustments in order to reflect increases in the
         cost of living.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any
         increase thereof.  Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve
         to limit or reduce any other obligation of the Company under this
         Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.  The
         Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to the
         Company's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").  The
         terms of such awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee
         at the time of grant.  The Executive shall also be entitled to receive
         benefits pursuant to such supplemental executive programs as are or
         may be established by the Company.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit, savings,
         retirement and welfare plans, practices, policies and programs
         applicable generally to employees and/or other executives of the
         Company, except with respect to any benefits under any plan, practice,
         policy or program to which the Executive has waived his rights in
         writing.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Company.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period,  the
         Executive shall be entitled to receive fringe benefits in accordance
         with the plans, practices, programs and policies of the Company from
         time to time in effect, commensurate with his position and at least
         comparable to those received by other executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to reimbursement from
         the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
         relocation and as preapproved by the Chief Executive Officer or the
         Chief Operating Officer of the Company.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" for termination by the Company shall include, but is
not limited to, acts of theft, embezzlement, fraud, moral turpitude, as well as
the following conduct of the Executive:

                                      -3-


                          (i)     material breach of any provision of this
                 Agreement, which breach shall not have been cured by the
                 Executive within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
                 of said breach;

                          (ii)    misconduct as an Executive of the Company,
                 including but not limited to:  misappropriating any funds or
                 property of the Company; attempting to obtain any personal
                 profit from any transaction in which the Executive has an
                 interest which is adverse to the interests of the Company; or
                 any other act or omission which substantially impairs the
                 Company's ability to conduct its ordinary business in its
                 usual manner;

                          (iii)   conviction of a felony; or

                          (iv)    any other acts or omission which subject the
                 Company to public disrespect, scandal, or ridicule.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the Executive not receiving salary increases
                 and incentive awards comparable to those received by other
                 executives in comparable positions with comparable performance
                 evaluations in the current year;

                          (iii)   the diminution without his consent of the
                 Executive's status, working conditions, authority, duties or
                 responsibilities from those in effect on the date of this
                 Agreement;

                          (iv)    the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                          (v)     any breach by the Company of any other
                 material provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet

                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)         in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death  or Disability, then (a) the
                 Company shall pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to
                 (1) the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement through the end of the Employment Period and (2) one
                 month's salary for each full or partial year of service with
                 the Company with a minimum of twelve (12) months' salary
                 payable under this clause (2), in each case at the rate in
                 effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, within
                 thirty (30) days of such Date of Termination, or, at the
                 option of the Executive, in installments over a period not to
                 exceed thirty-six (36) months; (b) the Company shall continue
                 medical and welfare benefits for the Executive for eighteen
                 (18) months after Termination at least equal to those which
                 would have been provided if the Executive's employment had not
                 been terminated (excluding benefits to which the Executive has
                 waived his rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 executives of the Company and their families during the 90-day
                 period immediately preceding the Date of Termination or as in
                 effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
                 executives of the Company; provided, however, that if the
                 Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is
                 eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
                 another employer provided plan, the benefits under the M&W
                 Plans shall be secondary to those provided under such other
                 plan during such applicable period of eligibility; provided,
                 however, that these provisions shall not operate to reduce any
                 rights the Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code,
                 Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal
                 legislation, but shall be in addition to such rights; and (c)
                 with respect to any incentive or similar plan awards, awards
                 shall be handled as the plan so provides; provided, however,
                 that if the Executive's entitlement to any plan award is
                 subject to fulfillment of performance criteria, either
                 corporate or individual, over a performance period, then
                 payment of such awards shall be made, if at all, at the end of
                 the performance period, based upon the achievement of goals
                 for the entire period, prorated from the beginning of the
                 performance period to the Date of Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof with
the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(b) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company and that shall not have been or hereafter
have become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the
Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may
not be amended, modified, repealed, waived, extended or discharged except by an
agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of

No person, other than pursuant to a resolution of the Board or a committee

or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets, as
described in Section 280G of the Code, or in any regulation promulgated
thereunder, the aggregate amount of such payments, whether or not made pursuant

                        1994 CEO Incentive Stock Plan

The CEO of WWP will be granted 2000 shares of WWP stock for each five cents of
increased corporate earnings starting at $1.38 and going up to and including
$1.63 in earnings. When the corporate earnings reach $1.65, additional 22,000
shares of WWP stock will be granted.

Earnings must be expected to continue (e.g. a one time sale, such as WIDCo,
would be excluded). If earnings go up one year, down the next, and up again
the next year, additional shares will not be granted. Each 5-cent increment may
only be rewarded the first time it is achieved.

This incentive is for the current CEO only and may be modified by Board of
Directors as deemed necessary and appropriate.

                        $1.48                   2,000
                        $1.53                   2,000

                        $1.63                   2,000

                        $1.65                  22,000

        Maximum Opportunity             34,000 shares of stock

Example:        If earnings reach $1.48 in 1994, the reward would be 2,000 
                        shares.
                        
                If earnings reach $1.65 in 1995, the reward would be 30,000
                        shares.

                 (a)      The Corporations and any successor thereto, agree, on

terminate and be of no force and effect.  As a condition to the Merger, the
parties hereto agree that the Company shall be responsible for all the
promises, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  From the Effective Date until
January 1, 1999, the Executive shall serve as the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") (assuming the Executive has been elected
to the Board by the shareholders) and the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company; provided, however, that the Executive shall continue to serve as
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer after January 1, 1999 until
January 1, 2002 if Walter M. Higgins, who commencing on the Effective Date will
serve as Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company
and the Chief Executive Officer of the Washington Water Power and Sierra
Pacific operating divisions, does not become Chief Executive Officer of the
Company on January 1, 1999.  Unless the Executive elects not to continue in the
employment of the Company, the Executive shall continue to serve as the
Chairman of the Board from January 1, 1999 until January 1, 2002 (assuming the
Executive has been elected to the Board by the shareholders).  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall have such authority, duties and
responsibilities as are set forth in Annex A hereto.  Such titles, authority,
duties and responsibilities may be changed from time to time only by mutual
written agreement of the parties.  The Executive's services shall be performed
at the location where the Executive is currently employed.  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall also continue to serve as Chairman of
the Board of each of the Company's subsidiary corporations.

                 (b)      Commencing on the Effective Date until January 1,
2002 (or January 1, 1999 if the Executive elects not to continue to serve), the
Company shall in connection with any annual meeting of shareholders of the
Company at which the Executive's class of Directors is to be elected cause the
Executive to be nominated as a director of the Company.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for his services hereunder to the Company:

                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than the
         Executive's base salary as of the Effective Date. Such Annual Base
         Salary shall be reviewed at least annually. The Board may from time to
         time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base Salary as the Board
         deems to be necessary or desirable including without limitation
         adjustments in order to reflect increases in the cost of living.
         Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any increase thereof.
         Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce
         any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.
         Subject to shareholder approval of the Plan, and after the Effective
         Date, the Executive shall be entitled to receive awards pursuant to
         the Company's Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") (the
         Sierra Pacific Resources Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan, adopted
         in 1994, and assumed by the Company pursuant to the merger).  The
         terms of such awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee
         at the time of grant.

                 During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is
         employed by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all
         incentive, stock option, restricted stock, performance unit or share,
         savings, retirement, insurance and welfare plans, practices, policies
         and programs applicable generally to employees and/or other senior
         executives of the Company, except with respect to any benefits under
         any plan, practice, policy or program to which the Executive has
         waived his rights in writing.  The Executive shall be entitled to
         receive pursuant to a supplemental executive retirement plan to be
         adopted by the Company, or otherwise, benefits in the amount and at
         the rate of accrual at least as generous as that provided to him at
         the date hereof pursuant to The Washington Water Power Company
         Unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Board.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period and so
         long as the Executive is employed by the Company, he shall be entitled
         to the following fringe benefits: (A) the Company shall pay the annual
         dues, assessments and other membership charges of the Executive with
         respect to the Executive's membership in the clubs and associations of
         the Executive's choice that are used for business purposes; and (B)
         the Company shall provide not less than thirty-eight (38) days paid
         leave for the Executive pursuant to the Company's One-Leave Program
         (The Washington Water Power One-Leave Program currently in effect and
         assumed, or replaced by a similar plan, by the Company pursuant to the
         Merger); in the case of paragraphs (A) and (B) on a basis
         substantially equivalent to such fringe benefits provided to the
         Executive in the past. In addition, the Executive shall be entitled to
         receive fringe benefits in accordance with the plans, practices,
         programs and policies of the Company from time to time in effect,
         commensurate with his position and at least comparable to those
         received by other senior executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated, he shall be entitled to reimbursement from
         the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
         relocation.

                 4.       Termination of Employment.

                 (a)      Death.  The Executive's employment shall terminate
automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.

                 (b)      By the Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate
the Executive's employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the conviction of the Executive for the
commission of a felony which, at the time of such commission, has a materially
adverse effect on the Company.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the change without his consent of the
                 Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities as
                 specified in Section 2(a) of this Agreement;

                          (iii)   the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed; or

                          (iv)    any breach by the Corporations or the Company
                 of any other material provision of this Agreement.

                                      -4-



                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes
to a showing of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of
the Executive or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company other than for Cause or for Disability, the Date of Termination shall
be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination,
and (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the
Date of Termination shall be the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate his employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)     the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within
                 thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination; the amount
                 referred to in clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to
                 the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)         in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death, then (a) the Company shall
                 pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to three (3)
                 times the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
                 Termination is given, within thirty (30) days of such Date of
                 Termination or, at the option of the Executive, in
                 installments over a period not to exceed thirty-six (36)
                 months; (b) the Company shall pay to or cause to be paid to
                 the Executive, pursuant to the terms of the respective plans,
                 based on the Executive's Annual Base Salary at the time Notice
                 of Termination is given, the value of all benefits to which
                 the Executive would have been entitled had he remained in the
                 employment of the Company until the end of the Employment
                 Period, under the Company's pension plan(s), supplemental
                 executive retirement plan(s), disability plan(s) and such
                 other benefit plans as may be adopted from time to time during
                 the Executive's employment with the Company; (c) the Company
                 shall continue medical and welfare benefits for the life of
                 the Executive and/or for the life of the Executive's spouse at
                 least equal to those which would have been provided if the
                 Executive's employment had not been terminated (excluding
                 benefits to which the Executive has waived his rights in
                 writing), such benefits to be in accordance with the most
                 favorable medical and welfare benefit plans, practices,
                 programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of the Company as

                                      -5-



                 in effect and applicable generally to other senior executives
                 of the Company and their families during the 90-day period
                 immediately preceding the Date of Termination or, if more
                 favorable to the Executive and/or his spouse, as in effect
                 generally at any time thereafter with respect to other senior
                 executives of the Company and their spouses (but on a
                 prospective basis only unless and then only to the extent such
                 more favorable M&W Plans are by their terms retroactive);
                 provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed
                 (or, in the case of spousal benefits, the spouse is or becomes
                 employed) with another employer and is eligible to receive
                 medical or other welfare benefits under another employer
                 provided plan, the benefits under the M&W Plans shall be
                 secondary to those provided under such other plan during such
                 applicable period of eligibility; provided, however, that
                 these provisions shall not operate to reduce any rights the
                 Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of
                 Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal legislation,
                 but shall be in addition to such rights; and (d) with respect
                 to any incentive or similar plan awards, all options shall
                 vest in full and become immediately exercisable, all
                 restrictions shall lapse with respect to restricted stock, and
                 any other types of awards, including but not limited to stock
                 appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares,
                 shall vest in full and become immediately exercisable or
                 payable; provided, however, that if the Executive's
                 entitlement to any of the stock options, restricted stock or
                 other awards referred to above is subject to fulfillment of
                 performance criteria, either corporate or individual, over a
                 performance period, then payment of such awards shall be made,
                 if at all, at the end of the performance period, based upon
                 the achievement of goals for the entire period, prorated from
                 the beginning of the performance period to the Date of
                 Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the Effective Date
with the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(c) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company, the Corporations or any of their
affiliated companies and that shall not have been or hereafter have become
public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the
Executive in
<PAGE>   7
                                      -7-



violation of this Agreement).  During the Employment Period, the Executive
shall not, without the prior consent of the Company or as may otherwise be
required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information,
knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Corporations or the Company, as the
case may be, shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or
laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Corporations, the Company and their respective successors and
assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may
not be amended, modified, repealed, waived, extended or discharged except by an

amendment, modification, repeal, waiver, extension or discharge is sought.  No
person, other than pursuant to a resolution of the Board or a committee
thereof, shall have authority on behalf of the Corporations or the Company to

                 WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter into this Agreement, as
of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined), setting forth the terms and
conditions for the employment relationship of the Executive with the Company
during the Employment Period (as hereinafter defined);

                 NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                 1.       Employment and Term.

                 (a)      The Corporations and any successor thereto, agree, on

remain in the employ of SPR, SPPC and the Company, as the successor to SPR and
SPPC, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement for the

                 (b)      The Employment Period shall commence as of the
consummation date (the "Effective Date") of the merger (the "Merger") pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement and shall continue until the close of

is terminated, then, at the time of such termination, this Agreement shall be
deemed canceled and of no force or effect.  As a condition to the Merger, the
parties hereto agree that the Company shall be responsible for all the
promises, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                 2.       Duties and Powers of Executive.

                 (a)      Position; Location.  From the Effective Date until

operating divisions.  Effective January 1, 1999 (or on such earlier date as
Paul Redmond shall no longer continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of
the Company) until January 1, 2002, the Executive shall serve as Vice Chairman
of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as Chief
Executive Officer of the Washington Water Power and Sierra Pacific operating
divisions.  If elected by the Board, effective January 1, 2002 until December
31, 2005, the Executive shall serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer.  During the Employment Period, the Executive shall have such
authority, duties and responsibilities as are set forth for the positions he
then holds in Annex A hereto.  Such titles, authority, duties and
responsibilities may be changed from time to time only by mutual written
agreement of the parties.  The Executive's services shall be performed at the
location where the Executive is currently employed; provided, however, that if
the Executive is relocated to Spokane, he shall be entitled to receive all
benefits and other amounts described in Section 3(e) hereof.

                 (b)      Commencing on the Effective Date until the end of the
Employment Period, the Company shall in connection with any annual meeting of
shareholders of the Company at which the Executive's class of Directors is to
be elected cause the Executive to be nominated as a director of the Company.

                 3.       Compensation and Benefits.

                 The Executive shall receive the following compensation and
benefits for his services hereunder to the Company:

                 (a)      Salary. The Executive's annual base salary ("Annual
         Base Salary"), payable not less often than monthly in equal
         installments, shall be at the annual rate of not less than the
         Executive's base salary as of the Effective Date. Such Annual Base
         Salary shall be reviewed at least annually. The Board may from time to
         time direct such upward adjustments in Annual Base Salary as the Board
         deems to be necessary or desirable including without limitation
         adjustments in order to reflect increases in the cost of living and
         the planned increases in the Executive's responsibilities.  Annual
         Base Salary shall not be reduced after any increase thereof.  Any
         increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any
         other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

                 (b)      Incentive, Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plans.
         During the Employment Period and so long as the Executive is employed
         by the Company, he shall be eligible to participate in all incentive,
         stock option, restricted stock, performance unit or share, savings,
         retirement, insurance and welfare plans, practices, policies and
         programs applicable generally to employees and/or other senior
         executives of the Company, except with respect to any benefits under
         any plan, practice, policy or program to which the Executive has
         waived his rights in writing.

                 (c)      Business Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay or
         reimburse the Executive for all expenses, including those for travel
         and entertainment, properly incurred by him in the performance of his
         duties hereunder in accordance with policies established from time to
         time by the Board.

                 (d)      Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period and so
         long as the Executive is employed by the Company, he shall be entitled
         to the following fringe benefits: (A) the Company shall pay the annual
         dues, assessments and other membership charges of the Executive with
         respect to the Executive's membership in the clubs and associations of
         the Executive's choice that are used for business purposes; and (B)
         the Company shall provide a one-time credit for 25 days paid leave for
         the Executive pursuant to the Company's One- Leave Program (The
         Washington Water Power One-Leave Program currently in effect and
         assumed, or replaced by a similar plan, by the Company pursuant to the
         Merger), further annual paid leave to accrue in accordance with the
         terms of the One-Leave Program; in the case of paragraph (A) on a
         basis substantially equivalent to such fringe benefits provided to the
         Executive in the past.  In addition, the Executive shall be entitled
         to receive fringe benefits in accordance with the plans, practices,
         programs and policies of the Company from time to time in effect,
         commensurate with his position and at least comparable to those
         received by other senior executives of the Company.

                 (e)      Relocation Benefits.  If during the Employment Period
         the Executive is relocated to Spokane, he shall be entitled to
         reimbursement from the Company for reasonable expenses incurred in
         connection with the relocation.

                 (f)      Other Compensation.  If as a result of the
         performance of his duties hereunder, the Executive loses the right to
         receive any non-qualified vested pension benefits to which he is
         entitled on the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay him
         an amount equal to the difference between what he received from such
         non-qualified pension plan and what he would have received had he not
         been penalized under any such plan's covenant not to compete.

                          (i)     material breach of any provision of this

                 Executive within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice
                 of said breach;

                 including but not limited to:  misappropriating any funds or
                 property of the Company; attempting to obtain any personal
                 profit from any transaction in which the Executive has an
                 interest which is adverse to the interests of the Company; or
                 any other act or omission which substantially impairs the
                 Company's ability to conduct its ordinary business in its
                 usual manner;

                          (iii)   conviction of a felony; or

                          (iv)    any other acts or omission which subject the
                 Company to public disrespect, scandal, or ridicule.

                 (c)      By the Executive for Good Reason.  The Executive may
terminate his employment during the Employment Period for Good Reason.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                          (i)     the reduction in the Executive's Annual Base
                 Salary as specified in Section 3(a) of this Agreement or any
                 other benefit or payment described in Section 3 of this
                 Agreement;

                          (ii)    the change without his consent of the
                 Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities, or
                 the timing thereof, as specified in Section 2(a) of this
                 Agreement;

                          (iii)   the Company requiring the Executive without
                 his consent to be based at any office or location other than
                 the location where the Executive is currently employed or
                 Spokane; or

                          (iv)    any breach by the Corporations or the Company
                 of any other material provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      By the Company for Disability.  The Company may
terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period in the event
of the Executive's Permanent and Total Disability ("Disability") as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                 (e)      Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause, by the Company for Disability or by the Executive for Good
Reason shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 10(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the
extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination  of the Executive's employment under
the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined in
Section 4(f)) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
termination date (which date shall be not more than 30 days after the giving of
such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the
Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing
of Good Reason, Disability or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive
or the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the
Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.

                 (f)      Date of Termination.  "Date of Termination" means (i)
if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, by the
Company for Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of
receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as
the case may be, (ii) if the





<PAGE>   4
                                      -4-



Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or for
Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company
notifies the Executive of such termination, and (iii) if the Executive's
employment is terminated by reason of death, the Date of Termination shall be
the date of death.

                 5.       Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

                 (a)      Termination Other Than for Cause.  During the
Employment Period, if the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
(other than in the case of a termination for Cause), or if the Executive shall
terminate his employment for Good Reason or if the Executive's employment shall
terminate by reason of death (termination in any such case referred to as
"Termination");

                          (i)     the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
                 his beneficiary) a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
                 (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of
                 Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) all
                 incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not yet
                 paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal
                 year in which the Date of Termination occurred, (3) any
                 compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
                 with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) and (4) any
                 accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, to the extent
                 not theretofore paid.  (The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2), (3) and (4) shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                 "Accrued Obligations"). The amounts specified in clauses (1),
                 (2) and (4) of this Section 5(a)(i) shall be paid within 30
                 days after the Date of Termination; the amount referred to in
                 clause (3), if any, will be paid pursuant to the terms of the
                 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan; and

                     (ii)         in the event of Termination other than by
                 reason of the Executive's death, then (a) the Company shall
                 pay to the Executive an amount in cash equal to three (3)
                 times the Annual Base Salary described in Section 3(a) of this
                 Agreement, at the rate in effect at the time Notice of
                 Termination is given, within thirty (30) days of such Date of
                 Termination or, at the option of the Executive, in
                 installments over a period not to exceed thirty-six (36)
                 months; (b) the Company shall pay to or cause to be paid to
                 the Executive, pursuant to the terms of the respective plans,
                 based on the Executive's Annual Base Salary at the time Notice
                 of Termination is given, the value of all benefits to which
                 the Executive would have been entitled had he remained in the
                 employment of the Company until the end of the Employment
                 Period, under the Company's pension plan(s), supplemental
                 executive retirement plan(s), disability plan(s) and such
                 other benefit plans as may be adopted from time to time during
                 the Executive's employment with the Company; (c) the Company
                 shall continue medical and welfare benefits to the Executive
                 and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which
                 would have been provided if the Executive's employment had not
                 been terminated (excluding benefits to which the Executive has
                 waived his rights in writing), such benefits to be in
                 accordance with the most favorable medical and welfare benefit
                 plans, practices, programs or policies (the "M&W Plans") of
                 the Company as in effect and applicable generally to other
                 senior executives of the Company and their families during the
                 90-day period immediately preceding the Date of Termination
                 or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally
                 at any time thereafter with respect to other senior executives
                 of the Company (but on a prospective basis only unless and
                 then only to the extent such more favorable M&W Plans are by
                 their terms retroactive); provided, however, that if the
                 Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is
                 eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under
                 another employer provided plan, the benefits under the M&W
                 Plans shall be secondary to those provided under such other
                 plan during such applicable period of eligibility; provided,
                 however, that these provisions shall not operate to reduce any
                 rights the Executive may have under Section 4980B of the Code,
                 Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other state or federal
                 legislation, but shall be in addition to such rights; and (d)
                 with respect to any incentive or similar plan awards, all
                 options shall vest in full and become immediately exercisable,
                 all restrictions shall lapse with respect to restricted stock,
                 and any other types of awards, including but not limited to
                 stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance
                 shares, shall vest in full and become immediately exercisable
                 or payable; provided, however, that if the Executive's
                 entitlement to any of the stock options, restricted stock or
                 other awards referred to above is subject to fulfillment of
                 performance criteria, either corporate or individual, over a
                 performance period, then payment of such awards shall be made,
                 if at all, at the end of the performance period, based upon
                 the achievement of goals for the entire period, prorated from
                 the beginning of the performance period to the Date of
                 Termination.

                 (b)      Termination by the Company for Cause or by the
Executive Other than for Good Reason.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated for Cause
during the Employment Period, or if the Executive terminates employment during
the Employment Period other than a termination for Good Reason, the Company
shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement other
than the obligation to pay to the Executive Annual Base Salary through the Date
of Termination, all incentive or other compensation, if any, awarded but not
yet paid with respect to fiscal years ending prior to the fiscal year in which
the Date of Termination occurred, the amount of any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued interest or earnings
thereon), any accrued leave pursuant to the One-Leave Program, and whatever
benefits the Executive may be entitled to under the Company's benefit plans, in
each case to the extent theretofore unpaid.

                 (c)      Any payments made pursuant to this Section 5 shall be
subject to the limits, to the extent applicable, set forth in Section 10(g)
hereof.

                 6.       Non-exclusivity of Rights.

                 Except as provided in Section 10(g) hereof, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future
participation in any benefit, plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company and for which the Executive may qualify (except with respect to any
benefit to which the Executive has waived his rights in writing), nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have
under any other contract or agreement entered into after the Effective Date
with the Company.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any benefit, plan, policy, practice or
program of, or any contract or agreement entered into after the date hereof
with, the Company at or subsequent to the Date of Termination, shall be payable
in accordance with such benefit, plan, policy, practice or program or contract
or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                 7.       Full Settlement; Mitigation.

                 The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.  In
no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages
for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this
Agreement and, except as provided in Section 5(a)(ii)(c) of this Agreement,
such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other
employment.  If the Executive finally prevails with respect to any dispute
between the Company, the Executive or others as to the interpretation, terms,
validity or enforceability of (including any dispute about the amount of any
payment pursuant to) this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all legal fees
and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any such
dispute.

                 8.       Confidential Information.

                 The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information, knowledge or data relating
to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective
businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the
Executive's employment by the Company, the Corporations or any of their
affiliated companies and that shall not have been or hereafter have become
public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the
Executive in violation of this Agreement).  During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall not, without the prior consent of the Company or as may
otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such
information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those
designated by it.

                 9.       Successors.

                 (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive and
without the prior written consent of the Corporations or the Company, as the
case may be, shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or
laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.

                 (b)      This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Corporations, the Company and their respective successors and
assigns.

                 (c)      The Company shall require any successor (whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume
expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean
the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its businesses and/or
assets as aforesaid that assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                 10.      Miscellaneous.

                 (a)      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are not part of
the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect.  This Agreement may
not be amended, modified, repealed, waived, extended or discharged except by an
agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such
amendment, modification, repeal, waiver, extension or discharge is sought.  No
person, other than pursuant to a resolution of the Board or a committee
thereof, shall have authority on behalf of the Corporations or the Company to
agree to amend, modify, repeal, waive, extend or discharge any provision of
this Agreement or anything in reference thereto.

                 (b)      All notices and other communications hereunder shall

provision of this Agreement.

                 (d)      The Company may withhold from any amounts payable
under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to

                 (e)      The Executive's or the Company's failure to insist
upon strict compliance with any provision hereof or any other provision of this
Agreement or the failure to assert any right the Executive or the Company may
have hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the Executive to
terminate employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 4(c) of this
Agreement, or the right of the Company to terminate the Executive's employment
