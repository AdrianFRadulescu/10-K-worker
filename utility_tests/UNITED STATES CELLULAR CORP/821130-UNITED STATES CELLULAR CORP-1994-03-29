ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

    United  States  Cellular  Corporation  (the  "Company")  is  engaged through
subsidiaries and joint ventures  primarily in the  development and operation  of
and  in the  acquisition of interests  in cellular  telephone markets ("cellular
markets"). The  Company is  a majority-owned  subsidiary of  Telephone and  Data
Systems, Inc. ("TDS"), an Iowa corporation.

    The  Company  acquires,  manages,  owns, operates  and  invests  in cellular
systems throughout the United States. As of December 31, 1993, the Company owned
or had the right to acquire interests in Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSAs")
and  Rural  Service  Areas  ("RSAs")  representing  approximately  23.7  million
population  equivalents in a  total of 205  markets. The Company  is the seventh
largest cellular telephone company in the United States, based on the  aggregate
number  of  population equivalents  it owns  or  has the  right to  acquire. The
Company's corporate development strategy is to acquire controlling interests  in
MSA  and RSA licensees in areas adjacent to or in proximity to its other markets
in order to build clusters. The Company anticipates that clustering markets will
expand its cellular  service areas while  enabling it to  achieve marketing  and
advertising  benefits and to achieve economies  in certain capital and operating
costs.

    The following  table summarizes  the status  of the  Company's interests  in
cellular markets at December 31, 1993.

    The Company served 293,000 customers at December 31, 1993, through 614 cells
in  136 managed markets.  The average penetration rate  (i.e., the percentage of
total population of a  market represented by  customers) in the  Company-managed
markets  was 1.33% at December  31, 1993. The churn rate,  or the portion of the
Company's customers discontinuing  service each month,  averaged 2.3% per  month
during   the  twelve  months   ended  December  31,   1993.  The  Company's  116
majority-owned and managed ("consolidated") markets served 261,000 customers  at
December  31,  1993, through  522  cells. The  average  penetration rate  in the
consolidated markets was 1.35% at December 31,  1993, and the churn rate in  all
consolidated  markets  averaged  2.3%  per month  for  the  twelve  months ended
December 31, 1993.

    The Company,  or  TDS for  the  benefit of  the  Company, has  entered  into
agreements  with  third parties  to acquire  cellular interests  which generally
require the  issuance  of  securities  of the  Company  or  TDS  securities.  In
connection  with agreements  that require  the delivery  of TDS  securities, the
Company  reimburses  TDS  for  TDS   securities  issued  to  third  parties   as
consideration for the acquisitions.

    If  all acquisitions pending at December 31, 1993, are completed as planned,
the Company will issue approximately 3.7 million Common Shares to TDS at or near
the respective closing  dates of  each of these  acquisitions and  approximately
49,000  Common Shares to  third parties. In  addition, approximately 5.0 million
Common Shares are issuable to third parties at December 31, 1993, in  connection
with  completed acquisitions. At December 31, 1993, the Company also had 197,000
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, all held by TDS, which are redeemable  by
the  delivery of 1.2  million Common Shares  between 1994 and  1996. Certain TDS
Preferred Shares delivered  in connection  with the  Company's acquisitions  are
also  redeemable by the delivery of an  additional 1.1 million USM Common Shares
between 1994 and 1996. The aggregate of 11.0 million Common Shares committed for
issuance in future years  are scheduled to be  issued as follows:  approximately
6.8  million shares by  March 21, 1994,  1.2 million shares  in the remainder of
1994, 1.6 million shares in 1995 and 1.4 million shares in 1996.

    TDS owned an aggregate of 59,548,450  shares of common stock of the  Company
at  December  31, 1993,  representing  over 85%  of  the combined  total  of the
Company's outstanding Common and  Series A Common Shares  and over 97% of  their
combined  voting power. Assuming  the Company's Common Shares  are issued in all
instances in which  the Company has  the choice  to issue its  Common Shares  or
other  consideration and  assuming all other  issuances of  the Company's common
stock to  TDS and  third  parties for  completed  and pending  acquisitions  and
redemptions of the Company's Preferred Stock and TDS's Preferred Shares had been
completed  at December 31, 1993, TDS would have owned approximately 79.5% of the
total outstanding common  stock of the  Company and controlled  over 95% of  the
combined  voting power of both  classes of its common  stock. In the event TDS's
ownership of  the Company  falls below  80% of  the total  value of  all of  the
outstanding  shares  of  the  Company's  stock, TDS  and  the  Company  would be
deconsolidated for federal  income tax purposes.  TDS and the  Company have  the
ability  to  defer  or  prevent  deconsolidation,  if  deferring  or  preventing
deconsolidation would be  advantageous, by delivering  TDS Common Shares  and/or
cash,  in  lieu  of  the  Company's Common  Shares  in  connection  with certain
acquisitions.

    The Company was incorporated  in Delaware in  1983. The Company's  executive
offices  are  located  at 8410  West  Bryn  Mawr, Chicago,  Illinois  60631. Its
telephone number is 312-399-8900. The Common Shares of the Company are listed on
the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "USM."

refer   to  United  States  Cellular  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries;  (ii)
references  to  "MSA"  or  to  a  particular  city  refer  to  the  Metropolitan

entity licensed,  designated to  receive  a license  or  expected to  receive  a
construction  permit ("licensee") by the FCC  to construct or operate a cellular
system in such market.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

    The operations of the Company are  subject to FCC and state regulation.  The
licenses  held by the Company which are granted  by the FCC for the use of radio
frequencies are an important component of the overall value of the assets of the
Company. As discussed  here, recent  Congressional legislation  and related  FCC
regulatory  proceedings  may  have significant  impact  on  some or  all  of its
operations by  altering FCC  and state  regulatory responsibilities  for  mobile
service, the procedures for the award by the FCC of licenses to conduct existing
and  new mobile  services, the  terms and  conditions of  business relationships
between mobile service providers  and Local Exchange  Carriers ("LECs") and  the
scope of the competitive opportunities available to mobile service providers.

    The  Omnibus Reconciliation  Act of  1993 (the  "Budget Act"),  which became
effective  in  August  1993,  amended  the  Communications  Act  of  1934   (the
"Communications   Act")  by   eliminating  legislatively   enacted  distinctions
affecting FCC and state regulation of common carrier and private carrier  mobile
operations  and  directed the  FCC to  classify  all mobile  services, including
cellular, paging, Specialized Mobile Radio ("SMR") and other services under  two
categories: Commercial Mobile Radio Services ("CMRS"), subject to common carrier
regulation;  or Private  Mobile Radio Services  ("PMRS"), not  subject to common
carrier regulation. At its  February 3, 1994 public  meeting, the FCC adopted  a
decision classifying mobile service offerings as CMRS operations if they include
a  service offering  to the public,  for a  fee, which is  interconnected to the
public switched network. Cellular, SMR and paging, among other services, will be
classified as CMRS if  they fit this definition.  In addition, the FCC  decision
establishes  a regulatory  precedent for  hybrid CMRS/PMRS  regulation of mobile
operations  which  offer  both  CMRS  service  and  PMRS  service.  The  Company
anticipates  that  its service  offerings will  be classified  as CMRS.  The FCC
decision also states that it would  forebear from requiring that CMRS  providers
comply  with a  number of statutory  provisions, otherwise  applicable to common
carriers, such as the filing of tariffs. It requires LECs to provide  reasonable
and  fair interconnection to all CMRS providers, subject to mutual compensation,
reasonable charges  for  interstate  interconnection  and  reasonable  forms  of
interconnection.  Because the text of the  FCC's decision has only recently been
released and  addresses  many complex  and  interrelated aspects  of  regulatory
policy, the impact of these aspects of the FCC proceedings on the Company cannot
be predicted with certainty.

    The  Budget Act also amended the Communications  Act to authorize the FCC to
use a system of  competitive bidding to  issue initial licenses  for the use  of
radio  frequencies for which there are mutually exclusive applications and where
the principal  use  of the  license  will be  to  offer service  in  return  for
compensation  from  customers. At  its  March 8,  1994  public meeting,  the FCC
adopted a  decision,  the  text  of  which  has  not  yet  been  released,  that
establishes  generic rules for competitive bidding, defines eligibility criteria
for small businesses, minority-and  female-owned businesses and rural  telephone
companies  which qualify for  preferential bidding treatment,  as required under
the Budget Act, and  describes the bidding mechanisms  to be used by  businesses
qualifying  for  preferential treatment  in  future spectrum  auctions.  The FCC
deferred adoption  of  the  competitive bidding  rules  for  specific  licensing
situations.

    Under other amendments to the Communications Act included in the Budget Act,
states  will generally be prohibited from regulating  the entry of, or the rates
charged by, any CMRS provider. The new  law does not, however, prohibit a  state
from  regulating other terms and conditions of CMRS offerings and permits states
to petition  the  FCC for  authority  to  continue rate  regulation.  These  new
statutory provisions will take effect in August 1994.

    On   September  23,  1993,  the  FCC  decided  to  allocate  seven  Personal
Communications Services ("PCS") frequency blocks for licensing, in the aggregate
120 Megahertz ("MHz") of spectrum for licensed operations, and an additional  40
MHz for unlicensed operations, including uses such as telephone PBX and wireless
local  area network operations. Two 30 MHz  frequency blocks will be awarded for
each of the 51 Rand  McNally Major Trading Areas, while  one 20 MHz and four  10
MHz  frequency blocks  will be awarded  for each  of the 492  Rand McNally Basic
Trading Areas. Cellular operators will be permitted to participate in the  award
of  these new PCS licenses,  which will be made  via a yet-to-be-defined auction
process, except for  licenses reserved  for rural,  small, minority-and  female-
owned businesses and licenses for markets in which such cellular operator owns a
20%  or greater interest in  a cellular licensee which  holds a license covering
10% or more of the population of the

                                                                               5

respective PCS  licensed area.  In the  latter case,  the cellular  licensee  is
limited  to one 10 MHz PCS  channel block. Numerous requests for reconsideration
of the FCC's decision have been filed and remain pending before the FCC. In  its
March 8, 1994 decision referenced above, the FCC presumptively classified PCS as
CMRS. The FCC has not adopted specific competitive bidding rules for the initial
licensing  of PCS spectrum or established a schedule for the commencement of PCS
auctions.

    PCS technology is currently under development and is expected to be  similar
in  some  respects  to  cellular  technology.  When  offered  commercially, this
technology is  expected to  offer increased  capacity for  wireless two-way  and
one-way  voice, data and  multimedia communications services  and is expected to
result in  increased competition  in the  Company's operations.  The ability  of
these  future  PCS licensees  to complement  or  compete with  existing cellular
licensees is uncertain and may be affected by future FCC rule-making. These  and
other  future  technological  developments  in  the  wireless telecommunications
industry and  the enhancement  of current  technologies will  likely create  new
products  and services that are competitive  with the services currently offered
by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be adversely
affected by such technological developments.

CELLULAR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

    THE CELLULAR TELEPHONE INDUSTRY.   The cellular telephone industry has  been
in  existence for approximately eleven years  in the United States. Although the
industry is still relatively new, it has grown significantly during this period.
According to the Cellular  Telecommunications Industry Association, at  December
31,  1993, there were estimated to be over 16 million cellular customer units in
service in the United States, generating nearly $11 billion of revenue per year.
Cellular service is now available  throughout the United States. The  commercial
feasibility  of cellular  systems in  the United  States has  not, however, been
proven over a long period of time.

    Cellular   telephone   technology   provides   high-quality,   high-capacity
communications services to in-vehicle cellular telephones and hand-held portable
cellular  telephones. Cellular  technology is  a major  improvement over earlier
mobile telephone technologies. Cellular telephone systems are designed to  allow
for  maximum  mobility  of  the  customer.  In  addition  to  mobility, cellular
telephone systems  provide  access  through system  interconnections  to  local,
regional,   national  and   world-wide  telecommunications   networks.  Cellular
telephone systems  also  offer  a  full range  of  ancillary  services  such  as
conference  calling,  call-waiting, call-forwarding,  voice mail,  facsimile and
data transmission.

    Cellular telephone systems divide each service area into smaller  geographic
areas  or  "cells." Each  cell  is served  by  radio transmitters  and receivers
operating on discrete radio frequencies licensed by the FCC. All of the cells in
a system  are  connected to  a  computer-controlled Mobile  Telephone  Switching
Office  ("MTSO").  The  MTSO  is  connected  to  the  conventional  ("landline")
telephone network. Each conversation on a cellular phone involves a transmission
over a  specific  range  of radio  frequencies  from  the cellular  phone  to  a
transmitter/receiver at a cell site. The transmission is forwarded from the cell
site  to the  MTSO and  from there  may be  forwarded to  the landline telephone
network to complete the call. As the  cellular telephone moves from one cell  to
another,  the MTSO determines radio signal  strength and transfers ("hands off")
the call from one cell  to the next. This hand-off  is not noticeable to  either
party on the phone call.

    The  Company provides cellular  telephone service under  licenses granted by
the FCC. The FCC grants only two licenses to provide cellular telephone  service
in   each  market.   However,  competition  for   customers  includes  competing
communications technologies such as conventional landline and mobile  telephone,
SMR  systems  and  radio  paging. In  addition,  emerging  technologies  such as
Enhanced Specialized  Mobile  Radio  ("ESMR"),  mobile  satellite  communication
systems,  second generation cordless telephones ("CT-2") and PCS may prove to be
competitive with cellular service in  the future in some  or all of the  markets
where the Company has operations.

    The  services available  to cellular  customers and  the sources  of revenue
available to  cellular  system  operators  are  similar  to  those  provided  by
conventional  landline telephone companies. Customers are charged a separate fee
for system access, airtime, long-distance calls, and ancillary services.

    Technical standards require  that analog cellular  telephones be  compatible
with  all cellular systems in all market  areas in the United States. Because of
this compatibility feature, cellular system operators

6
<PAGE>
often provide service to  customers of other  operators' cellular systems  while
the  customers  are temporarily  located  within the  operators'  service areas.
Customers using service away  from their home system  are called "roamers."  The
system  that provides the service to  these roamers will generate usage revenue.
Many operators, including  the Company,  charge premium rates  for this  roaming
service.

    There  are  a  number  of  recent  technical  developments  in  the cellular
industry. Currently, while most of the MTSOs process information digitally, most
of the radio transmission is done  on an analog basis. Digital radio  technology
offers  advantages, including less transmission  noise, greater system capacity,
and potentially lower incremental costs for additional customers. The conversion
from analog  to digital  radio technology  is expected  to be  an  industry-wide
process that will take a number of years.

    During 1992, a new transmission technique was approved for implementation by
the  cellular industry.  Time Division  Multiple Access  ("TDMA") technology was
selected as one industry standard by the cellular industry and has been deployed
in several  markets,  including the  Company's  operations in  Tulsa,  Oklahoma.
However,  another digital technology, Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA"), is
expected to be in a commercial trial by the end of 1994. The Company expects  to
deploy some digital radio channels in other markets in the near future.

    The  cellular  telephone industry  is  characterized by  high  initial fixed
costs. Accordingly, if and when revenues less variable costs exceed fixed costs,
incremental revenues should yield an operating profit. The amount of profit,  if
any,  under such circumstances  is dependent on, among  other things, prices and
variable marketing costs which in turn are affected by the amount and extent  of
competition.  Until technological limitations on  total capacity are approached,
additional cellular system  capacity can  normally be added  in increments  that
closely  match demand  and at  less than the  proportionate cost  of the initial
capacity.

    THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  The Company is building a substantial presence in
selected geographic areas throughout the United States where it can  efficiently
integrate  and manage cellular telephone systems. Its cellular interests include
market  clusters  in  the  Northern  Florida,  Eastern  Tennessee/Western  North
Carolina,  Eastern  North Carolina/Virginia,  Maine/New  Hampshire/Vermont, West
Virginia/Pennsylvania/Maryland, Indiana/Kentucky, Iowa,
Wisconsin/Illinois/Minnesota,   Oklahoma,    Missouri,    Southwestern    Texas,
Texas/Oklahoma, Oregon/California and Washington/Idaho areas. See "The Company's
Cellular Interests." The Company has acquired its cellular interests through the
wireline  application process  (22%), including  settlements and  exchanges with
other applicants, and  through acquisitions (78%),  including acquisitions  from
TDS and third parties.

    Management  plans to retain  minority interests in  certain cellular markets
which it believes  will earn a  favorable return on  investment. Other  minority
interests  may be  traded for interests  in markets which  enhance the Company's
market clusters or may be sold for cash or other consideration.

CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CELLULAR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

    Since its inception in 1983, the Company has principally been in a  start-up
phase  in  which  its activities  have  been concentrated  significantly  on the
acquisition of interests in entities licensed or designated to receive a license
("licensees") from the FCC to provide  cellular service and on the  construction
and  initial operation of cellular systems. The development of a cellular system
is capital-intensive and requires substantial investment prior to and subsequent
to initial  operation. The  Company  has experienced  operating losses  and  net
losses  in all  but a few  quarters since  its inception. The  Company may incur
operating losses  for the  next few  quarters, and  there is  no assurance  that
future operations, individually or in the aggregate, will be profitable.

    The  licensing  (including  renewal of  licenses),  construction, operation,
sale, interconnection  arrangements  and  acquisition of  cellular  systems  are
regulated  by the FCC  and various state public  utility commissions. Changes in
the regulation of  cellular operators or  their activities and  of other  mobile
service  providers (such  as the  decision by the  FCC to  permit PCS licensees)
could have a  material adverse effect  on the Company's  operations. See  "Legal
Proceedings  -- La Star Application" for a discussion of certain FCC proceedings
which have suspended the Company's and TDS's licensing authority in a  Wisconsin
market pending the outcome of an FCC hearing.

                                                                               7
<PAGE>
    The  number of population equivalents  represented by the Company's cellular
interests bears  no direct  relationship  to the  number of  potential  cellular
customers or the revenues that may be realized from the operation of the related
cellular systems. The fair market value of the Company's cellular interests will
ultimately  depend on the success of its  operations. There is no assurance that
the value of cellular  interests will not be  significantly lower in the  future
than at present.

    While there are numerous cellular systems operating in the United States and
other countries, the industry has only a limited operating history. As a result,
there  is uncertainty regarding its future,  including, among other factors: (i)
the growth in customers; (ii) the usage and pricing of cellular services;  (iii)
the percentage of customers who terminate service each month (the "churn rate");
(iv)  the cost of providing cellular  services, including the cost of attracting
new customers;  and  (v) continuing  technological  advances which  may  provide
competitive alternatives.

    Media  reports have  suggested that certain  radiofrequency ("RF") emissions
from portable cellular  telephones might be  linked to cancer.  The Company  has
reviewed  relevant scientific information and, based on such information, is not
aware of any credible evidence linking the usage of portable cellular telephones
with cancer. The FCC currently has a rulemaking proceeding pending to update the
guidlines and methods it  uses for evaluating RF  emissions in radio  equipment,
including  cellular telephones. While the proposal would impose more restrictive
standards on  RF emissions  from  low-power devices  such as  portable  cellular
telphones, it is anticipated that all cellular telephones currently marketed and
in use will comply with those standards.

CELLULAR SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT

    ACQUISITIONS.   During  the last three  years, the  Company has aggressively
expanded its size,  particularly in  markets which share  adjacency, through  an
ongoing acquisition program aimed at strengthening the Company's position in the
cellular  industry.  This growth  has  resulted primarily  from  acquisitions of
interests in  RSAs and  has been  based on  obtaining interests  with rights  to
manage the underlying market.

    Including  transfers  of  RSA interests  from  TDS, the  Company  has nearly
tripled its population  equivalents from approximately  8.0 million at  December
31, 1988, to approximately 23.7 million at December 31, 1993. Similarly, markets
managed  or  to be  managed by  the Company  have increased  from 33  markets at
December 31, 1988, to 144 markets at December 31, 1993. As of December 31, 1993,
almost 86%  of the  Company's population  equivalents represented  interests  in
markets  the Company manages or  expects to manage, compared  to 62% at December
31, 1988.

    The Company  seeks  and is  currently  negotiating for  the  acquisition  of
additional  cellular  interests  and  plans  to  acquire  significant additional
cellular interests in markets that complement its developing market clusters and
in other  attractive  markets.  The  Company  also  seeks  to  acquire  minority
interests  in markets where  it already owns  (or has the  right to acquire) the
majority interest.  At the  same  time the  Company  continues to  evaluate  the
disposition  of interests which  are not essential  to its corporate development
strategy.

    The Company will ordinarily make acquisitions using securities or cash or by
exchanging cellular interests it  already owns. There is  no assurance that  the
Company  will be  able to  purchase any additional  interests, or  that any such
additional interests,  if  purchased,  will  be  purchased  on  terms  that  are
favorable to the Company.

    The  Company,  or  TDS  for  the  benefit  of  the  Company,  has negotiated
acquisitions of cellular interests from third parties primarily in consideration
for the Company's Common  Shares or TDS's Common  or Preferred Shares.  Cellular
interests  acquired by TDS are generally assigned  to the Company. At that time,
the Company  reimburses TDS  for the  value  of TDS  securities issued  in  such
transactions, generally by issuing Common Shares and Preferred Stock (redeemable
by  the delivery of Common Shares) to TDS or by increases to the balance due TDS
under the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement in amounts equal to the value  of
TDS capital stock at the time the acquisitions are closed. The fair market value
of  the Common Shares and Preferred Stock issued to TDS in connection with these
transactions is equal to the fair market  value of the TDS securities issued  in
the transactions and is determined at the time the transactions are closed.

8
<PAGE>
    In  cases where  the Company's  Common Shares  are used  as consideration in
connection with acquisitions, most of the agreements call for such shares to  be
delivered  in 1994  and later  years. In a  limited number  of transactions, the
Company has agreed to pay some portion of the purchase price in cash.

    COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS.  During 1993, the Company completed the  acquisition
of controlling interests in 25 markets and several additional minority interests
representing  approximately 3.8 million population  equivalents for an aggregate
consideration of $284.6 million. The  consideration consisted of 5.7 million  of
the  Company's Common Shares, 75,000 of the Company's Series A Common Shares, an
increase in  the debt  to TDS  under the  Revolving Credit  Agreement of  $101.5
million,  $12.7 million in cash, cash paid by TDS of $9.4 million (treated as an
equity contribution to the Company), and the obligation to deliver approximately
140,000 of the Company's Common Shares to third parties in 1994. The debt  under
the  Revolving Credit Agreement  and 5.5 million of  the Company's Common Shares
were issued to TDS to reimburse TDS  for TDS Common Shares issued and cash  paid
to third parties in connection with these acquisitions.

    Included in the above transactions is the transfer of a minority interest in
one  RSA from TDS, representing 35,000 population equivalents. The consideration
consisted of the issuance of 31,000 of the Company's Common Shares and 75,000 of
the Company's Series A Common Shares to  TDS. The Company's Common and Series  A
Common  Shares  have been  recorded at  TDS's  book value  of the  RSA interests
transferred, rather  than  the fair  market  value of  the  shares, due  to  the
intercompany nature of the transaction.

    PENDING  ACQUISITIONS.  At  December 31, 1993,  the Company, or  TDS for the
benefit of  the Company,  had  entered into  agreements to  acquire  controlling
interests in nine markets and a minority interest representing approximately 1.2
million  population equivalents for  an aggregate consideration  estimated to be
approximately $128.4 million. If all  of the pending acquisitions are  completed
as planned, the Company will issue approximately 49,000 of its Common Shares and
will  pay approximately $4.5 million in  cash. TDS will pay approximately $123.0
million in TDS Common Shares  and cash. Any interests  acquired by TDS in  these
transactions  are expected to be  assigned to the Company  and at that time, the
Company will reimburse TDS for TDS's consideration delivered and costs  incurred
in such acquisitions in the form of Common Shares of the Company or increases in
the  balance under the Revolving Credit  Agreement. Based on the estimated value
of the consideration at the time  the agreements were entered into, the  Company
expects  to reimburse TDS by issuing 3.7  million of the Company's Common Shares
to TDS  and  by  increasing the  balance  due  TDS under  the  Revolving  Credit
Agreement by $400,000.

    In addition to the agreements discussed above, the Company has agreements to
acquire  interests representing 302,000 population equivalents in three markets.
The consideration  for these  acquisitions will  be determined  based on  future
appraisals  of  the fair  market values  of  the interests  to be  acquired. All
population  equivalents  acquirable  pursuant   to  these  agreements  and   the
agreements  in the previous paragraph  are included in the  table on pages 11 to
14.

    In  addition  to  the  acquisitions  completed  in  1993  and  the   pending
acquisitions  discussed above, the Company had  commitments at December 31, 1993
to issue 4.8  million Common  Shares in connection  with acquisitions  completed
prior  to 1993. Approximately 3.8  million of these shares  were issued in early
1994. The Company also had Preferred Stock outstanding (all of which is held  by
TDS) which is redeemable into 1.2 million of the Company's Common Shares in 1994
through  1996. Certain  series of  TDS Preferred  Shares are  redeemable into an
additional 1.1 million of the Company's Common Shares in 1994 through 1996.

    The Company maintains shelf registration of its Common Shares and  Preferred
Stock  under the Securities Act of  1933 for issuance specifically in connection
with acquisitions.

CELLULAR INTERESTS AND CLUSTERS

    The Company operates  clusters of  adjacent cellular  systems, enabling  its
customers  to benefit  from a larger  service area than  otherwise possible. The
Company's strategy was initially implemented  by filing for licenses to  operate
cellular  systems  in MSAs.  Following the  MSA  lotteries and  settlements, the
Company acquired interests  in certain  additional MSAs  through purchases.  The
Company has acquired

                                                                               9
<PAGE>
substantial  additional population equivalents through the purchase of interests
in RSAs.  The Company  plans to  continue to  acquire controlling  interests  in
cellular  licenses to provide service in  systems that complement its developing
market clusters and in other attractive systems.

    The Company anticipates  that clustering  markets will  expand its  cellular
service  areas and provide certain economies in its capital and operating costs.
In areas  where the  Company has  clusters of  contiguous markets  it may  offer
wide-area  coverage. This would allow uninterrupted  service within the area and
allow the customer to make outgoing  and receive incoming calls without  special
roamer   arrangements.  Clustering  also  makes   possible  greater  sharing  of
facilities, personnel  and other  costs  and may  thereby  reduce the  costs  of
serving  each  customer.  The extent  to  which these  revenue  enhancements and
economies of operation  will be  realized through clustering  is dependent  upon
market   conditions,   population  sizes   of   the  clusters   and  engineering
considerations.

    The Company's  market clusters  have grown  rapidly. At  December 31,  1993,
approximately  87%,  or  17.7  million,  of  the  Company's  managed  population
equivalents were in contiguous markets within market clusters. Additionally, 92%
of the Company's managed markets were adjacent to another Company-managed market
at  that  time.   The  Company  anticipates   continuing  to  pursue   strategic
acquisitions  and trades in order to  complement its developing market clusters.
The Company has  also acquired minority  interests in markets  where it  already
owns,  or has the right to acquire, a  majority interest. From time to time, the
Company may consider trading or selling some of its cellular interests which  do
not fit well with its long-term strategies.

    The  Company  owned  or  had  the right  to  acquire  interests  in cellular
telephone systems in  205 markets at  December 31, 1993.  At December 31,  1993,
approximately 86%, or 20.4 million, of the Company's population equivalents were
in  markets  that  the Company  manages  or  expects to  manage.  At  that date,
approximately 95%  of  the  Company's managed  population  equivalents  were  in
markets  where  cellular service  has been  initiated and  where the  Company is
currently operating the system. The following table summarizes the growth in the
Company's population equivalents in recent  years and the development status  of
these population equivalents.

    SYSTEM DESIGN  AND CONSTRUCTION.   The  Company designs  and constructs  its
systems  in a manner it believes will  permit it to provide high-quality service
to mobile, transportable  and portable cellular  telephones, generally based  on
market  and engineering  studies which  relate to  specific markets. Engineering
studies are performed by Company personnel or independent engineering firms. The
Company's switching equipment is digital, which reduces noise and crosstalk  and
is  capable of  interconnecting in  a manner  which reduces  costs of operation.
While digital microwave interconnections are typically made between the MTSO and
cell sites, primarily analog radio transmission  is used between cell sites  and
the cellular telephones themselves.

    In  accordance  with  its  strategy  of  building  and  strengthening market
clusters, the Company has selected  high capacity with service-upgraded  digital
cellular  switching systems that  are capable of serving  multiple markets via a
single MTSO.  The Company's  cellular  systems are  designed to  facilitate  the
installation  of equipment  which will permit  microwave interconnection between
the MTSO  and  each  cell  site. The  Company  has  implemented  such  microwave
interconnection  in most of the cellular systems it manages. In other systems in
which the Company  owns or has  an option  to purchase a  majority interest  and
where  it is believed to be  cost-efficient, such microwave technology will also
be implemented.  Otherwise,  such  systems will  rely  upon  landline  telephone
connections or microwave links owned by others to link cell sites with the MTSO.
Although   the  installation  of  microwave  network  interconnection  equipment
requires a greater  initial capital  investment, a microwave  network enables  a
system  operator to avoid the current and future charges associated with leasing
telephone lines from the landline  telephone company, while generally  improving
system  reliability. In  addition, microwave facilities  can be  used to connect
separate cellular systems to allow shared switching, which reduces the aggregate
cost of the equipment necessary to operate both systems.

    The Company  has  continued  to expand  its  internal,  nationwide  seamless
network in 1993 to encompass over 100 markets in the United States. This network
provides automatic call delivery for the Company's customers and handoff between
adjacent  markets.  The seamless  network has  also  been extended,  using IS-41
technology, via links with certain  systems operated by several other  carriers,
including  GTE,  US  West,  Ameritech,  BellSouth,  Centennial  Cellular  Corp.,
Southwestern Bell,  McCaw Cellular  Communications, Vanguard  Cellular  Systems,
Inc.  and others.  Additionally, the  Company has  conducted Signaling  System 7
field trials with AT&T and with  Independent Telephone Network to determine  the
most  viable  approach to  establish  a backbone  network  that will  enable the
Company to interface with other national networks.

    During 1994,  the  Company  expects to  significantly  extend  the  seamless
network  for its  customers into additional  areas in  Texas, Arkansas, Indiana,
Idaho, Utah,  California,  Louisiana,  Massachusetts,  Washington,  Florida  and
several  other states. Not only will this  expanded network increase the area in
which customers  can automatically  receive  incoming calls,  but it  will  also
reduce  the incidence  of fraud  due to the  pre-call validation  feature of the
IS-41 technology.

    Management  believes  that  currently  available  technologies  will   allow
sufficient  capacity on the  Company's networks to  meet anticipated demand over
the next few years.

COSTS OF SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING

    Construction of cellular systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial
investment for  land  and  improvements, buildings,  towers,  MTSOs,  cell  site
equipment,    microwave   equipment,   customer   equipment,   engineering   and
installation. The  Company,  consistent  with  FCC  control  requirements,  uses
primarily  its  own  personnel  to engineer  and  oversee  construction  of each
cellular system  where  it  owns or  has  the  right to  acquire  a  controlling
interest. In so doing, the Company expects to improve the overall quality of its
systems and to reduce the expense and time required to make them operational.

    The  costs (exclusive of license costs)  of the operational systems in which
the Company owns or has the right to acquire an interest are generally  financed
through  capital  contributions or  intercompany  loans to  the  partnerships or
subsidiaries owning the systems, and through certain vendor financing.

MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE

    The Company's marketing  plan is  designed to capitalize  on its  clustering
strategy  and  to  increase  revenue by  growing  the  Company's  customer base,
increasing customers' usage of cellular  service and reducing churn or  customer
disconnects.  The  marketing  plan  stresses  service  quality  and incorporates
programs aimed  at  developing  and  expanding  new  and  existing  distribution
channels,  stimulating customer usage by offering  new and enhanced services and
by increasing the public's awareness and understanding of the cellular  services
offered by the Company. Most of the Company's operations market cellular service
under the "United States Cellular"-TM- name and service mark.

    The  Company's marketing strategy  is to develop  a local, customer-oriented
operation, the primary goal of which  is to provide quality cellular service  to
its  customers. The Company's  marketing program focuses  on obtaining customers
who need  cellular service,  such as  business people  who, while  out of  their
offices, need to be in contact with others. The Company plans to follow the same
marketing program in the other systems it expects to manage.

    The  Company manages  each cellular  cluster, and  in some  cases individual
markets,  with  a  local  staff,  including  a  manager  and  customer   service
representatives.  Sales  consultants  are typically  maintained  in  each market
within the clusters. Customers are able  to report cellular service problems  or
concerns  24 hours  a day.  It is  the Company's  goal to  respond to customers'
concerns and  to  correct  reported  service deficiencies  within  24  hours  of
notification.  The Company  has established  local service  centers in  order to
repair and maintain most major brands of user equipment.

    The Company has relied primarily on its own direct and retail sales channels
to obtain customers for the cellular  markets it manages. The Company  maintains
an   ongoing  training  program  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  sales
consultants and retail associates in  obtaining customers as well as  maximizing
the  sale of high-user  packages. These packages  commit customers to  pay for a
minimum amount of  usage at  discounted rates per  minute, even  if usage  falls
below the monthly minimum amount. The

                                                                              15
<PAGE>
Company  also uses agents, dealers and retailers to obtain customers. Agents and
dealers are independent business  people who sell to  customers on a  commission
basis  for the  Company. The  Company's agents  are in  the business  of selling
cellular telephones, cellular  service packages  and other  related products  to
customers.  The  Company's  dealers  include  car  stereo  companies  and  other
companies whose customers are also  potential cellular customers. The  Company's
retailers  include car dealers,  major appliance dealers,  office supply dealers
and mass merchants.

    The Company began to specifically  address the fast-growing consumer  market
by  opening  its own  retail stores  in  late 1993.  These small  facilities are
located in high-traffic areas  and are designed to  cater to walk-in  customers.
The  Company plans to open more locations in 1994 to further its presence in the
local markets.

    The Company  also  actively  pursues  national  retail  accounts  which  may
potentially  yield  new customer  additions  in multiple  markets.  The national
account effort is expected to enable the Company to reach segments of the market
other than those accessed by the local sales force. Agreements have been entered
into with  such  national  distributors  as  Chrysler  Corporation,  Ford  Motor
Company,  General Motors, Honda, AT&T, Radio Shack, Best Buy, and Sears, Roebuck
& Co.  for  certain of  the  Company's markets.  Upon  the sale  of  a  cellular
telephone  by one  of these national  distributors, the  Company receives, often
exclusively within the territories served,  the resulting cellular customer.  In
recognition  of the  needs of these  national accounts, the  Company initiated a
centralized  customer  support  program.   This  program  allows  for   customer
activation  during peak retail  business hours (weekends  and evenings) when the
Company's local office might otherwise be closed.

    The Company uses a variety of direct mail, billboard, radio, television  and
newspaper advertising to stimulate interest by prospective customers in cellular
service  and to  establish familiarity with  the Company's  name. Advertising is
directed at  gaining  customers,  increasing usage  by  existing  customers  and
increasing  the  public awareness  and  understanding of  the  cellular services
offered by  the Company.  The Company  attempts to  select the  advertising  and
promotion  media that  are most  appealing to  the targeted  groups of potential
customers in each local market. The Company utilizes local advertising media and
public relations activities and establishes programs to enhance public awareness
of the Company, such as providing  telephones and service for public events  and
emergency uses.

CUSTOMERS AND SYSTEM USAGE

    Company data for 1993 indicate that 52% of the Company's customers use their
cellular  telephones primarily for business. Cellular customers come from a wide
range of occupations. They typically  include a large proportion of  individuals
who  work outside  of their  offices such  as people  in the  construction, real
estate, wholesale and retail distribution businesses, and professionals. Most of
the Company's  customers  use  in-vehicle  cellular  telephones.  However,  more
customers  (71% of new customers in 1993  compared to 21% in 1988) are selecting
portable and other transportable cellular telephones as these units become  more
compact and fully featured as well as more attractively priced.

    The  Company's  cellular systems  are  used most  extensively  during normal
business hours  between  7:00 am  and  6:00 pm.  On  average, the  local  retail
customers  in  the  Company's  majority-owned  and  managed  systems  used their
cellular systems approximately  103 minutes  per unit each  month and  generated
retail  revenue  of approximately  $49 per  month during  1993, compared  to 121
minutes and $52 per month in  1992. Revenue generated by roamers, together  with
local,  toll and  other revenues,  brought the  Company's total  average monthly
service revenue per customer unit in  majority-owned and managed markets to  $99
during  1993.  Average  monthly  service  revenue  per  customer  unit decreased
approximately 6% during 1993, reflecting primarily the decline in average  local
minutes  per customer unit. The Company anticipates that average monthly service
revenue per  customer  unit  may  continue to  decline  as  retail  distribution
channels  provide additional consumer customers who generate fewer local minutes
of use and as roamer revenues grow more slowly.

    Roaming is a service offered by the Company which allows a customer to place
or  receive a  call in  a cellular  service area  away from  the customer's home
market area. The Company has entered into "roaming agreements" with operators of
other cellular systems covering virtually all  systems in the United States  and
Canada.  These  agreements  offer customers  the  opportunity to  roam  in these
systems. These reciprocal agreements automatically pre-register the customers of
the Company's systems  in the  other carriers' systems.  Also, a  customer of  a
participating  system roaming (i.e.  travelling) in a  Company market where this
arrangement is in effect is able to automatically make and receive calls on  the
Company's  system. The charge for this service is typically at premium rates and
is billed by the  Company to the  customer's home system,  which then bills  the
customer.  The Company has entered into  agreements with other cellular carriers
to transfer roaming  usage at  agreed-upon rates.  In some  instances, based  on
competitive factors, the Company may charge a lower amount to its customers than
the  amount  actually charged  to the  Company by  another cellular  carrier for
roaming; however, these services include call delivery and call handoff.

    The following  table  summarizes  certain information  about  customers  and
market penetration in the Company's managed operations.

CELLULAR TELEPHONES AND INSTALLATION

    There  are a number of different types  of cellular telephones, all of which
are currently compatible with cellular systems nationwide. The Company offers  a
full  range of  vehicle-mounted, transportable, and  hand-held portable cellular
telephones.  Features  offered  in  some  of  the  cellular  telephones  include
hands-free calling, repeat dialing, horn alert and others.

    The  Company has established service  and/or installation facilities in many
of its local markets to ensure quality installation and service of the  cellular
telephones  it sells. These facilities allow  the Company to improve its service
by promptly assisting customers who experience equipment problems.

    The  Company  negotiates  volume  discounts  from  its  cellular   telephone
suppliers.  The Company  discounts cellular telephones  in most  markets to meet
competition or to stimulate  sales by reducing the  cost of becoming a  cellular
customer.  In these instances,  where permitted by  law, customers are generally
required to sign an extended service contract with the Company. The Company also
cooperates with  cellular  equipment  manufacturers  in  local  advertising  and
promotion of cellular equipment.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

    The  Company's  customers are  able  to choose  from  a variety  of packaged
pricing plans  which  are  designed  to  fit  different  calling  patterns.  The
Company's  customer  bills typically  show  separate charges  for custom-calling
features,  airtime  in  excess   of  the  packaged   amount,  and  toll   calls.
Custom-calling features provided by the Company include wide-area call delivery,
call  forwarding, call  waiting, three-way  calling and  no-answer transfer. The
Company also  offers  a voice  message  service in  many  of its  markets.  This
service,   which  functions  like  a  sophisticated  answering  machine,  allows
customers to receive messages from callers  when they are not available to  take
calls.

REGULATION

    The  construction, operation and transfer of  cellular systems in the United
States  are  regulated  to   varying  degrees  by  the   FCC  pursuant  to   the
Communications  Act. The FCC has  promulgated regulations governing construction
and operation of cellular systems, and licensing and technical standards for the
provision of cellular telephone service.

    For licensing  purposes, the  FCC divided  the United  States into  separate
geographic  markets  (MSAs and  RSAs). In  each  market, the  allocated cellular
frequencies are divided into two  equal blocks. During the application  process,
the  FCC  reserved  one  block of  frequencies  for  nonwireline  applicants and

18
<PAGE>
another block  for wireline  applicants.  Subject to  FCC approval,  a  cellular
system  may be sold  to either a  wireline or nonwireline  entity, but no entity
which controls a cellular system may own an interest in another cellular  system
in the same MSA or RSA.

    The  completion  of  acquisitions involving  the  transfer of  control  of a
cellular system requires prior FCC approval. Acquisitions of minority  interests
generally  do not require  FCC approval. Whenever FCC  approval is required, any
interested  party  may  file  a  petition  to  dismiss  or  deny  the  Company's
application for approval of the proposed transfer.

    When  the first cell of a cellular system has been constructed, the licensee
is required to notify the FCC that construction has been completed.  Immediately
upon  this notification,  but not  before, FCC  rules authorize  the licensee to
offer commercial  service to  the public.  The  licensee is  then said  to  have
"operating  authority."  Initial  operating licenses  are  granted  for ten-year
periods. The FCC must be notified each time an additional cell is constructed.

    The FCC's rules also generally require persons or entities holding  cellular
construction  permits or licenses  to coordinate their  proposed frequency usage
with  other  cellular  users  and   licensees  in  order  to  avoid   electrical
interference  between adjacent systems. The height and power of base stations in
the cellular system  are regulated by  FCC rules,  as are the  types of  signals
emitted  by  these stations.  In  addition to  regulation  by the  FCC, cellular
systems are  subject  to  certain Federal  Aviation  Administration  regulations
respecting  the  siting  and  construction of  cellular  transmitter  towers and
antennas.

    On January  9,  1992, the  FCC  adopted a  Report  and Order  ("R&O")  which
establishes  standards for conducting comparative  renewal proceedings between a
cellular  licensee  seeking  renewal  of  its  license  and  challengers  filing
competing  applications.  In  the R&O,  the  FCC: (i)  established  criteria for
comparing the renewal  applicant to challengers,  including the standards  under
which  a "renewal expectancy"  will be granted to  the applicant seeking license
renewal; (ii) established  basic qualifications standards  for challengers;  and
(iii)  provided  procedures for  preventing possible  abuses in  the comparative
renewal process. The FCC has concluded  that it will award a renewal  expectancy
if  the  licensee  has (i)  substantially  used  its spectrum  for  its intended
purposes; (ii) complied with FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act,  as
amended;  and (iii) not engaged in substantial relevant misconduct. If a renewal
expectancy is awarded  to an  existing licensee,  that expectancy  will be  more
significant  in the renewal proceeding than  any other criterion used to compare
the licensee to challengers. Licenses  of the Company's affiliates in  Knoxville
and  Tulsa  will  be its  first  to come  up  for  renewal in  1994.  See "Legal
Proceedings -- La Star Application" for a discussion of certain FCC  proceedings
which  have suspended the Company's and TDS's licensing authority in a Wisconsin
market pending the outcome of an FCC hearing.

    The Company conducts and plans to conduct its operations in accordance  with
all  relevant  FCC rules  and  regulations and  would  anticipate being  able to
qualify for a  renewal expectancy.  Accordingly, the Company  believes that  the
regulations  will have  no significant  effect on  its operations  and financial
condition.

    The FCC has  also provided that  five years after  the initial licenses  are
granted,  unserved areas within  markets previously granted  to licensees may be
applied for by both wireline and nonwireline entities and by third parties.  The
FCC  established 1993  filing dates for  filing "unserved  area" applications in
MSAs  in  which  the  five-year  period  had  expired  and  many  unserved  area
applications  were filed in certain MSAs. The Company's strategy with respect to
system construction in its markets has been and will be to build cells  covering
every  area within such markets that the Company considers economically feasible
to serve or might conceivably  wish to serve and to  do so within the  five-year
period following issuance of the license.

    The Company is also subject to state and local regulation in some instances.
In  1981, the FCC preempted the states from exercising jurisdiction in the areas
of licensing, technical standards and market structure. However, certain  states
require cellular system operators to go through a state certification process to
serve communities within their borders. All such certificates can be revoked for
cause.  In addition,  certain state  authorities regulate  several aspects  of a
cellular operator's business, including the  rates it charges its customers  and
cellular  resellers, the resale  of long-distance service  to its customers, the
technical arrangements and charges for interconnection with the landline network
and

                                                                              19
<PAGE>
the transfer of interests  in cellular systems. The  siting and construction  of
the  cellular facilities,  including transmitter towers,  antennas and equipment
shelters may also be subject to state or local zoning, land use and other  local
regulations.  Public utility  or public service  commissions (or  certain of the
commissioners) in several states have expressed an interest in examining whether
the cellular industry should be more closely regulated by such states.

COMPETITION

    The  Company's  only  facilities-based  competitor  for  cellular  telephone
service  in each market  is the licensee  of the second  cellular system in that
market. Competition for  customers between  the two  systems in  each market  is
principally  on the basis  of quality of  service, price, size  of area covered,
services offered, and responsiveness of customer service. The competing entities
in many of  the markets  in which  the Company  has an  interest have  financial
resources  which are  substantially greater  than those  of the  Company and its
partners in such markets.

    The FCC's rules require  all operational cellular systems  to provide, on  a
nondiscriminatory  basis, cellular service to resellers which purchase blocks of
mobile telephone numbers from an operational system and then resell them to  the
public.

    In  addition to competition from the other cellular licensee in each market,
there is also  competition from, among  other technologies, conventional  mobile
telephone  and SMR systems, both of which  are able to connect with the landline
telephone network.  The  Company  believes that  conventional  mobile  telephone
systems  and conventional SMR systems are competitively disadvantaged because of
technological limitations on the capacity of such systems. The FCC has  recently
given  approval, via waivers of its rules, to ESMR, an enhanced SMR system. ESMR
systems may have cells  and frequency reuse  like cellular, thereby  potentially
eliminating  any current technological  limitation. The first  ESMR systems were
implemented in 1993  in Los  Angeles. Although  less directly  a substitute  for
cellular  service, wireless data services and one-way paging service (and in the
future, two-way paging services) may be adequate for those who do not need  full
two-way voice service.

    Continuing  technological  advances  in  the  communications  field  make it
impossible to predict the extent  of additional future competition for  cellular
systems. For example, the FCC has allocated radio channels to a mobile satellite
system  in which transmissions from mobile  units to satellites would augment or
replace transmissions to cell  sites, and a consortium  to provide such  service
has been formed. Such a system is designed primarily to serve the communications
needs  of remote  locations and a  mobile satellite system  could provide viable
competition for land-based cellular systems in  such areas. It is also  possible
that  the  FCC  may in  the  future  assign additional  frequencies  to cellular
telephone service to provide  for more than two  cellular telephone systems  per
market.

    CT-2,   second   generation   cordless   telephones,   and   PCS,   personal
communications network  services,  may prove  to  be competitive  with  cellular
service in the future. CT-2 will allow a customer to make a call from a personal
phone  as long as the  person is within range of  a telepoint base station which
connects the call to the public switched telephone network. PCS will be digital,
wireless communications systems which currently  are primarily targeted for  use
in  very densely  populated areas.  Various CT-2 and  PCS trials  are in process
throughout the United States. CT-2 and PCS are not anticipated to be significant
sources of competition  in the  Company's markets  in the  near future.  Similar
technological  advances or regulatory  changes in the  future may make available
other alternatives to cellular service,  thereby creating additional sources  of
competition.

EMPLOYEES

    The  Company had 1,785  employees as of  February 28, 1994.  Of these, 1,491
were based at the  various cellular markets operated  or managed by the  Company
with  only 294 based at  its corporate office in  Chicago, Illinois. None of the
Company's  employees  is  represented  by  a  labor  organization.  The  Company
considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

20

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    The  property  for mobile  telephone switching  offices  and cell  sites are
either owned  or  leased under  long-term  leases by  the  Company, one  of  its
subsidiaries  or  the partnership  or corporation  which holds  the construction
permit or license. The Company has not experienced major problems with obtaining
zoning approval for cell sites or  operating facilities and does not  anticipate
any such problems in the future which are or will be material to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  as a  whole. The  Company's investment  in property  is small
compared to its investment in licenses and equipment.

    The Company leases approximately 39,000 square feet of office space for  its
headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

    The  Company  considers  the  properties  owned  or  leased  by  it  and its
subsidiaries  to  be  suitable  and  adequate  for  their  respective   business
operations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The  Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and
various state  and  federal  courts.  In some  cases,  the  litigation  involves
disputes  regarding  rights  to  certain cellular  telephone  markets.  The more
significant proceedings affecting  the Company  are described  in the  following
paragraphs.

    LA   STAR  APPLICATION.    Star  Cellular  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  ("Star
Cellular"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a 49%  owner
of  La  Star  Cellular  Telephone  Company  ("La  Star"),  an  applicant  for  a
construction permit  for a  cellular system  in St.  Tammany Parish  in the  New
Orleans  MSA. In June 1992, the FCC affirmed an Administrative Law Judge's order
which had granted the mutually exclusive  application of New Orleans CGSA,  Inc.
("NOCGSA")  and dismissed La Star's application. The ground for the FCC's action
was its finding that Star  Cellular, and not the  51% owner, SJI Cellular,  Inc.
("SJI"),  in fact controlled La Star. La Star, TDS and the Company have appealed
that order to the  United States Court  of Appeals of  the District of  Columbia
Circuit and those appeals are pending.

    In  a footnote  to its  decision, the FCC  stated, in  part, that "Questions
regarding the conduct of SJI and [the Company] in this case may be revisited  in
light  of the relevant findings and conclusions here in future proceedings where
the other  interests of  these parties  have decisional  significance."  Certain
adverse  parties have attempted to use the footnote in the LA STAR decision in a
number of  unrelated,  contested proceedings  which  TDS and  the  Company  have
pending  before  the  FCC.  In  addition,  since  the  LA  STAR  proceeding, FCC
authorizations in uncontested FCC proceedings  have been granted subject to  any
subsequent action the FCC may take concerning the LA STAR footnote.

    On  February 1, 1994, in a  proceeding involving a license originally issued
to TDS for a rural  service area in Wisconsin, the  FCC instituted a hearing  to
determine  whether in the La Star case  the Company had misrepresented facts to,
lacked candor in its dealings with or  attempted to mislead the FCC and, if  so,
whether  TDS  possesses  the  requisite character  qualifications  to  hold that
Wisconsin license. The FCC stated that, pending resolution of the issues in  the
Wisconsin  proceeding,  further  grants  to TDS  and  its  subsidiaries  will be
conditioned on the outcome of that proceeding. TDS was granted interim authority
to continue to operate the Wisconsin system pending completion of the hearing.

    An adverse finding  in the Wisconsin  hearing could result  in a variety  of
possible  sanctions, ranging from a  fine to loss of  the Wisconsin license, and
could, as stated in the FCC order, be raised and considered in other proceedings
involving TDS  and its  subsidiaries. TDS  and the  Company believe  they  acted
properly  in connection with the  La Star application and  that the findings and
record in  the La  Star proceeding  are  not relevant  in any  other  proceeding
involving their FCC license qualifications.

    TOWNES  TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., ET. AL. V. TDS, ET. AL.  Plaintiffs Townes
Telecommunications, Inc. ("Townes"), Tatum Telephone Company ("Tatum Telephone")
and Tatum Cellular  Telephone Company  ("Tatum Cellular")  filed a  suit in  the
District   Court   of   Rusk   County,  Texas,   against   both   TDS   and  the

                                                                              21
<PAGE>
Company as defendants.  Plaintiff Townes alleges  that it entered  into an  oral
agreement  with defendants which established a joint venture to develop cellular
business in  certain markets.  Townes alleges  that defendants  usurped a  joint
venture  opportunity  and  breached  fiduciary duties  to  Townes  by purchasing
interests in nonwireline markets in Texas RSA  #11 and the Tyler (Texas) MSA  on
their  own behalf  rather than on  behalf of  the alleged joint  venture. In its
Fifth Amended Original Petition, Townes seeks unspecified damages not to  exceed
$33  million for usurpation, breach of  fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, breach
of contract  and  tortious  interference.  Townes also  seeks  imposition  of  a
constructive  trust  on defendants'  profits from  Texas RSA  #11 and  the Tyler
(Texas) MSA and  transfer of those  interests to the  alleged joint venture.  In
addition  Townes  seeks reasonable  attorneys' fees  equal  to one-third  of the
judgment, along with  the prejudgment interest.  Plaintiffs Tatum Telephone  and
Tatum Cellular seek a declaration that transfers by defendants of a 49% interest
in  Tatum  Cellular  violated a  five-year  restriction on  alienation  of Tatum
Cellular shares contained in a written shareholders' agreement. Tatum  Telephone
and  Tatum Cellular seek to void the  transfers. All plaintiffs together seek as
much as $200 million in punitive damages.

    Defendants have asserted  meritorious defenses  to each  of the  plaintiffs'
claims  and are  vigorously defending  this case.  Discovery is  ongoing. A jury
trial in this case is set to commence on April 25, 1994.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                        ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  United  States  Cellular
Corporation  and  Subsidiaries  Annual Report  to  Shareholders  incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and  have issued our report thereon dated  February
7,   1994.  Our  report  on   the  consolidated  financial  statements  includes
explanatory paragraphs with respect  to the change in  the method of  accounting
for  cellular sales commissions and with respect  to the change in the method of
accounting for income taxes as discussed in Note 1 and Note 10, respectively, of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements and the uncertainties  discussed
in  Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and an explanatory
paragraph calling attention to certain litigation as discussed in Note 15 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Our audits  were  made  for the  purpose  of  forming an  opinion  on  those
financial  statements taken as a whole. The financial statement schedules listed
in Item 14(a)(2)  are the  responsibility of  the Company's  management and  are
presented   for  purposes  of   complying  with  the   Securities  and  Exchange
Commission's rules and  are not part  of the basic  financial statements.  These
financial  statement schedules  have been  subjected to  the auditing procedures
applied in the  audits of the  basic financial statements  and, in our  opinion,
fairly  state in  all material  respects the financial  data required  to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:

    The  accompanying combined  balance sheets of  the Los  Angeles SMSA Limited
Partnership, the  Nashville/Clarksville MSA  Limited Partnership  and the  Baton
Rouge  MSA Limited Partnership as of December  31, 1993 and 1992 and the related
combined statements of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash  flows
for  each of the  three years in the  period ended December  31, 1993, have been
prepared from  the  separate  financial  statements,  which  are  not  presented
separately  herein, of the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton
Rouge MSA limited  partnerships, as described  in Note 1.  We have reviewed  for
compilation  only the  accompanying combined  financial statements,  and, in our
opinion, those statements have been properly compiled from the amounts and notes
of the  underlying  separate  financial  statements of  the  Los  Angeles  SMSA,
Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton Rouge MSA limited partnerships, on the basis
described in Note 1.

    The statements for the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton
Rouge  MSA limited partnerships were  audited by other auditors  as set forth in
their reports included on pages 40 through 43. The report of the other  auditors
of the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership contains explanatory paragraphs with
respect  to the  uncertainties discussed in  the fourth and  fifth paragraphs of
Note 7.  We  have  not been  engaged  to  audit either  the  separate  financial
statements  of the aforementioned  limited partnerships or  the related combined
financial statements in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing  standards
and  to  render  an  opinion  as to  the  fair  presentation  of  such financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in "Change  in Accounting Principle" in  Note 2, the method  of
accounting for cellular sales commissions was changed effective January 1, 1991,
for  the Nashville/Clarksville MSA  Limited Partnership and  the Baton Rouge MSA
Limited Partnership.

To The Partners of
  LOS ANGELES SMSA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

    We have audited the balance sheets  of Los Angeles SMSA Limited  Partnership
as  of December  31, 1993  and 1992, and  the related  statements of operations,
partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993; such financial statements are not included separately herein.
These  financial  statements  are   the  responsibility  of  the   Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan  and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all material  respects, the financial  position of Los  Angeles SMSA Limited
Partnership as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and results of its operations  and
its  cash flows  for each of  the three years  in the period  ended December 31,
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in  Note 9  to the  financial statements,  two cellular  agents
filed  complaints  against  the Partnership.  The  outcome of  these  matters is
uncertain and, accordingly, no  accrual for these matters  has been made in  the
financial statements.

    In  addition, as discussed in Note 9,  a class action suit was filed against
the Partnership alleging  violations of  state and federal  antitrust laws.  The
outcome of this matter is uncertain and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter
has been made in the financial statements.

difference between net book value and proceeds received upon disposal.

    During  1993  and  1992,  one of  the  Partnerships  recorded  capital lease
additions of $827,000 and $513,000, respectively.

    Commitments for  future equipment  acquisitions amounted  to $22,734,000  at
December 31, 1993.

    On  January 10, 1994, one of the Partnerships entered into an agreement with
its major supplier to purchase $77 million in equipment.

    OTHER ASSETS

    Other assets consist primarily of the costs of acquiring the right to  serve
certain  customers previously served  by resellers and  are being amortized over
three  years  using  the  straight-line  method.  Accumulated  amortization  was
$4,806,000 and $2,797,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

    In the third quarter of 1991, the General Partner of two of the Partnerships
changed  its policy  of capitalizing certain  third party  sales commissions and
amortizing them over  the average  customer life. The  General Partner's  parent
effected   this  change  to  standardize   the  accounting  treatment  of  sales
commissions throughout its consolidated cellular operations. These amounts  will
be expensed in the period in which they are incurred by the agent. In 1991, this
change  in accounting principle was retroactively applied as of January 1, 1991.
Had the change not been made, 1991 net income before the cumulative effect of  a
change in accounting principle would have increased $1,838,000.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Revenues  from  operations primarily  consist  of charges  to  customers for
monthly access charges, cellular airtime usage, and roamer charges. Revenues are
recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues, resulting from  cellular
service  provided from the billing cycle date to  the end of each month and from
other cellular carriers' customers using the partnership's cellular systems  for
the last half of each month, are estimated and recorded as receivables. Unearned
monthly  access charges relating to the periods after month-end are deferred and
netted against accounts receivable.

                                                                              49

    INCOME TAXES

    No provisions have been  made for federal or  state income taxes since  such
taxes, if any, are the responsibility of the individual partners.

3.  LEASE COMMITMENTS:

    Future  minimum  rental payments  required under  operating leases  for real
estate that have initial  or remaining noncancellable lease  terms in excess  of
one year as of December 31, 1993, are as follows:

</TABLE>

    The initial lease terms generally range from 5 to 25 years with the majority
of them having initial terms of 10 years and providing for one renewal option of
5   years  and  for   rental  escalation.  Included   in  selling,  general  and
administrative expense are rental costs of $7,897,000, $5,996,000 and $4,463,000
for the years ended December 31, 1993,  1992 and 1991, respectively. One of  the
Partnerships  leases office  facilities under  a ten-year  lease agreement which
provides for free rent  incentives for six months  and rent escalation over  the
ten-year  period.  The Partnership  recognizes rent  expense on  a straight-line
basis and recorded  the related deferred  rent as a  noncurrent liability to  be
amortized as an adjustment to rental costs over the life of the lease.

4.  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION:

    One  of the Partnerships leases equipment under capital lease agreements. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, the amount of such equipment  included
in  property, plant and equipment is  $3,324,000 and $2,638,000 less accumulated
amortization of $1,914,000 and $1,451,000. Future minimum annual lease  payments
on noncancellable capital leases are as follows:

5.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

    Certain  affiliates of these cellular  limited partnerships provide services
for the system  operations, legal, financial,  management and administration  of
these  entities. These affiliates  are reimbursed for  both direct and allocated
costs (totaling $57.1 million in 1993 $52.2 million in 1992 and $50.0 million in
1991) related to providing these services. In addition, certain affiliates  have
established  a  credit facility  with  certain partnerships  to  provide working
capital  to  the  partnership.  One  of  the  partnerships  participates  in   a
centralized  cash management arrangement  with its general  partner. At December
31, 1993

and 1992, the interest-bearing balance amounted to $29,981,000 and  $16,074,000,
respectively. Effective January 1, 1989, the general partner pays or charges the
Partnership  monthly  interest,  computed using  the  general  partner's average
borrowing rate, on the amounts due  to or from the Partnership. Interest  earned
in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $1,294,000, $1,396,000 and $675,000, respectively.

6.  REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS:

    The  California  Public  Utilities  Commission (CPUC)  has  issued  an Order
Instituting Investigation of the regulation of cellular radiotelephone utilities
operating in the State of California under Order Number I.88-11-040. The  intent
of  the investigation was to determine the appropriate regulatory objectives for
the cellular  industry,  and  whether  current  regulations  applicable  to  the
cellular industry and its operators meet those objectives or should be modified.

    On  October 6, 1992,  the CPUC adopted  an Order which,  among other things,
imposes an accounting  methodology on cellular  utilities to separate  wholesale
and  retail costs, permits resellers to operate a reseller switch interconnected
to the cellular  carrier's facilities,  and requires the  unbundling of  certain
wholesale  rates to  the resellers.  On May 19,  1993, the  CPUC granted limited
rehearing of the decision. In addition,  the CPUC rescinded its order to  modify
the method for allocating costs between wholesale and retail operations.

    On December 17, 1993, the CPUC adopted a new Order Instituting Investigation
into  the regulation  of mobile  telephone service  and wireless communications,
Order Number I.93-12-007. The investigation proposes a regulatory program  which
would  encompass all  forms of mobile  telephone service. Currently,  one of the
Partnerships affected is unable to quantify  the precise impact of these  Orders
on  its future operations,  but that impact  may be material  to the Partnership
under certain circumstances.

    In January 1992, the CPUC commenced a separate investigation of all cellular
companies operating  in the  State to  determine their  compliance with  General
Order  number 159  (G.O. 159). The  investigation will  address whether cellular
utilities have complied with local,  state or federal regulations governing  the
approval  and construction of cellular  sites in the State.  The CPUC may advise
other agencies of violations in their jurisdictions.

    One of  the Partnerships  affected has  prepared and  filed the  information
requested  by the  CPUC. The  CPUC will review  the information  provided by the
Partnership and, if violations  of G.O. 159 are  found, it may assess  penalties
against  the Partnership.  The outcome  of this  investigation is  uncertain and
accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made.

7.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS:

    On June 28,  1993, an  applicant for  an unserved  area license  in the  Los
Angeles  market  filed  an  informal  objection  with  the  FCC  to  one  of the
Partnerships'  System  Information   Update  map.  The   applicant  claims   the
Partnership  was  not legally  authorized  to provide  service  in parts  of its
described service  area.  The  applicant  requests  that  the  FCC  correct  the
Partnership's  service area to eliminate such  areas and suggests the FCC impose
"such sanctions as it deems appropriate." The Partnership filed a response  with
the FCC in which it reported that, in its review of the applicant's allegations,
it  found certain errors that were made in its filings but disputed any of these
were intentional. The  FCC could  assess penalties against  the Partnership  for
nonconformance  with its license.  The outcome of  this matter remains uncertain
and, accordingly, the Partnership has  not recorded an accrual. The  Partnership
intends to defend its position vigorously.

    The  Partnership filed for  its 10-year license renewal  for the Los Angeles
market on  August 30,  1993. The  Partnership is  currently operating  with  FCC
authority  while  the renewal  application is  pending  resolution of  the FCC's
decision on  claims mentioned  above.  The Partnership  fully expects  that  its
license will be renewed.

                                                                              51

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

    Two  agents of  a competing  carrier have named  one of  the Partnerships in
several  complaints  against  the  carrier.  The  general  allegations   include
violations  of California  Unfair Practices Act  and price  fixing. The ultimate
outcome of both these actions is uncertain at this time. Accordingly, no accrual
for these contingencies  has been made.  The Partnership intends  to defend  its
position vigorously.

    On  November 24,  1993, a  class action  suit was  filed against  one of the
Partnerships and another cellular carrier  alleging conspiracy to fix the  price
of  cellular  service in  violation  of state  and  federal antitrust  laws. The
plaintiffs are seeking  substantial monetary  damages and  injunctive relief  in
excess   of  $100  million.  The  outcome  of  this  matter  is  uncertain  and,
accordingly, the  Partnership  has  not recorded  an  accrual.  The  Partnership
intends to defend its position vigorously.

    One  of the Partnerships is a party to various other lawsuits arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based on a review  of
such  litigation with legal counsel, any losses resulting from these actions are
not expected to materially impact the financial condition of the Partnership.

    Two  of  the  Partnerships  provide  cellular  service  and  sell   cellular
telephones  to diversified groups of  consumers within concentrated geographical
areas. The  general partner  performs credit  evaluations of  the  Partnerships'
customers  and generally does not  require collateral. Receivables are generally
due within  30  days.  Credit  losses related  to  customers  have  been  within
management's expectations.

    One  of the Partnerships  purchases substantially all  of its equipment from
one supplier.

    The General Partner of two of the Partnerships entered into agreements  with
an  equipment vendor on behalf of  the Partnerships to replace the Partnerships'
cellular equipment with new cellular  technology which will support both  analog
and digital voice transmissions.

                        SUMMARY OF 1993 BONUS PROGRAM FOR
                            SENIOR CORPORATE STAFF OF
                       UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION


          The objectives of the 1993 Bonus Program for Senior Corporate Staff
(the "1993 Bonus Plan") of United States Cellular Corporation ("USM") are: (i)
to provide suitable incentives for the senior corporate management of USM to
extend their best efforts to achieve superior results in relation to key
performance targets, (ii) to suitably reward USM's senior corporate management
team in relation to their success in meeting and exceeding these performance
targets, and (iii) to help USM attract and retain talented management personnel
in positions of critical importance to the success of USM.  A team performance
award and an individual performance award are available under the 1993 Bonus
Plan.

          For target performance on the team and individual categories, the 1993
Bonus Plan was designed to generate a targeted 1993 bonus pool equal to the
total of 25% of the aggregate of the base salaries of the Company's executive
officers other than the President.  Under the 1993 Bonus Plan, the size of the
target bonus pool is increased or decreased depending on USM's 1993 achievements
with respect to the performance categories.  No bonus pool is paid under such
plan if minimum performance levels are not achieved in these categories.  The
maximum bonus pool that could be generated, which would require exceptional
performance in all areas, would equal the total of 40% of the aggregate base
salaries of the Company's executive officers.  At target performance, the bonus
pool would be equal to 25% of the aggregate salaries of the Company's executive
officers other than the President.  Of this percentage, 7.5% represents a
targeted individual performance award and a total of 17.5% represents a targeted
team bonus award.  The targeted team award includes a discretionary team award
of 3.5% and an objective award which represents 14% of the targeted award of
25%.  The objective performance categories include (i) the increase in net
revenue subscribers (4.375% of the targeted award), (ii) the increase in
earnings before interest and taxes (7.0% of the targeted award) and (iii) the
increase in net service revenues (2.625% of the targeted amount).

          The discretionary team performance category, representing 3.5% of the
targeted award of 25%, permits the participants to earn bonus dollars through
USM's performance and their individual performance in areas not measured or not
adequately measured by objective team performance categories.  The President of
USM determines a bonus percentage to award for discretionary team performance
and presents his recommendation to the Chairman for his approval.  This decision
is made in a similar manner to that described above for the base salary decision
and is based primarily on an assessment of the team performance in general,
considering all facts and circumstances.  This award may range from 40% of the
targeted award for adequate



<PAGE>
performance on a team level to 160% of the targeted award for outstanding
performance on a team level.

          The 1993 Bonus Plan also provides a discretionary individual
performance category, representing 7.5% of the targeted percentage of 25%, to
permit the participants to earn bonus dollars through USM's performance and
their individual performance in areas not measured or not adequately measured by
team performance categories.  The President of USM determines a bonus percentage
to award for discretionary individual performance and presents his
recommendation to the Chairman for his approval.  This decision is made based
primarily on an assessment of the executive's personal performance.  This award
may range from 40% of the targeted award for adequate performance on an
individual basis to 160% of the targeted award for outstanding performance on an
individual basis.

UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION
INCORPORATED PORTIONS OF 1993 ANNUAL REPORT TO SECURITY HOLDERS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" or "USM") owns, operates and
invests in cellular markets throughout the United States. USM owns or has the
right to acquire both majority and minority interests in 205 cellular markets at
December 31, 1993, representing 23,731,000 population equivalents ("pops"). USM
manages the operations of 136 cellular markets at December 31, 1993 and expects
to manage the operations of eight additional markets. Interests in the 61
remaining markets are managed by others. All 61 of these markets were served by
operational systems at December 31, 1993. The following table is a summary of
the Company's markets and consolidated operations.

     Some markets were not in operation in 1991.
</TABLE>

The Company's consolidated results of operations include 100% of the revenues
and expenses of the systems serving majority-owned and managed markets plus its
corporate office operations. The December 31, 1993 consolidated results of
operations include 116 markets with a total population of 19.4 million, compared
to 92 markets with a total population of 15.0 million, in 1992 and 67 markets
with a total population of 11.5 million, in 1991.

Investment income includes the Company's share of the net income or loss of the
minority-owned and managed markets and also includes the Company's share of the
net income or loss of those markets managed by others for which the Company
follows the equity method of accounting. USM follows the cost method of
accounting for its remaining interests in markets managed by others. (See Note 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) This information is shown in the

</TABLE>

Operating results for 1993 primarily reflect improvement in the Company's more
established markets (those 67 markets consolidated at December 31, 1991), a full
year's operations from the 26 markets added to the consolidated group in 1992,
the acquisition of majority interests in 22 operational markets and the start-up
expenses associated with initiating operations in three additional
majority-owned and managed markets during 1993. Operating revenues, driven
primarily by increases in customers served, rose $83.2 million, or 51%.
Operating expenses rose $79.1 million, or 45%. Operating cash flow (operating
loss before minority share plus depreciation and amortization expense) increased
$19.4 million, or 115%.

<PAGE>

Investment and other income decreased $21.0 million due primarily to gains
recognized on the sale or exchange of cellular interests totaling $31.4 million
in 1992 while gains from sales transactions in 1993 totaled $4.9 million.
Investment income increased $4.5 million due to improved results in markets
managed by others. Interest expense increased $13.1 million primarily due to
increased borrowings under a Revolving Credit Agreement with USM's parent
company, Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. ("TDS"). USM used financing from TDS
as a major source of external funding requirements during 1993. Net (loss)
totaled ($25.4 million) in 1993 compared to net income of $6.2 million in 1992,
primarily reflecting the larger gains in 1992 and additional interest expense in
1993, offset somewhat by improved operating results in 1993. On a comparable
basis (net of tax), excluding nonrecurring and unusual items, net loss increased
23% to $30.3 million as compared to $24.6 million during 1992.

The Company expects to add 14 additional markets to consolidated operations by
the end of 1994. The Company currently owns a minority interest in and manages
eight of these markets. The Company expects to acquire a majority interest in
these eight and six additional markets by the end of 1994. Management
anticipates that operating losses from and funding requirements for these
acquired markets and for markets which recently began operations could result in
operating losses for the Company over the next several quarters.

OPERATING REVENUES
OPERATING REVENUES totaled $247.3 million in 1993, up $83.2 million, or 51%,
over 1992. Operating revenues totaled $164.1 million in 1992, up $64.6 million,
or 65%, over 1991. The effect of market acquisitions and start-ups increased
operating revenues $26.2 million, or 16%, in 1993 and $31.7 million, or 32%, in
1992. This effect is defined as: (1) the operations of markets added to the
consolidated group in the current year since their respective dates of
acquisition, plus (2) for any market added to the consolidated group in the
previous year, the portion of current year operations which correspond to that
portion of the previous year prior to the market's addition to the consolidated
group.

SERVICE REVENUES primarily consist of: (i) charges for access, airtime and
value-added services provided to the Company's local retail customers who use
the local systems operated by the Company; (ii) charges to customers of other
systems who use the Company's cellular systems when roaming ("inbound roamer");
(iii) charges for the Company's customers' use of systems other than their local
systems ("pass-through roamer"); and (iv) charges for long-distance calls made
on the Company's systems. Service revenues totaled $236.7 million in 1993, up
$81.9 million, or 53%, over 1992. Service revenues totaled $154.8 million in
1992, up $62.8 million, or 68%, over 1991. These increases were primarily due to
the growing number of local retail customers and the growth in inbound roamer
revenue. The effects of acquisitions increased service revenues $25.2 million,
or 16%, in 1993 and $30.2 million, or 33%, in 1992. Average monthly service
revenue per customer totaled $99 in 1993 compared to $105 in 1992 and $100 in
1991. The 6% decrease in average monthly service revenue per customer in 1993
was primarily a result of the decline in average local minutes of use per retail
customer and a decrease in per customer pass-through roamer revenue. The 5%
increase in average monthly service revenue per customer in 1992 was primarily a
result of the increase in inbound roamer revenue. This increase more than offset
the decrease in local retail revenue due to the decline in average local minutes
of use per retail customer. Management anticipates that average monthly service
revenue per customer will continue to decrease as local minutes of use per
customer decline and as the growth rate of the Company's customer base exceeds
the growth rate of inbound roamer revenue.

REVENUE FROM LOCAL CUSTOMERS' usage of USM's systems increased $40.5 million, or
53%, in 1993 and $26.8 million, or 53%, in 1992. Growth in the number of
customers in the systems serving the Company's consolidated markets was the
primary reason for the increase in local revenue. The number of customers
increased 73% to 261,000 at December 31, 1993 from 150,800 at December 31, 1992.
The number of customers increased 56% in 1992, up from 97,000 at December 31,
1991. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions, the Company's
consolidated markets added 86,600 customers in 1993. Of these additions, 72,400
were in markets in service and consolidated at December 31, 1992, representing a
48% increase over the 150,800 customers served at December 31, 1992.


<PAGE>

While the percentage increase is expected to be lower in future periods,
management anticipates that the total number of net customer additions will
increase. The effects of acquisitions increased local revenue $8.7 million, or
11%, in 1993 and $10.2 million, or 20%, in 1992.

Average monthly retail revenue per customer declined to $49 in 1993 from $52 in
1992 and $55 in 1991. Monthly local minutes of use per customer averaged 103 in
1993 compared to 121 in 1992 and 130 in 1991. This decline in average local
minutes of use follows an industry-wide trend and is believed to be related to
the tendency of the early customers in a market to be the heaviest users. It
also reflects the Company's and the industry's continued penetration of the
consumer market, which tends to include more lower-usage customers.

INBOUND ROAMER REVENUE increased $31.6 million, or 68%, in 1993 and $24.5
million, or 110%, in 1992. These increases are attributable to increases in the
number of customers from other systems using the Company's systems when roaming.
Also contributing were the increased number of Company-managed systems and cell
sites within those systems. Monthly inbound roamer revenue per customer averaged
$33 in 1993, $32 in 1992 and $24 in 1991. The effects of acquisitions increased
inbound roamer revenue $11.9 million, or 26%, in 1993 and $15.5 million, or 70%,
in 1992.

PASS-THROUGH ROAMER REVENUE increased $5.2 million, or 27%, in 1993 and $7.8
million, or 67%, in 1992. The primary reason for the increases were the growth
in the number of customers in the Company's consolidated markets using systems
other than their local systems. Monthly pass-through roamer revenue per customer
averaged $10 in 1993 and $13 in 1992 and 1991.

LONG-DISTANCE REVENUE increased $4.4 million, or 46%, in 1993 and $4.2 million,
or 77%, in 1992 as the volume of long-distance calls made on the Company's
systems increased. Monthly long-distance revenue per customer averaged $6 in
1993, 1992 and 1991.

EQUIPMENT SALES REVENUES totaled $10.5 million in 1993, up $1.2 million, or 13%,
over 1992. Equipment sales revenues totaled $9.3 million in 1992, up $1.8
million, or 24%, over 1991. Equipment sales reflect the sale of 83,000, 44,400
and 29,400 cellular telephone units in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, plus
installation revenue. The average revenue per unit was $127 in 1993 compared to
$208 in 1992 and $255 in 1991. The average revenue per unit decline partially
reflects the Company's decision to reduce sales prices on cellular telephones to
increase the number of customers, to maintain its market position and to meet
competitive prices as well as to reflect reduced manufacturers' prices. Also,
during the second half of 1993, the Company used specific promotions which were
based on increased equipment discounting.  The success of these promotions led
to both an increase in units sold and a decrease in average equipment sales
revenue per unit. The effects of acquisitions increased equipment sales revenues
$1.0 million, or 11%, in 1993 and $1.5 million, or 20%, in 1992.

OPERATING EXPENSES
OPERATING EXPENSES totaled $255.9 million in 1993, up $79.1 million, or 45%,
over 1992. Operating expenses totaled $176.8 million, up $60.5 million, or 52%,
over 1991. The effect of market acquisitions and start-ups increased expenses
$33.6 million, or 19%, in 1993 and $38.1 million, or 33%, in 1992.

SYSTEM OPERATIONS EXPENSES increased $18.9 million, or 39%, in 1993 and $17.6
million, or 57%, in 1992 as a result of increases in customer usage expenses and
costs associated with operating the Company's increased number of cellular
systems and increased number of cell sites within those systems. Costs are
expected to continue to increase as the number of cell sites within these
systems grows. Customer usage expenses represent charges from other
telecommunications service providers for USM's customers' use of their
facilities as well as for the Company's inbound roamer traffic on these
facilities. These expenses include local interconnection to the landline
network, toll charges and roamer expenses from the Company's customers' use of
systems other than their local systems. Customer usage expenses grew $13.5
million, or 36%, in 1993 and $15.7 million, or 72%, in 1992 primarily due to the
increase in roamer expenses. Customer usage expenses represented 22% of service
revenues in 1993 and 24% in 1992 and 1991. Maintenance, utility and cell site
expenses grew $5.4 million, or 49%, in 1993 and $1.9 million, or 22%, in 1992
primarily reflecting increases in the number of

<PAGE>

cell sites in the systems serving all majority-owned and managed markets, from
186 in 1991 to 320 in 1992 to 522 in 1993. The effects of acquisitions increased
system operations expenses $8.6 million, or 18%, in 1993 and $10.2 million, or
33%, in 1992.

MARKETING AND SELLING EXPENSES increased $12.8 million, or 42%, in 1993 and
$12.6 million, or 70%, in 1992. Marketing and selling expenses primarily consist
of salaries, commissions and expenses of field sales personnel, agent
commissions, promotional expenses, local advertising and public relations
expenses. The 1993 increase was primarily due to a 66% rise in the number of
gross customer activations, from 85,400 in 1992 to 141,700 in 1993. Excluding
acquisitions and dispositions, the Company added 86,600 net new customers in
1993 compared to 50,600 in 1992, a 71% increase. The 1992 increase in marketing
and selling expense was primarily due to the increased number of gross customer
activations and the use of various marketing programs which increased
promotional expense. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Company added
49% more net new customers in 1992 compared to 1991. The effects of acquisitions
increased marketing and selling expenses $4.8 million, or 16%, in 1993 and $5.8
million, or 32%, in 1992.

COST OF EQUIPMENT SOLD increased $8.4 million, or 48%, in 1993 and $3.7 million,
or 28%, in 1992. The increase reflects the increased unit sales related to both
the rise in gross customer activations made through the Company's direct sales
channels and the third and fourth quarter 1993 promotional sales which were
discussed previously, offset somewhat by falling manufacturer prices per unit.
The average cost to the Company of a telephone unit sold, including accessories
and installation, was $309 in 1993 compared to $390 in 1992 and $462 in 1991.
The effects of acquisitions increased cost of goods sold $2.6 million, or 15%,
in 1993 and $2.4 million, or 18%, in 1992.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES increased $23.6 million, or 47%, in 1993 and
$16.2 million, or 47%, in 1992. These expenses include the cost of operating the
Company's local business offices and its corporate expenses. This increase
includes the effects of an increase in the number of consolidated markets,
increases in expenses required to serve the growing customer base in existing
markets and an expansion of both local office and corporate staff, necessitated
by growth in the Company's business and the start-up and acquisition of
additional operations. The Company is using its clustering concept to combine
local operations wherever feasible in order to reduce its administrative
expenses. The effects of acquisitions increased direct field-related general and
administrative expenses $8.3 million, or 16%, in 1993 and $10.2 million, or 29%,
in 1992.

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE increased $9.1 million, or 55%, in 1993, reflecting an
increase in the average fixed asset balance of 56% since 1992. Depreciation
expense increased $7.8 million, or 88%, in 1992, reflecting an increase in the
average fixed asset balance of 77% since 1991. The effects of acquisitions
increased depreciation expense $3.1 million, or 19%, in 1993 and $4.0 million,
or 46%, in 1992.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased $6.3 million, or 49%, in 1993 and $2.6
million, or 25%, in 1992, primarily due to increases in license costs as a
result of the acquisitions of or the commencement of service in 25 markets
during 1993 and 26 markets during 1992. License costs related to consolidated
markets increased $310 million, or 63%, in 1993 and $183 million, or 59%, in
1992. Effective January 1, 1992, the Company prospectively changed its
amortization period for license costs from 20 years to 40 years to conform with
industry practices. Amortization expense was reduced by $4.5 million in 1992 due
to this change.

OPERATING LOSS BEFORE MINORITY SHARE
OPERATING LOSS BEFORE MINORITY SHARE totaled $8.7 million in 1993 compared to
$12.7 million in 1992 and $16.8 million in 1991. The operating loss margin
improved to (4%) in 1993 from (8%) in 1992 and (17%) in 1991. The decrease in
the 1993 operating loss reflects improved results in the more established
markets and increased revenues resulting from the growth in the number of
customers served by the Company's systems, partially offset by costs associated
with the growth of the Company's operations, increased losses on equipment sales
and increased system start-up expenses. The decrease in 1992 operating loss
reflects the improved results in the more established markets, growth in the
number of customers served by the Company's systems and the change in the
license cost amortization period, offset somewhat by system start-up expenses,


<PAGE>

increased losses on equipment sales and the costs associated with the growth of
the Company's operations. The effects of acquisitions increased operating loss
$7.3 million, or 58%, in 1993 and $6.4 million, or 38%, in 1992.

The Company expects service revenues to continue to grow during the next few
quarters as it continues to add customers and cell sites to its existing
systems, realizes a full year of revenues from customers and cell sites added in
1993, acquires the operations of existing markets and begins operations in new
markets. Additionally, the Company expects expenses to increase significantly in
the next few quarters as it incurs expenses for markets and cell sites added in
1993, incurs expenses associated with customer and system growth, acquires
existing markets and initiates service in new markets. At least 14 additional
markets are expected to be added to consolidated operations before the end of
1994. Of these, 13 markets (eight of which are currently minority-owned and
managed by the Company) were operational at December 31, 1993. The Company
expects to acquire a majority interest in these markets, and one nonoperational
market, before the end of 1994. Upon the commencement of operations in the new
markets and upon completion of any related acquisitions, the Company will begin
to amortize the related license costs. The Company expects that the costs
related to acquiring, constructing and operating its markets may exceed revenues
over the next few quarters. As a result, operating losses before minority share
could be generated over the next few quarters.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME
INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME totaled $22.6 million in 1993, $43.6 million in
1992 and $10.4 million in 1991. Investment income was $16.9 million in 1993
compared to $12.5 million in 1992 and $8.0 million in 1991. The Company's
share of the income or loss from the markets managed by others that are
accounted for by the equity method totaled $16.8 million in 1993 compared to
$13.0 million in 1992 and $9.7 million in 1991. There were 15 such markets in
1993 compared to 13 in 1992 and 1991. The Company's share of income from
minority-owned markets it manages totaled $143,000 in 1993 compared to losses
of $499,000 in 1992 and $1.7 million in 1991. There were 18 such markets
in 1993 and 1992 and 17 in 1991.

INTEREST INCOME was $2.7 million in 1993 compared to $3.2 million in 1992 and
1991. The $529,000, or 17%, decline in 1993 reflects primarily decreased loans
to unconsolidated subsidiaries and lower interest rates in 1993.

OTHER (EXPENSE), NET was $915,000 in 1993, $2.8 million in 1992 and $224,000 in
1991. In 1993, other (expense), net was reduced by both the sale of the
Company's customer base in its reseller operation and income recognized related
to the settlements of disputes concerning two of the Company's markets. Income
related to these transactions totaled $495,000 and $925,000, respectively. Also
in 1993, other (expense), net was increased by the writeoff of equipment no
longer used which totaled $677,000. In 1992, $1.3 million of costs applicable to
unsuccessful license applications and acquisitions were charged to expense.

GAIN ON SALE OF CELLULAR INTERESTS of $4.9 million in 1993 reflects the sale of
two cellular minority interests. In 1992, the $31.4 million gain includes a
$17.1 million gain from the completion of a sale to another company in which the
Company divested its 100% interest in a market it managed, an $11.4 million gain
on the exchange of cellular interests with another cellular company and a $2.9
million gain from the sale of an additional minority interest. (See "Financial
Resources and Liquidity" and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.) In 1991, the $557,000 gain reflects the sale of two cellular
minority interests.

INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES
INTEREST EXPENSE increased $13.1 million, or 65%, in 1993 and $3.7 million, or
22%, in 1992, on 66% and 72% increases, respectively, in the average amount of
debt outstanding. Interest expense is primarily related to borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS and borrowings under a vendor financing
agreement. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a
floating rate equal to prime plus 1.5% (for a rate of 7.5% at December 31, 1993)
and are used to finance the acquisitions of cellular interests, system
construction and losses related to system development, and investments in and
advances to entities in which the Company has a minority interest. Interest
expense relating to the Revolving Credit Agreement was $29.1 million in 1993,
$16.8 million in 1992 and $14.6 million in 1991. The average amount of debt
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement was $372.8 million in 1993,
$216.0 million in 1992 and $138.6 million in 1991. The average interest rate
on such debt was 7.5% in 1993, 7.8% in 1992 and 10.0% in 1991.

Most of the borrowings under the vendor financing agreement bear interest at a
rate of 2.3% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of high-grade, unsecured
notes (for a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 1993). The remainder of the borrowings
bear interest at a rate approximating the prime rate (6.0% at December 31,
1993). Borrowings under the vendor financing agreement were used to finance
certain of USM's equipment purchases and construction costs. Interest expense
related to the vendor financing agreement was approximately $4.0 million in
1993, $3.1 million in 1992 and $1.4 million in 1991. The average amount of debt
under the vendor financing agreement was $66.4 million in 1993, $48.8 million in
1992 and $15.4 million in 1991. The average interest rate on such debt was 5.7%
in 1993, 6.2% in 1992 and 7.7% in 1991.

<PAGE>

The completion of pending acquisitions, continued capital expenditures,
operating losses and investments in and advances to entities in which the
Company has a minority interest will require additional funding over the next
few years. These funding requirements are anticipated to be at least partially
met through additional debt, which will likely result in increased interest
expense as debt balances increase. Additional borrowings also may be required to
fund additional future acquisitions and their construction and operations. See
"Financial Resources and Liquidity."

The Company completed a rights offering to its common shareholders on November
15, 1993, which resulted in the reduction of approximately $378 million in debt
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. See "Financial Resources and
Liquidity."

INCOME TAX EXPENSE was $2.7 million in 1993, $2.0 million in 1992 and $16,000 in
1991. Income tax expense includes the federal taxes of a consolidated subsidiary
not included in the TDS consolidated federal income tax return. State income tax
expense in 1993 was primarily related to subsidiaries generating taxable income
after utilization of state net operating losses. The 1992 income tax expense
resulted primarily from state income taxes generated by the gains on the sale
and exchange of cellular interests completed in the first half of 1992. No such
taxes were generated by the 1993 or 1991 gains. The Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of the new principle on years
prior to 1993 had an immaterial effect on net loss and loss per share. Income
tax expense for 1993 reflects the new accounting principle. Income tax expense
amounts for 1992 and 1991 have not been restated.

USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members
of the TDS consolidated group. TDS and USM are parties to a Tax Allocation
Agreement under which USM is able to carry forward its losses and credits and
use them to offset any current or future income tax liabilities to TDS. The
amount of the federal net operating loss carryforward available to offset future
taxable income aggregated approximately $148.2 million at December 31, 1993, and
expires between 2002 and 2008.

The amount of the state net operating loss carryforward available to offset
future taxable income aggregated approximately $197.1 million at December 31,
1993, and expires between 1998 and 2008.

NET (LOSS) INCOME
NET (LOSS) INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
totaled ($25.4 million) in 1993 compared to $6.2 million in 1992 and ($24.4
million) in 1991. The 1993 net loss resulted from improved operating results in
the established markets, increased investment income and the $4.9 million gain
on the sale of cellular interests, offset by increased interest expense and the
effects of the addition of new markets. The 1992 net income reflects the $31.4
million gain on the sale or exchange of cellular interests and improved
operating results offset by increased interest and income tax expense.
CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE reflects the ($10.3
million) effect on years prior to 1991 of the change in the Company's and two of
its equity-method investees' method of accounting for sales commissions. NET
(LOSS) INCOME totaled ($25.4 million) in 1993, $6.2 million in 1992 and ($34.6
million) in 1991. On a comparable basis (net of tax), excluding nonrecurring and
unusual items, net loss increased 23% to $30.3 million in 1993 and decreased 1%
to $24.6 million in 1992.

NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLE was ($.45) in 1993 compared to $.11 in 1992 and ($.63) in 1991. The
weighted average number of Common and Series A Common Shares outstanding for
1993 decreased 1% over the shares outstanding for 1992 primarily as a result of
Common Shares issued in connection with acquisitions and the 1993 rights
offering offset by the addition of dilutive common stock equivalents in 1992 as
a result of the 1992 net income. The weighted average number of Common and
Series A Common Shares outstanding for 1992 increased 49% over the shares
outstanding for 1991 primarily as a result of the addition of dilutive common
stock equivalents, Common Shares issued in connection with acquisitions and a
1991 public offering and related debt conversion. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE
IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE PER SHARE was ($.26) in 1991. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER
SHARE was ($.45) in 1993, $.11 in 1992 and ($.89) in 1991, primarily reflecting
improved operating results in 1993, the gain on the sale or exchange of cellular
interests in 1992, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
in 1991 and the increase in weighted average shares outstanding. On a comparable
basis (net of tax), excluding nonrecurring and unusual items, net (loss) per
share rose 8% to ($.53) in 1993 and declined 9% to ($.49) in 1992.

TDS owned an aggregate of 59,548,450 shares of common stock of the Company at
December 31, 1993, representing over 85% of the combined total of the Company's
outstanding Common and Series A Common Shares and over 97% of their combined
voting power. Assuming the Company's Common Shares are issued in all instances
in which the Company has the choice to issue its Common Shares or other
consideration and assuming all issuances of the Company's common stock to TDS
and third parties for completed and pending acquisitions and redemptions of the
Company's Preferred Stock and TDS's Preferred Shares had been completed at
December 31, 1993, TDS would have owned approximately 79.5% of the total
outstanding common stock of the Company and

<PAGE>

controlled over 95% of the combined voting power of both classes of its common
stock. In the event TDS's ownership of the Company falls below 80% of the total
value of all of the outstanding shares of the Company's stock, TDS and the
Company would be deconsolidated for federal income tax purposes. TDS and the
Company have the ability to defer or prevent deconsolidation, if deferring or
preventing deconsolidation would be advantageous, by delivering TDS Common
Shares and/or cash, in lieu of the Company's Common Shares in connection with
certain acquisitions.

INFLATION
Management believes that inflation affects the Company's business to no greater
extent than the general economy.

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" which requires employers to
recognize the obligation to provide benefits to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement. Based on a study of the provisions of
SFAS No. 112, the Company has determined that it should not have a material
impact on results of operations or financial condition.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES
The FASB issued SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," in May 1993, which becomes effective in January 1994. SFAS
No. 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments
in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified in one of three
categories; a) held-to-maturity securities, reported at amortized cost;
b) trading securities, reported at fair value; and c) available-for-sale
securities, reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded
from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Based on a review of the provisions of SFAS No. 115, management believes that
implementation will not have a material effect on results of operations or
financial condition.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company operates a capital- and marketing-intensive business. Rapid growth
in markets operated by the Company and customers served has caused financing
requirements for acquisitions, construction and operations to exceed internally
generated cash flow. The Company requires capital to complete acquisitions in
process; to fund construction and operating expenses of the cellular systems it
operates; to fund investments in minority partnership interests in other
cellular markets; and to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt.
Management anticipates that each new cellular market the Company acquires and
places in service will require significant capital expenditures and will incur
substantial losses during its initial operating stage. The Company has
experienced operating losses and net losses in all but a few quarters since its
inception. The Company has obtained substantial funds from external sources
during the past several years.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES provided $35.3 million in 1993 and $3.5
million in 1992 and required $18.9 million in 1991. Operating cash flow
(operating loss before minority share plus depreciation and amortization
expense) provided cash totaling $36.4 million in 1993, $16.9 million in 1992 and
$2.4 million in 1991. The 1993 increase in operating cash flow primarily
reflects improvement in the more mature markets. The effects of acquisitions
increased operating cash flow $1.8 million, or 11%, in 1993 and $3.2 million, or
130%, in 1992. The 1992 increase reflects improvement in the more mature
markets. Cash flows from other operating activities (investment and other
income, interest expense, changes in working capital and changes in other assets
and liabilities) required cash investments totaling $1.1 million in 1993, $13.4
million in 1992 and $21.3 million in 1991.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES provided $65.4 million in 1993, $57.5
million in 1992 and $106.2 million in 1991. Cash flows from financing activities
include cash flows from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS
and vendor financing transactions and sales of Common Shares. Borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS totaling $45.4 million provided a
majority of the Company's external financing requirements in 1993. The sale of
Common Shares to parties other than TDS in connection with the rights offering
pro-


<PAGE>

vided an additional $36.8 million of the Company's external financing
requirements. In connection with the rights offering, debt to TDS under the
Revolving Credit Agreement was reduced by $340.7 million upon the issuance to
TDS of 4.8 million Common Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares.
Borrowings under the vendor financing arrangement totaling $36.6 million
provided a majority of the Company's external financing requirements in 1992.
Increases in the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement also
provided $22.2 million of external financing in 1992. Increases in the amount
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $49.3 million and the sale
of 2.0 million Common Shares to the public at $18 per share provided most of the
Company's external financing requirements during 1991. Proceeds to the Company,
after the underwriting discount, amounted to $34.4 million. In connection with
the 1991 public offering, the Company converted $110 million of notes payable
under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Demand Notes with TDS into 6.1 million
Common Shares.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES required cash totaling $98.6 million in
1993, $69.6 million in 1992 and $84.1 million in 1991. Such cash requirements
primarily consisted of cash additions to property, plant and equipment and cash
requirements for acquisitions and for investments in cellular markets. Cash
expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $91.5 million in 1993 (of
which $6.6 million relates to 1992 additions), representing the construction of
138 cell sites and other plant additions. Cash expenditures for property, plant
and equipment totaled $56.1 million in 1992 (of which $2.8 million relates to
1991 additions), representing the construction of 107 cell sites and other plant
additions. Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $59.5
million in 1991 (of which $3.1 million relates to 1990 additions), representing
the construction of 67 cell sites and other plant additions.

Anticipated capital requirements for 1994 reflect the Company's construction and
system expansion program, funding of anticipated operating losses and working
capital needs, investments in entities in which the Company has a minority
interest, scheduled debt repayments and pending acquisitions. The Company's
consolidated construction budget for 1994 is approximately $160 million,
including anticipated expenditures for both enhancements to existing systems and
construction of new systems. Planned expenditures for enhancements of existing
majority-owned cellular systems, including additional radio channel capacity as
well as new cell sites, total about $140 million. Anticipated expenditures for
construction of switching offices and digital expansion total $7 million.
Investments in partnerships, primarily in minority-owned and managed markets,
are expected to total $5 million in 1994.

The Company is expanding its operations through acquisitions.  During 1993, the
Company completed the acquisition of controlling interests in 25 markets and
several additional minority interests. During 1992, the Company completed the
acquisition of controlling interests in 16 markets and several additional
minority interests. During 1991, the Company completed the acquisition of
controlling interests in 41 markets and several additional minority interests.
Some of the markets acquired during 1993, 1992 and 1991 were subject to
acquisition agreements which were entered into prior to the year in which
acquisitions were completed. The following table summarizes the consideration
issued for these acquisitions.

Of the 1993 consideration, the debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement and 5.5
million of the USM Common Shares were issued to TDS to reimburse TDS for TDS
Common Shares issued and cash paid to third parties in connection with 1993
acquisitions. Of the 1992 consideration, the debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement and 2.8 million of the USM Common Shares were issued to TDS to
reimburse TDS for TDS Common and Series A Common Shares issued and cash paid to
third parties in connection with 1992 acquisitions. Of the 1991 consideration,
the Demand Notes, the debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the accounts
payable, the shares of Preferred Stock and 1.2 million of the USM Common Shares
were issued to TDS to reimburse TDS for TDS Common Shares

<PAGE>

and shares of TDS Preferred Stock issued and cash paid to third parties in
connection with 1991 acquisitions. Additionally, the Company had commitments to
issue 5.0 million Common Shares in 1994 through 1996 related to certain
completed acquisitions. The Company and TDS have the option to deliver TDS
Common Shares and/or cash in lieu of the Company's Common Shares in connection
with certain of these acquisitions. In January, 1994, 3.9 million Common Shares
were issued to third parties in connection with these commitments.

Included in the acquisitions in the table are the transfers of interests in one
market from TDS in 1993, five in 1992 and 25 in 1991, representing 35,000,
508,000 and 1.8 million population equivalents, respectively. The 1993 transfer
was completed by the issuance of 31,000 USM Common Shares and 75,000 USM Series
A Common Shares. The 1992 transfer was completed by the issuance of 742,000 USM
Common Shares and 924,000 USM Series A Common Shares. The 1991 transfer was
completed by the issuance of 1.9 million USM Common Shares and 4.6 million USM
Series A Common Shares. The USM Common and Series A Common Shares were recorded
at TDS's book value of the market transferred, rather than the fair market value
of the shares, due to the intercompany nature of the transaction.

In addition to the acquisitions in the table, in 1992 the Company completed the
exchange of cellular interests involving the acquisition by USM of controlling
interests in two markets and the remaining minority interest in a market managed
by USM. In exchange for these interests, USM transferred its 100% interest in
two markets, its minority interest in two markets and $2.9 million in cash.

The Company has an ongoing acquisition program, the funding requirements of
which may be substantial. The Company maintains an ongoing acquisition program
to seek to maximize its future potential, including seeking opportunities to
combine operations and achieve increased economies of scale. These economies of
scale include the sharing of market personnel, equipment and office resources.
The Company plans to continue its acquisition program as long as it is feasible
to acquire cellular interests that fit into its business objectives.

At December 31, 1993, the Company, or TDS for the benefit of the Company, had
entered into agreements to acquire controlling interests in nine markets and a
minority interest. The following table summarizes the consideration to be issued
by USM for these acquisitions if they are completed as planned.

Cellular interests acquired by TDS in these transactions are expected to be
assigned to the Company and at the time this occurs the Company will reimburse
TDS for TDS's consideration delivered and costs incurred in such acquisitions.
Of the consideration for these pending acquisitions, the debt under the
Revolving Credit Agreement and 3.7 million of the USM Common Shares are to be
issued to TDS to reimburse TDS for TDS Common Shares to be issued and cash to be
paid to third parties in connection with these pending acquisitions. Most of the
3.7 million Common Shares to be issued in connection with pending acquisitions
are expected to be issued in 1994.

In addition to the agreements above, the Company has agreements to acquire
interests representing 302,000 population equivalents in three markets. The
consideration for these acquisitions will be determined based on future
appraisals of the fair market values of the interests to be acquired.

TDS and USM are parties to a legal proceeding before the Federal Communications
Commission ("FCC") involving its cellular license in a Wisconsin Rural Service
Area. Pending the resolution of the issues in the Wisconsin proceeding, further
FCC grants to TDS and its subsidiaries will be conditioned on the outcome of
that proceeding. TDS's and USM's ability to sell or exchange properties with
third parties while such proceeding is pending may be affected.


<PAGE>

See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Legal Proceedings (La
Star Application), for a discussion of the proceeding involving the Wisconsin
Rural Service Area.

LIQUIDITY
The Company anticipates that the aggregate resources required for 1994 will
include approximately: (i) $160 million for capital spending; (ii) $5 million
for investments in cellular partnerships; (iii) $4 million for cash
acquisitions; and (iv) $12 million of scheduled debt repayments. Additionally,
the Company anticipates it will reimburse TDS, as each acquisition is completed,
for TDS Common Shares valued at approximately $121 million to be issued and $1
million in cash to be paid by TDS to third parties in connection with
acquisitions anticipated to be primarily completed by the end of 1994. The
reimbursement to TDS is expected to be in the form of 3.7 million Common Shares
of the Company. Not included in the above amounts are acquisitions that may be
signed in 1994. These potential acquisitions may require substantial funding for
both their acquisition and operation during 1994.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had $6 million of cash and cash equivalents,
$108 million remaining under the $250 million Revolving Credit Agreement with
TDS as amended effective November 15, 1993, and $6 million of anticipated
minority partner capital contributions. Additionally, the Company anticipates
generating an increasing amount of positive cash flows from operating activities
during 1994.

Pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to an
aggregate of $250 million from TDS, at an interest rate equal to 1.5% above the
prime rate. The advances made by TDS under the Revolving Credit Agreement are
unsecured. Interest on the balance due under the Revolving Credit Agreement is
payable quarterly and no principal is payable until March 31, 1996, subject to
acceleration under certain circumstances, at which time the entire principal
balance then outstanding is scheduled to become due and payable. The Company may
prepay the balance due under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time, in
whole or in part, without premium.

The Company initiated a rights offering to holders of its common stock which
commenced on October 25, 1993. Pursuant to this rights offering, common
stockholders received one right for every five shares owned on October 22, 1993.
Each right enabled the holder to purchase one additional share of common stock
at the exercise price of $33.00 per share, which was a 10% discount from the
market price of the Company's Common Shares on October 22, 1993. TDS agreed to
purchase any unsubscribed shares at the exercise price. The rights offering
concluded on November 15, 1993, and shortly after that date the Company reduced
its debt to TDS under the Revolving Credit Agreement with the cash proceeds of
the rights offering, which totaled approximately $37 million. Pursuant to the
rights offering, TDS purchased additional common stock with a value of $341
million by reducing the amount the Company owes TDS under the Revolving Credit
Agreement.

The Company anticipates requiring substantial funding to acquire cellular
markets and build and operate cellular systems during 1994. The timing and
amount of such funding requirements will depend on the timing of the completion
of pending acquisitions, the number of additional licenses acquired by the
Company, the construction and operational plans for the individual cellular
projects, and other relevant factors. The Company will need to raise additional
capital to meet these requirements. These additional requirements may be met
through additional borrowings from TDS, the issuance of equity or debt
securities or a combination thereof, vendor financing, bank financing, or the
sale of assets. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be made
available to the Company on terms or at prices acceptable to the Company. If
sufficient funding is not made available to the Company on terms and prices
acceptable to the Company, the Company would have to reduce its construction,
development and acquisition programs. In the long term, reduction of the
Company's construction, development and acquisition programs would have a
negative impact on the ability of the Company to increase its consolidated
revenues and cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" or "USM"), is an 85.1%-owned
subsidiary of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. ("TDS").

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of USM, its
majority-owned subsidiaries and partnerships in which USM manages the system and
has a majority partnership interest. There were 116 consolidated entities in
1993, 92 in 1992 and 67 in 1991. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

REVENUES
Revenues from operations primarily consist of charges to customers for monthly
access, cellular airtime usage, roamer charges, toll charges and vertical
services. Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues,
resulting from cellular service provided from the billing cycle date to the end
of each month and from other cellular carriers' customers using USM's cellular
systems for the last half of each month, are estimated and recorded. Equipment
sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to
customers for cellular telephone equipment purchased.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net (Loss) per Common and Series A Common Share for the years ended December 31,
1993 and 1991 was computed by dividing Net (Loss) by the weighted average number
of Common Shares and Series A Common Shares outstanding during the year.

Net Income per Common and Series A Common Share for the year ended December 31,
1992 was computed by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number of
Common Shares, Series A Common Shares and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock equivalents consist of
Common Shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock, Common Shares
issuable in the future to third parties in connection with completed
acquisitions and Common Share options and stock appreciation rights.

Pro forma Net (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 1993 would have been
reduced by $25.1 million for the interest expense eliminated by the pro forma
retirement, as of January 1, 1993, of the amount outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Agreement-TDS through the conversion of 4.8 million Common Shares and 5.5
million Series A Common Shares purchased by TDS in connection with the November
1993 rights offering ("Rights Offering") ($340.7 million) and the application of
the proceeds from the sale of 1.1 million Common Shares to parties other than
TDS in connection with the Rights Offering ($36.8 million). Pro forma (Loss) per
Common Share would have been reduced by $.45 to zero for the year ended December
31, 1993 had the debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement been retired as of
January 1, 1993, by the conversion of the Revolving Credit Agreement into Common
Shares and from the proceeds of the Rights Offering.

Pro forma Net (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 1991, would have been
reduced by $8.2 million for the interest expense eliminated by the pro forma
retirement, as of January 1, 1991, of the Demand Notes and the Revolving Credit
Agreement-TDS through the conversion of $110 million of the amount outstanding
under the Demand Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement into approximately 6.1
million Common Shares, through the sale of 2.0 million Common Shares of the
Company's June 1991 public offering and the sale of 368,000 Common Shares to
Coditel Brabant, S. A. ("Coditel") pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
at the public offering price of $18.00 per share. Pro forma (Loss) per Common
Share would have been ($.38) for the year ended December 31, 1991, had $150.7
million of Demand Notes and debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement at June
1991 been retired as of January 1, 1991, by the conversion of the Demand Notes
and Revolving Credit Agreement into Common Shares, and from the proceeds of the
public offering and the sale to Coditel.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the plant assets.
The provision for depreciation as a percentage of average depreciable property,
plant and equipment was 10.5% in 1993, 10.5% in 1992 and 10.4% in 1991.

</TABLE>

See Note 13 Lease Commitments for a discussion of property leased by USM.

NOTES AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE
Notes and interest receivable reflect primarily loans to other partners for
capital calls paid on their behalf. The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for notes and interest receivable approximates their fair value.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and those short-term, highly-liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying
amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable consists of amounts owed by customers for both service
provided and equipment sales, by other cellular carriers whose customers have
used USM's cellular systems, by affiliated entities and by other partners for
capital contributions and distributions.

INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a
specific identification basis.

DEFERRED CHARGES
Deferred start-up costs represent expenses incurred prior to the commencement of
service in each individual market. These costs are capitalized and, upon
commencement of operations, amortized over five years. Deferred start-up costs
include expenses related to constructing the systems and expenses incurred in
preparing to market cellular service.

Other deferred charges primarily represent costs incurred for the development of
new systems and legal and other charges incurred relating to the preparation of
vendor financing agreements. Capitalized costs of systems development are
amortized over a five year period starting when the new system is placed in
service. When vendor financing is finalized for an entity, deferred charges
recorded on that entity's books are amortized over the financing period.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
Effective January 1, 1991, USM changed its method of accounting for sales
commissions from capitalizing and amortizing these costs over 36 months to
expensing as incurred. Also in 1991, two of USM's equity-method investees made a
similar change.

The ($10.3 million) cumulative effect of both USM's and its equity-method
investees' changes on prior years is included in income for the year ended
December 31, 1991. The effect of the changes in 1991 was to increase net (loss)
and (loss) per share before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle by $846,000 and $.02, respectively, and to increase net (loss) and
(loss) per share by $11.1 million and $.28, respectively.

For a discussion of the change in accounting for income taxes, see Note 10
Income Taxes.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES
USM acquired certain cellular licenses and interests during 1993, 1992 and 1991.
In conjunction with these acquisitions, the following assets were acquired,
liabilities assumed, Common Shares and shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock
issued and equity contributions made by TDS.

During 1993, USM converted $340.7 million of debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement into equity through the issuance of approximately 4.8 million Common
Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares to TDS in connection with the
Rights Offering.

During 1993, USM recorded $40.3 million of additional borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement as reimbursement to TDS for TDS Common Shares issued
and issuable in lieu of 1.7 million USM Common Shares that were to be issued in
1994 through 1996 in connection with completed acquisitions.

USM converted accrued interest into debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement of
approximately $28.2 million in 1993, $15.9 million in 1992 and $11.9 million in
1991. Approximately $6.6 million, $2.8 million and $2.6 million of additions to
property, plant and equipment were financed through Accounts Payable-Other in
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

During 1992, USM recorded a gain on the exchange of its minority interests in
two Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSAs") which is not included in the table
above. See Note 12 Gain on Sale of Cellular Interests for a discussion of the
effects of the exchange.

During 1991, USM converted $110 million of Demand Notes and debt under the

PENDING ACQUISITIONS. At December 31, 1993, the Company, or TDS for the benefit
of the Company, had entered into agreements to acquire controlling interests in
nine markets and a minority interest representing approximately 1.2 million
population equivalents for an aggregate consideration estimated to be
approximately $128.4 million. If all of the pending acquisitions are completed
as planned, the Company will issue approximately 49,000 of its Common Shares and
pay approximately $4.5 million in cash. TDS will pay approximately $123.0
million in cash and TDS Common Shares. Any cellular interests acquired by TDS in
these transactions will be assigned to the Company and the Company will
reimburse TDS for TDS's consideration delivered and costs incurred in such
acquisitions in the form of Common Shares of the Company and notes payable.

In addition to the agreements above, the Company has agreements to acquire
interests representing 302,000 population equivalents in three markets. The
consideration for these acquisitions will be determined based on future
appraisals of the fair market values of the interests to be acquired.

</TABLE>

USM follows the equity method of accounting for its long-term investments which
recognizes, on a current basis, USM's proportionate share of the incomes and
losses accruing to it under the terms of its partnership and shareholder
agreements. The equity method is followed for minority interests in markets that
are managed by USM and for certain markets managed by others.

USM follows the cost method of accounting for its investments in markets held
for sale or exchange, and such investments are recorded at the lower of cost or
market value. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of USM's
investments in cellular partnerships held for sale or exchange due to the lack
of quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair values without
incurring excessive costs. The $12.9 million carrying amount at December 31,
1993, represents primarily the original cost of the investments, which
management believes is not impaired. USM's unaudited proportionate share of the
incomes or (losses) of cellular investments accounted for under the cost method
and therefore not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were
approximately $838,000, $302,000, and ($354,000) for the years December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. USM's proportionate share of all such incomes
or (losses) since the inception of operations or acquisition was ($2.1 million)
at December 31, 1993.

The following summarizes the unaudited assets, liabilities and partners'
capital, and the results of operations of the cellular system partnerships in
which USM's investments are accounted for by the equity method.

Two agents of a competing carrier of the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership
(the "Partnership") have named the Partnership in several complaints against
the carrier. The general allegations include violations of California Unfair
Practices Act and price fixing.

On November 24, 1993, a class action suit was filed against the Partnership and
another cellular carrier alleging conspiracy to fix the price of cellular
service in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are
seeking substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.

The ultimate outcome of these actions is uncertain at this time. Accordingly, no
accrual for these matters has been made.

4. INVESTMENT IN LICENSES

Investment in licenses consists of the costs incurred in acquiring Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") licenses or interests in entities which have
filed for or have been awarded FCC licenses to provide cellular service. These
costs include amounts paid to license applicants and owners of interests in
cellular entities awarded licenses; amounts paid for legal, engineering and
consulting services; amounts incurred by USM and its parent, TDS, in acquiring
these interests; and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over 40 years,
upon commencement of operations, or at the date of acquisition when USM's
interest is in an operating system. Effective January 1, 1992, USM prospectively
changed its amortization period for license costs from 20 years to 40 years to
conform with industry practices. Costs applicable to unsuccessful license
applications and acquisitions are charged to expense. Cellular license costs
with an unamortized financial reporting basis of approximately $258.0 million
have no tax basis because the associated purchase transactions were structured
to be tax-free. This basis difference is goodwill and no deferred taxes have
been provided.

Investment in licenses consists of the following:

5. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

At December 31, 1993 and 1992 USM's noncurrent marketable equity securities are
carried at the lower of cost ($18.2 million) or market value ($17.6 million in
1993 and $19.5 million in 1992) resulting in an unrealized loss of $626,000 in
1993 and an unrealized gain of $1.3 million in 1992. The market value for the
marketable equity securities is based on quoted market prices.


6. REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

USM has unsecured notes payable to TDS and Telecommunications Technologies Fund,
Inc. ("TTF"), a wholly owned subsidiary of TDS, pursuant to a Revolving Credit
Agreement. USM repaid approximately $377.5 million of debt under the Revolving
Credit Agreement with the proceeds of its 1993 Rights Offering.

The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement provide for borrowings with
interest, at the prime rate plus 1.5% (for a rate of 7.5% at December 31, 1993),
due quarterly. The Revolving Credit Agreement has been amended by TDS from time
to time to change the size of the borrowing facility. Most recently, the
facility was amended effective November 15, 1993, in connection with the Rights
Offering to provide for borrowings up to a maximum of $250 million. Any
borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in
part, without premium, with any prepayment reinstating credit in the amount of
such prepayment. No principal under the Revolving Credit Agreement is due until
March 31, 1996, on which date the Revolving Credit Agreement terminates and all
unpaid principal and accrued interest thereon are due and payable. The terms of
the Revolving Credit Agreement also include, among others, restrictions on
incurring additional indebtedness and on paying dividends. The carrying value of
USM's borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement approximates their fair
value, as the Revolving Credit Agreement is variable debt with the interest rate
based on the prime rate.


7. LONG-TERM DEBT

USM has two arrangements for the financing of cellular system equipment and
construction costs with an equipment vendor.  One is arranged through the
individual entities which USM manages and the other is with USM directly. The
carrying value of USM's borrowings under the two vendor financing arrangements
approximates their fair value. The fair value of USM's long-term debt is
estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The loans under the first
arrangement bear interest at a rate approximating the prime rate (6.0% at
December 31, 1993) and have interest deferred during the first year. Deferred
interest and principal must be repaid over the succeeding seven years. The loans
are secured by all of the assets of these individual entities and by some or all
of the various owners' interests in the entities.  Amounts borrowed which
relate to goods or services not provided by the vendor are guaranteed by USM.

As of December 31, 1993, $22.2 million of financing had been completed under
this arrangement, including $21.0 million for those subsidiaries and
partnerships included in the consolidated financial statements, and $1.2 million
for those managed

<PAGE>

subsidiaries and partnerships in which USM has a minority interest and follows
the equity method of accounting. The amount of financing outstanding for all
managed subsidiaries and partnerships at December 31, 1993 was $5.0 million.

During 1991, USM entered into an additional long-term financing agreement with
the same equipment vendor. The agreement provided for new borrowings of up to
$52 million to finance USM's equipment purchases and construction costs, and for
the refinancing of previous borrowings of up to $4 million. The borrowings are
senior obligations of USM and are collateralized by a secured interest in the
tangible assets (excluding customer accounts receivable) and certain intangible
assets of certain of USM's operating subsidiaries, excluding any interest in
such operating subsidiaries' FCC licenses. Borrowings have terms of seven to
eight years at an interest rate of 2.3% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of
high-grade, unsecured notes (for a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 1993). At
December 31, 1993, the amount of new borrowings outstanding was $49.0 million
and the amount of refinancing of previous borrowings outstanding was $3.9
million.

Long-term debt is as follows:

TAX-DEFERRED SAVINGS PLAN. USM has reserved 52,004 Common Shares for issue under
the TDS Tax-Deferred Savings Plan, a qualified profit-sharing plan pursuant to
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees
have the option of investing their contributions in TDS Common Shares, USM
Common Shares or four other non-affiliated funds.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. USM sold 35,409 Common Shares to its employees and
employees of its subsidiaries at $13.45 per share in connection with the 1990
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

USM has reserved 80,000 Common Shares for sale to employees of USM and its
subsidiaries at $16.15 per share in connection with the 1992 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

STOCK OPTION AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN. USM has reserved 260,000 Common
Shares and 55,000 Series A Common Shares for options granted to key employees.
USM has established a Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (as
amended on February 1, 1991) that provides for the grant of stock options and
stock appreciation rights to officers and employees. The options are exercisable
one year from the date of the award through November 1, 1997, or thirty days
following the date of the employee's termination of employment, if earlier. At
December 31, 1993, 56,659 stock options were outstanding at a price of $15.67
per share.

<PAGE>

Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") allow the grantee to receive an amount in
Common Shares or cash, or a combination thereof, equivalent to the difference
between the excercise price and the fair market value of the Common Shares on
the exercise date. At December 31, 1993, 51,600 Common Share SARs and 36,000
Series A Common Share SARs were outstanding at $15.00 per share.  These rights
expire from 1998 to 2003 or the date of the person's termination of employment,
if earlier. During 1993 and 1992, 1,800 and 600 Common Share SARs were
exercised, respectively. Compensation expense, measured on the difference
between the option prices and the year-end market price of the Common Shares,
aggregated $598,000 in 1993, $67,000 in 1992 and $101,000 in 1991.

RIGHTS OFFERING
In the fourth quarter of 1993, USM completed a rights offering to holders of its
common stock. Pursuant to the rights offering, common shareholders received one
right for every five shares owned on October 22, 1993. Each right enabled the
holder to purchase one additional share of common stock at the exercise price of
$33.00 per share, which was a 10% discount from the closing market price of
USM's Common Shares on October 22, 1993. USM issued approximately 5.9 million
Common Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares in connection with the
rights offering. Approximately 4.8 million Common Shares and all of the
Series A Common Shares were purchased by TDS.

SERIES A COMMON SHARES
Series A Common Shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Common
Shares. As of December 31, 1993, all of USM's outstanding Series A Common Shares
were held by TDS.


9. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

Redeemable Preferred Stock, authorized 5,000,000 shares, has a stated
liquidation value of $100 per share, is not entitled to any dividends and is
redeemable in 1994 through 1996. The Redeemable Preferred Stock is issuable in
series by the Board of Directors, who esatablish the terms of the issue. At
December 31, 1993, all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock were held by TDS as
reimbursement for shares of TDS Preferred Stock issued in connection with
acquisitions. The fair value of Redeemable Preferred Stock is estimated to be
approximately $36.1 million using the net present value of the Common Shares to
be issued upon conversion, valued at the December 31, 1993, quoted market price.
At December 31, 1993, all of the Redeemable Preferred Stock is redeemable by USM
by the delivery of Common Shares as shown in the following table.

10. INCOME TAXES

USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members
of the TDS consolidated group.

TDS and USM entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement (the "Agreement") effective
July 1, 1987. The Agreement provides that USM and its subsidiaries be included
in a consolidated federal income tax return with the TDS affiliated group unless
TDS requests otherwise. USM and its subsidiaries calculate their losses and
credits as if they comprised a separate affiliated group. Under the Agreement,
USM is able to carry forward its losses and credits and use them to offset any
future income tax liabilities to TDS. The amount of federal net operating loss
carryforward available to offset future taxable income aggregated approximately
$148.2 million at December 31, 1993, and expires between 2002 and 2008.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires
companies to record all deferred tax liabilities or assets for the deferred tax
consequences of all temporary differences. Additionally, the statement requires
that deferred tax balances be adjusted to reflect new tax rates when they are
enacted into law.  The cumulative effect of the implementation of SFAS 109 on
years prior to 1993

<PAGE>

had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income tax
expense for 1993 reflects the new method of accounting; income tax expense for
prior years has not been restated.

In August of 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the
statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent. 1993
federal income tax expense was not affected as a result of this change.

Federal income tax expense in 1993 and 1992 primarily relates to a consolidated
subsidiary not included in the TDS consolidated federal income tax return. State
income tax expense in 1993 was primarily related to subsidiaries generating
taxable income after utilization of state net operating losses. State income tax
expense in 1992 was primarily generated by the gains on the sale and exchange of
celular interests completed in 1992. The amount of state net operating loss
carryforward available to offset future taxable income aggregated approximately
$197.1 million at December 31, 1993, and expires between 1998 and 2008. Income
tax provisions charged to expense are summarized below:

</TABLE>

A valuation allowance has been provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. USM has established
a valuation allowance primarily for operating loss carryforwards that may expire
before they can be utilized. During 1993, the valuation allowance increased
$10.5 million primarily due to USM's 1993 net operating loss. USM had current
deferred tax assets totaling $595,000 at December 31, 1993, resulting primarily
from the allowance for customer receivables.

The statutory federal income tax rate is reconciled to the Company's effective
income tax rate below.

11. RELATED PARTIES

USM is billed for all services it receives from TDS, consisting primarily of
information processing and general management services. Such billings are based
on expenses specifically identified to USM and upon allocations of common
expenses. Such allocations are based upon the relationship of USM's assets and
revenues to the total assets and revenues of TDS. Management believes the
method used to allocate common expenses is reasonable. Billings to USM from TDS
amounted to $22.9 million in 1993, $13.8 million in 1992 and $9.9 million in
1991. Management believes that all expenses and costs applicable to USM are
reflected in the accompanying financial statements on a basis which is
representative of what they would have been if USM operated on a stand-alone
basis.

All markets managed by USM are billed for services they receive from USM
consisting primarily of accounting, billing and engineering services. Such
billings are based on expenses specifically identified to each market and upon
allocations of common expenses. Such allocations are based upon the
relationships of each market's assets and revenues to the total assets and
revenues of all the markets managed by USM. Billings to nonconsolidated, managed
markets amounted to $7.6 million in 1993, $7.5 million in 1992 and $6.4 million
in 1991. Management believes that all expenses and costs applicable to each
market are representative of what

<PAGE>

they would have been if each managed market operated on a stand-alone basis.

Interest income includes interest on loans to managed unconsolidated markets
used to fund ongoing construction and operating expenses. Interest income from
these markets amounted to $1.9 million in 1993, $2.1 million in 1992 and $1.4
million in 1991.

USM has a Cash Management Agreement with TDS under which USM may from time to
time deposit its excess cash with TDS for investment under TDS's cash management
program. Deposits made under the agreement are available to USM on demand and
bear interest each month at the 30-day Commercial Paper Rate as reported in THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL, plus 1/4%, or such higher rate as TDS may at its discretion
offer on such deposits.


12. GAIN ON SALE OF CELLULAR INTERESTS

Gains in 1993 reflect primarily the sale of two cellular minority interests. USM
received $6.8 million cash consideration on the sales.

Gains in 1992 reflect the sales and exchange of minority- and majority-owned
cellular interests as follows: (a) USM transferred its controlling interests in
two RSAs, its minority interests in two MSAs and approximately $2.9 million in
cash in exchange for controlling interests in two other MSAs and a minority
interest in a combined MSA/RSA system. The exchange of the controlling interests
in the RSAs has been recorded using book values, with no gain or loss recognized
on the exchange. The exchange of the minority interests in the two MSAs has been
recorded at the fair market value of approximately $15.7 million. A gain of
$11.4 million, representing the excess of the fair market value of the MSA
interests traded over the book value of such interests, was included in income
for 1992. (b) USM sold a majority interest in an MSA in exchange for certain
marketable equity securities then valued at $18.2 million. A gain of $17.1
million was recognized on the sale. (c) USM sold a minority interest in an MSA
for $3.8 million in cash. A gain of $2.9 million was recognized on the sale.

Gains in 1991 reflect primarily the sale of two cellular minority interests. USM
received $752,000 cash consideration on the sales.


13. LEASE COMMITMENTS

USM and certain of its majority-owned partnerships and subsidiaries lease
certain office and cell site locations under operating leases. Future minimum
rental payments required under operating leases that have noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 1993 are as follows:

Rent expense totaled $4.7 million in 1993, $3.2 million in 1992 and $3.1 million
in 1991.


14. COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

The partnerships and corporations in which USM is a partner or shareholder are
in various stages of development. USM expects to spend approximately $160
million during 1994 for both enhancements to existing systems and construction
of new systems. Planned expenditures for enhancements of existing majority-owned
cellular systems, including additional radio channel capacity as well as new
cell sites, total about $140 million. Anticipated expenditures for construction
of switching offices and digital expansion total $7 million. Under the terms of
certain partnership and shareholder agreements, USM may be committed to funding
other partners' or shareholders' portion of construction and other costs, if
sufficient financing is not available to the individual entities. USM does not
expect such individual financing shortfalls to be material. Investments in
cellular partnerships, primarily minority-owned and managed partnerships, are
expected to total $5 million in 1994.

USM has an ongoing acquisition program to maximize its growth. For a
discussion of pending acquisitions see Note 2 Acquisitions.

Under USM's financing arrangement with an equipment vendor, amounts borrowed
which relate to goods or services not provided by that vendor are guaranteed by
USM. As of December 31, 1993, long-term debt in the amount of $2.5 million was
guaranteed by USM under this arrangement.

15. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and
various state and federal courts. In some cases, the litigation involves
disputes regarding rights to certain cellular telephone systems. The more
significant proceedings involving the Company are described in the following
paragraphs.

LA STAR APPLICATION. Star Cellular Telephone Company, Inc. ("Star Cellular"), an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of USM, is a 49% owner of La Star Cellular
Telephone Company ("La Star"), an applicant for a construction permit for a
cellular system in St. Tammany Parish in the New Orleans MSA. In June 1992, the
FCC affirmed an Administrative Law Judge's order which had granted the mutually
exclusive application of New Orleans CGSA, Inc. ("NOCGSA") and dismissed La
Star's application. The ground for the FCC's action was its finding that Star
Cellular, and not the 51% owner, SJI Cellular Inc. ("SJI"), in fact controlled
La Star. La Star, TDS and USM have appealed that order to the United States
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit and those appeals are
pending.

In a footnote to its decision, the FCC stated, in part, that "Questions
regarding the conduct of SJI and [USM] in this case may be revisited in light of
the relevant findings and conclusions here in future proceedings where the other
interests of these parties have decisional significance. Certain adverse
parties have attempted to use the footnote in the La Star decision in a number
of unrelated, contested proceedings which TDS and USM have pending before the
FCC. In addition, since the La Star proceeding, FCC authorizations in
uncontested FCC proceedings have been granted subject to any subsequent action
the FCC may take concerning the La Star footnote.

On February 1, 1994, in a proceeding involving a license originally issued to
TDS for a rural service area in Wisconsin, the FCC instituted a hearing to
determine whether in the La Star case USM had misrepresented facts to, lacked
candor in its dealings with or attempted to mislead the FCC and, if so, whether
TDS possesses the requisite character qualifications to hold that Wisconsin
license. The FCC stated that, pending resolution of the issues in the Wisconsin
proceeding, further grants to TDS and its subsidiaries will be conditioned on
the outcome of that proceeding. TDS was granted interim authority to continue to
operate the Wisconsin system pending completion of the hearing.

An adverse finding in the Wisconsin hearing could result in a variety of
possible sanctions, ranging from a fine to loss of the Wisconsin license, and
could, as stated in the FCC order, be raised and considered in other
proceedings involving TDS and its subsidiaries. TDS and USM believe they acted
properly in connection with the La Star application and that the findings and
record in the La Star proceeding are not relevant in any other proceeding
involving their FCC license qualifications.

TOWNES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., ET. AL. V. TDS, ET. AL. Plaintiffs Townes
Telecommunications, Inc. ("Townes"), Tatum Telephone Company ("Tatum Telephone")
and Tatum Cellular Telephone Company ("Tatum Cellular") filed a suit in the
District Court of Rusk County, Texas, against both TDS and USM as defendants.
Plaintiff Townes alleges that it entered into an oral agreement with defendants
which established a joint venture to develop cellular business in certain
markets. Townes alleges that defendents usurped a joint venture opportunity and
breached fiduciary duties to Townes by purchasing interests in nonwireline
markets in Texas RSA #11 and the Tyler (Texas) MSA on their own behalf rather
than on behalf of the alleged joint venture. In its Fifth Amended Original
Petition Townes seeks unspecified damages not to exceed $33 million for
usurpation, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, breach of contract and
tortious interference. Townes also seeks imposition of a constructive trust on
defendants' profits from Texas RSA #11 and the Tyler (Texas) MSA and transfer of
those interests to the alleged joint venture. In addition Townes seeks
reasonable attorneys' fees equal to one-third of the judgement, along with
prejudgement interest. Plaintiffs Tatum Telephone and Tatum Cellular seek a
declaration that transfers by defendants of a 49% interest in Tatum Cellular
violated a five-year restriction on alienation of Tatum Cellular shares
contained in a written shareholders' agreement. Tatum Telephone and Tatum
Cellular seek to void the transfers. All plaintiffs together seek as much as
$200 million in punitive damages.

Defendants have asserted meritorious defenses to each of the plaintiffs' claims
and are vigorously defending this case. Discovery is ongoing. A jury trial in
this case is set to commence on April 25, 1994.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UNITED STATES CELLULAR
CORPORATION:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United States
Cellular Corporation (a Delaware corporation and an 85.1%-owned subsidiary of
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in common
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the financial statements of the Los Angeles SMSA, Baton Rouge MSA and
Nashville/Clarksville MSA limited partnerships. The Company's investment in
these partnerships is reflected in the accompanying financial statements using
the equity method of accounting. The investment in these limited partnerships
represented $38,447,000 and $33,209,000 (or 3.1% and 3.9%) of total consolidated
assets at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and the equity in their
income represents $15,364,000, $10,436,000 and $6,242,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and is included in the
consolidated net (loss) income. The summarized financial information contained
in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes financial
information for the aforementioned partnerships. The financial statements of
those limited partnerships were audited by other auditors whose reports have
been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for those limited partnerships, is based solely on the reports of the
other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of United States Cellular Corporation and Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in "Change in Accounting Principle" in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, the method of accounting for cellular sales
commissions was changed effective January 1, 1991. As discussed in Note 10 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the method of accounting for
income taxes was changed effective January 1, 1993.

The report of other auditors on the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership
referred to above includes explanatory paragraphs relating to uncertainties
as discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
ultimate outcome of these actions are uncertain at this time. Accordingly, no
accrual for these matters has been made in the consolidated financial statments.

As discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
the Company is a defendant in a lawsuit involving a joint venture opportunity, a
shareholders' agreement and other related matters. The ultimate outcome from the
litigation cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, no provision for any
liability which may result has been made in the consolidated financial
statements.

                       UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION
                         PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION


     United States Cellular Corporation (AMEX symbol "USM") is referred to in
this exhibit as the "Company."  The Company is an 85.1%-owned subsidiary of
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. ("TDS").

     From January 1 through December 31, 1993, the Company acquired controlling
interests in 25 cellular markets and several additional minority cellular
interests representing a total of approximately 3.8 million population
equivalents.  The total consideration paid for these acquisitions was
approximately $284.6 million, consisting of 5.7 million Common Shares, 75,000
Series A Common Shares, the obligation to issue 140,000 Common Shares in the
future, an increase in the Company's revolving credit agreement with TDS (the
"Revolving Credit Agreement") of $101.5 million, 29,000 shares of subsidiary
preferred stock, cash and Common Shares issued by TDS totaling $9.4 million
(treated as an equity contribution to the Company), and $12.7 million in cash
paid by the Company.  Of this consideration, the debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement, most of the Common Shares and all of the Series A Common Shares were
issued to TDS to reimburse TDS for TDS Common Shares issued and cash paid to
third parties.

     As of December 31, 1993, the Company had pending agreements to acquire
controlling interests in nine cellular markets and a minority interest in one
additional market representing a total of approximately 1.2 million population
equivalents.  The total consideration to be paid for the acquisitions described
in this paragraph, valued at the time such agreements were entered into, is
approximately $128.4 million.  If these acquisitions are completed as planned,
the Company will issue approximately 3.7 million Common Shares, will increase
the balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement by $400,000, will
pay approximately $4.5 million in cash (expected to be funded by an additional
increase in the Revolving Credit Agreement) and TDS will pay $700,000 in cash
(to be treated as an equity contribution to the Company).

     Pursuant to Rule 3-05 and Rule 11-01 of Regulation S-X, the completed and
pending acquisitions of businesses described in the foregoing paragraphs are not
individually significant.  The following pro forma financial information is
included pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X:

     The pro forma allocations of the purchase prices to the acquired entities'
assets as set forth above are based upon preliminary estimates of the values of
those assets.

income and the elimination of the minority shareholders' portion of net income
of companies in which the Company acquired additional minority interests.

     (3)  Reflects the amortization of assumed costs in excess of book value.
All excess cost amounts are assumed to be amortized over 40 years.

     (4)  Reflects the elimination of the equity-method losses of acquired
entities which are consolidated in the Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

     (5)  Reflects the elimination of intercompany interest income and interest
expense between the Company and several acquired entities.  The acquired
entities were previously accounted for by the equity method of accounting (see
Note 4).

     (6)  Reflects the estimated interest expense incurred as a result of
increases in the Revolving Credit Agreement in connection with the acquisitions
included in the Condensed Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     (7)  The Company is included in a consolidated federal income tax return
with other members of the TDS consolidated group.  TDS and the Company entered
into a Tax Allocation Agreement (the "Agreement") effective July 1, 1987.  The
Agreement provides, among other things, that the Company and its subsidiaries be
included in a consolidated federal income tax return with the TDS affiliated
group unless TDS requests otherwise.  The Company and its subsidiaries calculate
their losses and credits as if they comprised a separate affiliated group.
Under the Agreement, the Company is able to carry forward its losses and credits
and use them to offset any future income tax liabilities to TDS.  Accordingly,
no pro forma income tax benefits arising from the pro forma effects of
acquisitions have been recorded in the Condensed Pro Forma Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
