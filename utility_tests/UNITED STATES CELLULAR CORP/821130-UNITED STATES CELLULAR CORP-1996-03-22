ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
THE COMPANY
 
    United   States  Cellular  Corporation  (the  "Company")  provides  cellular
telephone service to  710,000 customers through  137 majority-owned and  managed
("consolidated") cellular systems serving approximately 17% of the geography and
approximately  8% of the population  of the United States.  Since 1985, when the
Company began providing  cellular service in  Knoxville, Tennessee, the  Company
has  expanded its cellular networks and customer service operations to cover 147
markets in 29 states as of December 31, 1995. In total, the Company now operates
nine market clusters, of  which five have  a total population  of more than  two
million, and each of which has a total population of more than one million, plus
other unclustered markets. Overall, 83% of the Company's 24.5 million population
equivalents  are in markets which are or will be consolidated, 1% are in managed
but not consolidated markets and 16% are  in markets in which the Company  holds
an investment interest.
 
    The  Company is the seventh largest cellular telephone company in the United
States, based on the aggregate number  of population equivalents it owns or  has
the right to acquire. The Company's corporate development strategy is to acquire
controlling  interests in cellular  market licensees in areas  adjacent to or in
proximity to its  other markets in  order to build  and expand market  clusters.
Customers  benefit from larger service  areas which provide longer uninterrupted
service and the ability to make outgoing calls and receive incoming calls within
the designated  area  without special  roaming  arrangements. In  addition,  the
Company anticipates that clustering will continue to provide the Company certain
economies in its capital and operating costs.
 
    The  following table  summarizes the  status of  the Company's  interests in
cellular markets at December 31, 1995.

(1) The Company expects  to divest  controlling interests in  eight markets  and
    acquire  controlling  interests in  two markets.  One of  the markets  to be
    acquired is being  operated by a  third party until  the Company acquires  a
    controlling interest in that market.
 
(2) Represents  markets in which the Company owns  or has the right to acquire a
    minority or other  noncontrolling interest  and which are  managed by  third
    parties; as of December 31, 1995, the Company accounted for its interests in
    21  of these markets using the equity method and accounted for the remaining
    40 markets, all held for sale or exchange, using the cost method.
 
    Cellular systems in  the Company's  137 majority-owned  and managed  markets
served  710,000 customers at December 31,  1995, and contained 1,116 cell sites.
The average penetration rate in the Company's consolidated markets was 3.18%  at
December  31, 1995, and the churn rate in all consolidated markets averaged 2.1%
per month for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995.

CELLULAR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS
 
    THE  CELLULAR TELEPHONE  INDUSTRY.   Cellular telephone  technology provides
high-quality, high-capacity communications services to in-vehicle and  hand-held
portable  cellular telephones. Cellular  technology is a  major improvement over
earlier mobile telephone technologies.  Cellular telephone systems are  designed
for  maximum  mobility  of  the  customer.  Access  is  provided  through system
interconnections to local, regional, national and world-wide  telecommunications
networks.  Cellular  telephone  systems also  offer  a full  range  of ancillary
services such as conference calling, call-waiting, call-forwarding, voice  mail,
facsimile and data transmission.
 
    Cellular  telephone systems divide each service area into smaller geographic
areas or  "cells." Each  cell  is served  by  radio transmitters  and  receivers
operating on discrete radio frequencies licensed by the FCC. All of the cells in
a  system  are connected  to  a computer-controlled  Mobile  Telephone Switching
Office  ("MTSO").  The  MTSO  is  connected  to  the  conventional  ("landline")
telephone  network and potentially other MTSOs.  Each conversation on a cellular
phone involves a transmission over a specific set of radio frequencies from  the
cellular  phone to  a transmitter/receiver at  a cell site.  The transmission is
forwarded from the cell site to the MTSO and from there may be forwarded to  the
landline telephone network to complete the call. As the cellular telephone moves
from  one  cell  to  another,  the MTSO  determines  radio  signal  strength and
transfers ("hands off") the call from one cell to the next. This hand-off is not
noticeable to either party on the phone call.
 
    The FCC currently  grants only  two licenses to  provide cellular  telephone
service  in each market.  However, competition for  customers includes competing
communications technologies such as conventional landline and mobile  telephone,
Specialized   Mobile   Radio  ("SMR")   systems   and  radio   paging.  Personal
communications service  ("PCS")  is expected  to  be competitive  with  cellular
service in the future in all of the Company's markets, and emerging technologies
such  as  Enhanced  Specialized  Mobile  Radio  ("ESMR")  and  mobile  satellite
communication systems may prove to be  competitive with cellular service in  the
future in some or all of the markets where the Company has operations.
 
    The  services available  to cellular  customers and  the sources  of revenue
available to  cellular  system  operators  are  similar  to  those  provided  by
conventional  landline telephone companies. Customers are charged a separate fee
for system access, airtime, long-distance calls and ancillary services. Cellular
system operators often provide service to customers of other operators' cellular
systems while  the  customers  are temporarily  located  within  the  operators'
service  areas. Customers using  service away from their  home system are called
"roamers." Roaming is available because technical standards require that  analog
cellular  telephones be compatible in all market areas in the United States. The
system that provides the service to  these roamers will generate usage  revenue.
Many  operators, including  the Company, charge  premium rates  for this roaming
service.
 
    There are  a  number  of  recent  technical  developments  in  the  cellular
industry. Currently, while most of the MTSOs process information digitally, most
of  the  radio transmission  is  done on  an analog  basis.  During 1992,  a new
transmission technique was approved for implementation by the cellular industry.
Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA")  technology was selected as one  industry
standard by the
 
4
<PAGE>
cellular  industry  and  has been  deployed  in several  markets,  including the
Company's operations  in  Tulsa,  Oklahoma.  Another  digital  technology,  Code
Division  Multiple Access ("CDMA"), is expected to be deployed by the Company in
a commercial trial  during 1996. The  Company also expects  to deploy some  CDMA
digital  radio channels in  other markets on  a trial basis  in the near future.
Digital radio technology  offers several advantages  including greater  privacy,
less   transmission  noise,  greater  system   capacity  and  potentially  lower
incremental costs  for  additional  customers. The  conversion  from  analog  to
digital  radio technology is  expected to be an  industry-wide process that will
take a number of years.
 
    The cellular  telephone  industry is  characterized  by high  initial  fixed
costs. Accordingly, if and when revenues less variable costs exceed fixed costs,
incremental  revenues should yield an operating profit. The amount of profit, if
any, under such circumstances  is dependent on, among  other things, prices  and
variable  marketing costs which in turn are affected by the amount and extent of
competition. Until technological limitations  on total capacity are  approached,
additional  cellular system  capacity can normally  be added  in increments that
closely match demand  and at  less than the  proportionate cost  of the  initial
capacity.
 
    THE  COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.   From its inception  in 1983 until  the last two
years, the Company has  principally been in a  start-up phase. Until that  time,
the  Company's activities had been concentrated significantly on the acquisition
of  interests  in  entities  licensed   or  designated  to  receive  a   license
("licensees")  from the FCC to provide  cellular service and on the construction
and initial operation of cellular systems. The development of a cellular  system
is capital-intensive and requires substantial investment prior to and subsequent
to  initial operation. The  Company experienced operating  losses and net losses
from its inception  until the past  two years.  During the past  two years,  the
Company  generated operations-driven net income  and has significantly increased
its operating cash  flows during  that time.  Management anticipates  increasing
growth  in cellular units in  service and revenues as  the Company continues its
vigorous expansion  and development  programs. Marketing  and system  operations
expenses  associated  with  this expansion  may  reduce  the rate  of  growth in
operating cash  flow  and operating  income  during the  period  of  accelerated
growth.  In addition,  the Company anticipates  that the  seasonality of revenue
streams and  operating  expenses may  affect  the Company's  operating  and  net
results over the next several quarters.
 
    While  the Company produced operating income  and net income during 1994 and
1995, changes  in any  of several  factors may  reduce the  Company's growth  in
operating  income and net income over the next few years. These factors include:
(i) the growth rate in the Company's  customer base; (ii) the usage and  pricing
of  cellular services; (iii) the churn rate; (iv) the cost of providing cellular
services, including the cost of  attracting new customers; (v) the  introduction
of  competition from  PCS and other  emerging technologies;  and (vi) continuing
technological advances which may provide additional competitive alternatives  to
cellular service.
 
    The  Company is building a substantial presence in selected geographic areas
throughout the  United States  where  it can  efficiently integrate  and  manage
cellular  telephone  systems.  Its cellular  interests  include  regional market
clusters in  the following  areas: Iowa,  Wisconsin/Illinois, Missouri,  Eastern
North  Carolina/South  Carolina, Virginia,  West Virginia/Pennsylvania/Maryland,
Oregon/California, Washington/Oregon/Idaho, Indiana/Kentucky, Eastern
Tennessee/Western  North  Carolina,  Oklahoma/Missouri/Kansas,   Texas/Oklahoma,
Maine/New  Hampshire/Vermont, Florida/Georgia  and Southwestern  Texas. See "The
Company's Cellular Interests." The Company  has acquired its cellular  interests
through  the  wireline  application  process  (22%),  including  settlements and
exchanges with  other  applicants,  and through  acquisitions  (78%),  including
acquisitions from TDS and third parties.
 
CELLULAR SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT
 
    ACQUISITIONS.   During  the last  five years,  the Company  has expanded its
size, particularly  in  contiguous  or  adjacent  markets,  through  an  ongoing
acquisition  program  aimed  at  strengthening  the  Company's  position  in the
cellular industry.  This  growth has  resulted  primarily from  acquisitions  of
interests  in  mid-sized  and rural  markets  and  has been  based  on obtaining
interests with rights to manage the underlying market.
 
    Including transfers of RSA interests from TDS, the Company has increased its
population equivalents by 63%, from  approximately 15.0 million at December  31,

markets at December 31, 1990 to 140 markets at December 31, 1995. As of December
31, 1995, 84% of the  Company's population equivalents represented interests  in
markets the Company manages or expects to manage compared to 77% at December 31,
1990.
 
    Recently, the pace of acquisitions has slowed as industry-wide consolidation
has  reduced  the number  of markets  available  for acquisition.  The Company's
population equivalents grew at a compound annual rate of over 10% over the  last
five years, but decreased by 4% from 1994 to 1995 due to the increased number of
completed and pending divestitures.
 
    The   Company  plans  to  acquire   additional  cellular  interests  through
acquisitions or exchanges in markets that further strengthen its market clusters
and in other  attractive markets.  The Company  also seeks  to acquire  minority
interests  in markets where  it already owns  (or has the  right to acquire) the
majority interest. While  the Company  believes that  it will  be successful  in
making  additional acquisitions or exchanges, there can be no assurance that the
Company, or  TDS for  the benefit  of the  Company, will  be able  to  negotiate
additional  acquisitions  or  exchanges  on  terms  acceptable  to  it  or  that
regulatory approvals, where  required, will  be received. The  Company plans  to
retain  minority interests  in certain cellular  markets which  it believes will
earn a favorable return on investment. Other minority interests may be exchanged
for interests in markets which enhance  the Company's market clusters or may  be
sold for cash or other consideration. The Company also continues to evaluate the
disposition  of  certain  managed  interests  which  are  not  essential  to its
corporate development strategy.
 
    The Company,  or  TDS for  the  benefit  of the  Company,  has  historically
negotiated  acquisitions of cellular  interests from third  parties primarily in
consideration for  the Company's  Common  Shares or  TDS's Common  or  Preferred
Shares.  Cellular  interests acquired  by TDS  in  these transactions  have been
assigned to the Company. At that time, the Company reimbursed TDS for the  value
of  TDS  securities issued  in such  transactions,  generally by  issuing Common
Shares to TDS or by increasing the balance due TDS under the Company's Revolving
Credit Agreement in amounts  equal to the value  of TDS securities delivered  at
the time the acquisitions were completed. The fair market value of the Company's
securities  issued to TDS in connection with these transactions was equal to the
fair market value of  the TDS securities delivered  in the transactions and  was
determined at the time the transactions were completed.
 
    In  the past two years, the Company, or  TDS for the benefit of the Company,
has also negotiated divestitures and exchanges of cellular interests with  third
parties.  The consideration  received from  these divestitures  of non-strategic
markets has primarily  been cash,  which has  been used  to reduce  debt or  for
general  corporate  purposes. The  exchanges  have included  the  divestiture of
controlling interests  in  non-strategic  markets in  exchange  for  controlling
interests in markets which further enhance the Company's clusters.
 
    COMPLETED  ACQUISITIONS.  During 1995, the Company completed the acquisition
of controlling  interests  in eleven  markets  and several  additional  minority
interests  representing approximately 1.7 million  population equivalents for an
aggregate consideration of  $151.0 million. The  consideration consisted of  3.1
million  of the Company's Common Shares,  456,000 of the Company's Common Shares
to be issued  in the future,  an increase of  $14.6 million in  the debt to  TDS
under  the Revolving Credit Agreement and $23.2  million in cash. The debt under
the Revolving Credit Agreement, 2.7 million  of the Company's Common Shares  and
the  Common Shares issuable were issued or  issuable to TDS to reimburse TDS for
TDS Common  Shares  issued  and issuable  and  cash  paid to  third  parties  in
connection with these acquisitions.
 
    COMPLETED  DIVESTITURES AND EXCHANGES.   During 1995,  the Company completed
the divestiture of controlling interests  in six markets and minority  interests
in   six  other  markets  representing   approximately  1.1  million  population
equivalents for an  aggregate consideration of  $129.3 million, primarily  cash.
Also during 1995, the Company completed six separate exchange transactions which
resulted  in  the  acquisition  of  controlling  interests  in  twelve  markets,
representing 2.0  million population  equivalents, and  the divestiture  of  ten
markets  plus  three  market  partitions,  representing  2.1  million population
equivalents.
 
    PENDING ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND EXCHANGES.  At December 31, 1995, the
Company, or TDS for the benefit of  the Company, had entered into agreements  to
purchase  a controlling interest in one market and several minority interests in
another market, representing approximately 302,000 population

equivalents. Also at  that date,  the Company,  or TDS  for the  benefit of  the
Company,  had entered into  agreements to divest  controlling interests in seven
markets,  one   minority  interest   and  one   market  partition   representing
approximately  870,000  population  equivalents. The  Company  has  entered into
another agreement to exchange markets  with another cellular operator.  Pursuant
to  the exchange agreement, the Company will  receive a majority interest in one
market, plus cash, in exchange for a majority interest in one market the Company
currently owns. The Company also has  an agreement to settle litigation  related
to  an investment interest which was sold  in 1995. Pursuant to the divestiture,
exchange and settlement agreements, the Company expects to receive approximately
$150 million in cash and $20 million of notes receivable due in three years. All
of these pending transactions are expected to be completed during 1996.
 
    The Company maintains shelf registration of its Common Shares and  Preferred
Stock  under the Securities Act of  1933 for issuance specifically in connection
with acquisitions.
 
    The Company is  a majority-owned subsidiary  of TDS. TDS  owns 80.8% of  the
combined  total of the outstanding  Common Shares and Series  A Common Shares of
the Company and controls 95.8% of the  combined voting power of both classes  of
common  stock.  The  Company  benefits  from  the  extensive  telecommunications
industry experience of TDS, which also operates telephone and paging  businesses
and is developing its PCS business.
 
CELLULAR INTERESTS AND CLUSTERS
 
    The  Company operates clusters of adjacent cellular systems in nearly all of
its markets, enabling its  customers to benefit from  larger service areas  than
otherwise  possible. Where the Company  offers wide-area coverage, its customers
enjoy uninterrupted service within the designated area. Customers may also  make
outgoing  calls  and receive  incoming calls  within  this area  without special
roaming arrangements. In addition to benefits to customers, clustering also  has
provided  to the Company  certain economies in its  capital and operating costs.
These economies  are  made possible  through  increased sharing  of  facilities,
personnel  and other costs and have resulted in a reduction of the Company's per
customer cost of service.  The extent to which  the Company benefits from  these
revenue   enhancements  and  economies  of  operation  is  dependent  on  market
conditions, population size of each cluster and engineering considerations.
 
    The  Company  anticipates  that  it   will  continue  to  pursue   strategic
acquisitions   and  exchanges  which  will  complement  its  established  market
clusters. From time to time, the Company may also consider exchanging or selling
its interests in markets which do not fit well with its long-term strategies.
 
    The Company  owned  or  had  the right  to  acquire  interests  in  cellular
telephone systems in 201 markets at December 31, 1995, representing 24.5 million
population  equivalents.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  growth  in the
Company's population equivalents in recent  years and the development status  of
these population equivalents.

    SYSTEM  DESIGN AND  CONSTRUCTION.   The Company  designs and  constructs its
systems in a manner it believes  will permit it to provide high-quality  service
to  mobile, transportable and  portable cellular telephones,  generally based on
market and engineering  studies which  relate to  specific markets.  Engineering
studies are performed by Company personnel or independent engineering firms. The
Company's  switching equipment is digital, which reduces noise and crosstalk and
is capable of  interconnecting in  a manner  which reduces  costs of  operation.
While digital microwave interconnections are typically made between the MTSO and
cell  sites, primarily analog radio transmission  is used between cell sites and
the cellular telephones themselves.
 
    In accordance  with  its  strategy  of  building  and  strengthening  market
clusters,  the  Company has  selected high  capacity digital  cellular switching
systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single MTSO.  The
Company's  cellular  systems  are  designed to  facilitate  the  installation of
equipment which will permit microwave  interconnection between the MTSO and  the
cell site. The Company has implemented such microwave interconnection in most of
the  cellular systems it manages. In other  systems in which the Company owns or
has an option to  purchase a majority  interest and where it  is believed to  be
cost-efficient,  such microwave technology will  also be implemented. Otherwise,
such systems will rely  upon landline telephone  connections or microwave  links
owned  by others to link cell sites  with the MTSO. Although the installation of
microwave network interconnection equipment  requires a greater initial  capital
investment,  a microwave network enables a  system operator to avoid the current
and future charges  associated with  leasing telephone lines  from the  landline
telephone  company, while  generally improving system  reliability. In addition,
microwave facilities can be used to  connect separate cellular systems to  allow
shared switching, which reduces the aggregate cost of the equipment necessary to
operate both systems.
 
    The  Company  has  continued  to  expand its  internal  network  in  1995 to
encompass nearly all  of its  managed markets. This  network provides  automatic
call  delivery for the Company's customers and handoff between adjacent markets.
The network has also been extended  through links with certain systems  operated
by  several  other  carriers,  including  GTE,  US  West,  Ameritech, BellSouth,
Centennial Cellular  Corp.,  Southwestern Bell,  AT&T  Wireless  Communications,
Vanguard  Cellular Systems and others. Additionally, the Company has implemented
two Signal Transfer Points which will allow it to interconnect efficiently  with
network  providers  such  as the  Independent  Telephone Network  and  the North
American Cellular Network.
 
    During 1996, the  Company intends to  extend the network  for its  customers
through interconnection with one or more network providers as well as additional
"point  to point" connections required for  hand-off. This expanded network will
increase the area in which  customers can automatically receive incoming  calls,
and  should also  reduce the  incidence of  "tumbling" electronic  serial number
fraud due to the pre-call validation feature of networked systems.
 
    Management  believes  that  currently  available  technologies  will   allow
sufficient  capacity on the  Company's networks to  meet anticipated demand over
the next few years.
 
COSTS OF SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING
 
    Construction of cellular systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial
investment for  land  and  improvements, buildings,  towers,  MTSOs,  cell  site
equipment,  microwave  equipment,  engineering  and  installation.  The Company,
consistent with FCC control  requirements, uses primarily  its own personnel  to
engineer  and oversee construction of each cellular  system where it owns or has
the right to acquire a controlling interest. In so doing, the Company expects to
improve the overall quality of  its systems and to  reduce the expense and  time
required to make them operational.
 
    The  costs (exclusive of license costs)  of the operational systems in which
the Company owns or has the right to acquire an interest are generally  financed
through  capital contributions  or intercompany  loans from  the Company  to the
partnerships or  subsidiaries owning  the systems,  and through  certain  vendor
financing.
 
MARKETING
 
    The  Company's marketing plan  is designed to  continue rapid penetration of
its market clusters and to increase customer awareness of cellular service.  The
marketing  plan  stresses the  quality of  the  Company's service  offerings and
incorporates  both   rate  plans   and   cellular  telephone   equipment   which
 
                                                                              13

are designed to meet the needs of a variety of customer segments and their usage
patterns.  The Company's  distribution channels include  direct sales personnel,
agents and retail  service centers in  the vast majority  of its markets.  These
Company-owned  and managed locations are designed  to market cellular service to
the consumer segment in a familiar setting.
 
    The Company manages each cluster  of markets from one administrative  office
with  a local staff, including sales,  customer service, engineering and in some
cases installation personnel. Direct  sales consultants market cellular  service
to  potential business customers throughout each cluster. Retail associates work
out of the retail locations and market cellular service to the consumer segment.
The Company maintains an ongoing  training program to improve the  effectiveness
of  sales  consultants  and  retail  associates  by  focusing  their  efforts on
obtaining customers  and  maximizing  the  sale  of  high-user  packages.  These
packages provide for customers to obtain a minimum amount of usage at discounted
rates  per minute, at fixed prices which are charged even if usage falls below a
defined monthly minimum amount.
 
    The Company also continues to expand its relationships with agents,  dealers
and   non-Company  retailers  to  obtain   customers.  Agents  and  dealers  are
independent business people who obtain customers for the Company on a commission
basis. The Company's agents  are generally in the  business of selling  cellular
telephones,  cellular service packages and other related products. The Company's
dealers include car  stereo companies  and other companies  whose customers  are
also  potential  cellular  customers.  The  non-Company  retailers  include  car
dealers, major appliance dealers, office supply dealers and mass merchants.
 
    The Company opened its own retail locations in late 1993, expanding to  over
170  locations by the  end of 1995. These  Company-owned and operated businesses
utilize rental facilities in high-traffic areas. The Company is working toward a
uniform appearance  of  these  stores,  with all  having  similar  displays  and
layouts.  The retail centers' hours of business  match those of the retail trade
in the  local marketplace,  often staying  open  on weekends  and later  in  the
evening  than a typical business supplier. Additionally, to fully serve customer
needs, these stores sell accessories to  complement the phones and services  the
Company has traditionally provided.
 
    In addition to its own retail centers, the Company actively pursues national
retail  accounts,  as agents  of the  Company, which  may potentially  yield new
customer additions in multiple markets.  Agreements have been entered into  with
such  national  distributors  as  Wal-Mart,  Chrysler  Corporation,  Ford  Motor
Company, General Motors, AT&T, Radio Shack, Best Buy and Sears, Roebuck & Co. in
certain of the Company's markets. Upon the  sale of a cellular telephone by  one
of  these national distributors, the  Company receives, often exclusively within
the territories served, the resulting cellular customer.
 
    The Company uses a variety of direct mail, billboard, radio, television  and
newspaper   advertising  to  stimulate  interest  by  prospective  customers  in
purchasing the Company's cellular service and to establish familiarity with  the
Company's  name.  Advertising  is  directed  at  gaining  customers,  increasing
existing customers' usage and increasing the public awareness and  understanding
of  the cellular services offered by the Company. The Company attempts to select
the advertising and  promotion media  that are  most appealing  to the  targeted
groups  of potential customers in each  local market. The Company utilizes local
advertising media and  public relations activities  and establishes programs  to
enhance  public  awareness  of the  Company,  such as  providing  telephones and
service for public events and emergency uses.

CUSTOMERS AND SYSTEM USAGE
 
    Cellular customers come  from a  wide range of  occupations. They  typically
include a large proportion of individuals who work outside of their offices such
as  people in the  construction, real estate,  wholesale and retail distribution
businesses and professionals.  Increasingly, the Company  is providing  cellular
service  to consumers  and to  customers who  use their  cellular telephones for
security purposes.  Although  many of  the  Company's customers  use  in-vehicle
cellular   telephones,  most  new  customers  are  selecting  portable  cellular
telephones, as these units have become  more compact and fully featured as  well
as more attractively priced.
 
    The  Company's  cellular systems  are  used most  extensively  during normal
business hours  between  7:00 am  and  6:00 pm.  On  average, the  local  retail
customers  in  the  Company's  majority-owned  and  managed  systems  used their
cellular systems  approximately 95  minutes per  unit each  month and  generated
retail  revenue  of approximately  $44  per month  during  1995, compared  to 95
minutes and $47 per month in  1994. Revenue generated by roamers, together  with
local,  toll and  other revenues,  brought the  Company's total  average monthly
service revenue per customer unit in  majority-owned and managed markets to  $72
during  1995.  Average  monthly  service  revenue  per  customer  unit decreased
approximately 9%  during  1995, related  to  the industry-wide  trend  of  newer
customers  tending  to  use  fewer  minutes per  month,  to  per  minute pricing
decreases, off-peak incentives and to declining contribution of inbound  roaming
revenue  per  customer. The  Company  anticipates that  average  monthly service
revenue per customer unit will continue to decline as its distribution  channels
provide  additional customers who generate lower revenue per local minute of use
and as roaming  revenues grow  more slowly. However,  this effect  is more  than
offset by the Company's increasing number of customers.
 
    In  addition to revenue  from local retail  customers, the Company generates
revenue from roaming customers and other services. The Company's roaming service
allows a customer to  place or receive  a call in a  cellular service area  away
from  the customer's  home service area.  The Company has  entered into "roaming
agreements" with  operators of  other cellular  systems covering  virtually  all
systems  in the United  States and Canada. These  agreements offer customers the
opportunity to roam in these systems. These reciprocal agreements  automatically
pre-register  the  customers of  the Company's  systems  in the  other carriers'
systems. Also, a customer of  a participating system roaming (i.e.,  travelling)
in  a Company  market where this  arrangement is in  effect is able  to make and
receive calls on the Company's system. The charge for this service is  typically
at  premium rates and  is billed by  the Company to  the customer's home system,
which then bills  the customer.  The Company  has entered  into agreements  with
other
 
                                                                              15

cellular  carriers  to  transfer roaming  usage  at agreed-upon  rates.  In some
instances, based on competitive factors, the  Company may charge a lower  amount
to  its customers  than the  amount actually charged  to the  Company by another
cellular carrier for roaming.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
    CELLULAR TELEPHONES AND INSTALLATION.  There are a number of different types
of cellular  telephones, all  of which  are currently  compatible with  cellular
systems  nationwide.  The  Company  offers  a  full  range  of  vehicle-mounted,
transportable and hand-held  portable cellular telephones.  Features offered  in
some of the cellular telephones include hands-free calling, repeat dialing, horn
alert and others.
 
    The   Company  negotiates  volume  discounts  from  its  cellular  telephone
suppliers. The Company discounts cellular  telephones to meet competition or  to
stimulate  sales by reducing the cost of  becoming a cellular customer. In these
instances, where permitted by law, customers  are generally required to sign  an
extended  service contract  with the Company.  The Company  also cooperates with
cellular equipment manufacturers in local advertising and promotion of  cellular
equipment.
 
    The  Company has established service  and/or installation facilities in many
of its local markets to ensure quality installation and service of the  cellular
telephones  it sells. These facilities allow  the Company to improve its service
by promptly assisting customers who experience equipment problems. Additionally,
the Company maintains a repair facility  in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which handles  more
complex service and repair issues.
 
    CELLULAR  SERVICES.   The  Company's  customers are  able  to choose  from a
variety of packaged pricing  plans which are designed  to fit different  calling
patterns.  The  Company's customer  bills  typically show  separate  charges for
custom-calling features,  airtime in  excess of  the packaged  amount, and  toll
calls.  Custom-calling features provided  by the Company  include wide-area call
delivery,  call  forwarding,  call  waiting,  three-way  calling  and  no-answer
transfer.  The  Company also  offers  a voice  message  service in  many  of its
markets. This service, which functions  like a sophisticated answering  machine,
allows customers to receive messages from callers when they are not available to
take calls.
 
REGULATION
 
    The  Company's  operations  are subject  to  FCC and  state  regulation. The
licenses held  by the  Company are  granted  by the  FCC for  the use  of  radio
frequencies and are an important component of the overall value of the assets of
the   Company.   The   construction,   operation   and   transfer   of  cellular
 
16
<PAGE>
systems in  the  United States  are  regulated to  varying  degrees by  the  FCC
pursuant  to the Communications Act of  1934 (the "Communications Act"). The FCC
has promulgated  regulations governing  construction and  operation of  cellular
systems,  and licensing (including renewal  of licenses) and technical standards
for the provision of cellular telephone service. See "Telecommunications Act  of
1996."
 
    For  licensing purposes, the FCC has divided the United States into separate
geographic markets  (MSAs and  RSAs).  In each  market, the  allocated  cellular
frequencies  are divided into two equal  blocks. During the application process,
the FCC  reserved  one block  of  frequencies for  non-wireline  applicants  and
another  block  for wireline  applicants. Subject  to  FCC approval,  a cellular
system may be sold to  either a wireline or  non-wireline entity, but no  entity
which  controls a cellular system may own an interest in another cellular system
in the same MSA or RSA.
 
    The completion  of  acquisitions involving  the  transfer of  control  of  a
cellular  system requires prior FCC approval. Acquisitions of minority interests
generally do not require  FCC approval. Whenever FCC  approval is required,  any
interested  party  may  file  a  petition  to  dismiss  or  deny  the  Company's
application for approval of the proposed transfer.
 
    When the first  cell of a  cellular system has  been constructed, FCC  rules
authorize  the licensee to offer commercial service  to the public. The FCC must
be notified  of  the  construction of  that  cell  within fifteen  days  of  the
completion  of  construction.  The  licensee is  then  said  to  have "operating
authority." Initial operating licenses are granted for ten-year periods. The FCC
must be notified each time an additional cell is constructed which enlarges  the
service area of a given market.
 
    The  FCC's rules also generally require persons or entities holding cellular
construction permits or  licenses to coordinate  their proposed frequency  usage
with  neighboring cellular licensees  in order to  avoid electrical interference
between adjacent systems. The height and power of base stations in the  cellular
system  are regulated by FCC rules, as are the types of signals emitted by these
stations. In addition to regulation by the FCC, cellular systems are subject  to
certain  Federal Aviation Administration regulations  with respect to the siting
and construction of cellular transmitter towers and antennas.
 
    The  FCC  has  established  standards  for  conducting  comparative  renewal
proceedings  between  a cellular  licensee seeking  renewal  of its  license and
challengers filing competing applications. The FCC has: (i) established criteria
for comparing  the renewal  applicant to  challengers, including  the  standards
under  which a  "renewal expectancy"  will be  granted to  the applicant seeking
license  renewal;   (ii)   established  basic   qualifications   standards   for
challengers; and (iii) provided procedures for preventing possible abuses in the
comparative  renewal process. The FCC has concluded that it will award a renewal
expectancy if the licensee has (i) provided "substantial" performance, which  is
defined as "sound, favorable and substantially above a level of mediocre service
just  minimally justifying renewal," and (ii)  complied with FCC rules, policies
and the Communications Act.  If a renewal expectancy  is awarded to an  existing
licensee,  its license is renewed and competing applications are not considered.
The Company's Tulsa and Knoxville licenses  were renewed in 1995. The  Company's
next  renewal applications are  due to be  filed in 1996,  for Des Moines, Iowa;
Peoria, Illinois and Roanoke, Virginia.
 
    The Company conducts and plans to conduct its operations in accordance  with
all relevant FCC rules and regulations and anticipates being able to qualify for
a  renewal expectancy in its upcoming  renewal filings. Accordingly, the Company
believes that  current  regulations  will  have no  significant  effect  on  its
operations  and  financial  condition.  However, changes  in  the  regulation of
cellular operators or  their activities  and of other  mobile service  providers
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.
 
    The  FCC has also  provided that five  years after the  initial licenses are
granted, unserved areas within  markets previously granted  to licensees may  be
applied  for by  both wireline and  non-wireline entities and  by third parties.
Accordingly, many unserved area applications have been filed by the Company  and
others.  The  Company's  strategy with  respect  to system  construction  in its
markets has been and will be to  build cells covering areas within such  markets
that  the Company considers economically feasible  to serve or might conceivably
wish to serve and to do so within the five-year period following issuance of the
license. In cases  where applications  for unserved  areas are  filed which  are
"mutually exclusive" and would result in overlapping service areas, the FCC will
decide between the competing applicants by an auction process.
 
                                                                              17
<PAGE>
    The Company is also subject to state and local regulation in some instances.
In  1981, the FCC preempted the states from exercising jurisdiction in the areas
of licensing,  technical  standards  and market  structure.  In  1993,  Congress
preempted  states from regulating the entry of cellular systems into service and
the rates  charged by  cellular systems  to customers.  However, certain  states
still  require cellular  system operators  to go  through a  state certification
process to serve communities within their borders. All such certificates can  be
revoked  for cause. In addition, certain  state authorities continue to regulate
several aspects  of a  cellular  operator's business,  including the  resale  of
intra-state  long-distance service to its  customers, the technical arrangements
and charges for interconnection  with the landline network  and the transfer  of
interests  in cellular systems, though it is uncertain whether states any longer
have the  right  to  regulate  transfers  under  current  law.  The  siting  and
construction  of the cellular facilities, including transmitter towers, antennas
and equipment shelters are still subject to  state or local zoning and land  use
regulations. In addition, states may still regulate other "terms and conditions"
of cellular service.
 
    Pursuant  to 1993 amendments to the  Communications Act, cellular service is
classified as a Commercial Mobile Radio Service ("CMRS"), in that it is  service
offered to the public, for a fee, which is interconnected to the public switched
telephone  network. The FCC has determined  that it will forebear from requiring
CMRS carriers  to  comply  with  a  number  of  statutory  provisions  otherwise
applicable to common carriers, such as the filing of tariffs.
 
    There  are two regulatory proceedings currently pending before the FCC which
are of particular importance to the cellular industry. In the first  proceeding,
the  FCC  has sought  comment on  whether "enhanced  911" regulations  should be
imposed on cellular carriers. "Enhanced 911" capabilities would enable  cellular
systems  to determine  the precise location  of the person  making the emergency
call.
 
    In the second  proceeding, the  FCC, in 1996,  issued a  Notice of  Proposed
Rulemaking  regarding the method  by which cellular  carriers and Local Exchange
Carriers ("LECs") shall compensate each  other for interconnecting cellular  and
local  exchange facilities. The  FCC has tentatively proposed  a "bill and keep"
system, under which cellular and other CMRS carriers and LECs would simply  keep
all  revenues from calls originating on their  systems and would not have to pay
special "interconnection" charges  to each  other. Since CMRS  carriers now  pay
more  to interconnect with LECs than VICE  VERSA, such a rule, if adopted, would
be favorable to the cellular industry. The  FCC has also sought comment in  this
proceeding   on   whether  it   should   pre-empt  all   state   regulations  of
interconnection.
 
    The FCC has  also allocated a  total of 140  megahertz ("MHz") to  broadband
PCS,  20  MHz  to unlicensed  operations  and  120 MHz  to  licensed operations,
consisting of two 30 MHz blocks in  each of the 51 Major Trading Areas  ("MTAs")
and  one 30 MHz block and three 10 MHz blocks in each of 493 Basic Trading Areas
("BTAs"). Cellular operators and those entities under common ownership with them
are permitted to participate in the ownership of PCS licensees, except for those
PCS licenses reserved for small businesses,  and licenses for PCS service  areas
in  which the  cellular operator owns  a 20%  or greater interest  in a cellular
licensee, the service area of which covers 10% or more of the population of  the
PCS  service area. In the latter case, the cellular license is limited to one 10
MHz PCS channel block.
 
    The FCC licensed the first two 30 MHz MTA frequency blocks in 1995. The  FCC
is  currently holding an auction for the 30  MHz BTA block which is reserved for
small business entities. American Portable  Telecom, Inc. ("APT"), a  subsidiary
of  TDS which is developing  broadband PCS services, has  been licensed in eight
MTAs for 30 MHz blocks. APT has entered into a definitive agreement to sell  its
license covering the Guam MTA, subject to FCC approval, and is pursuing the sale
of its license for the Alaska MTA.
 
    In  compliance with  FCC restrictions  on common  ownership of  cellular and
broadband PCS interests in overlapping market areas, the Company entered into  a
series  of arrangements for  the divestiture or restructuring  of certain of its
cellular interests in market areas where APT was awarded broadband PCS licenses.
A number of these proposed arrangements  required FCC approval of assignment  or
transfer  of control applications before they could be consummated. All of these
applications have  been  approved by  the  FCC  and are  either  consummated  or
awaiting consummation. APT believes that it has taken reasonable steps to comply
with  the FCC's cross-interest policies. This is no assurance that the FCC might
not raise questions regarding these compliance efforts.

    PCS  technology is currently  under development and will  be similar in some
respects to cellular  technology. When it  becomes commercially available,  this
technology  is expected  to offer  increased capacity  for wireless  two-way and
one-way voice, data and  multimedia communications services  and is expected  to
result  in increased  competition in  the Company's  operations. The  ability of
these future  PCS licensees  to  complement or  compete with  existing  cellular
licensees  will be affected  by future FCC rule-makings.  These and other future
technological developments in the  wireless telecommunications industry and  the
enhancement of current technologies will likely create new products and services
that  are competitive with the services  currently offered by the Company. There
can be no  assurance that the  Company will  not be adversely  affected by  such
technological developments.
 
    Media  reports have suggested that  certain radio frequency ("RF") emissions
from portable cellular  telephones might be  linked to cancer.  The Company  has
reviewed  relevant scientific information and, based on such information, is not
aware of any credible evidence linking the usage of portable cellular telephones
with cancer. The FCC currently has a rulemaking proceeding pending to update the
guidelines and methods it uses for  evaluating RF emissions in radio  equipment,
including  cellular telephones. While the proposal would impose more restrictive
standards on  RF emissions  from  low-power devices  such as  portable  cellular
telephones,  it is anticipated  that all cellular  telephones currently marketed
and in use will comply with those standards.
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996
 
    The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") was enacted on  February
8,   1996.   The   1996   Act   mandates   significant   changes   in   existing
telecommunications  rules  and  policies  to  promote  competition,  ensure  the
availability  of telecommunications services  to all parts of  the nation and to
streamline regulation of  the telecommunications industry  to remove  regulatory
burdens.
 
    The  1996 Act provides that implementing  its legislative objectives will be
the task of the FCC, the state public utilities commissions and a  federal-state
joint  board.  Much  of  this  implementation  must  be  completed  in numerous,
virtually simultaneous,  proceedings with  short, 6-18  month, deadlines.  These
proceedings are expected to address issues (and possibly even proposals) already
before  the FCC  in pending rulemaking  proceedings affecting  the telephone and
wireless industries, as  well as additional  areas of telecommunications  policy
and  regulation. The proceedings will also replace, modify or terminate existing
FCC and state policies and regulations that are inconsistent with the new law.
 
    OPEN COMPETITION.  The primary purpose and effect of the new law is to  open
all  telecommunications  markets  to competition  --  including  local telephone
service. The 1996  Act makes virtually  all direct or  indirect state and  local
barriers to competition unlawful. It directs the FCC to preempt all inconsistent
state  and local laws and regulations,  after notice and comment proceedings. It
also enables  electric  and  other utilities  to  engage  in  telecommunications
service through qualifying subsidiaries.
 
    Only  narrow  powers over  competitive  entry are  left  to state  and local
authorities. Each  state retains  the power  to impose  "competitively  neutral"
requirements that are consistent with the 1996 Act's universal service provision
and  necessary  for universal  services,  public safety  and  welfare, continued
service quality and consumer rights. While  a state may not impose  requirements
that  effectively function as barriers to entry, it retains limited authority to
regulate certain competitive practices in rural telephone company service areas.
 
    Some specific provisions of the 1996 Act which are expected to affect  local
exchange, wireless and interexchange providers are:
 
    EXPANDED  INTERCONNECTION OBLIGATIONS.   The 1996 Act  establishes a general
duty for all telecommunications carriers, including cellular and PCS  providers,
to interconnect with other carriers.
 
    Congress  has also developed  a somewhat more  specific list of requirements
with respect  to  the interconnection  obligations  of LECs.  These  obligations
include  resale, number portability, dialing parity, access to rights-of-way and
reciprocal compensation. These LEC obligations do not extend to wireless service
providers, unless the  FCC decides to  include them within  the definition of  a
LEC.  However, the requirements apply to competitive providers of local exchange
or exchange access services, as well as the incumbent LECs.
 
                                                                              19
<PAGE>
    Unless exempted  or  granted  suspension or  modification,  LECs  designated
"incumbents" have additional obligations as follows: to negotiate in good faith;
to comply with more detailed interconnection terms, including non-discrimination
and  unbundling their network and service  components so competitors may provide
only those elements they  choose to provide; to  offer their retail services  at
wholesale  rates to facilitate  resale by their competitors;  and to allow other
carriers to place  equipment necessary  for interconnection or  access on  their
premises.
 
    The  1996 Act establishes  a framework for state  commissions to mediate and
arbitrate interconnection  negotiations  between  incumbent  LECs  and  carriers
requesting   interconnection,  services  or  network   elements.  The  1996  Act
establishes   deadlines,   standards   for   state   commission   approval    of
interconnection  agreements and recourse to the  FCC if a state commission fails
to act.
 
    UNIVERSAL SERVICE.  The  1996 Act establishes principles  and a process  for
implementing  a  strengthened  "universal  service"  policy.  This  policy seeks
nationwide, affordable  service and  access to  advanced telecommunications  and
information  services. It calls for reasonably  comparable urban and rural rates
and services. The 1996 Act also requires universal service to schools, libraries
and rural health facilities at discounted rates.
 
    Regulators must complete a major  overhaul of current support mechanisms  to
eliminate implicit subsidies. All long distance providers must provide urban and
rural long distance services essentially at averaged rates and must average long
distance  calls from one state to another. To receive universal service support,
a carrier  must  obtain state  designation  as an  "eligible  telecommunications
carrier"  and provide  universal service  throughout a  state-designated service
area. The state  must designate  more than  one requesting  eligible carrier  to
receive support in most areas, but can only do so in a rural telephone company's
area if it makes a public interest finding.
 
    CARRIER   SUPPORT  OBLIGATIONS.    The  1996  Act  requires  all  interstate
telecommunications providers, including wireless service providers, to "make  an
equitable and non-discriminatory contribution," to support the cost of providing
universal service, unless their contribution would be DE MINIMIS.
 
    BELL OPERATING COMPANY PROVISIONS.  The 1996 Act establishes the process for
eliminating  all  remaining  line-of-business restrictions  placed  on  the Bell
Operating Companies ("BOCs") by the AT&T divestiture consent decree. Subject  to
specific  safeguards,  the BOCs  may immediately  provide long  distance service
outside the area where that Bell group serves, as well as specified "incidental"
long distance services. For in-region long distance relief, the BOCs must obtain
an FCC public  interest finding and  show that they  have met a  strict list  of
interconnection  requirements and that there is a specified level of competition
in each in-region state to be relieved of the long distance ban.
 
    PROHIBITION AGAINST  CROSS-SUBSIDY.   The  1996  Act prohibits  a  LEC  from
subsidizing    any   competitive   service    (including   voice   mail,   voice
storage/retrieval, live operator services  and related ancillary services)  from
its telephone exchange service or exchange access service.
 
    TELEPHONE  COMPANY PROVISION  OF CABLE  TELEVISION SERVICES.   The  1996 Act
eliminates the ban  on LEC provision  of cable programming  service directly  to
subscribers   within  its   telephone  service  area.   However,  most  mergers,
acquisitions and  joint ventures  by LECs  and cable  systems in  the same  area
remain unlawful.
 
    INFRASTRUCTURE  SHARING.   LECs  with "eligible  telecommunications carrier"
status that lack economies of scale  may share features and functions of  larger
neighboring incumbent LECs on non-common carrier terms.
 
    USE  OF CUSTOMER  INFORMATION.   The new law  restricts the  use of customer
information for  purposes beyond  the  provision of  service except  subject  to
prescribed   safeguards,  and   requires  LECs  to   provide  directory  listing
information to competing telephone directory providers.
 
    ELIMINATION  OF   ALIEN   OFFICER/DIRECTOR  RESTRICTIONS.      The   current
restrictions  on the  numbers of  alien officers  and directors  of FCC licensee
companies and companies controlling such licenses has been eliminated.
 
20
<PAGE>
    BOC COMMERCIAL MOBILE JOINT MARKETING.  BOCs are permitted to market jointly
and sell  wireless  services in  conjunction  with telephone  exchange  service,
exchange  access,  intraLATA  and interLATA  telecommunications  and information
services.
 
    WIRELESS FACILITIES SITING.   The 1996 Act limits  the rights of states  and
localities  to regulate placement of wireless facilities so as to "prohibit" the
provision of  wireless services  or to  "discriminate" among  providers of  such
services.  It also eliminates environmental  effects (provided that the wireless
system complies with FCC rules) as a basis for states and localities to regulate
the placement, construction or operation of wireless facilities.
 
    EQUAL ACCESS.   Section  332(c)  of the  Communications  Act is  amended  to
provide  that wireless  providers are  not required  to provide  equal access to
common carriers for toll  services. The FCC is  authorized to require  unblocked
access subject to certain conditions.
 
    DEREGULATION.  The FCC is required to forbear from applying any statutory or
regulatory  provision that is not necessary to keep telecommunications rates and
terms reasonable or to protect consumers. A  state may not apply a statutory  or
regulatory provision that the FCC decides to forbear from applying. In addition,
the  FCC  must review  its telecommunications  regulations  every two  years and
change any that are no longer necessary.
 
COMPETITION
 
    The Company's principal  competitor for cellular  telephone service in  each
market  is the licensee of the second cellular system in that market. Since each
competitor operates its cellular system on a 25 MHz frequency block licensed  by
the  FCC using comparable  technology and facilities,  competition for customers
between the two systems in each market is principally on the basis of quality of
service, price, size of  area covered, services  offered, and responsiveness  of
customer  service. The competing  entities in many  of the markets  in which the
Company has an interest have financial resources which are substantially greater
than those of the Company and its partners in such markets.
 
    The FCC's rules require  all operational cellular systems  to provide, on  a
nondiscriminatory  basis, cellular service to resellers which purchase blocks of
mobile telephone numbers from an operational system and then resell them to  the
public.
 
    In  addition to competition from the other cellular licensee in each market,
there is also  competition from, among  other technologies, conventional  mobile
telephone  and SMR systems, both of which  are able to connect with the landline
telephone network.  The  Company  believes that  conventional  mobile  telephone
systems  and conventional SMR systems are competitively disadvantaged because of
technological limitations on the capacity of such systems. The FCC has  recently
given  approval, through waivers of its rules,  to ESMR, an enhanced SMR system.
ESMR  systems  may  have  cells  and  frequency  reuse  like  cellular,  thereby
potentially  eliminating any  current technological  limitation. The  first ESMR
systems were  implemented  in  1993 in  Los  Angeles  and are  beginning  to  be
constructed  in several other cities across the  United States. In 1995, an ESMR
provider initiated  service in  Tulsa, Oklahoma,  where the  Company operates  a
cellular  system.  Although less  directly  a substitute  for  cellular service,
wireless data services and  one-way paging service (and  in the future,  two-way
paging  services) may be adequate  for those who do  not need full two-way voice
service.
 
    PCS is anticipated to  be competitive with cellular  service in the  future.
PCS  providers are expected to  offer digital, wireless communications services.
Similar technological  advances or  regulatory changes  in the  future may  make
available  other alternatives  to cellular service,  thereby creating additional
sources of competition. The first PCS  system was initiated in Washington,  D.C.
in 1995. The Company expects PCS operators to begin deployment of PCS in some of
its  larger cellular markets like Tulsa, Oklahoma; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Des
Moines, Iowa in late 1996 or early 1997.
 
    Continuing technological  advances  in  the  communications  field  make  it
difficult  to predict the  extent of additional  future competition for cellular
systems. For example, the FCC has allocated radio channels to a mobile satellite
system in which transmissions from mobile  units to satellites would augment  or
replace  transmissions  to cell  sites, and  several  consortia to  provide such
service have  been formed.  Such a  system is  designed primarily  to serve  the
communications needs of remote locations and a
 
                                                                              21

mobile satellite system could provide viable competition for land-based cellular
systems in such areas. It is also possible that the FCC may in the future assign
additional  frequencies to cellular  telephone service to  provide for more than
two cellular telephone systems per market.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    The Company had  3,175 employees as  of December 31,  1995. Of these,  2,791
were  based at the various  cellular markets operated or  managed by the Company
with only 384 based at  its corporate office in  Chicago, Illinois. None of  the
Company's  employees  is  represented  by  a  labor  organization.  The  Company
considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
    The property  for mobile  telephone  switching offices  and cell  sites  are
either  owned  or leased  under  long-term leases  by  the Company,  one  of its
subsidiaries or  the partnership  or corporation  which holds  the  construction
permit or license. The Company has not experienced major problems with obtaining
zoning  approval for cell sites or  operating facilities and does not anticipate
any such problems in the future which are or will be material to the Company and
its subsidiaries  as a  whole. The  Company's investment  in property  is  small
compared to its investment in licenses and cellular system equipment.
 
    The  Company leases approximately 75,000 square feet of office space for its
headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.
 
    The Company  considers  the  properties  owned  or  leased  by  it  and  its
subsidiaries   to  be  suitable  and  adequate  for  their  respective  business
operations.
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC  and
various  state  and  federal  courts. In  some  cases,  the  litigation involves
disputes regarding  rights  to  certain cellular  telephone  systems  and  other
interests.  The Company does not believe that  any such proceeding should have a
material adverse impact on the Company.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:
 
    We have audited  in accordance with  generally accepted auditing  standards,
the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  United  States  Cellular
Corporation and  Subsidiaries  Annual  Report to  Shareholders  incorporated  by
reference  in this Form 10-K, and have  issued our report thereon dated February
6, 1996. Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial  statements taken  as a  whole. The  financial  statement
schedule  listed  in  Item  14(a)(2)  is  the  responsibility  of  the Company's
management and is presented  for purposes of complying  with the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements. This financial statement schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic consolidated financial  statements
and,  in our opinion, fairly states in  all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

              COMPILATION REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:
 
    The accompanying combined  balance sheets  of the Los  Angeles SMSA  Limited
Partnership,  the Nashville/Clarksville  MSA Limited  Partnership and  the Baton
Rouge MSA Limited Partnership as of December  31, 1995 and 1994 and the  related
combined  statements of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows
for each of the  three years in  the period ended December  31, 1995, have  been
prepared  from  the  separate  financial  statements,  which  are  not presented
separately herein, of the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and  Baton
Rouge  MSA limited partnerships,  as described in  Note 1. We  have reviewed for
compilation only the  accompanying combined  financial statements,  and, in  our
opinion, those statements have been properly compiled from the amounts and notes
of  the  underlying  separate  financial statements  of  the  Los  Angeles SMSA,
Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton Rouge MSA limited partnerships, on the basis
described in Note 1.
 
    The statements for the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton
Rouge MSA limited partnerships  were audited by other  auditors as set forth  in
their reports included on pages 32 through 37. We have not been engaged to audit
either   the  separate  financial  statements   of  the  aforementioned  limited
partnerships or the  related combined  financial statements  in accordance  with
generally  accepted auditing standards and  to render an opinion  as to the fair
presentation of such financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted
accounting principles.

                    REPORTS OF OTHER INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To The Partners of
  LOS ANGELES SMSA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:
 
    In  our opinion,  the balance  sheet and  the related  statements of income,
partner's capital and of cash flows  and the financial statement schedule II  --
valuation  and qualifying accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership at December 31, 1995,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements, which
are not presented separately herein, are the responsibility of the Partnership's
management;  our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements based on  our audit. We  conducted our audit  of these statements  in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence  supporting the  amounts and disclosures  in the  financial

capital  and cash flows for  each of the two years  in the period ended December
31, 1994; such financial  statements are not  included separately herein.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion  on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan  and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all material  respects, the financial  position of Los  Angeles SMSA Limited
Partnership as of December 31, 1994, and results of its operations and its  cash

</TABLE>
 
    Effective  January 1, 1995, one of  the Partnerships changed its estimate of
the useful lives of certain telecommunications equipment from 7 to 10 years. The
change  in  estimate  had  the  effect  of  reducing  depreciation  expense  and
increasing net income by approximately $14,844,000 for 1995.

</TABLE>
 
    Included  in buildings  are costs relating  to the acquisition  of cell site
leases; such as legal, consulting, and  title fees. Lease acquisition costs  are
capitalized  when incurred  and amortized  over the  period of  the lease. Costs
related to unsuccessful negotiations are expensed in the period the negotiations
are terminated.
 
    Gains and losses on disposals are included in income at amounts equal to the
difference between net book value and proceeds received upon disposal.
 
    On January 10, 1994, one of the Partnerships entered into an agreement  with
its  major supplier to purchase $77 million  in equipment. At December 31, 1995,
approximately $22 million  in equipment  had been purchased  by the  Partnership
under the agreement.
 
    OTHER CURRENT ASSETS
 
    Other  current assets  includes inventory  consisting primarily  of cellular
phones and accessories held for resale  stated at average cost. Consistent  with
industry  practice, losses  on sales  of cellular  phones are  recognized in the
period in which sales are made as a cost of acquiring subscribers.
 
    REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
    Revenues from  operations  primarily consist  of  charges to  customers  for
monthly access charges, cellular airtime usage, and roamer charges. Revenues are
recognized  as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues, resulting from cellular
service provided from the billing cycle date  to the end of each month and  from
other  cellular carriers' customers using the partnership's cellular systems for
the last half of each month, are estimated and recorded as receivables. Unearned
monthly access  charges and  bundled service  packages relating  to the  periods
after  month-end  are  deferred  and  netted  against  accounts  receivable  and
recognized the following month when services are provided.
 
    INCOME TAXES
 
    No provisions have been  made for federal or  state income taxes since  such
taxes, if any, are the responsibility of the individual partners.
 
    ADVERTISING
 
    Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The advertising expense for 1995
was $42,046,000.
 
    ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 
    The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect  the amounts reported  in the  financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

    IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
 
    In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121, "Accounting  for  the  Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and  for Long-Lived Assets  to be Disposed  Of" ("SFAS  121").
Under  SFAS 121, the Partnerships are required to evaluate long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets,  including fixed assets, for  impairment
whenever  events or changes in circumstances indicate  that the book value of an
asset may not be recoverable. An  impairment loss should be recognized  whenever
the  review  demonstrates that  the  book value  of  a long-lived  asset  is not
recoverable. The  Partnerships do  not expect  the implementation  of SFAS  121,
adopted  effective January 1, 1996,  to have a material  impact on its financial
condition or results of operations.
 
    RECLASSIFICATIONS
 
    Certain reclassifications of the 1994  and 1993 financial statements of  one
of  the Partnerships  have been  made to conform  to the  1995 presentation. The
reclassifications have not affected previously reported net income or  partners'
capital.
 
3.  LEASE COMMITMENTS:
 
    Future  minimum  rental payments  required under  operating leases  for real
estate that have initial  or remaining noncancellable lease  terms in excess  of
one year as of December 31, 1995, are as follows:

</TABLE>
 
    The initial lease terms generally range from 5 to 25 years with the majority
of them having initial terms of 10 years and providing for one renewal option of
5   years  and  for   rental  escalation.  Included   in  selling,  general  and
administrative  expense  are  rental  costs  of  $17,455,000,  $17,750,000   and
$15,119,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.
One  of  the  Partnerships  leases  office  facilities  under  a  ten-year lease
agreement which  provides for  free  rent incentives  for  six months  and  rent
escalation  over the ten-year period. The Partnership recognizes rent expense on
a straight-line basis  and recorded the  related deferred rent  as a  noncurrent
liability  to be amortized as an adjustment to rental costs over the life of the
lease.
 
4.  SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
 
    On November  1,  1995,  one of  the  Partners  of one  of  the  Partnerships
contributed  a  note  receivable of  $3,152,000  (Note  5) and  other  assets of
$104,000 and  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  other  RSA  interests  totaling
$6,018,000.  All assets  and liabilities were  recorded at  their historical net
book value. The contribution of the note receivable and the combined  properties
is reflected in the Statement of Changes in Partners' Capital.
 
    During  1995, one of  the Partnerships replaced and  upgraded certain of its
cellular equipment with new cellular  technology which supports both analog  and
digital  voice  transmissions. In  connection with  this equipment  upgrade, the
Partnership traded-in cellular equipment with a net book value of $3,704,000 for
new cellular equipment  with a  cost of  $6,250,000. The  remaining balance  was
funded through the credit facility with its General Partner.

5.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
 
    Certain  affiliates of these cellular  limited partnerships provide services
for the system  operations, legal, financial,  management and administration  of
these  entities. These affiliates  are reimbursed for  both direct and allocated
costs (totaling $59.5 million in 1995,  $57.6 million in 1994 and $57.1  million
in  1993) related to  providing these services.  In addition, certain affiliates
have established a credit facility with certain partnerships to provide  working
capital   to  the  partnership.  One  of  the  partnerships  participates  in  a
centralized cash management  arrangement with its  general partner. At  December
31,  1995 and  1994, the  interest-bearing balance  amounted to  $14,830,000 and
$16,016,000, respectively. Effective January 1,  1989, the general partner  pays
or  charges  the  Partnership  monthly  interest,  computed  using  the  general
partner's average borrowing rate, on the amounts due to or from the Partnership.
Interest earned in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $785,000, $1,480,000 and  $1,294,000,
respectively.
 
    One  of the Partnerships has a note receivable from its General Partner with
a balance of $3,152,000  and accrued interest of  $32,000 at December 31,  1995.
The  note  bears  interest  at  12% per  annum,  compounded  quarterly  with all
principal and interest due at maturity on May 10, 1997. The note was contributed
to the Partnership by its General Partner during 1995 (Note 4).

</TABLE>
 
    Accounts receivable are derived from revenues earned from customers  located
in the Partnership's metropolitan serving area. The Partnership performs ongoing
credit  evaluations  of  its  customers  and  in  certain  circumstances obtains
refundable deposits.  The Partnership  maintains reserves  for potential  credit
losses;  historically, such  losses have been  within management's expectations.
The carrying value of accounts receivable approximates fair value.
 
    Two  of  the  Partnerships  provide  cellular  service  and  sell   cellular
telephones  to diversified groups of  consumers within concentrated geographical
areas. The  general partner  performs credit  evaluations of  the  Partnerships'
customers  and generally does not  require collateral. Receivables are generally
due within  30  days.  Credit  losses related  to  customers  have  been  within
management's expectations.
 
7.  REGULATORY MATTERS:
 
    On  December 21, 1993,  the California Public  Utilities Commission ("CPUC")
issued  an  Order  Instituting  Investigation  into  the  regulation  of  mobile
telephone  service  and wireless  communications.  The investigation  proposes a
regulatory program which would encompass all forms of mobile telephone services.
 
    In 1993, the U.S.  Congress passed legislation  prohibiting state and  local
governments  from  regulating the  rates  for commercial  mobile  radio services
("CMRS"), including cellular service.  States with rate  regulation in place  on
June  1, 1993, including California, were  given the opportunity to petition the
Federal Communications Commission  ("FCC") for continuation  of such  authority.
The CPUC filed such
 
                                                                              45

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
a  petition  with the  FCC. The  FCC denied  the CPUC's  petition in  an interim
decision issued  in May  1995  and issued  a final  Order  in August  1995  (the
"Order"),  thereby preempting the CPUC's authority over rates. As a consequence,
one of the Partnerships withdrew its rate-related traiffs.
 
    The  CPUC  is  currently  considering  outstanding  issues  concerning   its
remaining  jurisdiction over  CMRS providers  in recognition  of the  changes in
federal law  and the  Order.  Specifically, the  CPUC  is assessing  changes  to
existing  regulation in light of the preemption of rate and entry regulation and
the scope of its residual authority to regulate "other terms and conditions"  of
services.  Until the CPUC  completes its assessment  of its remaining regulatory
authority, the effect,  if any, of  such regulation to  the Partnership and  its
operating activities cannot be determined.
 
8.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS:
 
    A  class action complaint was filed in November 1993 naming a partner of one
of the partnerships as  general partner of the  Partnership. In April 1995,  the
Partnership  was named as a necessary party to the action. The plaintiff alleged
the Partnership conspired  to fix  the price  of wholesale  and retail  cellular
service  in its metropolitan serving area  market. The plaintiff alleged damages
for the class "in a sum in excess of $100 million." The Partnership has answered
the complaint  and intends  to  defend itself  vigorously.  This case  has  been
consolidated  for  purposes of  discovery with  two  other class  actions making
identical price-fixing allegations. The case has been removed to federal  court.
The  other cases have been  stayed pending resolution of  a motion to remand the
case to state court. In addition, three non-class action antitrust cases brought
by cellular  agents  making  similar allegations  were  settled  for  immaterial
amounts.  In April  1995, a  Federal class action  complaint was  dismissed on a
motion for summary judgment. The dismissal was upheld on appeal. The Partnership
does not believe that these proceedings  will have a material adverse effect  on
the Partnership's financial position.
 
    In  September 1995,  a class  action lawsuit  was brought  on behalf  of all
subscribers of the  general partner of  one of the  Partnerships, including  the
Partnership's  subscribers, regarding customer notification of the Partnership's
practices with  respect  to  billing  for  fractional  minutes  of  service.  No
dispositive  motions have been filed in the proceeding and discovery has not yet
begun. The Partnership believes the lawsuit to be without merit.
 
    One of the Partnerships is a party to various other lawsuits arising in  the
ordinary   course  of  business.  Although  the  ultimate  resolution  of  these
proceedings cannot be ascertained, the Partnership's management does not believe
they will  have a  materially adverse  effect on  the results  of operations  or
financial position of the Partnership.

(Plus Capitalized Interest)
                                      Amended and as of ________________, 1995


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION, a corporation 
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "COMPANY"), promises 
to pay to the order of NTFC CAPITAL CORPORATION (formerly known as Northern 
Telecom Finance Corporation) (the "LENDER") at its offices located at 220 
Athens Way, Nashville, Tennessee 37228-1399, in lawful money of the United 
States of America and in immediately available funds the lesser of (i) 
Thirty-Nine Million Four Hundred Sixty-One Thousand Dollars ($39,461,000.00), 
and (ii) all amounts advanced pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Loan 
Agreement (defined below), together with interest thereon and other amounts 
due as provided below.  This Note shall finally mature on December 1, 2003 
(the "FINAL MATURITY DATE").

     This Note has been made and delivered pursuant to that certain Amended 
and Restated Term Loan Agreement dated as of December 22, 1994 by and between 
the Company and the Lender, as amended by a First Amendment to Amended and 
Restated Term Loan Agreement of even date herewith and as it may be further 
modified, amended or supplemented from time to time (the "LOAN AGREEMENT"), 
and is the 1994 Construction Note described in Section 2.2(b) thereof.  Any 
capitalized term not otherwise defined in this Note shall have the meaning 
ascribed to it in the Loan Agreement.  Reference is made to the Loan 
Agreement, which among other things provides for the acceleration of the 
maturity hereof upon the occurrence of certain events and for prepayments in 
certain circumstances and upon certain terms and conditions.  This Note may 
be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, in accordance 
with the Loan Agreement.  This Note is secured by the Collateral described 
in the Loan Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Assignments and is 
entitled to the benefits thereof.

     All Advances hereunder shall bear interest at the Base Rate, as defined 
below, from the date of such Advance until such amount is due and payable 
(whether at the Maturity Date, upon Required Prepayment, by acceleration, or 
otherwise).  The Base Rate shall be the adjustable interest rate per annum 
(compounded monthly and computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the 
actual days elapsed) equal to the rate announced from time to time as the 
ninety (90) day "Commercial Paper" rate (being defined as the rate paid on 
high grade unsecured notes sold through major dealers by major corporations 
in multiples of $1,000 for repurchase within 90 days) as reported in THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL, PLUS 2.25% per annum.  The Base Rate in effect on the last 
Business Day of each


<PAGE>


Calendar Quarter as reflected by the most recent THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
publication shall be the Base Rate for the following Calendar Quarter.

     Each Advance made under this Note (except Advances for Capitalized 
Interest) shall be evidenced by a separate Note Schedule to be attached to 
this Note, each of which shall be consecutively numbered, beginning with 
SCHEDULE 1.  Each and all of the Note Schedules shall be deemed a part 
hereof.  The principal of and interest on each such Advance under the Note 
shall be paid as follows:

     During the period from the date of each Advance hereunder through the 
     first full twelve (12) months following the date of such Advance (the 
     "CAPITALIZED INTEREST PERIOD"), no principal payments shall be due, but 
     interest shall accrue at the Base Rate on the principal amount of such 
     Advance, and shall be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal 
     amount of such Advance, unless the Company elects, by writing delivered 
     to Lender no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of any calendar month, 
     to pay the accrued interest on such Advance for such month, in arrears, 
     on the first Business Day of the following calendar month.  The sum of 
     the amount of Capitalized Interest added to this Note and the amount of 
     capitalized interest added to the 1994 Equipment Note shall not exceed 
     an aggregate of $6,750,000, and after that limit has been reached, the 
     Company shall thereafter pay accrued interest on the outstanding 
     principal amount hereof, in arrears, on the first Business Day of each 
     month during the balance of the Capitalized Interest Period.

     After the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for each 
     Advance, all outstanding principal (including Capitalized Interest) of 
     such Advance shall be paid in seventy-two (72) equal consecutive monthly 
     installments of principal, in each case on the first Business Day of 
     each calendar month (each, a "PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on the first 
     Payment Date after the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for 
     such Advance and on each Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date 
     (as deemed below), on which date all outstanding principal (including 
     Capitalized Interest), interest and other charges with respect to such 
     Advance shall be paid in full.  The "MATURITY DATE" for any Advance 
     shall be the first Business Day of the eighty-fourth (84th) calendar 
     month following the date of such Advance.

     After the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for any Advance, 
     interest shall be paid monthly, in arrears, on each Payment Date, along 
     with the principal payments described above.

     In any event, all outstanding principal of, interest on, and charges 
with respect to this Note shall be due and payable in full on the Final 
Maturity Date.  Lender is authorized to make notations on the Note Schedules 
(or on other schedules hereto) as to the amount of Capitalized Interest or 
the principal and interest payments made by the Company, but the failure to 
make any


                                     -2-


<PAGE>


notations on any Note Schedule (or other schedule) shall not diminish the 
obligation of the Company to pay all amounts due under this Note or any Note 
Schedule hereto.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall fail to pay within 
ten (10) days after when due any principal amount or interest or other amount 
payable by the Company under the Loan Agreement or under this Note, such 
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum that is equal to the lesser of 
three percent (3%) higher than the then applicable Base Rate or the maximum 
permissible interest rate under applicable law, until such overdue principal 
amount, interest or other amount are paid in full (both before and after 
judgment) whether or not any notice of default in the payment thereof has 
been delivered under the Loan Agreement.

     Notwithstanding any provision of this Note or the Loan Agreement to the 
contrary, it is the intent of the Lender and the Company that the Lender or 
any subsequent holder of this Note shall never be entitled to receive, 
collect, reserve or apply, as interest, any amount in excess of the maximum 
rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, as amended or 
enacted from time to time.  In the event Lender, or any subsequent holder of 
this Note, ever receives, collects, reserves or applies, as interest, any 
such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed a 
partial prepayment of principal and treated as such, or, if the principal 
indebtedness and all other amounts due are paid in full, any remaining excess 
funds shall immediately be paid to the Company.  In determining whether or 
not the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the 
highest lawful rate, the Company and the Lender shall, to the maximum extent 
permitted under applicable law, (a) exclude voluntary prepayments and the 
effects thereof as it may relate to any fees charged by the Lender, and (b) 
amortize, promote, allocate, and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of 
interest throughout the entire term of the indebtedness; provided that if the 
indebtedness is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full 
contemplated term hereof, and if the interest received for the actual period 
of existence hereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, the Lender or any 
subsequent holder of this Note shall refund to the Company the amount of such 
excess or credit the amount of such excess against the principal portion of 
the indebtedness, as of the date it was received, and, in such event, the 
Lender shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for 
contracting for, charging, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the 
maximum lawful rate.

     Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default 
specified in the Loan Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this 
Note shall be, or may be declared to be, immediately due and payable as 
provided in the Loan Agreement, without further notice, at the option of the 
holder hereof.  The holder may waive any Default before or after the same has 
been declared and restore this Note to full force and effect without 
impairing any rights hereunder, such right of waiver being a continuing one, 
but any one waiver shall not imply any additional or subsequent waiver.

     Demand, presentment, notice and protest are expressly waived, except for 
notices otherwise required in the Loan Agreement.

     In the event this Note is placed in the hands of one or more attorneys 
for collection or enforcement or protection of the holder's rights described 
in the Loan Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all reasonable attorneys' 
fees (which shall be due on demand) and all court and other costs incurred by 
the holder hereof.

     This Note is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the 
internal laws of the State of Illinois.

     This Note may not be changed, extended or terminated except in writing.

     This Note is an amendment and restatement of that certain Construction 
Note in the maximum principal amount of $37,500,000, dated as of December 22, 
1994, and is not intended as, and shall not be deemed to constitute, a 
novation, release or discharge of such note or any indebtedness evidenced or 
created thereby.

and is the 1994 Equipment Note described in Section 2.2(b) thereof. Any 
capitalized term not otherwise defined in this Note shall have the meaning

below, from the date of such Advance until such amount is due and payable 
(whether at the Maturity Date, upon Required Prepayment, by acceleration, to 
otherwise). The BAse Rate shall be the adjustable interest rate per annum 
(compounded monthly and computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the 
actual days elapsed) equal to (a) the rate announced from time to time as the

<PAGE>

     Each Advance made under this Note (except Advances for Capitalized 
Interest) shall be evidenced by a separate Note Schedule to be attached to 
this Note, each of which shall be consecutively numbered, beginning with 
SCHEDULE 1. Each and all of the Note Schedules shall be deemed a part hereof. 
The principal and interest on each such Advance under this Note shall be Paid 
as follows:

     During the period from the date of each Advance hereunder through the 
     first full twelve (12) months following the date of such Advance (the 
     "CAPITALIZED INTEREST PERIOD"), no principal payments shall be due, but 
     interest shall accrue at the Base Rate on the principal amount of such 
     Advance, and shall be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal 
     amount of such Advance, unless the Company elects, by writing delivered 
     to Lender no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of any calendar month, 
     to pay the accrued interest on such advance for such month, in arrears, 
     on the first Business Day of the following calendar month. The sum of 
     the amount of Capitalized Interest added to this Note and the amount of 
     capitalized interest added to the 1994 Construction Note shall not 
     exceed an aggregate of $6,750,000, and after that limit has been 
     reached, the Company shall thereafter pay accrued interest on the 
     outstanding principal amount hereof, in arrears, on the first Business 
     Day of each month during the balance of the Capitalized Interest Period.

     After the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for each 
     Advance, all outstanding principal including Capitalized Interest) of 
     such Advance shall be paid in seventy-two (72) equal consecutive monthly 
     installments of principal, in each case on the first Business Day of 
     each calendar month (each, a "PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on the first 
     Payment Date after the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for 
     such Advance and on each Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date 
     (as deemed below), on which date all outstanding principal (including 
     Capitalized Interest), interest and other charges with respect to such 
     Advance shall be paid in full. The "MATURITY DATE" for any Advance shall 
     be the first Business Day of the eighty-fourth (84th) calendar month 
     following the date of such Advance.

     After the expiration of the Capitalized Interest Period for any Advance, 
     interest shall be paid monthly, in arrears, on each Payment Date, along 
     with the principal payments described above.

     In any event, all outstanding principal of, interest on, and charges 
with respect to this Note shall be due and payable in full on the Final 
Maturity Date. Lender is authorized to make notations on the Note Schedules 
(or on other schedules hereto) as to the amount of Capitalized Interest or 
the principal and interest payments made by the Company, but the failure to 
make any notations on any Note Schedule (or other schedule) shall not 
diminish the obligation of the Company to pay all amounts due under this Note 
or any Note Schedule hereto.

                                      -2-

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall fail to pay within 
ten (10) days after when due any principal amount or interest or other amount 
payable by the Company under the Loan Agreement or under this Note, such 
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum that is equal to the lesser of 
three percent (3%) higher than the then applicable Base Rate or the maximum 
permissible interest rate under applicable law, until such overdue principal 
amount, interest or other amount are paid in full (both before and after 
judgment) whether or not any notice of default in the payment thereof has 
been delivered under the Loan Agreement.

     Notwithstanding any provision of this Note or the Loan Agreement to the 
contrary, it is the intent of the Lender and the Company that the Lender or 
any subsequent holder of this Note shall never be entitled to received, 
collect, reserve or apply, as interest, any amount in excess of the maximum 
rate of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law, as amended or 
enacted from time to time. In the event Lender, or any subsequent holder of 
this Note, ever receives, collects, reserves or applies, as interest, any 
such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be deemed a 
partial prepayment of principal and treated as such, or, if the principal 
indebtedness and all other amounts due are paid in full, any remaining excess 
funds shall immediately be paid to the Company. In determining whether or not 
the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the 
highest lawful rate, the Company and th Lender shall, to the maximum extent 
permitted under applicable law, (a) exclude voluntary prepayments and the 
effects thereof as it may relate to any fees charged by the Lender, and (b) 
amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread, in equal parts, the total amount of 
interest throughout the entire term of the indebtedness; provided that if the 
indebtedness is paid and performed in full prior to  the end of the full 
contemplated therm hereof, and if the interest received for the actual period 
of existence hereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, the Lender or any 
subsequent holder of this Note shall refund to the Company the amount of such 
excess or credit the amount of such excess against the principal portion of 
the indebtedness, as of the date it was received, and, in such event, the 
Lender shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for 
contracting for, charging, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the 
maximum lawful rate.

     Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default 
specified in the Loan Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this 
Note shall be, or may be declared to be, immediately due and payable as 
provided in the Loan Agreement, without further notice, at the option of the 
holder hereof. The holder may waive any Default before or after the same has 
been declared and restore this Note to full force and effect without 
impairing any rights hereunder, such right of waiver being a continuing one, 
but any one waiver shall not imply any additional or subsequent waiver.

     Demand, presentment, notice and protest are expressly waived, except for 
notices otherwise required in the Loan Agreement.

     In the event this Note is placed in the hands of one or more attorneys 
for collection or enforcement or protection of the holder's rights described 
in the Loan Agreement, the Company agrees to pay all reasonable attorneys' 
fees (which shall be due on demand) and all court and other costs incurred by 
holder thereof.

                          SUMMARY OF 1995 BONUS PROGRAM FOR
                              SENIOR CORPORATE STAFF OF
                          UNITED STATED CELLULAR CORPORATION

    The objectives of the 1995 Bonus Program for Senior Corporate Staff (the 
"1995 Bonus Plan") of United States Cellular Corporation ("USM") are: (i) to 
provide suitable incentives for the senior corporate management of USM to 
extend their best efforts to achieve superior results in relation to key 
performance targets, (ii) to suitably reward USM's senior corporate management 
team in relation to their success in meeting and exceeding these performance 
targets, and (iii) to help USM attract and retain talented management 
personnel in positions of critical importance to the success of USM. A team 
performance award and an individual performance award are available under the 
1995 Bonus Plan.

    For target performance on the team and individual categories, the 1995 
Bonus Plan was designed to generate a targeted 1995 bonus pool equal to the 
total of 25% of the aggregate of the base salaries of the Company's executive 
officers other than the President. Under the 1995 Bonus Plan, the size of the 
target bonus pool is increased or decreased depending on USM's 1995 
achievements with respect to the performance categories. No bonus pool is 
paid under such plan if minimum performance levels are not achieved in 
these categories. The maximum bonus pool that could be generated, which would 
require exceptional performance in all areas, would equal the total of 40% of 
the aggregate base salaries of the Company's executive officers. At target 
performance, the bonus pool would be equal to 25% of the aggregate salaries 
of the Company's executive officers other than the President. Of this 
percentage, 7.5% represents a targeted individual performance award and a 
total of 17.5% represents a targeted team bonus award. The targeted team 
award includes a discretionary team award of 3.5% and an objective award of 
14% for a total targeted team bonus award of 17.5%. The objective performance 
categories include (i) cash flow (6.125% of the targeted award), (ii) service 
revenue (5.25% of the targeted award) and (iii) quality improvement (2.625% 
of the targeted award).

     The discretionary team performance category, representing 3.5% of the 
targeted award of 25%, permits the participants to earn bonus dollars through 
USM's performance and their individual performance in areas not measured or 
not adequately measured by objective team performance categories. The 
President of USM determines a bonus percentage to award for discretionary 
team performance and presents his recommendation to the Chairman for his 
approval. This decision is based primarily on an assessment of the team 
performance in general, considering all facts and circumstances. This award 
may range from 40% of the targeted award for adequate performance on a team 
level to 160% of the targeted award for outstanding performance on a teal 
level.

     The 1995 Bonus Plan also provides a discretionary individual performance 
category, representing 7.5% of the targeted percentage of 25%, to permit the 
participants to earn bonus dollars through USM's performance and their 
individual performance in areas not measured or not adequately measured by 
team performance categories. The President of USM determines a bonus 
percentage to award for discretionary individual performance and presents his 
recommendation to the Chairman for his approval. This decision is based 
primarily on an assessment of the executive's personal performance. This 
award may range from 40% of the targeted award for adequate performance on an 
individual basis to 160% of the targeted award for outstanding performance on 
an individual basis.

              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF 
                     OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" - AMEX symbol: USM) owns, 
operates and invests in cellular markets throughout the United States. USM owns 
or has the right to acquire both majority and minority interests in 201 
cellular markets at December 31, 1995, representing 24,451,000 population 
equivalents ("pops"). USM included the operations of 137 majority-owned and 
managed cellular markets in consolidated operations ("consolidated markets") at 
December 31, 1995. Noncontrolling interests in 29 markets, representing 3.4 
million pops, were accounted for using the equity method and were included in 
investment income at that date. Noncontrolling interests held for sale or trade 
in 40 other markets, representing 887,000 pops, were accounted for using the 
cost method. Following is a table of summarized operating data for USM's 
consolidated operations.

The Company's consolidated revenues and expenses include 100% of the revenues 
and expenses of the systems serving majority-owned and managed markets plus its 
corporate office operations. Investment income includes the Company's share of 
the net income or loss of each of the noncontrolling markets for which the 
Company follows the equity method of accounting.

Operating results for 1995 primarily reflect improvement in the Company's more 
established markets, a full year's operations from the 14 markets added to the 
consolidated group in 1994, the acquisition of majority interests in 23 
operational markets and the divestiture of majority interests in 16 operational 
markets during 1995. Operating revenues, driven primarily by increases in 
customers served, rose $160.0 million, or 48%. Operating expenses rose $134.6 
million, or 43%. Operating cash flow increased $49.4 million, or 60%.

Investment and other income increased $93.7 million to $124.7 million, due 
primarily to gains on the sales of cellular and other investments totaling 
$83.5 million and an increase in investment income. Investment income increased 
$13.3 million in 1995, mostly due to improved results in markets managed by 
others. Interest expense increased $5.4 million, or 25%, in 1995 primarily due 
to a 26% increase in average debt balances. Net income totaled $99.7 million in 
1995 compared to $16.4 million in 1994, reflecting increased gains on the sales 
of cellular and other investments, improved operating results, increased 
investment income and increased interest expense. On a comparable basis, 
excluding the effect of the gains on sales of cellular and other investments 
(net of tax), net income increased to $43.9 million in 1995 compared to $13.1 
million in 1994 and a loss of $30.3 million in 1993.


<PAGE>

The Company expects the number of markets included in consolidated operations 
to be reduced by six during 1996, through the acquisition of majority interests 
in two operational markets and the divestiture of eight markets currently 
majority-owned and managed by the Company. At that time, the Company will 
include 131 markets in its consolidated operations.

Management believes there exists a seasonality in both service revenues, which 
tend to increase more slowly in the first and fourth quarters, and operating 
expenses, which tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased 
marketing activities and customer growth, which may cause operating income to 
vary from quarter to quarter.

OPERATING REVENUES

Operating revenues totaled $492.4 million in 1995, up $160.0 million, or 48%, 
over 1994. Operating revenues totaled $332.4 million in 1994, up $118.1 
million, or 55%, over 1993. Acquisitions increased operating revenues $44.2 
million, or 13%, in 1995 and $25.5 million, or 12%, in 1994.

Service revenues primarily consist of: (i) charges for access, airtime and 
value-added services provided to the Company's local retail customers who use 
the local systems operated by the Company; (ii) charges to customers of other 
systems who use the Company's cellular systems when roaming ("inbound 
roaming"); and (iii) charges for long-distance calls made on the Company's 
systems. Service revenues totaled $476.6 million in 1995, up $158.0 million, or 
50%, over 1994. Service revenues totaled $318.6 million in 1994, up $114.8 
million, or 56%, over 1993. The increase was primarily due to the growing 
number of local retail customers and the growth in inbound roaming revenue 
offset by declining monthly average revenue per customer. Service revenues in 
1995 increased 65%, or $205.7 million, due to customer growth and declined 15%, 
or $47.7 million, due to decreases in average monthly service revenue per 
customer. Acquisitions increased service revenues $42.7 million, or 13%, in 
1995 and $24.4 million, or 12%, in 1994. 

Average monthly service revenue per customer totaled $72 in 1995 compared to 
$80 in 1994 and $85 in 1993. The 9% decrease in average monthly service revenue 
per customer in 1995 was primarily a result of a decrease in per customer 
inbound roaming revenue and lower per customer revenue from local retail 
customers. Inbound roaming revenue has been increasing at a slower rate than 
the Company's own customer base, which is growing faster than that of the rest 
of the industry. Although average monthly local minutes of use per retail 
customer totaled 95 in both 1995 and 1994, the Company's use of incentive 
programs to increase lower-revenue weekend and off-peak usage in 1995 resulted 
in a decrease in average revenue per minute of use during the year. The 6% 
decrease in average monthly service revenue per customer in 1994 was primarily 
a result of a decrease in per customer inbound roaming revenue, for the same 
reasons as in 1995, and the decline in average local minutes of use per retail 
customer.

Revenue from local customers' usage of USM's systems increased $101.5 million, 
or 54%, in 1994 and $70.4 million, or 60%, in 1994. Growth in the number of 
customers in the systems serving the Company's consolidated markets was the 
primary reason for the increase in local revenue. The number of customers 
increased 69% to 710,000 at December 31, 1995 from 421,000 at December 31, 
1994. The number of customers increased 61% in 1994, up from 261,000 at 
December 31, 1993. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and dispositions, the 
Company's consolidated markets added 255,000 customers in 1995 and 142,000 
customers in 


                                      -2-

1994. While the percentage increase in customer additions is expected to be 
lower in the future, management anticipates that the total number of net 
customer additions will continue to increase in 1996. Acquisitions increased 
local revenue $26.3 million, or 14%, in 1995 and $12.4 million, or 11%, in 1994.

Average monthly local retail revenue per customer declined to $44 in 1995 from 
$47 in 1994 and $49 in 1993. Monthly local retail minutes of use per customer 
averaged 95 in both 1995 and 1994 compared to 103 in 1993. While there was no 
decline in average local retail minutes of use from 1994 to 1995, average 
revenue per minute of use decreased as a result of the incentive programs 
stated previously. Management believes that local retail revenue  will continue 
to decrease due to the usage patterns of incrementally added customers. This is 
part of an industry-wide trend and is believed to be related to the tendency of 
the early customers in a market to be the heaviest users during peak business 
hours. It also reflects the Company's and the industry's continued penetration 
of the consumer market, which tends to include fewer peak business hour-usage 
customers.

Inbound roaming revenue increased $44.0 million, or 42%, in 1995 and $33.9 
million, or 48%, in 1994. This increase was attributable to the rise in the 
number of customers from other systems using the Company's systems when 
roaming. Also contributing were the increased number of Company-managed systems 
and cell sites within those systems. Monthly inbound roaming revenue per 
customer averaged $22 in 1995, $26 in 1994 and $29 in 1993. Acquisitions 
increased inbound roaming revenue $13.6 million, or 13%, in 1995 and $10.1 
million, or 14%, in 1994.

Long-distance revenue increased $12.4 million, or 55%, in 1995 and $8.8 
million, or 63%, in 1994 as the volume of long-distance calls billed by the 
Company increased. Monthly long-distance revenue per customer averaged $5 in 
1995 and $6 in 1994 and 1993. Acquisitions  increased long-distance revenue 
$3.5 million, or 16%, in 1995 and $1.7 million, or 12%, in 1994.

Equipment sales revenues totaled $15.8 million in 1995, up $2.0 million, or 
15%, over 1994. Equipment sales revenues totaled $13.8 million in 1994, up $3.3 
million, or 31%, over 1993. Equipment sales reflect the sale of 296,000, 
153,000 and 83,000 cellular telephone units in 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively, plus installation and accessories revenue. The average revenue 
per unit was $53 in 1995 compared to $90 in 1994 and $127 in 1993. The average 
revenue per unit decline partially reflects the Company's decision to reduce 
sales prices on cellular telephones to increase the number of customers, to 
maintain its market position and to meet competitive prices as well as to pass 
through reduced manufacturers' prices to customers. Also, the Company uses 
promotions which are based on increased equipment discounting. The success of 
these promotions led to both an increase in units sold and a decrease in 
average equipment sales revenue per unit. Acquisitions increased equipment 
sales revenues $1.5 million, or 11%, in 1995 and $1.1 million, or 11%, in 1994.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Operating expenses totaled $449.6 million in 1995, up $134.6 million, or 43%, 
over 1994. Operating expenses totaled $315.0 million in 1994, up $92.0 million, 
or 41%, over 1993. Acquisitions increased expenses $40.7 million, or 13%, in 
1995 and $30.9 million, or 14%, in 1994.


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

System operations expenses increased $23.6 million, or 50%, in 1995 and $12.6 
million, or 37%, in 1994, as a result of increases in customer usage expenses 
and costs associated with operating the Company's increased number of cellular 
systems and the growing number of cell sites within those systems. Costs are 
expected to continue to increase as the number of cell sites within the 
Company's systems grows.

Customer usage expenses represent charges from other telecommunications service 
providers for USM's customers' use of their facilities as well as for the 
Company's inbound roaming traffic on these facilities, offset somewhat by 
pass-through roaming revenue. These expenses also include local interconnection 
to the landline network, toll charges and roaming expenses from the Company's 
customers' use of systems other than their local systems. Customer usage 
expenses were $34.9 million in 1995 compared to $21.6 million in 1994 and $18.0 
million in 1993, and represented 7% of service revenues in 1995 and 1994 
compared to 9% in 1993. 

Maintenance, utility and cell site expenses totaled $35.5 million in 1995 
compared to $25.3 million in 1994 and $16.3 million in 1993, primarily 
reflecting an increase in the number of cell sites in the systems serving all 
majority-owned and managed markets, to 1,116 in 1995 from 790 in 1994 and 522 
in 1993. Acquisitions increased system operations expenses $7.6 million, or 
16%, in 1995 and $6.1 million, or 18%, in 1994.

Marketing and selling expenses increased $33.3 million, or 48%, in 1995 and 
$25.6 million, or 59%, in 1994. Marketing and selling expenses primarily 
consist of salaries, commissions and expenses of field sales and retail 
personnel and offices; agent commissions; promotional expenses; local 
advertising and public relations expenses. The 1995 increase was primarily due 
to a 69% rise in the number of gross customer activations (excluding 
acquisitions and divestitures), from 232,000 in 1994 to 392,000 in 1995. The 
1994 increase was primarily due to a 64% rise in the number of gross customer 
activations (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), from 141,700 in 1993 to 
232,000 in 1994. Cost per gross customer addition, including losses on 
equipment sales, decreased to $361 in 1995 from $408 in 1994 and $414 in 1993. 
Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Company added 255,000 net new 
customers in 1995 compared to 142,000 in 1994 and 86,600 in 1993, increases of 
80% and 64% in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The churn rate was 2.1% in 1995 and 
2.3% in 1994 and 1993. Acquisitions increased marketing and selling expenses 
$9.0 million, or 13%, in 1995 and $6.3 million, or 15%, in 1994.

Cost of equipment sold increased $15.5 million, or 39%, in 1995 and $13.7 
million, or 54%, in 1994. The increases reflect the growth in unit sales 
related to the rise in gross customer activations made through the Company's 
direct and retail distribution channels, offset somewhat by falling 
manufacturer prices per unit. The average cost to the Company of a telephone 
unit sold, including accessories and installation, was $186 in 1995 compared to 
$258 in 1994 and $309 in 1993. Acquisitions increased cost of goods sold $6.3 
million, or 16%, in 1995 and $3.4 million, or 13%, in 1994.

General and administrative expenses increased $38.2 million, or 41%, in 1995 
and $19.7 million, or 26%, in 1994. These expenses include the costs of 
operating the Company's local business offices and its corporate expenses. 
These increases include the effects of an increase in the number of 
consolidated markets, increases in expenses required to serve the growing 
customer base in existing markets and an expansion of both local administrative 
office and corporate staff, necessitated by growth in the Company's business. 
The Company is using 


                                      -4-

<PAGE>

an ongoing clustering strategy to combine local operations wherever feasible in 
order to gain operational efficiencies and reduce its administrative expenses. 
Acquisitions increased direct field-related general and administrative expenses 
$11.1 million, or 12%, in 1995 and $8.4 million, or 11%, in 1994. 

Operating cash flow (operating income or loss before minority share plus 
depreciation and amortization expense) increased $49.4 million, or 60%, to 
$132.2 million in 1995 and increased $46.5 million, or 128%, to $82.8 million 
in 1994. The improvement in 1995 and 1994 was primarily due to growth in 
service revenues and a slower rate of increase in operating expenses resulting 
from improved operational efficiencies.

Depreciation expense increased $17.8 million, or 45%, in 1995 and $13.9 
million, or 54%, in 1994. These increases reflect rising average fixed asset 
balances, which increased 48% in 1995 and 54% in 1994. Increased fixed asset 
balances primarily result from the increase in cell sites built to improve 
coverage in the Company's markets. Acquisitions increased depreciation expense 
$4.6 million, or 12%, in 1995 and $2.9 million, or 11%, in 1994.

Amortization of intangibles increased $6.2 million, or 24%, in 1995 and $6.6 
million, or 34%, in 1994. These increases are primarily due to increases in 
license costs as a result of the acquisition of or the commencement of service 
in 23 markets in 1995 and 14 markets in 1994. License costs related to 
consolidated markets increased $69.0 million, or 7%, in 1995 and $163.9 
million, or 20%, in 1994. Acquisitions increased amortization of intangibles 
$2.2 million, or 9%, in 1995 and $3.8 million, or 20%, in 1994.

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE MINORITY SHARE

Operating income before minority share totaled $42.8 million in 1995 and $17.4 
million in 1994 compared to a loss of $8.7 million in 1993. The operating 
income margin (as a percent of service revenues) improved to 9% in 1995 and 5% 
in 1994 from an operating (loss) margin of (4%) in 1993. The 1995 and 1994 
operating income improvements reflect improved results in the more established 
markets and increased revenues resulting from growth in the number of customers 
served by the Company's systems. This was partially offset by costs associated 
with the growth of the Company's operations and increased losses on equipment 
sales. Acquisitions increased operating income before minority share $3.5 
million in 1995 and decreased operating income before minority share $5.4 
million in 1994.

The Company expects service revenues to continue to grow significantly during 
1996 as it adds customers to its existing systems and realizes a full year of 
revenues from customers added in 1995. Additionally, the Company expects 
expenses to increase significantly during 1996 as it incurs costs for markets 
and cell sites added in 1994 and 1995, incurs costs associated with customer 
and system growth and continues to acquire markets. Management believes there 
exists a seasonality in both service revenues, which tend to increase more 
slowly in the first and fourth quarters, and operating expenses, which tend to 
be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing activities and 
customer growth, which may cause operating income to vary from quarter to 
quarter.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME

Investment and other income totaled $124.7 million in 1995, $31.0 million in 
1994 and $22.6 million in 1993. Investment income was $39.8 million in 1995 
compared to $26.5 million in 1994 and $16.9 million in 1993. Investment income 
primarily represents the Company's share 


                                      -5-

<PAGE>


of net income from the markets managed by others that are accounted for by the 
equity method. 

Gain on sale of cellular interests totaled $83.5 million in 1995, $3.3 million 
in 1994 and $4.9 million in 1993. The 1995 amount primarily reflects gains 
totaling $64.6 million recorded on the sales of the Company's majority 
interests in six markets; gains totaling $11.1 million recorded on the sales of 
the Company's investment interests in six markets; a gain totaling $5.3 million 
resulting from cash proceeds received in an exchange of markets; and a gain 
totaling $2.5 million recorded on the sale of certain marketable equity 
securities. The 1994 amount reflects gains recorded on the exchange of five of 
the Company's investment interests with another cellular company for minority 
interests in seven markets in which the Company owns controlling interests. The 
1993 amount reflects gains recorded on the sales of two investment interests.

INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES

Total interest expense increased $5.4 million, or 25%, in 1995, on a 26% 
increase in the average amount of debt outstanding. Total interest expense 
decreased $11.3 million, or 34%, in 1994, on a 37% decrease in the average 
amount of debt outstanding. Interest expense in 1995 is primarily related to 
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS, Liquid Yield OptionTM 
Notes ("LYONsTM") (TM Trademark of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.) and borrowings 
under a vendor financing agreement.

Interest expense relating to the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS was $10.4 
million in 1995, $17.8 million in 1994 and $29.1 million in 1993. The average 
amount of debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement was $100.0 
million in 1995, $204.7 million in 1994 and $372.8 million in 1993; however, no 
borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 
31, 1995. The average interest rate on such debt was 10.4% in 1995, 8.6% in 
1994 and 7.5% in 1993. Interest expense relating to the LYONs, which accrue 
interest at 6%,  was $7.4 million in 1995. The LYONs are zero coupon 
convertible debentures which do not require current cash payments of interest; 
therefore, this is a noncash expense. Interest expense related to the vendor 
financing agreements was $9.2 million in 1995, $3.9 million in 1994 and $4.0 
million in 1993. The average amount of debt under the vendor financing 
agreements was $112.1 million in 1995, $58.1 million in 1994 and $66.4 million 
in 1993. The average interest rate on such debt was 8.3% in 1995, 7.1% in 1994 
and 5.7% in 1993.

Income tax expense was $32.5 million in 1995, $4.9 million in 1994 and $2.7 
million in 1993. In 1995, $27.7 million of income tax expense related to the 
gains on sales of cellular and other investments. Income tax expense for 1994 
and 1993 primarily includes the federal income taxes of consolidated 
subsidiaries not included in the TDS consolidated federal income tax return. 
State income tax expense was primarily related to subsidiaries generating 
taxable income after utilization of state net operating losses.

USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members 
of the TDS consolidated group. TDS and USM are parties to a Tax Allocation 
Agreement under which USM is able to carry forward its losses and credits and 
use them to offset any current or future income tax liabilities to TDS. The 
amount of the federal net operating loss carryforward available to offset 
future taxable income aggregated approximately $74 million at December 31, 
1995, and expires between 2002 and 2010. The amount of the state net operating 
loss carryforward available to offset future taxable income aggregated 
approximately $212 million 


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

at December 31, 1995, and expires between 1996 and 2010. Both the federal and 
state loss carryforwards have been significantly reduced by the gains on the 
sales of cellular and other investments during 1995, and more reductions are 
anticipated from gains which may be recognized on sales of cellular interests 
for which the Company has agreements as of December 31, 1995.

NET INCOME (LOSS)

Net income totaled $99.7 million in 1995 and $16.4 million in 1994 compared to 
a net loss of $25.4 million in 1993. The improvement in 1995 resulted from 
gains on the sales of cellular and other investments, improved operating 
results in the established markets and increased investment income, partially 
offset by increased income tax expense. The improvement in 1994 resulted from 
improved operating results in the established markets, increased investment 
income and decreased interest expense, partially offset by the effects of the 
addition of new markets. On a comparable basis (net of tax), excluding gains on 
the sales of cellular and other investments, net income totaled $43.9 million 
in 1995 and $13.1 million in 1994 and net loss totaled $30.3 million in 1993. 
Net income per share was $1.19 in 1995 and $.21 in 1994 and net loss per share 
was $.45 in 1993. The improvements in 1995 and 1994 primarily reflects the 
improvement in net income offset by the increase in weighted average Common and 
Series A Common Shares outstanding. The weighted average number of Common and 
Series A Common Shares outstanding for 1995 increased 6%, primarily due to the 
issuance of Common Shares in connection with acquisitions. The weighted average 
number of Common and Series A Common Shares outstanding for 1994 increased 39% 
over the shares outstanding for 1993 primarily as a result of Common and Series 
A Common Shares issued in connection with the 1993 rights offering, Common 
Shares issued in connection with acquisitions, and the inclusion of dilutive 
common stock equivalents in 1994 weighted average common shares outstanding as 
a result of the 1994 net income.

INFLATION

Management believes that inflation affects the Company's business to no greater 
extent than the general economy.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived 
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," in March 1995, which 
became effective in January 1996, requiring that long-lived assets and certain 
identifiable intangibles to be held and used by any entity be reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management believes the 
carrying amount of the Company's long-lived assets is not impaired. 

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company operates a capital- and marketing-intensive business. Rapid growth 
in markets operated by the Company, capital expenditures and customers served 
has caused financing requirements for acquisitions, construction and operations 
to exceed internally generated cash flow. In recent years, the Company has 
generated operating cash flows and received cash proceeds frin divestitures to 
fund most of its construction and operating expenses. The Company has been 
profitable for the last two years, but had previously incurred significant 
start-up costs and operating losses.  The Company anticipates increasing growth 
in cellular units in service and revenues as it continues its expansion and 
development programs. 


                                      -7-

<PAGE>

Marketing and system operations expenses associated with this expansion may 
reduce the rate of growth in operating cash flow and operating income over the 
next several quarters.

Cash flows from operating activities provided $115.9 million in 1995, $84.3 
million in 1994 and $35.3 million in 1993. Operating cash flow (operating 
income or loss before minority share plus depreciation and amortization 
expense) provided cash totaling $132.2 million in 1995, $82.8 million in 1994 
and $36.4 million in 1993. The 1995 and 1994 increases in operating cash flow 
primarily reflect improvement in the more established markets. Acquisitions 
increased operating cash flow $10.3 million, or 12%, in 1995 and $1.3 million, 
or 4%, in 1994. Cash flows from other operating activities (investment and 
other income, interest expense, changes in working capital and changes in other 
assets and liabilities) required cash investments totaling $16.3 million in 
1995 and $1.1 million in 1993 and provided cash totaling $1.5 million in 1994.

Cash flows from financing activities provided $19.3 million in 1995, $95.6 
million in 1994 and $65.4 million in 1993. Cash flows from financing activities 
include cash flows from the sale of LYONs, borrowings under the Revolving 
Credit Agreement with TDS, vendor financing transactions and sales of Common 
Shares. In 1995, the sale of LYONs provided cash totaling $221.5 million and 
vendor financing transactions provided cash totaling $59.5 million. This cash 
was used to repay amounts owed under the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS 
totaling $251.2 million and amounts owed under the vendor financing agreements 
totaling $13.4 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement with 
TDS totaling $75.4 million and $45.4 million provided a majority of the 
Company's external financing requirements in 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
Borrowings under one of the vendor financing agreements provided an additional 
$18.0 million in 1994. The sale of Common Shares to parties other than TDS in 
connection with the rights offering provided an additional $36.8 million of the 
Company's external financing requirements in 1993.

Cash flows from investing activities required cash investments totaling $102.6 
million in 1995, $180.4 million in 1994 and $98.6 million in 1993. Such cash 
requirements primarily consisted of cash additions to property, plant, and 
equipment and cash requirements for acquisitions and for investments in 
cellular markets. In 1995, the Company received cash proceeds totaling $151.1 
million relating to the sales of cellular and other investments. Cash 
expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $208.7 million in 1995, 
representing the construction of 292 cell sites and other plant additions. 
Expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $158.2 million in 1994, 
representing the construction of 225 cell sites and other plant additions. 
Expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $84.9 million in 1993, 
representing the construction of 138 cell sites and other plant additions.

Anticipated capital requirements for 1996 primarily reflect the Company's 
construction and system expansion program. The Company's construction and 
system expansion budget for 1996 is approximately $240 million, consisting 
primarily of new cell sites to expand and enhance the Company's coverage in its 
service areas and expansion of office systems.

The Company continues to expand its operations through acquisitions. Some of 
the markets acquired during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were subject to acquisition 
agreements which were entered into prior to the year in which the acquisitions 
were completed. The following table summarizes the acquisitions completed 
during the last three years and the consideration issued for these acquisitions.

Additionally, the Company had commitments at December 31, 1995, to issue 
928,000 Common Shares in 1996 related to certain completed acquisitions.

The Company is continuing to assess its portfolio of cellular holdings in order 
to maximize the benefits derived from clustering its markets. As the number of 
opportunities for outright acquisitions has decreased over the last one or two 
years, and as the Company's clusters have grown to realize greater economies of 
scale, the Company's focus has shifted toward exchanges and divestitures of 
managed and investment interests. Recently, the Company has completed exchanges 
of controlling interests in its less strategic markets for controlling 
interests in markets which better complement its clusters. The Company has also 
completed outright sales of other less strategic markets. The proceeds from 
these sales have been used to further the Company's growth.

At December 31, 1995, the Company had agreements pending to exchange a 
controlling interest in one market, representing 96,000 population equivalents, 
for a controlling interest in another market, representing 153,000 population 
equivalents, plus cash consideration.  The Company also had an agreement 
pending to acquire a controlling interest in one market and several minority 
interests in another market, representing 302,000 population equivalents.  In 
addition, the Company had agreements pending to divest controlling interests in 
seven other markets, one minority interest and one market partition, 
representing 870,000 population equivalents, and to settle litigation related 
to an investment interest which was divested in 1995. If the exchange, 
divestitures and litigation settlement are completed as planned, the Company 
will receive consideration totaling approximately $170 million. All of the 
pending exchange, acquisition, divestiture and litigation settlement agreements 
discussed above are expected to be completed during 1996. Certain of the 
divestitures and the litigation settlement are expected to generate substantial 
gains for book and tax purposes.

TDS has proposed the transfer of its minority ownership interests in certain 
cellular markets acquired in conjunction with its prior acquisitions of 
telephone companies to the Company. The minority interests subject to the 
proposal represent approximately 675,000 population equivalents.  The proposed 
purchase price is approximately $116.7 million. The form of consideration to be 
paid by USM is subject to negotiation and would likely consist of cash or USM 
common stock or a combination thereof.

The TDS proposal is subject to negotiation and has been referred to a 
previously established independent committee of the Company's Board of 
Directors. The independent committee has retained Lazard Freres & Co. as its 
financial advisor.  The proposed transaction will be subject to approval by the 
independent committee of the USM Board of Directors, to the completion of 
definitive documentation and to compliance with regulatory requirements.

LIQUIDITY

The Company anticipates that the aggregate resources required for 1996 will 
include approximately: (i) $240 million for capital spending and (ii) $21 
million of scheduled debt repayments. Additionally, the Company anticipates it 
will reimburse TDS, for a pending acquisition which is scheduled to be 
completed during 1996, for TDS Common Shares to be issued to third parties. The 
reimbursement to TDS is expected to be in the form of USM Common Shares. Not 
included in the above amounts are those related to any acquisition agreements 
that the Company may enter into in 1996. These potential acquisitions may 
require substantial funding for both their acquisition and operation during 
1996.

The Company had $38 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1995, 
anticipates generating an increasing amount of positive cash flows from 
operating activities and is scheduled to receive approximately $150 million in 
cash proceeds from pending divestitures, an exchange and a litigation 
settlement during 1996. The Company also has $100 million available under the 
Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS and $4 million available under its primary 
vendor financing agreement.

The Company sold $745 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon 
convertible debt in June 1995. This 20-year, 6% yield to maturity fixed rate 
debt, in the form of LYONs, is subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the 
Company. Each LYON is convertible at the option of the holder at any time on or 
prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 9.475 Common Shares per LYON. Upon 
conversion, USM may elect the delivery of its Common Shares or cash equal to 
the market value of the Common Shares into which the LYONs are convertible. 
Beginning five years after the date of issue, the LYONs may be redeemed at any 
time for cash at the option of the Company at redemption prices equal to the 
issue price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of 
redemption. On the fifth anniversary of the issue date, USM will purchase 
LYONs, at the option of the holder, at the issue price plus accrued original 
issue discount through that date. At that time, USM will have the option of 
purchasing such LYONs with cash, USM Common Shares or TDS common equity 
securities, or any combination thereof.

Most of the net proceeds to the Company of approximately $221.5 million from 
the sale of the LYONs were used to completely repay debt to TDS under the 
Revolving Credit Agreement, and the excess proceeds were used for general 
corporate purposes. In connection with the sale of the LYONs, on June 29, 1995, 
the Company and TDS amended the Revolving Credit Agreement to reduce the 
available line of credit thereunder to $100 million and to reduce the 


                                      -10-

<PAGE>

interest rate for borrowings to prime plus 0.75%. No borrowings were 
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 1995.

The Company has two arrangements for the financing of cellular system equipment 
and construction costs with an equipment vendor. Terms of borrowings under the 
first agreement are for seven years at interest rates of 2.25% or 2.31% over 
the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of high-grade, unsecured notes (for rates of 
7.8% or 7.9%, respectively, at December 31, 1995). The Company also has an 
agreement with the same equipment vendor which was assumed pursuant to a 1993 
acquisition which is arranged through the individual entity acquired.  The 
interest rate for these borrowings is 2.25% over the 90-day Commercial Paper 
Rate of high-grade, unsecured notes (for a rate of 7.8% at December 31, 1995). 
In the aggregate, borrowings totaling $120.0 million were outstanding under 
these vendor financing agreements at December 31, 1995, and approximately $4 
million remained available under these agreements at that date.

Management believes that the Company's operating cash flows and cash proceeds 
from scheduled market divestitures provide substantial financial flexibility. 
The Company also has a line of credit and longer term financing commitments to 
help meet its short-and long-term financing needs. Additionally, the Company 
has access to public and private capital markets and anticipate issuing debt 
and equity securities when capital requirements (including acquisitions), 
financial market conditions and other factors warrant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
     ACCOUNTING POLICIES

United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" or "USM"), is an 80.8%-owned
subsidiary of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. ("TDS").

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

USM owns, manages and invests in cellular systems throughout the United States
and is the nation's seventh largest cellular telephone company in terms of popu-
lation equivalents. The Company owns or has the right to acquire interests in
201 cellular markets, representing approximately 24.5 million population
equivalents as of December 31, 1995. USM's 137 majority-owned and managed
markets, primarily mid-sized and rural markets, covered 29 states and served
710,000 customers as of December 31, 1995.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of USM, its majority-
owned subsidiaries and partnerships in which USM has a controlling majority
partnership interest. There were 137 consolidated operating entities in 1995,
130 in 1994 and 116 in 1993. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. Certain amounts reported in prior years have been
reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUES

Revenues from operations primarily consist of charges to customers for monthly
access, cellular airtime and data usage, roaming charges, long-distance charges
and vertical services. Revenues are recognized as services are rendered.
Unbilled revenues, resulting from cellular service provided from the billing
cycle date to the end of each month and from other cellular carriers' customers
using USM's cellular systems for the last half of each month, are estimated and
recorded. Equipment sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer and
reflect charges to customers for cellular telephone user equipment purchased.

PENSION PLAN

United States Cellular Corporation's Employees' Pension Trust I (the "Pension
Trust"), a qualified noncontributory defined contribution pension plan, was
adopted effective January 1, 1994. It provides pension benefits for the
employees of USM. Under this plan, pension benefits and costs are calculated
separately for each participant and are funded currently. Pension costs were
$1.2 million in 1995 and $1.0 million in 1994.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per Common and Series A Common Share for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994 was computed by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number
of Common Shares, Series A Common Shares and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock equivalents consist of Common
Shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock, Common Shares issuable in
the future to TDS and third parties in connection with completed acquisitions
and Common Share options and stock appreciation rights.

Earnings per Common and Series A Common Share for the year ended December 31,
1993 was computed by dividing Net (Loss) by the weighted average number of
Common Shares and Series A Common Shares outstanding during the year.

Pro forma Net (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 1993 would have been
reduced by $25.1 million for the interest expense eliminated by the pro forma
retirement, as of January 1, 1993, of the amount outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Agreement-TDS through the conversion of 4.8 million Common Shares and 5.5
million Series A Common Shares purchased by TDS in connection with the November
1993 rights offering ("Rights Offering") ($340.7 million) and the application of
the proceeds from the sale of 1.1 million Common Shares to parties other than
TDS in connection with the Rights Offering ($36.8 million). Under the above
circumstances, pro forma (Loss) per Common Share would have been reduced by $.45
to zero for the year ended December 31, 1993.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the plant assets.
The provision for depreciation as a percentage of average depreciable property,
plant and equipment was 10.0% in 1995 and 10.5% in 1994 and 1993.

</TABLE>

See Note 13 Lease Commitments for a discussion of property leased by USM.

NOTES AND INTEREST RECEIVABLE

Notes and interest receivable reflect primarily loans to other partners for
capital calls paid on their behalf. USM also has an outstanding loan to the
operators of another cellular company in which USM has no equity. See Note 14
Commitments and Contingencies - Collectibility of Note Receivable for a
discussion of this note receivable. The carrying amount reported in the balance
sheet for notes and interest receivable approximates their fair value.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and those short-term, highly-liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying
amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable consists of amounts owed by customers for both service
provided and equipment sales, by other cellular carriers whose customers have
used USM's cellular systems, by affiliated entities and by other partners for
capital contributions and distributions.

INVENTORY

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a
specific identification basis.

DEFERRED CHARGES

Deferred start-up costs represent expenses incurred prior to the commencement of
service in each individual market. These costs are capitalized and, upon
commencement of operations, amortized over five years. Deferred start-up costs
include expenses related to constructing the systems and expenses incurred in
preparing to market cellular service.

Other deferred charges primarily represent costs incurred for the development of
new systems, legal and other charges incurred relating to the preparation of
vendor financing agreements and the 6% zero coupon convertible debentures.
Capitalized costs of systems development are amortized over a five-year period
starting when the new system is placed in service. When vendor financing is
finalized, deferred charges recorded are amortized over the financing period.
The deferred charges for the convertible debentures are being amortized over the
twenty-year financing period.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH
FLOW DISCLOSURES

USM acquired certain cellular licenses and other cellular interests during 1995,
1994 and 1993. In conjunction with these acquisitions, the following assets were
acquired, liabilities assumed, Common Shares issued and equity contributions
made by TDS.

USM recorded a gain on the exchange of its minority interest in one market in
1995, and on the exchange of its minority interests in five markets in 1994,
which are not included in the table above. See Note 12 Gain on Sale of Cellular
and Other Investments for a discussion of the effects of these transactions.

During 1993, USM converted $340.7 million of debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement into equity through the issuance of approximately 4.8 million Common
Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares to TDS in connection with the
Rights Offering.

During 1993, USM recorded $40.3 million of additional borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement as reimbursement to TDS for TDS Common Shares issued
and issuable in lieu of 1.7 million USM Common Shares that were to be issued in
1994 through 1996 in connection with completed acquisitions.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, in March 1995, which
became effective in January 1996. SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets
and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by any entity be
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. SFAS No. 121 also
requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be
disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell. The carrying amount of the Company's long-lived assets at December 31,
1995 primarily represents the original amounts invested less recorded
depreciation and amortization. Management believes the carrying amount of these
investments is not impaired.

2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

USM has acquired cellular interests for cash, promissory notes, USM and TDS
Common Shares, and shares of TDS Preferred Stock. USM has also divested cellular
interests for cash and notes receivable.

TDS made capital contributions totalling $9.4 million in 1993 pursuant to TDS's
agreement to fund certain cellular license investments made by USM.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS. During 1995, USM completed the acquisition of
controlling interests in eleven markets and several minority interests
representing approximately 1.7 million population equivalents for a total
consideration of $151.0 million as shown in the following table.

During 1995, the Company completed the divestiture of controlling interests in
six markets and investment interests in six markets. See Note 12 Gain on Sale of
Cellular and Other Investments for a discussion of these divestitures.

PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES. At December 31, 1995, USM had entered
into agreements with third parties to acquire a controlling interest in one
market and several minority interests in another market. USM also had entered
into an agreement with another cellular operator to exchange USM's controlling
interest in one market for a controlling interest in another market USM
currently manages, plus cash. Additionally, at December 31, 1995, USM had
agreements pending with third parties to sell its controlling interests in seven
markets plus one market partition and to settle litigation related to an
investment interest which was sold in 1995. Pursuant to the agreements, USM will
receive $170 million in cash and notes receivable. All of the pending agreements
are expected to be completed during 1996. Certain of the sales and the
litigation settlement will generate substantial gains for book and tax purposes.

3. INVESTMENT IN LICENSES

Investment in licenses consists of the costs incurred in acquiring Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") licenses or interests in entities which have
filed for or have been awarded FCC licenses to provide cellular service. These
costs include amounts paid to license applicants and owners of interests in
cellular entities awarded licenses; amounts paid for legal, engineering and
consulting services; amounts incurred by USM and TDS in acquiring these
interests; and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over 40 years, upon
commencement of operations, or at the date of acquisition when USM acquires an
interest in an operating system. Costs applicable to unsuccessful license
applications and acquisitions are charged to expense. Included in cellular
license costs is approximately $363 million of goodwill which resulted from
various acquisitions structured to be tax-free.

Investment in licenses consists of the following:

4. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

The Company implemented SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," effective January 1, 1994.

During 1995 the Company sold all of its available-for-sale securities resulting
in a net realized gain of $2.5 million. Proceeds from the sale totaled $20.7
million.

At December 31, 1994 the Company held available-for-sale securities with a cost
basis of $18.2 million and an aggregate fair value of $20.1 million. The
Company's net unrealized holding gain on available-for-sale securities was $1.3
million (net of income taxes of $677,000) in 1994 and has been included as an
increase to Common Shareholders' Equity. No sales or transfers of these
securities occurred during 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


5. REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

USM has the option to take out unsecured notes payable to TDS and
Telecommunications Technologies Fund, Inc. ("TTF"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
TDS, pursuant to a Revolving Credit Agreement. USM repaid approximately $206.5
million of debt under the Revolving Credit Agreement with the proceeds of its
1995 offering of 6% Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures. See Note 7 6% Zero
Coupon Convertible Debentures for a discussion of these debentures.

The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement provide for borrowings with
interest, at the prime rate plus .75% (for a rate of 9.25% at December 31,
1995), due quarterly. The Revolving Credit Agreement has been amended by TDS
from time to time to change the size of the borrowing facility. Most recently,
the facility was amended effective June 29, 1995, to provide for borrowings up
to a maximum of $100 million. Any borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement
may be prepaid in whole or in part, without premium, with any prepayment
reinstating credit in the amount of such prepayment. No principal under the
Revolving Credit Agreement is due until January 2, 1998, on which date the
Revolving Credit Agreement terminates and all unpaid principal and accrued
interest thereon are due and payable. The terms of the Revolving Credit
Agreement also include, among others, restrictions on incurring additional
indebtedness and on paying dividends. As of December 31, 1995, no borrowings
were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The carrying value of
USM's borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 1994
approximated their fair value, as the Revolving Credit Agreement is variable
debt with the interest rate based on the prime rate.

6. LONG-TERM DEBT

USM has two arrangements for the financing of cellular system equipment and
construction costs with an equipment vendor.

During 1994, USM consolidated the terms of its borrowings under previously
negotiated long-term financing agreements into one agreement. As provided for in
this new agreement, USM consolidated borrowings under certain other previously
negotiated agreements, those which were arranged through the individual entities
which USM manages, during 1995. All borrowings are collateralized by a secured
interest in the tangible assets (excluding customer accounts receivable) and
certain intangible assets of certain of USM's operating subsidiaries, excluding
any interest in such operating subsidiaries' Federal Communications Commission
licenses. Terms of the borrowings are for seven years at interest rates of
either 2.25% or 2.307% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of high-grade,
unsecured notes (for rates of 7.8% and 7.9%, respectively, at December 31,
1995). Borrowings totaling $116.4 million were outstanding under this agreement
at December 31, 1995, and $3.9 million was available at that date for future
borrowings.

USM has another agreement which was assumed pursuant to a 1993 acquisition and
which is arranged through the individual entity acquired. The loans under this
agreement are secured by all of the assets of the individual entity and bear
interest at a rate of 2.25% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of high-grade,
unsecured notes (for a rate of 7.8% at December 31, 1995). USM had completed
$3.6 million of borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of December 31,
1995 and there was no remaining availability at that date for future borrowings.

The carrying value of USM's current and long-term debt, $120.0 million, is
approximately equal to its estimated fair value at December 31, 1995. The
carrying value at December 31, 1994, $69.3 million, was more than its fair
value, estimated to be $64.3 million. The fair value was estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis.

As of January 1, 1996, the interest rate for outstanding and future borrowings
under both agreements was changed to 1.40% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate
of high-grade, unsecured notes.

Long-term debt is as follows:

respectively.
<PAGE>


7. 6% ZERO COUPON
   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES

During 1995, the Company sold $745 million principal amount at maturity of zero
coupon 6% yield to maturity convertible debt with proceeds to the Company of
$221.5 million. This 20-year fixed rate debt, in the form of Liquid Yield
Option-TM- Notes ("LYONs"-TM-) (-TM-Trademark of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.), is
subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the Company. Each LYON is convertible
at the option of the holder at any time at a conversion rate of 9.475 Common
Shares per LYON. Upon conversion, USM may elect to deliver its Common Shares or
cash equal to the market value of the Common Shares. Beginning June 15, 2000,
the LYONs may be redeemed at any time for cash at the option of USM at the
issued price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of
redemption. USM will purchase LYONs, at the option of the holder, as of June 15,
2000, at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount through that date.
USM will have the option of purchasing such LYONs with cash, USM Common Shares
or TDS common equity securities, or any combination thereof. No LYONs have been
converted as of December 31, 1995.

The carrying value of USM's 6% Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures, $235.7
million, is less than its fair value, estimated to be $265.5 million. The fair
value was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis.

8. COMMON STOCK

COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE

Certain of the cellular acquisition agreements closed during 1995, 1992 and 1991
require USM to deliver Common Shares in the future. USM is required to issue
928,009 Common Shares to TDS and third parties in 1996.

TAX-DEFERRED SAVINGS PLAN. USM has reserved 199,713 Common Shares for issuance
under the TDS Tax-Deferred Savings Plan, a qualified profit-sharing plan
pursuant to Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Participating employees have the option of investing their contributions in TDS
Common Shares, USM Common Shares, American Paging, Inc. (a wholly owned
subsidiary of TDS) Common Shares or five other non-affiliated funds.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. USM sold 25,000 Common Shares to its employees at
$26.94 per share in connection with the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

STOCK OPTION AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN. USM has reserved 983,572 Common
Shares and 55,000 Series A Common Shares for options granted to key employees.
USM has established two Stock Option plans as of February 1, 1991 and November
9, 1994, and a Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (as amended on February 1, 1991)
that provides for the grant of stock options and stock appreciation rights to
officers and employees. The options under the 1991 plan are exercisable from the
date of vesting through November 1, 1997, or thirty days following the date of
the employee's termination of employment, if earlier. At December 31, 1995,
54,196 stock options were outstanding at a price of $15.67 per share. The
options under the 1994 plan are exercisable from the date of vesting through
November 9, 2004, or thirty days following the date of the employee's
termination of employment, if earlier. At December 31, 1995, 128,131 stock
options were outstanding at a weighted average price of $30.96 per share.

Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") allow the grantee to receive an amount in
Common Shares or cash, or a combination thereof, equivalent to the difference
between the exercise price and the fair market value of the Common Shares on the
exercise date. At December 31, 1995, 42,300 Common Share SARs and 36,000 Series
A Common Share SARs were outstanding at $15.00 per share. These rights expire
from 1998 to 2003 or the date of the person's termination of employment, if
earlier. During 1994 and 1993, 1,200 and 1,800 Common Share SARs were exercised,
respectively. No SARs were exercised in 1995. Compensation expense, measured by
the difference between the SAR prices and the year-end market price of the
Common Shares, aggregated $168,000 in 1995, $71,000 in 1994 and $598,000 in
1993.

RIGHTS OFFERING

In the fourth quarter of 1993, USM completed a rights offering to holders of its
common stock. Pursuant to the rights offering, common shareholders received one
right for every five shares owned on October 22, 1993. Each right enabled the
holder to purchase one additional share of common stock at the exercise price of
$33.00 per share, which was a 10% discount from the closing market price 
<PAGE>

of USM's Common Shares on October 22, 1993. USM issued approximately 5.9 
million Common Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares in connection 
with the rights offering. Approximately 4.8 million Common Shares and all of 
the Series A Common Shares were purchased by TDS.

SERIES A COMMON SHARES

Series A Common Shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Common
Shares. As of December 31, 1995, all of USM's outstanding Series A Common Shares
were held by TDS.

9. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

Redeemable Preferred Stock, authorized 5,000,000 shares, has a stated
liquidation value of $100 per share, is not entitled to any dividends and is
redeemable in 1996. The Redeemable Preferred Stock is issuable in series by the
Board of Directors, who establish the terms of the issue. At December 31, 1995,
all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock were held by TDS as reimbursement for
TDS Preferred Shares issued in connection with acquisitions. The fair value of
Redeemable Preferred Stock is estimated to be approximately $17.6 million using
the net present value of the Common Shares to be issued upon conversion, valued
at the December 31, 1995 quoted market price. The estimated fair value at
December 31, 1994 of USM's Redeemable Preferred Stock was $30.9 million, using
the net present value of the Common Shares to be issued upon conversion, valued
at December 31, 1994 quoted market price. At December 31, 1995 all of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock is redeemable by USM by the delivery of Common Shares
as shown in the following table.

Shares were redeemed for 471,224 and 55,213 USM Common Shares, respectively.

10. INCOME TAXES

USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members
of the TDS consolidated group.

TDS and USM entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement (the "Agreement") effective
July 1, 1987. The Agreement provides that USM and its subsidiaries be included
in a consolidated federal income tax return and in state income or franchise tax
returns in certain situations with the TDS affiliated group. USM and its
subsidiaries calculate their losses and credits as if they comprised a separate
affiliated group. Under the Agreement, USM is able to carry forward its losses
and credits and use them to offset any future income tax liabilities to TDS.

Federal income tax expense in 1995 primarily relates to the gain on the sale of
cellular and other investments. Federal income tax expense recorded in 1994 and
1993 primarily relates to consolidated subsidiaries not included in the TDS
consolidated federal income tax return. State income tax expense recorded in
1995, 1994 and 1993 was primarily related to subsidiaries generating taxable
income after utilization of state net operating losses. Income tax provisions
charged to net income are summarized below:

Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the
amount of the Company's assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and their tax basis.

USM had current deferred tax assets totaling $1.0 million at December 31, 1995,
and $926,000 at December 31, 1994, resulting primarily from the allowance for
customer receivables.

The temporary differences that gave rise to the noncurrent deferred tax assets
and liabilities as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, are as follows:

</TABLE>

The amount of federal net operating loss carryforward available to offset future
taxable income aggregated approximately $74 million at December 31, 1995 and
expires between 2002 and 2010. The amount of state net operating loss
carryforward available to offset future taxable income aggregated approximately
$212 million at December 31, 1995 and expires between 1996 and 2010. At December
31, 1995, USM had $12.5 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit
carryforward available to offset regular income tax payable in future years.

A valuation allowance has been provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. During 1995, the
valuation allowance decreased $17.9 million primarily due to USM's 1995 net
taxable income.

11. RELATED PARTIES

USM is billed for all services it receives from TDS, consisting primarily of
information processing and general management services. Such billings are based
on expenses specifically identified to USM and on allocations of common
expenses. Such allocations are based on the relationship of USM's assets and
revenues to the total assets and revenues of TDS. Management believes the method
used to allocate common expenses is reasonable. Billings to USM from TDS
amounted to $26.1 million in 1995, $22.1 million in 1994 and $22.9 million in
1993. Management believes that all expenses and costs applicable to USM are
reflected in the accompanying financial statements on a basis which is
representative of what they would have been if USM operated on
a stand-alone basis.

All markets managed by USM are billed for services they receive from USM
consisting primarily of accounting, billing and engineering services. Such
billings are based on expenses specifically identified to each market and on
allocations of common expenses. Such allocations are based on the relationships
of each market's assets and revenues to the total assets and revenues of all the
markets managed by USM. Billings to nonconsolidated, managed markets amounted to
$4.8 million in 1995, $5.6 million in 1994 and $7.6 million in 1993. Management
believes that all expenses and costs applicable to each market are
representative of what they would have been if each managed market operated on a
stand-alone basis.

Interest income primarily includes interest on loans to managed unconsolidated
markets used to fund these markets' ongoing construction and operating expenses.
Interest income from these markets amounted to $1.8 million in 1995 and $1.9
million in 1994 and 1993.

USM has a Cash Management Agreement with TDS under which USM may from time to
time deposit its excess cash with TDS for investment under TDS's cash management
program. Deposits made under the agreement are available to USM on demand and
bear interest each month at the 30-day Commercial Paper Rate as reported in The
Wall Street Journal, plus 1/4%, or such higher rate as TDS may at its discretion
offer on such deposits.

12. GAIN ON SALE OF CELLULAR
    AND OTHER INVESTMENTS

The gains recorded in 1995 reflect the sales and exchanges of minority- and
majority-owned cellular interests and the sale of certain marketable equity
securities as follows: (a) USM sold a majority interest in six markets for
$115.3 million in cash. A pretax gain of $64.6 million was recognized on the
sales; (b) USM sold its minority interests in six markets for $14.0 million in
cash and notes receivable. A pretax gain of $11.1 million was recognized on the
sales; (c) USM received cash proceeds totaling $5.5 million in an exchange of
cellular markets, recognizing a prextax gain of $5.3 million; and (d) certain
marketable equity securities were sold for $20.7 million in cash. A pretax gain
of $2.5 million was recognized on the sale, representing the excess of the fair
market value over the cost basis of the securities.

The gains recorded in 1994 reflect the exchange of USM's cost-basis investment
interests in five markets in exchange for additional interests in seven markets
controlled by USM. The exchange of the investment interests in the five markets
has been recorded at their fair market value of approximately $4.3 million. A
gain of $3.3 million, representing the excess of the fair market value of the
market interests exchanged over the book value of such interests, was included
in income for 1994.

The gains recorded in 1993 reflect primarily the sale of investment interests in
two markets. USM received $6.8 million cash consideration on the sales.

13. LEASE COMMITMENTS

USM and certain of its majority-owned partnerships and subsidiaries lease
certain office and cell site locations under operating leases. Future minimum
rental payments required under operating leases that have noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 1995 are as follows:

14. COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

The partnerships and corporations in which USM is a partner or shareholder are
in various stages of development. USM expects to spend approximately $240
million during 1996 for both enhancements to existing systems and construction
of new systems. Under the terms of certain partnership and shareholder
agreements, USM may be committed to funding other partners' or shareholders'
portions of construction and other costs, if sufficient financing is not
available to the individual entities. USM does not expect such individual
financing shortfalls to be material.

USM has an ongoing acquisition and divestiture program to maximize its
clustering strategy. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures for a discussion
of pending acquisitions and divestitures.

COLLECTIBILITY OF NOTE RECEIVABLE

As of December 31, 1995, USM loaned a total of $5.5 million to another cellular
company ("Cellular Co.") under a long-term financing agreement. Under the
agreement, USM will provide up to $6 million to finance Cellular Co.'s equipment
purchases and construction costs related to the operations in an RSA. Although
interest payments are current, USM has no assurance that Cellular Co. will have
sufficient assets at the time the principal payment is due in June 2000 to repay
the loans in full. No accrual has been made for this possibility and the note is
being carried on the balance sheet at the full loan amount as of December 31,
1995.

STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT

The Company has entered into a standby letter of credit agreement effective July
20, 1994 with a financial institution. This standby letter of credit, which will
not exceed $10.0 million, provides supplemental security in support of a bank
loan to an entity minority-owned by the Company. In the event of default under
the minority-owned entity's bank loan agreement, the bank may call upon the
Company's standby letter of credit to satisfy any amounts still due under this
loan agreement.

15. INVESTMENTS IN
    CELLULAR PARTNERSHIPS

Investments in cellular partnerships consist of amounts invested in cellular
entities in which USM holds a minority or noncontrolling interest. Investments
in cellular partnerships consist of long-term investments and investments held
for sale or exchange, as follows:

</TABLE>

USM follows the equity method of accounting for its long-term investments which
recognizes, on a current basis, USM's proportionate share of the incomes and
losses accruing to it under the terms of its partnership and shareholder
agreements. The equity method is followed for minority interests in markets that
are managed by USM and for certain markets managed by others.

USM follows the cost method of accounting for its investments in markets held
for sale or exchange, and such investments are recorded at the lower of cost or
market value. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of USM's
investments in cellular partnerships held for sale or exchange due to the lack
of quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair values without
incurring excessive costs. The $10.6 million carrying amount at December 31,
1995, represents primarily the original amounts invested, which management
believes are not impaired.

The following summarizes the unaudited balance sheets and results of operations
of the cellular system partnerships in which USM's investments are accounted for
by the equity method.

</TABLE>

A class action complaint was filed in November 1993 naming AirTouch Cellular as
general partner of the Partnership. In April 1995, Los Angeles Cellular
Telephone Company ("LACTC") was named as a necessary party to the action. The
plaintiff alleged LACTC and the Partnership conspired to fix the price of
wholesale and retail cellular service in the Los Angeles market. The plaintiff
alleged damages for the class "in a sum in excess of $100 million." The
Partnership has answered the complaint and intends to defend itself vigorously.
This case has been consolidated for purposes of discovery with two other class
actions making identical price-fixing allegations. The case has been removed to
federal court. The other cases have been stayed pending resolution of a motion
to remand the case to state court. In addition three non-class action antitrust
cases brought
<PAGE>

by cellular agents making similar allegations were settled for immaterial
amounts. In April 1995, a Federal class action complaint was dismissed on a
motion for summary judgment. The dismissal was upheld on appeal. The Partnership
does not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on
the Partnership's financial position.

In September 1995, a class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of all of
AirTouch Cellular's subscribers nationwide, including the Partnership's
subscribers, regarding customer notification of AirTouch Cellular's practices
with respect to billing for fractional minutes of service. No dispositive
motions have been filed in the proceeding and discovery has not yet begun. The
Partnership believes the lawsuit to be without merit.

16. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is in involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and
various state and federal courts. In some cases, the litigation involves
disputes regarding rights to certain cellular telephone systems and other
interests. Management does not believe that any of such proceedings should have
a material adverse impact on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
    PROPOSED MINORITY
    INTEREST TRANSFER

TDS has proposed the transfer of its minority ownership interests in certain
cellular markets (acquired in conjunction with its prior acquisitions of
telephone companies) to the Company. The minority interests subject to the
proposal represent approximately 675,000 population equivalents. The proposed
purchase price is approximately $116.7 million. The form of consideration to be
paid by USM is subject to negotiation and would likely consist of cash and USM
common stock or a combination thereof.

The TDS proposal is subject to negotiation and has been referred to a previously
established independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The
independent committee has retained Lazard Freres & Co. as its financial advisor.
The proposed transaction will be subject to approval by the independent
committee of the USM Board of Directors, to definitive documentation and to
compliance with regulatory requirements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UNITED
STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United States
Cellular Corporation (a Delaware corporation and an 80.8%-owned subsidiary of
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in common
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the financial statements of the Los Angeles SMSA, Baton Rouge MSA and
Nashville/Clarksville MSA limited partnerships. The Company's investment in
these partnerships is reflected in the accompanying financial statements using
the equity method of accounting. The investment in these limited partnerships
represented $73,396,000 and $45,694,000 (or 3.9% and 3.0%) of total consolidated
assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, and the equity in their
income represents $29,084,000, $21,189,000 and $15,364,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and is included in
the consolidated net income (loss). The summarized financial information
contained in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes
financial information for the aforementioned partnerships. The financial
statements of those limited partnerships were audited by other auditors whose
reports have been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for those limited partnerships, is based solely on the reports
of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of United States Cellular Corporation and Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
