ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

    United   States  Cellular  Corporation  (the  "Company")  provides  cellular
telephone service to  421,000 customers through  130 majority-owned and  managed
("consolidated") cellular systems serving approximately 18% of the geography and
approximately  9% of the population  of the United States.  Since 1985, when the
Company began providing  cellular service in  Knoxville, Tennessee, the  Company
has  expanded its cellular networks and customer service operations to cover 145
markets in 33 states as of December 31, 1994. In total, the Company now operates
nine market clusters, of  which four have  a total population  of more than  two
million,  plus other  unclustered markets.  Overall, 84%  of the  Company's 25.2
million population equivalents are in markets which are or will be consolidated,
2% are in managed but not consolidated  markets and 14% are in markets in  which
the Company holds an investment interest.

    The  Company is the seventh largest cellular telephone company in the United
States, based on the aggregate number  of population equivalents it owns or  has
the right to acquire. The Company's corporate development strategy is to acquire
controlling  interests  in MSA  and RSA  licensees  in areas  adjacent to  or in
proximity to its other markets in order to build and expand market clusters. The
Company anticipates that  clustering markets  will expand  its cellular  service
areas and provide certain economies in its capital and operating costs.

    The  following table  summarizes the  status of  the Company's  interests in
cellular markets at December 31, 1994.

    Cellular  systems in  the Company's  130 majority-owned  and managed markets
served 421,000 customers at December 31, 1994, and contained 790 cell sites. The
average penetration  rate in  the Company's  consolidated markets  was 1.98%  at
December  31, 1994, and the churn rate in all consolidated markets averaged 2.3%
per month for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994.

    The Company,  or  TDS for  the  benefit of  the  Company, has  entered  into
agreements  with  third parties  to acquire  cellular interests  which generally
require the issuance of  the Company's or TDS's  securities. In connection  with
agreements  that require the delivery of  TDS securities, the Company reimburses
TDS for  TDS  securities  issued  to third  parties  as  consideration  for  the
acquisitions.

    The  Company was incorporated  in Delaware in  1983. The Company's executive
offices are  located  at 8410  West  Bryn  Mawr, Chicago,  Illinois  60631.  Its
telephone number is 312-399-8900. The Common Shares of the Company are listed on
the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "USM."

system in such market.

CELLULAR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

    THE CELLULAR  TELEPHONE INDUSTRY.   Cellular  telephone technology  provides
high-quality,  high-capacity communications services to in-vehicle and hand-held
portable cellular telephones.  Cellular technology is  a major improvement  over
earlier  mobile telephone technologies. Cellular  telephone systems are designed
for maximum  mobility  of  the  customer.  Access  is  provided  through  system
interconnections  to local, regional, national and world-wide telecommunications
networks. Cellular  telephone  systems also  offer  a full  range  of  ancillary
services  such as conference calling, call-waiting, call-forwarding, voice mail,
facsimile and data transmission.

    Cellular telephone systems divide each service area into smaller  geographic
areas  or  "cells." Each  cell  is served  by  radio transmitters  and receivers
operating on discrete radio frequencies licensed by the FCC. All of the cells in
a system  are  connected to  a  computer-controlled Mobile  Telephone  Switching
Office  ("MTSO").  The  MTSO  is  connected  to  the  conventional  ("landline")
telephone network and potentially other  MTSOs. Each conversation on a  cellular
phone  involves a transmission over a specific set of radio frequencies from the
cellular phone to  a transmitter/receiver at  a cell site.  The transmission  is
forwarded  from the cell site to the MTSO and from there may be forwarded to the
landline telephone network to complete the call. As the cellular telephone moves
from one  cell  to  another,  the MTSO  determines  radio  signal  strength  and
transfers ("hands off") the call from one cell to the next. This hand-off is not
noticeable to either party on the phone call.

    The  Company provides cellular  telephone service under  licenses granted by
the FCC. The FCC grants only two licenses to provide cellular telephone  service
in   each  market.   However,  competition  for   customers  includes  competing
communications technologies such as conventional landline and mobile  telephone,
Special  Mobile Radio  ("SMR") systems and  radio paging.  In addition, emerging
technologies  such  as  Enhanced  Specialized  Mobile  Radio  ("ESMR"),   mobile
satellite communication systems and Personal Communications Services ("PCS") may
prove  to be competitive with  cellular service in the future  in some or all of
the markets where the Company has operations.

    The services  available to  cellular customers  and the  sources of  revenue
available  to  cellular  system  operators  are  similar  to  those  provided by
conventional landline telephone companies. Customers are charged a separate  fee
for system access, airtime, long-distance calls, and ancillary services.

<PAGE>
    Cellular  system  operators  often  provide service  to  customers  of other
operators' cellular systems while the  customers are temporarily located  within
the  operators'  service areas.  Customers using  service  away from  their home
system are called  "roamers." Roaming is  available because technical  standards
require that analog cellular telephones be compatible in all market areas in the
United  States.  The system  that  provides the  service  to these  roamers will
generate usage revenue.  Many operators, including  the Company, charge  premium
rates for this roaming service.

    There  are  a  number  of  recent  technical  developments  in  the cellular
industry. Currently, while most of the MTSOs process information digitally, most
of the radio transmission is done  on an analog basis. Digital radio  technology
offers  advantages, including less transmission  noise, greater system capacity,
and potentially lower incremental costs for additional customers. The conversion
from analog  to digital  radio technology  is expected  to be  an  industry-wide
process that will take a number of years.

    During 1992, a new transmission technique was approved for implementation by
the  cellular industry.  Time Division  Multiple Access  ("TDMA") technology was
selected as one industry standard by the cellular industry and has been deployed
in several  markets,  including the  Company's  operations in  Tulsa,  Oklahoma.
Another  digital technology, Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA"), is expected
to be in a commercial  trial by the end of  1995. The Company expects to  deploy
some CDMA digital radio channels in other markets in the near future.

    The  cellular  telephone industry  is  characterized by  high  initial fixed
costs. Accordingly, if and when revenues less variable costs exceed fixed costs,
incremental revenues should yield an operating profit. The amount of profit,  if
any,  under such circumstances  is dependent on, among  other things, prices and
variable marketing costs which in turn are affected by the amount and extent  of
competition.  Until technological limitations on  total capacity are approached,
additional cellular system  capacity can  normally be added  in increments  that
closely  match demand  and at  less than the  proportionate cost  of the initial
capacity.

    THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.  From its  inception in 1983 until very  recently,
the  Company has principally been in  a start-up phase. The Company's activities
have been concentrated significantly on the acquisition of interests in entities
licensed or  designated to  receive  a license  ("licensees")  from the  FCC  to
provide  cellular  service  and on  the  construction and  initial  operation of
cellular systems. The development of a cellular system is capital-intensive  and
requires  substantial investment prior  to and subsequent  to initial operation.
The Company has experienced operating losses  and net losses from its  inception
until  the  past few  quarters.  Management anticipates  accelerating  growth in
cellular units in  service and revenues  as the Company  continues its  vigorous
expansion  and development  programs. Marketing  and system  operations expenses
associated with this rapid expansion will most likely reduce the rate of  growth
in operating cash flow and operating income over the next several quarters.

    While there are numerous cellular systems operating in the United States and
other  countries, the industry  has only a limited  operating history. While the
Company produced operating income and net income during 1994, changes in any  of
several  factors may  reduce the  Company's growth  in operating  income and net
income over the next few  years. These factors include:  (i) the growth rate  in
the  Company's customer base;  (ii) the usage and  pricing of cellular services;
(iii) the percentage of customers who  terminate service each month (the  "churn
rate");  (iv) the  cost of  providing cellular  services, including  the cost of
attracting new customers;  and (v) continuing  technological advances which  may
provide competitive alternatives.

    The  Company is building a substantial presence in selected geographic areas
throughout the  United States  where  it can  efficiently integrate  and  manage
cellular telephone systems. Its cellular interests include operating clusters of
markets  in the following areas:  Iowa, Wisconsin/Illinois/ Minnesota, Missouri,
Eastern  North  Carolina/Virginia/South  Carolina,  West  Virginia/Pennsylvania/
Maryland, Indiana/Kentucky, Oregon/California, Washington/Oregon,
Oklahoma/Missouri/Kansas,  Texas/ Oklahoma, Maine/New Hampshire/Vermont, Eastern
Tennessee/Western North  Carolina,  Northern  Florida/Georgia  and  Southwestern
Texas.  See "The  Company's Cellular  Interests." The  Company has  acquired its
cellular interests  through the  wireline application  process (22%),  including
settlements and exchanges with other applicants, and through acquisitions (78%),
including acquisitions from TDS and third parties.

                                                                               5
<PAGE>
    Management  plans to retain  minority interests in  certain cellular markets
which it believes  will earn a  favorable return on  investment. Other  minority
interests  may be  traded for interests  in markets which  enhance the Company's
market clusters or may be sold for cash or other consideration.

CELLULAR SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT

    ACQUISITIONS.  During  the last  five years,  the Company  has expanded  its
size,  particularly  in  contiguous  or  adjacent  markets  through  an  ongoing
acquisition program  aimed  at  strengthening  the  Company's  position  in  the
cellular  industry.  This growth  has  resulted primarily  from  acquisitions of
interests in  RSAs and  has been  based on  obtaining interests  with rights  to
manage the underlying market.

    Including  transfers of  RSA interests from  TDS, the Company  has more than
doubled its population  equivalents from approximately  9.2 million at  December
31,  1989,  to  approximately  25.2  million  at  December  31,  1994.  However,
population equivalents grew at a compound annual rate of 10% over the last three
years and only 5% in 1994. Markets managed or to be managed by the Company  have
increased  from 50 markets at December 31,  1989, to 150 markets at December 31,
1994.  As  of  December  31,  1994,  almost  86%  of  the  Company's  population
equivalents  represented interests in markets the  Company manages or expects to
manage compared to 70% at December 31, 1989.

    The  Company  plans  to   acquire  additional  cellular  interests   through
acquisitions  or trades in  markets that further  strengthen its market clusters
and in other  attractive markets.  The Company  also seeks  to acquire  minority
interests  in markets where  it already owns  (or has the  right to acquire) the
majority interest. The  Company also  continues to evaluate  the disposition  of
interests which are not essential to its corporate development strategy.

    The  Company, or TDS  for the benefit  of the Company,  will ordinarily make
acquisitions using securities  or cash  or by exchanging  cellular interests  it
already  owns. While  management believes that  it will be  successful in making
additional acquisitions or trades, there can  be no assurance that the  Company,
or  TDS for  the benefit of  the Company,  will be able  to negotiate additional
acquisitions or trades on terms acceptable  to it or that regulatory  approvals,
where required, will be received.

    The  Company,  or  TDS  for  the  benefit  of  the  Company,  has negotiated
acquisitions of cellular interests from third parties primarily in consideration
for the Company's Common  Shares or TDS's Common  or Preferred Shares.  Cellular
interests  acquired by TDS are generally assigned  to the Company. At that time,
the Company  reimburses TDS  for the  value  of TDS  securities issued  in  such
transactions,  generally by  issuing Common Shares  to TDS or  by increasing the
balance due TDS under the Company's Revolving Credit Agreement in amounts  equal
to  the  value of  TDS securities  delivered  at the  time the  acquisitions are
closed. The  fair market  value of  the Company's  securities issued  to TDS  in
connection  with these transactions is equal to the fair market value of the TDS
securities delivered  in the  transactions and  is determined  at the  time  the
transactions are closed.

    COMPLETED  ACQUISITIONS.  During 1994, the Company completed the acquisition
of controlling  interests  in  nine  markets  and  several  additional  minority
interests  representing approximately 1.3 million  population equivalents for an
aggregate consideration of  $140.3 million. The  consideration consisted of  4.3
million  of the Company's Common Shares, an  increase of $309,000 in the debt to
TDS under  the Revolving  Credit Agreement,  $6.7  million in  cash and  a  $1.4
million  cancellation of a note receivable.  The debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement and 4.2 million of the Company's  Common Shares were issued to TDS  to
reimburse  TDS for TDS Common Shares issued  and issuable and cash paid to third
parties in connection with these acquisitions.

    PENDING ACQUISITIONS.   At December 31,  1994, the Company,  or TDS for  the
benefit  of  the Company,  had entered  into  agreements to  acquire controlling
interests  in  seven  markets   and  several  minority  interests   representing
approximately  1.2 million population equivalents for an aggregate consideration
estimated to be approximately $101.5 million. If all of the pending acquisitions
are completed as planned,  the Company will issue  approximately 102,000 of  its
Common  Shares and TDS will pay approximately $98.3 million in TDS Common Shares
and cash. Any interests acquired by TDS in these transactions are expected to be
assigned to the Company and,  at that time, the  Company will reimburse TDS  for
TDS's  consideration delivered  and costs incurred  in such  acquisitions in the
form of Common  Shares of  the Company  or increases  in the  balance under  the
Revolving Credit Agreement. Based on the estimated value of the consideration at
the time the agreements were entered into, the Company

6
<PAGE>
expects  to reimburse TDS by issuing 2.7  million of the Company's Common Shares
to TDS  and  by  increasing the  balance  due  TDS under  the  Revolving  Credit
Agreement  by $11.2  million. The  Company has  also entered  into agreements to
exchange markets with four  other cellular operators.  Pursuant to the  exchange
agreements,  the Company will receive majority  interests in nine new markets in
exchange for majority interests in seven markets and three market partitions the
Company currently owns.

    The Company maintains shelf registration of its Common Shares and  Preferred
Stock  under the Securities Act of  1933 for issuance specifically in connection
with acquisitions.

    TDS owned an aggregate of 63,897,673  shares of common stock of the  Company
at  December  31, 1994,  representing  over 81%  of  the combined  total  of the
Company's outstanding Common and  Series A Common Shares  and over 96% of  their
combined  voting power. Assuming  the Company's Common Shares  are issued in all
instances in which  the Company has  the choice  to issue its  Common Shares  or
other  consideration and  assuming all other  issuances of  the Company's common
stock to  TDS and  third  parties for  completed  and pending  acquisitions  and
redemptions of the Company's Preferred Stock and TDS's Preferred Shares had been
completed  at December  31, 1994,  TDS would  have owned  over 80%  of the total
outstanding common stock of the Company and controlled over 95% of the  combined
voting  power of both classes of its  common stock. In the event TDS's ownership
of the Company  falls below 80%  of the total  value of all  of the  outstanding
shares  of the Company's stock, TDS and  the Company would be deconsolidated for
federal income tax purposes. TDS  and the Company have  the ability to defer  or
prevent  deconsolidation, if  deferring or  preventing deconsolidation  would be
advantageous, by  delivering TDS  Common  Shares and/or  cash,  in lieu  of  the
Company's Common Shares in connection with certain acquisitions.

CELLULAR INTERESTS AND CLUSTERS

    The   Company  operates  clusters  of  adjacent  cellular  systems  wherever
feasible, enabling  its customers  to  benefit from  larger service  areas  than
otherwise  possible. Where the Company  offers wide-area coverage, its customers
enjoy uninterrupted service within the designated area. Customers may also  make
outgoing  calls  and receive  incoming calls  within  this area  without special
roaming arrangements. In addition to benefits to customers, clustering also  has
provided  to the Company  certain economies in its  capital and operating costs.
These economies  are  made possible  through  increased sharing  of  facilities,
personnel  and other costs and have resulted in a reduction of the Company's per
customer cost of service.  The extent to which  the Company benefits from  these
revenue   enhancements  and  economies  of  operation  is  dependent  on  market
conditions, population sizes of each cluster and engineering considerations.

    The Company's  market clusters  continue to  grow rapidly.  At December  31,
1994, the Company's service territory covered approximately 18% of the geography
and  approximately  9%  of the  population  of  the United  States.  The Company
operated nine market clusters at that date,  four of which have a population  of
two  million or more.  The Company anticipates  that it will  continue to pursue
strategic acquisitions and trades which  will complement its established  market
clusters.  From time to time,  the Company may also  consider trading or selling
its interests in markets which do not fit well with its long-term strategies.

                                                                               7

    The Company  owned  or  had  the right  to  acquire  interests  in  cellular
telephone systems in 207 markets at December 31, 1994, representing 25.2 million
population  equivalents.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  growth  in the
Company's population equivalents in recent  years and the development status  of

                        THE COMPANY'S CELLULAR INTERESTS

    The table below sets forth certain information with respect to the interests
in cellular markets which the Company owned or had the right to acquire pursuant
to definitive agreements as of December 31, 1994.

    The  number of population equivalents  represented by the Company's cellular
interests may have no  direct relationship to the  number of potential  cellular
customers or the revenues that may be realized from the operation of the related
cellular systems. The fair market value of the Company's cellular interests will
ultimately  depend on the success of its  operations. There is no assurance that
the value of cellular  interests will not be  significantly lower in the  future
than at present.

</TABLE>

    SYSTEM  DESIGN AND  CONSTRUCTION.   The Company  designs and  constructs its
systems in a manner it believes  will permit it to provide high-quality  service
to  mobile, transportable and  portable cellular telephones,  generally based on
market and engineering  studies which  relate to  specific markets.  Engineering
studies are performed by Company personnel or independent engineering firms. The
Company's  switching equipment is digital, which reduces noise and crosstalk and
is capable of  interconnecting in  a manner  which reduces  costs of  operation.
While digital microwave interconnections are typically made between the MTSO and
cell  sites, primarily analog radio transmission  is used between cell sites and
the cellular telephones themselves.

    In accordance  with  its  strategy  of  building  and  strengthening  market
clusters,  the  Company has  selected high  capacity digital  cellular switching
systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single MTSO.  The
Company's  cellular  systems  are  designed to  facilitate  the  installation of
equipment which will permit microwave interconnection between the MTSO and  each
cell site. The Company has implemented such microwave interconnection in most of
the  cellular systems it manages. In other  systems in which the Company owns or
has an option to  purchase a majority  interest and where it  is believed to  be
cost-efficient,  such microwave technology will  also be implemented. Otherwise,
such

14
<PAGE>
systems will rely upon landline  telephone connections or microwave links  owned
by  others  to link  cell  sites with  the  MTSO. Although  the  installation of
microwave network interconnection equipment  requires a greater initial  capital
investment,  a microwave network enables a  system operator to avoid the current
and future charges  associated with  leasing telephone lines  from the  landline
telephone  company, while  generally improving system  reliability. In addition,
microwave facilities can be used to  connect separate cellular systems to  allow
shared switching, which reduces the aggregate cost of the equipment necessary to
operate both systems.

    The  Company  has  continued  to  expand its  internal  network  in  1994 to
encompass over 100 markets in the United States. This network provides automatic
call delivery for the Company's customers and handoff between adjacent  markets.
The  network has also been extended,  using IS-41 technology, through links with
certain systems  operated by  several other  carriers, including  GTE, US  West,
Ameritech,  BellSouth,  Centennial  Cellular  Corp.,  Southwestern  Bell,  McCaw
Cellular Communications, Vanguard Cellular Systems and others. Additionally, the
Company has  implemented two  Signal  Transfer Points  which  will allow  it  to
interconnect  efficiently with  network providers such  as Independent Telephone
Network and the North American Cellular Network.

    During 1995, the  Company intends to  extend the network  for its  customers
through interconnection with one or more network providers as well as additional
"point  to point" connections required for  hand-off. This expanded network will
increase the area in which  customers can automatically receive incoming  calls,
and  should also reduce  the incidence of  fraud due to  the pre-call validation
feature of the IS-41 technology.

    Management  believes  that  currently  available  technologies  will   allow
sufficient  capacity on the  Company's networks to  meet anticipated demand over
the next few years.

COSTS OF SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING

    Construction of cellular systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial
investment for  land  and  improvements, buildings,  towers,  MTSOs,  cell  site
equipment,  microwave  equipment,  engineering  and  installation.  The Company,
consistent with FCC control  requirements, uses primarily  its own personnel  to
engineer  and oversee construction of each cellular  system where it owns or has
the right to acquire a controlling interest. In so doing, the Company expects to
improve the overall quality of  its systems and to  reduce the expense and  time
required to make them operational.

    The  costs (exclusive of license costs)  of the operational systems in which
the Company owns or has the right to acquire an interest are generally  financed
through  capital  contributions or  intercompany  loans to  the  partnerships or
subsidiaries owning the systems, and through certain vendor financing.

MARKETING

    The Company's marketing plan  is designed to  continue rapid penetration  of
its  market clusters and to increase customer awareness of cellular service. The
marketing plan  stresses the  quality  of the  Company's service  offerings  and
incorporates  rate plans which  are designed to  meet the needs  of a variety of
customer usage  patterns. The  Company's  distribution channels  include  direct
sales  personnel and  agents and the  Company has recently  added retail service
centers in many of  its markets. These Company-owned  and managed locations  are
designed  to market cellular service to the  consumer segment in a setting which
is familiar to these potential customers.

    The Company manages each cluster of markets out of one administrative office
with a local staff,  including marketing, customer  service, engineering and  in
some  cases  installation personnel.  Direct  sales consultants  market cellular
service to potential customers throughout  each cluster. Retail associates  work
out of the retail locations and market cellular service to the consumer segment.
The  Company maintains an ongoing training  program to improve the effectiveness
of sales  consultants  and  retail  associates  by  focusing  their  efforts  on
obtaining  customers  and  maximizing  the  sale  of  high-user  packages. These
packages commit customers  to pay for  a minimum amount  of usage at  discounted
rates per minute, even if usage falls below a defined monthly minimum amount.

    The  Company also  relies on  agents, dealers  and non-Company  retailers to
obtain customers. Agents and dealers are independent business people who  obtain
customers  for  the Company  on  a commission  basis.  The Company's  agents are
generally in the business of selling cellular telephones,

                                                                              15
<PAGE>
cellular  service  packages and  other related  products. The  Company's dealers
include car  stereo  companies and  other  companies whose  customers  are  also
potential  cellular customers.  The non-Company  retailers include  car dealers,
major appliance dealers, office supply dealers and mass merchants.

    The Company opened its own retail locations in late 1993, expanding to  over
140  locations by the  end of 1994. These  Company-owned and operated businesses
utilize rental facilities located in high-traffic areas. The Company is  working
toward  a uniform appearance  in these stores, with  all having similar displays
and layouts. The  retail centers' hours  of business match  those of the  retail
trade  in the local marketplace, often staying open on weekends and later in the
evening than a typical business supplier. Additionally, to fully serve  customer
needs,  these stores sell accessories to  complement the phones and services the
Company has traditionally provided.

    In addition to its own retail centers, the Company actively pursues national
retail accounts which may potentially  yield new customer additions in  multiple
markets.  Agreements have been  entered into with  such national distributors as
Chrysler Corporation, Ford  Motor Company,  General Motors,  AT&T, Radio  Shack,
Best  Buy and Sears, Roebuck & Co. in certain of the Company's markets. Upon the
sale of a cellular telephone by one of these national distributors, the  Company
receives,  often  exclusively  within  the  territories  served,  the  resulting
cellular customer.

    The Company uses a variety of direct mail, billboard, radio, television  and
newspaper advertising to stimulate interest by prospective customers in cellular
service  and to  establish familiarity with  the Company's  name. Advertising is
directed at  gaining  customers,  increasing usage  by  existing  customers  and
increasing  the  public awareness  and  understanding of  the  cellular services
offered by  the Company.  The Company  attempts to  select the  advertising  and
promotion  media that  are most  appealing to  the targeted  groups of potential
customers in each local market. The Company utilizes local advertising media and
public relations activities and establishes programs to enhance public awareness
of the Company, such as providing  telephones and service for public events  and
emergency uses.

CUSTOMERS AND SYSTEM USAGE

    Cellular  customers come  from a wide  range of  occupations. They typically
include a large proportion of individuals who work outside of their offices such
as people in the  construction, real estate,  wholesale and retail  distribution
businesses  and professionals.  Most of  the Company's  customers use in-vehicle
cellular telephones.  However, more  customers are  selecting portable  cellular
telephones as these units become more compact and fully featured as well as more
attractively priced.

    The  Company's  cellular systems  are  used most  extensively  during normal
business hours  between  7:00 am  and  6:00 pm.  On  average, the  local  retail
customers  in  the  Company's  majority-owned  and  managed  systems  used their
cellular systems  approximately 95  minutes per  unit each  month and  generated
retail  revenue  of approximately  $47 per  month during  1994, compared  to 103
minutes and $49 per month in  1993. Revenue generated by roamers, together  with
local,  toll and  other revenues,  brought the  Company's total  average monthly
service revenue per customer unit in  majority-owned and managed markets to  $80
during  1994.  Average  monthly  service  revenue  per  customer  unit decreased
approximately 6%  during 1994,  reflecting  both the  decline in  average  local
minutes  per customer  unit and slower  growth in roaming  revenues. The Company
anticipates that average monthly service revenue per customer unit will continue
to decline  as  its  distribution  channels  provide  additional  customers  who
generate fewer local minutes of use and as roaming revenues grow more slowly.

    Roaming is a service offered by the Company which allows a customer to place
or  receive a  call in  a cellular  service area  away from  the customer's home
market area. The Company has entered into "roaming agreements" with operators of
other cellular systems covering virtually all  systems in the United States  and
Canada.  These  agreements  offer customers  the  opportunity to  roam  in these
systems. These reciprocal agreements automatically pre-register the customers of
the Company's systems  in the  other carriers' systems.  Also, a  customer of  a
participating  system roaming (i.e.  travelling) in a  Company market where this
arrangement is in  effect is able  to make  and receive calls  on the  Company's
system.  The charge for this service is typically at premium rates and is billed
by the Company to the customer's home system, which then bills the customer. The
Company has entered into agreements with other

16
<PAGE>
cellular carriers  to  transfer roaming  usage  at agreed-upon  rates.  In  some
instances,  based on competitive factors, the  Company may charge a lower amount
to its customers  than the  amount actually charged  to the  Company by  another
cellular carrier for roaming.

CELLULAR TELEPHONES AND INSTALLATION

    There are a number of different  types of cellular telephones, all of  which
are  currently compatible with cellular systems nationwide. The Company offers a
full range  of vehicle-mounted,  transportable and  hand-held portable  cellular
telephones.  Features  offered  in  some  of  the  cellular  telephones  include
hands-free calling, repeat dialing, horn alert and others.

    The Company has established service  and/or installation facilities in  many
of  its local markets to ensure quality installation and service of the cellular
telephones it sells. These facilities allow  the Company to improve its  service
by promptly assisting customers who experience equipment problems.

    The   Company  negotiates  volume  discounts  from  its  cellular  telephone
suppliers. The Company  discounts cellular  telephones in most  markets to  meet
competition  or to stimulate sales  by reducing the cost  of becoming a cellular
customer. In these instances,  where permitted by  law, customers are  generally
required to sign an extended service contract with the Company. The Company also
cooperates  with  cellular  equipment  manufacturers  in  local  advertising and
promotion of cellular equipment.

    The Company's  customers are  able  to choose  from  a variety  of  packaged
pricing  plans  which  are  designed  to  fit  different  calling  patterns. The
Company's customer  bills typically  show  separate charges  for  custom-calling
features,   airtime  in  excess   of  the  packaged   amount,  and  toll  calls.
Custom-calling features provided by the Company include wide-area call delivery,
call forwarding, call  waiting, three-way  calling and  no-answer transfer.  The
Company  also  offers a  voice  message service  in  many of  its  markets. This
service,  which  functions  like  a  sophisticated  answering  machine,   allows
customers  to receive messages from callers when  they are not available to take
calls.

REGULATION

    The operations of the Company are  subject to FCC and state regulation.  The
licenses  held  by the  Company are  granted by  the  FCC for  the use  of radio
frequencies and are an important component of the overall value of the assets of
the Company. The construction, operation and transfer of cellular systems in the
United States  are regulated  to varying  degrees  by the  FCC pursuant  to  the
Communications  Act  of 1934  ("Communications  Act"). The  FCC  has promulgated
regulations governing  construction  and  operation  of  cellular  systems,  and
licensing  (including  renewal  of  licenses) and  technical  standards  for the
provision of cellular telephone service.

    For licensing  purposes, the  FCC divided  the United  States into  separate
geographic  markets  (MSAs and  RSAs). In  each  market, the  allocated cellular
frequencies are divided into two equal blocks. During

18
<PAGE>
the  application  process,  the  FCC  reserved  one  block  of  frequencies  for
nonwireline applicants and another block for wireline applicants. Subject to FCC
approval,  a cellular  system may  be sold to  either a  wireline or nonwireline
entity, but no entity which  controls a cellular system  may own an interest  in
another cellular system in the same MSA or RSA.

    The  completion  of  acquisitions involving  the  transfer of  control  of a
cellular system requires prior FCC approval. Acquisitions of minority  interests
generally  do not require  FCC approval. Whenever FCC  approval is required, any
interested  party  may  file  a  petition  to  dismiss  or  deny  the  Company's
application for approval of the proposed transfer.

    When  the first cell of a cellular system has been constructed, the licensee
is required to notify the FCC that construction has been completed.  Immediately
upon  this notification,  but not  before, FCC  rules authorize  the licensee to
offer commercial  service to  the public.  The  licensee is  then said  to  have
"operating  authority."  Initial  operating licenses  are  granted  for ten-year
periods. The FCC must  be notified each time  an additional cell is  constructed
which enlarges the service area of a given market.

    The  FCC's rules also generally require persons or entities holding cellular
construction permits or  licenses to coordinate  their proposed frequency  usage
with   other  cellular  users  and  licensees   in  order  to  avoid  electrical
interference between adjacent systems. The height and power of base stations  in
the  cellular system  are regulated by  FCC rules,  as are the  types of signals
emitted by  these stations.  In  addition to  regulation  by the  FCC,  cellular
systems  are subject to certain Federal Aviation Administration regulations with
respect to  the  siting and  construction  of cellular  transmitter  towers  and
antennas.

    In  a  series  of  actions, most  recently  on  July 7,  1994,  the  FCC has
established standards for conducting  comparative renewal proceedings between  a
cellular  licensee  seeking  renewal  of  its  license  and  challengers  filing
competing applications.  The FCC:  (i) established  criteria for  comparing  the
renewal applicant to challengers, including the standards under which a "renewal
expectancy"  will  be granted  to the  applicant  seeking license  renewal; (ii)
established basic qualifications standards  for challengers; and (iii)  provided
procedures  for preventing possible  abuses in the  comparative renewal process.
The FCC has concluded that  it will award a  renewal expectancy if the  licensee
has  (i)  provided  "substantial"  performance,  which  is  defined  as  "sound,
favorable and substantially  above a  level of mediocre  service just  minimally
justifying  renewal,"  and  (ii)  complied  with  FCC  rules,  policies  and the
Communications Act. If a renewal expectancy is awarded to an existing  licensee,
its  license  is  renewed and  competing  applications are  not  considered. The
Company's Tulsa and Knoxville renewal applications filed in 1994 were  unopposed
and  the  Company expects  its  licenses in  these  markets to  be  renewed. The
Company's next renewal  applications are  due to be  filed in  1996. See  "Legal
Proceedings  -- La Star  and Wisconsin RSA  8 Applications" for  a discussion of
certain FCC proceedings  which have  set aside  TDS's licensing  authority in  a
Wisconsin market pending the outcome of an FCC hearing.

    The  Company conducts and plans to conduct its operations in accordance with
all relevant FCC rules and regulations and anticipates being able to qualify for
a renewal  expectancy, if  applicable. Accordingly,  the Company  believes  that
current  regulations  will  have no  significant  effect on  its  operations and
financial condition. However, changes in the regulation of cellular operators or
their activities and  of other mobile  service providers could  have a  material
adverse effect on the Company's operations.

    The  FCC has also  provided that five  years after the  initial licenses are
granted, unserved areas within  markets previously granted  to licensees may  be
applied  for by  both wireline  and nonwireline  entities and  by third parties.
Accordingly, many unserved area applications have been filed by the Company  and
others.  The  Company's  strategy with  respect  to system  construction  in its
markets has been and will be to  build cells covering areas within such  markets
that  the Company considers economically feasible  to serve or might conceivably
wish to serve and to do so within the five-year period following issuance of the
license.

    The Company is also subject to state and local regulation in some instances.
In 1981, the FCC pre-empted the states from exercising jurisdiction in the areas
of licensing, technical standards and market structure. However, certain  states
require cellular system operators to go through a state certification process to
serve communities within their borders. All such certificates can be revoked for
cause.  In addition,  certain state  authorities regulate  several aspects  of a
cellular operator's business, including the resale of intra-state  long-distance
service   to  its  customers,   the  technical  arrangements   and  charges  for

                                                                              19
<PAGE>
interconnection with  the landline  network  and the  transfer of  interests  in
cellular  systems.  The  siting  and construction  of  the  cellular facilities,
including transmitter  towers,  antennas  and equipment  shelters  may  also  be
subject  to state or local zoning, land  use and other local regulations. Public
utility or  public service  commissions  (or certain  of the  commissioners)  in
several  states have  expressed an  interest in  examining whether  the cellular
industry should be more closely regulated by such states.

    Recent Congressional legislation, legislative proposals under  consideration
and FCC regulatory proceedings may have significant impact on some or all of the
Company's  operations by altering FCC  and state regulatory responsibilities for
mobile service, the procedures for the award  by the FCC of licenses to  conduct
existing  and  new  mobile  services,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  business
relationships between  mobile  service  providers and  Local  Exchange  Carriers
("LECs")  and the  scope of  the competitive  opportunities available  to mobile
service providers. In  general, the  trend of  these developments  is toward  an
increase  in the number of competitors and of competitive services. For the most
part, FCC  regulations which  implement changes  in the  law have  not yet  been
adopted,  or are  subject to  requests for  reconsideration, and  the Company is
therefore not now able to predict the extent of such impact.

    The Omnibus  Reconciliation  Act of  1993  (the "Budget  Act")  amended  the
Communications  Act by eliminating  legislatively enacted distinctions affecting
FCC and state regulation of common carrier and private carrier mobile operations
and directed  the  FCC to  classify  all mobile  services,  including  cellular,
paging,  SMR and  other services under  two categories:  Commercial Mobile Radio
Services ("CMRS"), subject to common carrier regulation; or Private Mobile Radio
Services ("PMRS"), not  subject to common  carrier regulation. In  1994 the  FCC
released  a decision classifying mobile service  offerings as CMRS operations if
they  include  a  service  offering  to   the  public,  for  a  fee,  which   is
interconnected  to the public switched network.  Cellular, SMR and paging, among
other services,  will be  classified as  CMRS if  they fit  this definition.  In
addition,  the FCC decision established a  regulatory precedent for hybrid CMRS/
PMRS regulation of mobile operations which offer both CMRS and PMRS service. The
Company anticipates that  most of its  service offerings will  be classified  as
CMRS.  The FCC decision also  states that it would  forebear from requiring that
CMRS  providers  comply  with  a  number  of  statutory  provisions,   otherwise
applicable  to common carriers, such as the  filing of tariffs. It requires LECs
to provide reasonable and fair interconnection to all CMRS providers, subject to
mutual compensation,  reasonable  charges  for  interstate  interconnection  and
reasonable  forms of interconnection. Numerous  petitions for reconsideration of
this decision were filed and remain pending.

    The Budget Act also amended the  Communications Act to authorize the FCC  to
use  a system of  competitive bidding to  issue initial licenses  for the use of
radio frequencies for which there are mutually exclusive applications and  where
the  principal  use  of the  license  will be  to  offer service  in  return for
compensation from  customers. In  response, the  FCC adopted  generic rules  for
competitive   bidding,  defined  eligibility   criteria  for  small  businesses,
minority- and  female-owned  businesses  and  rural  telephone  companies  which
qualify  for preferential bidding  treatment, as required  under the Budget Act,
and described the  bidding mechanisms to  be used by  businesses qualifying  for
preferential treatment in future spectrum auctions.

    Under other amendments to the Communications Act included in the Budget Act,
states  will generally be prohibited from regulating  the entry of, or the rates
charged by, any CMRS provider. The new  law does not, however, prohibit a  state
from  regulating other terms and conditions of CMRS offerings and permits states
to petition  the  FCC for  authority  to  continue rate  regulation.  These  new
statutory  provisions  took  effect  in  August  1994,  and  eight  states filed
petitions.

    Media reports have suggested that  certain radio frequency ("RF")  emissions
from  portable cellular  telephones might be  linked to cancer.  The Company has
reviewed relevant scientific information and, based on such information, is  not
aware of any credible evidence linking the usage of portable cellular telephones
with cancer. The FCC currently has a rulemaking proceeding pending to update the
guidelines  and methods it uses for  evaluating RF emissions in radio equipment,
including cellular telephones. While the proposal would impose more  restrictive
standards  on  RF emissions  from low-power  devices  such as  portable cellular
telephones, it is  anticipated that all  cellular telephones currently  marketed
and in use will comply with those standards.

20
<PAGE>
    The  FCC has allocated a total of 140 megahertz ("MHz") to broadband PCS, 20
MHz to unlicensed operations and 120  MHz to licensed operations, consisting  of
two 30 MHz blocks in each of the 51 Rand McNally Major Trading Areas, and one 30
MHz  block and  three 10 MHz  blocks in each  of 493 Rand  McNally Basic Trading
Areas. Cellular operators are permitted to participate in the award of these new
PCS licenses,  except for  licenses  reserved for  rural, small,  minority-  and
female-owned businesses and licenses for markets in which such cellular operator
owns  a 20%  or greater interest  in a  cellular licensee which  holds a license
covering 10% or more of the population  of the respective PCS licensed area.  In
the  latter case,  the cellular licensee  is limited  to one 10  MHz PCS channel
block. Numerous requests  for reconsideration  of the FCC's  decision have  been
filed  and remain pending before  the FCC and at least  one appeal was filed. On
March 15, 1995, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an
order delaying the commencement  of the auction  of the 30  MHz block for  Basic
Trading  Areas pending  a resolution  of a challenge  to the  FCC's rules giving
bidding preferences  to  certain  participants.  A  September  1995  hearing  is
scheduled. The FCC has classified PCS as CMRS.

    PCS  technology is currently under development and is expected to be similar
in some respects to cellular technology. When it becomes commercially available,
this technology is expected to offer increased capacity for wireless two-way and
one-way voice, data and  multimedia communications services  and is expected  to
result  in increased  competition in  the Company's  operations. The  ability of
these future  PCS licensees  to  complement or  compete with  existing  cellular
licensees  will be  affected by future  FCC rule-making. These  and other future
technological developments in the  wireless telecommunications industry and  the
enhancement of current technologies will likely create new products and services
that  are competitive with the services  currently offered by the Company. There
can be no  assurance that the  Company will  not be adversely  affected by  such
technological developments.

COMPETITION

    The  Company's only competitor for cellular telephone service in each market
is the licensee of  the second cellular system  in that market. Competition  for
customers  between the two systems in each market is principally on the basis of
quality  of  service,  price,  size  of  area  covered,  services  offered,  and
responsiveness  of  customer  service. The  competing  entities in  many  of the
markets in which the Company has an interest have financial resources which  are
substantially  greater  than  those of  the  Company  and its  partners  in such
markets.

    The FCC's rules require  all operational cellular systems  to provide, on  a
nondiscriminatory  basis, cellular service to resellers which purchase blocks of
mobile telephone numbers from an operational system and then resell them to  the
public.

    In  addition to competition from the other cellular licensee in each market,
there is also  competition from, among  other technologies, conventional  mobile
telephone  and SMR systems, both of which  are able to connect with the landline
telephone network.  The  Company  believes that  conventional  mobile  telephone
systems  and conventional SMR systems are competitively disadvantaged because of
technological limitations on the capacity of such systems. The FCC has  recently
given  approval, through waivers of its rules,  to ESMR, an enhanced SMR system.
ESMR  systems  may  have  cells  and  frequency  reuse  like  cellular,  thereby
potentially  eliminating any  current technological  limitation. The  first ESMR
systems were  implemented in  1993  in Los  Angeles.  Although less  directly  a
substitute  for  cellular service,  wireless  data services  and  one-way paging
service (and in the future, two-way  paging services) may be adequate for  those
who do not need full two-way voice service.

    Continuing  technological  advances  in  the  communications  field  make it
difficult to predict the  extent of additional  future competition for  cellular
systems. For example, the FCC has allocated radio channels to a mobile satellite
system  in which transmissions from mobile  units to satellites would augment or
replace transmissions  to cell  sites,  and several  consortia to  provide  such
service  have been  formed. Such  a system  is designed  primarily to  serve the
communications needs of  remote locations  and a mobile  satellite system  could
provide  viable competition for land-based cellular systems in such areas. It is
also possible that the  FCC may in the  future assign additional frequencies  to
cellular  telephone  service to  provide for  more  than two  cellular telephone
systems per market.

    PCS may prove  to be competitive  with cellular service  in the future.  PCS
providers  are expected to offer  digital, wireless communications services. PCS
trials are in process throughout the United States.

                                                                              21
<PAGE>
PCS is not anticipated to be significant sources of competition in the Company's
markets in the near future, but  may become a significant source of  competition
in the Company's markets once PCS systems have been built and developed. Similar
technological  advances or regulatory  changes in the  future may make available
other alternatives to cellular service,  thereby creating additional sources  of
competition.

EMPLOYEES

    The  Company had 2,250  employees as of  December 31, 1994.  Of these, 1,880
were based at the  various cellular markets operated  or managed by the  Company
with  only 370 based at  its corporate office in  Chicago, Illinois. None of the
Company's  employees  is  represented  by  a  labor  organization.  The  Company
considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    The  property  for mobile  telephone switching  offices  and cell  sites are
either owned  or  leased under  long-term  leases by  the  Company, one  of  its
subsidiaries  or  the partnership  or corporation  which holds  the construction
permit or license. The Company has not experienced major problems with obtaining
zoning approval for cell sites or  operating facilities and does not  anticipate
any such problems in the future which are or will be material to the Company and
its  subsidiaries  as a  whole. The  Company's investment  in property  is small
compared to its investment in licenses and cellular system equipment.

    The Company leases approximately 84,000 square feet of office space for  its
headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

    The  Company  considers  the  properties  owned  or  leased  by  it  and its
subsidiaries  to  be  suitable  and  adequate  for  their  respective   business
operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The  Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and
various state  and  federal  courts.  In some  cases,  the  litigation  involves
disputes  regarding  rights  to  certain cellular  telephone  systems.  The more
significant proceedings affecting  the Company  are described  in the  following
paragraphs.

    LA  STAR AND WISCONSIN  RSA 8 APPLICATIONS.   USM indirectly  owns 49% of La
Star Cellular  Telephone Company  ("La  Star"), which  was  an applicant  for  a
construction  permit for a cellular system in the New Orleans MSA. In June 1992,
the FCC  affirmed an  Administrative Law  Judge's order  which had  granted  the
application  of another applicant and dismissed La Star's application. The basis
for the FCC's action was its finding that USM improperly controlled La Star.  In
a  footnote to its decision, the FCC stated that questions regarding the conduct
of USM in that proceeding may be revisited in future proceedings. As a result of
that footnote,  FCC  authorizations in  uncontested  FCC proceedings  have  been
granted  to TDS and  its subsidiaries subject  to any subsequent  action the FCC
might take concerning its findings and conclusions in the La Star decision.

    La Star, TDS and USM appealed the FCC's decision in the La Star  proceeding.
On  March  29, 1994,  the United  States Court  of Appeals  for the  District of
Columbia Circuit  vacated the  FCC's  decision in  the  La Star  proceeding  and
remanded  the matter  to the  FCC for  further proceedings.  On remand,  the FCC
affirmed the  dismissal of  the La  Star  application but  did not  address  the
subject  matter of its footnote  in the original La  Star decision. As a result,
the Wisconsin  RSA  8  case,  discussed below,  now  constitutes  the  only  FCC
expression calling for conditions on authorizations to TDS and its subsidiaries.

    On  February 1, 1994, in a  proceeding involving a license originally issued
to TDS for Wisconsin RSA 8, the FCC instituted a hearing to determine whether in
the La Star case USM had misrepresented facts to, lacked candor in its  dealings
with  or attempted  to mislead the  FCC, and,  if so, whether  TDS possesses the
requisite character  qualifications  to hold  that  Wisconsin license.  The  FCC
stated in its

22
<PAGE>
decision  that, pending  resolution of the  issues in  the Wisconsin proceeding,
subsequent authorizations to TDS  and its subsidiaries  would be conditioned  on
the outcome of that proceeding. TDS was granted interim authority to continue to
operate that Wisconsin system pending completion of the hearing.

    Following extensive discovery by the FCC and other parties, TDS and USM have
reached  preliminary and  definitive settlement  agreements with  parties to the
proceeding contemplating a summary decision finding TDS and its affiliates fully
qualified  to  be  FCC  licensees.  Pending  the  negotiation  of  a  definitive
settlement  agreement  with a  group of  Wisconsin  telephone companies  who are
parties to the proceeding, the hearing has been postponed. Final settlement will
also be subject to the action of the judge presiding in the proceeding.

    TOWNES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., ET. AL. V.  TDS, ET AL.  Plaintiffs  Townes
Telecommunications,  Inc., Tatum Telephone Company  and Tatum Cellular Telephone
Company filed a suit on September 4, 1991 in the District Court of Rusk  County,
Texas,  against both  TDS and  USM as  defendants. Plaintiffs  made a  number of
allegations, including usurpation, breach  of fiduciary duty, civil  conspiracy,
breach of contract, tortious interference and other claims, and sought a variety
of remedies, including unspecified damages not to exceed $33 million and as much
as $200 million in punitive damages.

    The  case went to trial on April 25, 1994. On May 5, 1994, the jury returned
a verdict in favor of TDS and USM on all issues. The plaintiffs filed an  appeal
of  the case on September 12, 1994. The parties have executed an agreement which
settles all matters related to this litigation and this case has been  dismissed
with   prejudice  on  February  14,  1995.  The  settlement  agreement  requires
plaintiffs to  purchase a  minority  cellular interest  from  the Company  at  a
negotiated  purchase price which  the Company believes  approximates fair market
value, and does not require the payment of any money by the Company.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                        ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  United  States  Cellular
Corporation  and  Subsidiaries  Annual Report  to  Shareholders  incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and  have issued our report thereon dated  February
7,  1995 (except with respect  to the matters discussed in  Note 15, as to which
the date is March 14, 1995). Our report on the consolidated financial statements
includes explanatory paragraphs  with respect  to the  change in  the method  of
accounting  for income taxes as discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and the uncertainties discussed in Note 14 of the Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Our  audits  were  made for  the  purpose  of forming  an  opinion  on those
financial statements taken as a  whole. The financial statement schedule  listed
in  Item  14(a)(2) is  the  responsibility of  the  Company's management  and is
presented  for  purposes   of  complying  with   the  Securities  and   Exchange
Commission's  rules  and is  not part  of the  basic financial  statements. This
financial statement  schedule  has been  subjected  to the  auditing  procedures
applied  in the audits  of the basic  financial statements and,  in our opinion,
fairly states in  all material respects  the financial data  required to be  set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

              COMPILATION REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
  UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION:

    The accompanying combined  balance sheets  of the Los  Angeles SMSA  Limited
Partnership,  the Nashville/Clarksville  MSA Limited  Partnership and  the Baton
Rouge MSA Limited Partnership as of December  31, 1994 and 1993 and the  related
combined  statements of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows
for each of the  three years in  the period ended December  31, 1994, have  been
prepared  from  the  separate  financial  statements,  which  are  not presented
separately herein, of the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and  Baton
Rouge  MSA limited partnerships,  as described in  Note 1. We  have reviewed for
compilation only the  accompanying combined  financial statements,  and, in  our
opinion, those statements have been properly compiled from the amounts and notes
of  the  underlying  separate  financial statements  of  the  Los  Angeles SMSA,
Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton Rouge MSA limited partnerships, on the basis
described in Note 1.

    The statements for the Los Angeles SMSA, Nashville/Clarksville MSA and Baton
Rouge MSA limited partnerships  were audited by other  auditors as set forth  in
their  reports included on pages 32 through 36. The report of the other auditors
of the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership contains explanatory paragraphs with
respect to the uncertainties  discussed in the second,  third, fourth and  fifth
paragraphs  of Note  7. We have  not been  engaged to audit  either the separate
financial statements of the aforementioned  limited partnerships or the  related
combined  financial statements  in accordance  with generally  accepted auditing
standards and to render an opinion as to the fair presentation of such financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

                    REPORTS OF OTHER INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To The Partners of
  LOS ANGELES SMSA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

    We have audited the balance sheets  of Los Angeles SMSA Limited  Partnership
as  of December  31, 1994  and 1993, and  the related  statements of operations,
partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994; such financial statements are not included separately herein.
These  financial  statements  are   the  responsibility  of  the   Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan  and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all material  respects, the financial  position of Los  Angeles SMSA Limited
Partnership as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and results of its operations  and
its  cash flows  for each of  the three years  in the period  ended December 31,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, the Partnership has been
named in two separate actions, now consolidated, and a separate complaint served
by cellular agents. The outcome of these matters is uncertain and,  accordingly,
no accrual for these matters has been made in the financial statements.

    In  addition, as  discussed in  Note 9, four  class action  suits were filed
against the Partnership alleging violations of state and federal antitrust laws.
The outcome of these matters is uncertain and, accordingly, no accrual for these
matters has been made in the financial statements.

</TABLE>

    Included in buildings  are costs relating  to the acquisition  of cell  site
leases;  such as legal, consulting, and  title fees. Lease acquisition costs are
capitalized when incurred  and amortized  over the  period of  the lease.  Costs
related to unsuccessful negotiations are expensed in the period the negotiations
are terminated.

    Gains and losses on disposals are included in income at amounts equal to the
difference between net book value and proceeds received upon disposal.

    During  1994, 1993 and 1992, one  of the Partnerships recorded capital lease
additions of $687,000, $827,000 and $514,000, respectively.

    Commitments for  future equipment  acquisitions amounted  to $55,187,000  at
December 31, 1994.

    On  January 10, 1994, one of the Partnerships entered into an agreement with
its major supplier to purchase $77  million in equipment. At December 31,  1994,
approximately  $11 million  in equipment had  been purchased  by the Partnership
under the agreement.

    OTHER ASSETS

    Other assets consist primarily of the costs of acquiring the right to  serve
certain  customers previously served  by resellers and  are being amortized over
three  years  using  the  straight-line  method.  Accumulated  amortization  was
$5,656,000 and $4,806,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    OTHER CURRENT ASSETS

    Other  current assets  includes inventory  consisting primarily  of cellular
phones and accessories held for resale  stated at average cost. Consistent  with
industry  practice, losses  on sales  of cellular  phones are  recognized in the
period in which sales are made as a cost of acquiring subscribers.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION

    Revenues from  operations  primarily consist  of  charges to  customers  for
monthly access charges, cellular airtime usage, and roamer charges. Revenues are
recognized  as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues, resulting from cellular
service provided from the billing cycle date  to the end of each month and  from
other  cellular carriers' customers using the partnership's cellular systems for
the last half of each month, are estimated and recorded as receivables. Unearned
monthly access  charges and  bundled service  packages relating  to the  periods
after  month-end  are  deferred  and  netted  against  accounts  receivable  and
recognized the following month when services are provided.

3.  LEASE COMMITMENTS:

    Future  minimum  rental payments  required under  operating leases  for real
estate that have initial  or remaining noncancellable lease  terms in excess  of
one year as of December 31, 1994, are as follows:

</TABLE>

    The initial lease terms generally range from 5 to 25 years with the majority
of them having initial terms of 10 years and providing for one renewal option of
5   years  and  for   rental  escalation.  Included   in  selling,  general  and
administrative  expense  are  rental  costs  of  $17,750,000,  $15,119,000   and
$10,938,000  for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
One of  the  Partnerships  leases  office  facilities  under  a  ten-year  lease
agreement  which  provides for  free  rent incentives  for  six months  and rent
escalation over the ten-year period. The Partnership recognizes rent expense  on
a  straight-line basis  and recorded the  related deferred rent  as a noncurrent
liability to be amortized as an adjustment to rental costs over the life of  the
lease.

4.  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION:

    One  of the Partnerships leases equipment under capital lease agreements. At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, the amount of such equipment  included
in  property, plant and equipment is  $3,645,000 and $3,324,000 less accumulated
amortization of $2,356,000 and $1,914,000. Future minimum annual lease  payments
on noncancellable capital leases are as follows:

5.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

    Certain  affiliates of these cellular  limited partnerships provide services
for the system  operations, legal, financial,  management and administration  of
these  entities. These affiliates  are reimbursed for  both direct and allocated
costs (totaling $57.6 million in 1994,  $57.1 million in 1993 and $52.2  million
in  1992) related to  providing these services.  In addition, certain affiliates
have established a credit facility with certain partnerships to provide  working
capital   to  the  partnership.  One  of  the  partnerships  participates  in  a
centralized cash management  arrangement with its  general partner. At  December
31, 1994

                                                                              43

and  1993, the interest-bearing balance amounted to $16,016,000 and $29,981,000,
respectively. Effective January 1, 1989, the general partner pays or charges the
Partnership monthly  interest,  computed  using the  general  partner's  average
borrowing  rate, on the amounts due to  or from the Partnership. Interest earned
in 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $1,480,000, $1,294,000 and $1,396,000, respectively.

6.  REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS:

    On December 21,  1993, the California  Public Utilities Commission  ("CPUC")
adopted  a new  Order Instituting  Investigation into  the regulation  of mobile
telephone service  and wireless  communications, Order  Number I.93-12-007.  The
investigation  proposes a regulatory program which  would encompass all forms of
mobile telephone service.

    On August  22, 1994,  the CPUC  issued an  interim Decision  that imposes  a
methodology  in  which  existing  cellular  carriers  be  subject  to  rate  cap
regulation and  other  regulations, and  requiring  carriers, upon  request,  to
permit  resellers to  operate reseller  switches interconnected  to the cellular
carrier's facilities,  to unbundle  cellular access  charges to  resellers on  a
market  basis and to subsidize resellers' roaming revenues. The Decision further
authorized  the  CPUC  to  file  a  petition  with  the  Federal  Communications
Commission  ("FCC") to extend the CPUC's jurisdiction over cellular carriers for
at least 18 months. Application for  Rehearing and Suspension has been filed  by
various   carriers  and  is  pending  with  the  CPUC.  Currently,  one  of  the
Partnerships is  unable to  quantify the  precise impact  of this  Order on  its
future  operations, but that impact  may be material to  one of the Partnerships
under certain circumstances.

    In 1993, Congress amended Section 332 of the Communications Act in order to,
among other things, mandate a general federal preemption of state regulation  of
entry and rates for cellular service providers. Congress established a mechanism
for states to petition for permission to continue whatever state rate regulation
actually  existed as of June 1, 1993 for a period of time. It also established a
mechanism for those states  that wanted to petition  for the right to  establish
new  or modified rate regulations. On August  8, 1994, the CPUC filed a petition
with the FCC seeking to retain regulatory authority over cellular service  rates
in  California. In September  1994, opposition to this  petition was filed. This
matter is pending with the FCC.

    In January 1992, the CPUC commenced a separate investigation of all cellular
companies operating  in the  State to  determine their  compliance with  General
Order  number  159 (G.O.  159).  This investigation  addresses  whether cellular
utilities have complied with local,  state or federal regulations governing  the
approval  and construction of cellular  sites in the State.  The CPUC may advise
other agencies of violations in their jurisdictions. Currently, certain carriers
have agreed to monetary settlements as a result of this investigation.

    One of the Partnerships has prepared and filed the information requested  by
the  CPUC.  The  CPUC  will  review  the  information  provided  by  one  of the
Partnerships and, if violations of G.O.  159 are found, it may assess  penalties
against  one of the Partnerships. The outcome of this investigation is uncertain
and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made.

7.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS:

    One of the Partnerships  filed for its 10-year  license renewal for the  Los
Angeles  market on August 30, 1993. The  Partnership had been operating with FCC
authority while  the  renewal application  was  pending. In  January  1995,  the
Partnership's license was renewed for a 10-year period.

    In  two separate actions filed,  on October 7, 1993,  and February 15, 1994,
now consolidated, two  agents of  the competing carrier  have named  one of  the
Partnerships  as  a defendant.  The  general allegations  include  violations of
California Unfair  Practices  Act  and  price  fixing.  At  a  recent  mandatory
settlement  conference, plaintiffs asked  for $6 million  from all defendants to
settle the above claims ($2.5 million from one of the defendants, including  the
Partnership). The proposed settlement offer has

not been accepted. The ultimate outcome of both of these actions is uncertain at
this  time. Accordingly, no  accrual for these contingencies  has been made. The
Partnership intends to defend its position vigorously.

    In May 1994, several former and current agents of the competing carrier have
named one of the Partnerships in only one cause of action. This cause of  action
alleges  a conspiracy with the  competing carrier to fix  the prices of cellular
service in violation of state antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are seeking damages
in excess of  $100,000 for each  of the  plaintiff agents. The  outcome of  this
matter  is  uncertain  and, accordingly,  the  Partnership has  not  recorded an
accrual. The Partnership intends to defend its position vigorously.

    On November 24, 1993, October 17, 1994 and November 30, 1994, three separate
class  action  (not  yet  certified)  suits  were  filed  against  one  of   the
Partnerships  alleging conspiracy with  a competing carrier to  fix the price of
cellular  service  in  violation  of  state  and  federal  antitrust  laws.  The
plaintiffs  are seeking  injunctive relief  and substantial  monetary damages in
excess of $100 million before trebling. The outcome of this matter is  uncertain
and,  accordingly, the Partnership has not  recorded an accrual. The Partnership
intends to defend its position vigorously.

    On July 18, 1994,  a partner in  one of the Partnerships  was served with  a
class  action (not yet certified) suit on behalf of the Partnership's authorized
agents. The complaint alleges "predatory practices" and seeks damages in  excess
of  $1.6 million per agent,  plus statutory treble damages.  The outcome of this
matter is  uncertain  and, accordingly,  the  Partnership has  not  recorded  an
accrual. The Partnership intends to defend its position vigorously.

    In  January 1995, the United States  Department of Justice asserted that one
of the partners' parent company, including the Partnership, is a "successor"  to
a  Bell Operating Company and  bound by Section II  of the Modification of Final
Judgment entered  in 1984  in  the AT&T  divestiture  case. Section  II  imposes
certain   restrictions   relating   to   interexchange   telecommunications  and
telecommunications equipment manufacturing, among  other things. A Complaint  in
Intervention  has been  filed and is  still pending. A  standstill agreement has
been entered into which enables one  of the partners' parent company,  including
the  Partnership, to  operate as  is. In the  event of  an adverse  order in the
Complaint in Intervention proceeding, management does not expect that the impact
would be material to the Partnership's  current operations. The outcome of  this
matter  is  uncertain  and, accordingly,  the  Partnership has  not  recorded an
accrual. The Partnership intends to defend its position vigorously.

    One of the Partnerships is a party to various other lawsuits arising in  the
ordinary  course of business. In the opinion of management, based on a review of
such litigation with legal counsel, any losses resulting from these actions  are
not expected to materially impact the financial condition of the Partnership.

    Two   of  the  Partnerships  provide  cellular  service  and  sell  cellular
telephones to diversified groups  of consumers within concentrated  geographical
areas.  The  general partner  performs credit  evaluations of  the Partnerships'
customers and generally does not  require collateral. Receivables are  generally
due  within  30  days.  Credit  losses related  to  customers  have  been within
management's expectations.

    One of the Partnerships  purchases substantially all  of its equipment  from
one supplier.

    The  General Partner of two of the Partnerships entered into agreements with
an equipment vendor on behalf of  the Partnerships to replace the  Partnerships'
cellular  equipment with new cellular technology  which will support both analog
and digital  voice  transmissions. Prior  to  replacement the  Partnerships  are
renting  certain cellular equipment in order to meet demands relating to current
market growth.

                                                                              45

     A.   The Company and Lender entered into that certain Term Loan Agreement
dated as of October 1, 1991 (the "1991 LOAN AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which

     thereto (the "1991 CONSTRUCTION NOTE"); and

          3.  That certain Equipment Note executed by the Company, payable to
     the Lender, dated as of October 1, 1991, in the original principal amount
     of Twenty-Six Million Dollars ($26,000,000), plus Capitalized Interest (as

     C.   The Company has or intends to have ownership interests, either
directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or affiliates of the Company, in
certain corporate or partnership entities, each of which has obtained or will
obtain authorization from the Federal Communications Commission to construct and
operate a cellular radio communication system in either a Rural Service Area or
a Metropolitan Statistical Area (collectively, the "GENERAL MARKET ENTITIES"),
and the Loans under the 1991 Loan Agreement were made to permit the Company to
make secured loans to certain of the General Market Entities for the
construction and operation of their respective cellular radio communications
systems.

<PAGE>


     D.   Pursuant to the 1991 Loan Agreement, the Lender and the Company
executed that certain Security Agreement and Assignment of Contracts dated as of
October 1, 1991 (the "1991 SECURITY AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which the Company
delivered to Lender thirty-seven (37) Market Entity Loan Packages (as defined in
the 1991 Security Agreement), for the Market Entities described on SCHEDULE 1
hereto (the "EXISTING MARKET ENTITIES").

     E.   Pursuant to the 1991 Loan Agreement, the Company and Lender also
executed and delivered various other Loan Documents, as defined therein.

and Capitalized Interest (as defined in the 1991 Loan Agreement) in the amount
of Three Million Three Hundred Fifteen Thousand Six Hundred Fifty-Nine Dollars
and Twenty Cents ($3,315,659.20) has been added to such principal.

     G.   The Company has requested that Lender agree to extend to the Company
additional credit of up to Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) for the
purpose of allowing the Company to advance funds to the Existing Market Entities
and other subsidiaries and affiliates to be identified pursuant to this
Agreement (the "FUTURE MARKET ENTITIES"), to allow such Existing Market Entities
and Future Market Entities to acquire funds for the construction and operation
of their respective cellular radio communications systems.

     H.   The Lender entered into various financing transactions with certain of
the Company's affiliates, each involving the Company as a limited guarantor, all
as referenced on SCHEDULE 2 hereto (the "DIRECT LOAN TRANSACTIONS"). The Company
and the operating entities involved in such transactions, as listed on SCHEDULE
2 hereto (the "DIRECT LOAN ENTITIES") have notified Lender of the intended
prepayment by the Direct Loan Entities of all amounts outstanding under the
Direct Loan Transactions, and the Company has requested that Lender, upon such
payment, lend pursuant to this Agreement additional funds in an aggregate amount
equal to the principal amount so paid.

all amounts outstanding under the CA-1 Loan Agreement, and the Company has
requested that Lender, upon such payment, lend pursuant to

                                        2
<PAGE>
this Agreement additional funds in an aggregate amount equal to the principal
amount so paid, to refinance the loans made to Randolph Cellular by Lender.

     J.   Lender is willing to extend additional credit to the Company for such
purposes, but only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     K.   The Company and Lender wish to amend and restate the 1991 Loan
Agreement, to evidence the existing Loans as well as the additional credit to be
extended to the Company by the Lender, and for the convenience of the parties.

     mortgage releases in connection with the liens created or evidenced
     thereby.

     SECTION 2.2   NOTES AND PAYMENT TERMS.

          (a) REFINANCING NOTE. The Refinancing Loan is evidenced by the
     Refinancing Note.

          (b) CONSTRUCTION NOTE AND EQUIPMENT NOTE. The Equipment Loan and the
     Construction Loan, respectively, shall be evidenced by the Equipment Note
     and the Construction Note, respectively. Each such Note shall be executed
     by the Company, payable to the order of Lender, and shall evidence the
     obligation of the Company to repay all principal amounts advanced under or
     pursuant to the Loan evidenced by such Note, together with interest and
     all other amounts due thereunder. Each Advance (other than an Advance for
     Capitalized Interest) under the Equipment Loan or the Construction Loan
     shall also be evidenced by an appropriate Note Schedule, each
     substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A-4 hereto, each of which will
     evidence the applicable Advance. The 1994 Construction Note and the 1994
     Equipment Note shall each (i) be dated the Amendment Date; (ii) have a
     stated maturity that is the Final Maturity Date; and (iii) bear interest
     at the Base Rate from the date of each Advance until the Note or any
     amount thereunder is paid in full (whether on any Maturity Date, on the
     Final Maturity Date, by acceleration, upon Required Prepayment, or
     otherwise). Each Note Schedule shall be executed by the Company and shall
     designate the applicable Borrowing Date for the applicable Advance, the
     applicable Maturity Date for the applicable Advance and the principal
     amount of such

                                       18
<PAGE>
     Advance. All Note Schedules, and all other schedules attached to any Note,
     shall be deemed a part thereof. Any such Note Schedule or other schedule
     may be amended by Lender from time to time to reflect changes in the
     amounts that may be included thereon, but the failure to amend any Note
     Schedule or other schedule shall not diminish the obligation of Company to
     repay all amounts due hereunder or on any Note.

          (c) LOAN D. The Advance under Loan D shall be evidenced by a separate
     promissory note, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A-5 hereto ("NOTE
     D"), in the principal amount equal to the aggregate of all principal
     amounts outstanding in respect of the Direct Loan Transactions on the
     Borrowing Date for Loan D, and paid by the Direct Loan Entities on the
     Borrowing Date for Loan D. The current amounts outstanding in respect of
     the Direct Loan Transactions are set forth on SCHEDULE 2 hereto, and
     adjustments will be made as necessary to reflect payments made thereon
     before the applicable Borrowing Date. Note D shall (i) be dated the
     Borrowing Date for Note D, (ii) have a stated maturity of February 1,
     1996, (iii) bear interest at the Base Rate from the date thereof until
     Note D or any amount thereunder is paid in full (whether on any maturity
     date, by acceleration, on Required Prepayment or otherwise.)

          (d) LOAN E. The Advance under Loan E shall be evidenced by a separate
     promissory note, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A-6 hereto ("NOTE
     E"), in the principal amount equal to the aggregate of all principal
     amounts outstanding in respect of the CA-1 Loan Agreement, and paid by
     California-1 on the Borrowing Date for Loan E. The current amounts
     outstanding in respect of the CA-1 Loan Agreement are set forth on
     SCHEDULE 2 hereto, and adjustments will be made as necessary to reflect
     payments made thereon before the applicable Borrowing Date. Note E shall
     (i) be dated the Borrowing Date for Loan E, (ii) have a stated maturity
     that is January 31, 1999, (iii) bear interest at the Base Rate from the
     date thereof until Note E or any amount thereunder is paid in full
     (whether on any maturity date, by acceleration, on Required Prepayment or
     otherwise.)

          (e) INTEREST PAYMENTS. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount
     outstanding on each Note at the applicable Base Rate and shall be payable
     as follows:

              (i)  For the Equipment Note and the Construction Note, interest
          shall accrue on all Advances thereunder during the Capitalized
          Interest Period, and the amount of accrued interest each month (up to
          a maximum aggregate of $6,750,000 for the 1994 Equipment Note and the
          1994 Construction Note) shall be capitalized by Lender and added to
          the principal amount of the appropriate Note unless the Company elects
          in writing by the fifteenth (15th) day of any month during the
          Capitalized Interest Period to pay accrued interest with respect to
          any Advance for such month on or before the first Business Day of the
          following month. The capitalization of such accrued interest shall be
          deemed to be an Advance hereunder, except that all Capitalized
          Interest shall be added to the principal amount of the applicable
          Advance, and shall not have a separate payment term.

                                       19
<PAGE>
          After an aggregate of $6,750,000 in Capitalized Interest has been
          added to the 1994 Construction Note and the 1994 Equipment Note, the
          Company shall thereafter pay accrued interest on both the 1994
          Construction Note and the 1994 Equipment Note, in arrears, on the
          first Business Day of each month, during the balance of the
          Capitalized Interest Period.

              (ii)      Following the expiration of the Capitalized Interest
          Period, accrued interest on each Advance (including Capitalized
          Interest on such Advance) under the Equipment Note or the Construction
          Note shall be paid on each Payment Date, along with the principal
          payments described below.

              (iii)  Interest on the Refinancing Note and each of the New Notes
          shall not be capitalized, but shall be payable on each Payment Date.

          (f) PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. The outstanding principal of each of the
     Notes shall be paid as follows:

              (i)  Principal payments on the Refinancing Note shall be paid in
          eighty-four (84) equal monthly installments of principal payable on
          the Initial Payment Date and on each Payment Date thereafter until the
          Maturity Date, when all principal, interest, charges and other amounts
          outstanding under the Refinancing Note shall be due and payable.

              (ii)      Commencing on the Initial Payment Date for each Advance
          under the 1991 Equipment Note or the 1991 Construction Note, and on
          the first Business Day of each successive calendar month thereafter
          until the Maturity Date for such Advance, subject to the provisions of
          Section 2.4 hereof, all amounts due with respect to such Advance
          (including any Capitalized Interest on such Advance), and all charges,
          if any, shall be payable in eighty-four (84) equal consecutive monthly
          installments of principal. In addition, the Company shall pay on each
          Payment Date all accrued but unpaid interest, as set forth above. In
          any event, the entire outstanding principal amount of each Advance
          (including Capitalized Interest) under the 1991 Construction Note or
          the 1991 Equipment Note and all accrued but unpaid interest and all
          other amounts due thereunder shall be paid on the Maturity Date for
          such Advance, and all amounts outstanding under the 1991 Construction
          Note or the 1991 Equipment Note (including all Capitalized Interest)
          shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date for such Note.

              (iii)     Commencing on the Initial Payment Date for each Advance
          under the 1994 Equipment Note or the 1994 Construction Note, and on
          the first Business Day of each successive calendar month thereafter
          until the Maturity Date for such Advance, subject to the provisions of
          Section 2.4 hereof, all amounts due with respect to such Advance
          (including any Capitalized Interest on such Advance), and all charges,
          if any, shall be payable in seventy-two (72) equal consecutive monthly

                                       20
<PAGE>
          installments of principal. In addition, the Company shall pay on each
          Payment Date all accrued but unpaid interest, as set forth above. In
          any event, the entire outstanding principal amount of each Advance
          (including Capitalized Interest) under the 1994 Construction Note or
          the 1994 Equipment Note and all accrued but unpaid interest and all
          other amounts due thereunder shall be paid on the Maturity Date for
          such Advance, and all amounts outstanding under the 1994 Construction
          Note or the 1994 Equipment Note (including all Capitalized Interest)
          shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date for such Note.

              (iv)      Principal payments on Note D shall be paid in equal
          monthly payments, payable on the Initial Payment Date and on each
          Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date for Note D, when all
          principal, interest, charges and other amounts outstanding under Note
          D shall be due and payable.

              (v)       Principal payments on Note E shall be paid in equal
          monthly payments, payable on the Initial Payment Date and on each
          Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date for Note E, when all
          principal, interest, charges and other amounts outstanding under Note
          E shall be due and payable.

          (g) LATE PAYMENTS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company
     shall fail to pay within ten (10) days after when due any principal amount
     or interest or other amount payable under this Agreement or under any
     Note, such amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum that is equal to
     the lesser of (i) three percent (3%) higher than the then applicable Base
     Rate or (ii) the maximum permissible rate under applicable law, from the
     due date until such overdue principal amount, interest or other amount is
     paid in full (both before and after judgment) whether or not any notice of
     default in the payment thereof has been delivered under this Agreement.
     Interest shall be computed in accordance with this Section 2.2 and Section
     2.5 hereof.

          (h) EXCESS INTEREST. Notwithstanding any provision of any Note, this
     Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, it is the intent of
     Lender and Company, that Lender or any subsequent holder of any Note shall
     never be entitled to receive, collect, reserve or apply, as interest, any
     amount in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged
     by applicable law, as amended or enacted from time to time. In the event
     Lender, or any subsequent holder of any Note, ever receives, collects,
     reserves or applies, as interest, any such excess, such amount which would
     be excessive interest shall be deemed a partial prepayment of principal
     and treated as such, or, if the principal indebtedness and all other
     amounts due are paid in full, any remaining excess funds shall immediately
     be applied to any other outstanding indebtedness of Company due to Lender,
     and if none is outstanding, shall be paid to Company. In determining
     whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific
     contingency, exceeds the highest lawful rate, Company and Lender shall, to
     the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (a) exclude voluntary
     prepayments and the effects thereof as it may relate to any fees charged
     by Lender, and (b) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread, in equal
     parts, the total amount

                                       21
<PAGE>
     of interest throughout the entire term of the indebtedness; PROVIDED that
     if the indebtedness is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the
     full contemplated term hereof, and if the interest received for the actual
     period of existence hereof exceeds the maximum lawful rate, Lender or any
     subsequent holder of any Note shall refund to Company the amount of such
     excess or credit the amount of such excess against the principal portion
     of the indebtedness, as of the date it was received, and, in such event,
     Lender shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for
     contracting for, charging, reserving or receiving interest in excess of
     the maximum lawful rate.

     SECTION 2.3   PROCEDURE FOR BORROWING.

          (a) REFINANCING LOAN. The one Advance under the Refinancing Loan was
     made by Lender on January 1, 1992.

          (b) EQUIPMENT LOAN AND CONSTRUCTION LOAN. For Advances (other than
     Advances for Capitalized Interest) under the Equipment Loan or the
     Construction Loan, the Company shall give the Lender at least seven
     Business Days' written notice of its intention to borrow pursuant to the
     Commitment by issuing and delivering to the Lender a Borrowing Certificate
     substantially in the form of  EXHIBIT B-1 OR B-2 hereto, as applicable,
     specifying (i) the Business Day on which such Advance is to be made, (ii)
     the account to which the funds are to be transmitted, and (iii) the amount
     of the proposed Advance. Each Borrowing Certificate shall have attached
     thereto copies of the applicable invoices or a transaction summary
     reflecting payments made by the Company and such other supporting
     documentation as Lender may reasonably require, including without
     limitation, for Advances made on or after the Amendment Date, copies of
     general ledger entries reflecting that the Collateral Value for a Market
     Entity is equal to or greater than the outstanding principal amount of the
     applicable Market Entity Note. Not later than 12:00 p.m., Nashville time,
     on the Borrowing Date specified in the Borrowing Certificate, if all
     conditions for the requested Advance are met, the Lender shall initiate
     the transmission of the requested Advance by wire transfer of immediately
     available funds to the account specified in such Borrowing Certificate.
     Advances (other than Advances for Capitalized Interest) shall be made only
     on the last Business Day of each Calendar Quarter, except for the first
     Advance to be made under the Construction Loan or the Equipment Loan, and
     each Advance other than the last Advance hereunder shall be in an
     aggregate principal amount of not less than $100,000.

          (c) LOAN D AND LOAN E. The one Advance in respect of each of Loan D
     and Loan E shall be made by Lender on the first Borrowing Date on which
     all conditions for such Advance have been met. (The parties anticipate
     that the Advances for each of Note D and Note E will be made by March 31,
     1995.) For the Advance under each of Note D and Note E, the Company shall
     give the Lender at least seven Business Days' written notice of the
     proposed Borrowing Date, by issuing and delivering to the Lender Borrowing
     Certificates substantially in the form of EXHIBIT B-3 hereto, as
     applicable, specifying (i) the Business Day on which such Advance is to be
     made, (ii) the account

                                       22
<PAGE>
     to which the funds are to be transmitted, and (iii) the amount of the
     proposed Advance. The Borrowing Certificate for Note D shall have attached
     thereto copies of general ledger entries reflecting that the Collateral
     Value for the Market Entity is equal to or greater than the outstanding
     principal amount of the applicable Market Entity Note, and such other
     supporting documentation as Lender may reasonably require. Not later than
     12:00 p.m., Nashville time, on the Borrowing Date specified in the
     Borrowing Certificate, if all conditions for the requested Advance are
     met, the Lender shall initiate the transmission of the requested Advance
     by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified
     in such Borrowing Certificate.

     SECTION 2.4   PREPAYMENTS.

          (a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Company shall be permitted to prepay
     the Loans, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, at any time,
     in any amount.

          (b) REQUIRED PREPAYMENTS. The following prepayments shall be required
     (the "REQUIRED PREPAYMENTS"):(i) if the Company or USCOC should terminate
     the Supply Agreement or the Letter Agreement except for reasonable cause
     pursuant to the terms thereof at any time prior to the earlier of (a) the
     satisfaction of the obligations of the Company to purchase, or cause the
     purchase of, NTI Equipment with an aggregate purchase price of at least
     $37,500,000 under the Letter Agreement, or (b) the Financing Termination
     Date (except as such Financing Termination Date might exist solely because
     of such termination), the Company shall immediately prepay the outstanding
     principal amount of all of the Loans evidenced by the 1994 Construction
     Note and the 1994 Equipment Note, on demand, together with accrued and
     unpaid interest thereon to the date of prepayment; and (ii) if the Company
     has not otherwise complied with the requirements of Section 7.4 hereof,
     the Company shall make prepayments to Lender in the amounts, if any,
     required by Section 7.4 hereof.

          (c) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS. Principal amounts prepaid (i)
     pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i) hereof shall be applied to the outstanding
     balance of each of the 1994 Construction Note and the 1994 Equipment Note
     on a pro rata basis, (ii) pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(ii) or 7.3 hereof
     shall be applied to the outstanding balance of each Note (other than the
     Refinancing Note) on a pro rata basis, and (iii) pursuant to Section
     2.4(a) hereof shall be applied to the outstanding balance of each Note on
     a pro rata basis. After any prepayment hereunder, the remaining
     installments of outstanding principal due under each applicable Note shall
     be recalculated and any invoices delivered to the Company by the Lender
     shall incorporate a revised repayment schedule to reflect such
     recalculation.

     SECTION 2.5   COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual days elapsed.

     SECTION 2.6   PAYMENTS. All payments (including prepayments) by the
Company on account of principal, interest and other charges shall be made
without setoff or counterclaim to

                                       23
<PAGE>
the Lender at the office of the Lender referred to in Section 9.2 hereof in
lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds.
If any payment hereunder or on any Note becomes due and payable on a day other
than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.

     SECTION 2.7   USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loans evidenced by the
Equipment Note and the Construction Note shall be used by the Company to make
loans to the Market Entities, secured by the applicable Market Entity
Collateral, in the respective amounts described in Section 2.1 hereof, and to
pay Capitalized Interest pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. Except as described
below in this Section 2.7, the Market Entity Loans made by the Company with the
proceeds of the Loans evidenced by the Construction Note shall be used to
finance or refinance the direct construction costs (including engineering,
purchase and installation) of the System of each Market Entity, and the Market
Entity Loans made by the Company with the proceeds of the Loans evidenced by the
Equipment Note shall be used to finance or refinance the acquisition of the NTI
Equipment for the System of each Market Entity pursuant to the Supply Agreement,
all as described in Section 2.1(b) and (c) hereof, respectively. The amount of
each Market Entity Loan made with the proceeds of the Loans evidenced by the
1994 Construction Note shall be limited to the amount of such direct
construction costs paid by or on behalf of such Market Entity, or for which such
Market Entity became liable, after January 1, 1991. The amount of each Market
Entity Loan made with the proceeds of the Loans evidenced by the 1994 Equipment
Note shall be limited to the amount of such NTI Equipment acquisition costs paid
by or on behalf of such Market Entity, or for which such Market Entity became
liable, after January 1, 1993. Each Market Entity Loan made with the proceeds of
the 1994 Equipment Note or the 1994 Construction Note may be used to finance or
refinance such costs, or, if the Collateral Value for a Market Entity is equal
to or greater than the outstanding principal amount of the applicable Market
Entity Note, for such Market Entity's general business purposes.  The proceeds
of the Loans evidenced by the Refinancing Note have been used to repay and
retire the Interim Notes. The proceeds of Advances made in respect of Loan D
shall be used to provide funds to the applicable Market Entity for general
business purposes, by means of a Market Entity Loan, secured by the applicable
Market Entity Collateral. The proceeds of Loan E shall be used to refinance the
loans originally made by Lender to Randolph Cellular, and assumed by California-
1 under the CA-1 Loan Agreement, by means of a Market Entity Loan to California-
1, secured by the California-1 Market Entity Collateral.


                    ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     In order to induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make the

its property, to lease its leased property and to conduct the business in which

with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply
therewith could not, in the aggregate, have a  material adverse effect on the
business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company (in each
case, taken as a whole), and could not materially adversely affect the ability
of the Company to perform its obligations under any Basic Agreement or the
Letter Agreement;  and (d) is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions
where the Company's ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified could not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company (in each
case, taken as a whole), and could not materially adversely affect the ability
of the Company to perform its obligations under any Basic Agreement or the
Letter Agreement.

     SECTION 3.3   POWER; AUTHORIZATION. The Company has the power and
authority and the legal right to make, deliver and perform the Basic Agreements
and to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize the

authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Basic Agreements and
the Letter Agreement, except for the necessity of obtaining such consents,
licenses and approvals as are specifically set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3 hereto (the
"REQUIRED CONSENTS"). Other than the Required Consents, no consent or
authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of the FCC, the PUC
or any other Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in
connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery,
performance, validity or enforceability of any Basic Agreement or the Letter
Agreement, except where the failure to meet such requirements could not, in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or
financial condition of the Company (in each case, taken as a whole), and could
not materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under any Basic Agreement or the Letter Agreement.

     SECTION 3.4   ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each Basic Agreement has been, or
on the First Borrowing Date or the applicable Borrowing Date will be, duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Company, and each Basic Agreement
constitutes, or when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to (i) the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether

                                       25
<PAGE>
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) limitations on
enforceability under certain circumstances of provisions indemnifying a party
against liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts imposed by public
policy relating thereto.

     SECTION 3.5   NO LEGAL BAR.  The execution, delivery and performance of
the Basic Agreements and the Letter Agreement, the borrowings hereunder, and the
use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or any
Contractual Obligation of the Company, except to the extent such violations, in
the aggregate, could not have a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
operations, assets or financial condition of the Company (in each case, taken as
a whole), or (ii) the Company's ability to perform its obligations under any
Basic Agreement or the Letter Agreement, and will not result in, or require, the
creation or imposition of any material Lien on the Collateral pursuant to any
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation other than pursuant to the Security
Agreement or the Assignments, except as otherwise permitted by Section 6.2
hereof.

     SECTION 3.6   NO MATERIAL LITIGATION. As of the Amendment Date, except as

Responsible Officer of the Company, threatened by or against the Company or
against any of its properties or revenues (i) with respect to any of the Basic
Agreements or the Letter Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby, or (ii) which, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company
(in each case, taken as a whole).

     the same time such notice is given to the Securities and Exchange
     Commission; and

          (c) of any payment default under any of the Market Entity Loan
     Documents that continues for thirty (30) calendar days.

reasonably result in any liability that is material to the Company, (ii) any
funding deficiency with respect to any Plan that may reasonably result in any
liability that is material to the Company, (iii) any liability, either primary
or secondary, with respect to complete or partial withdrawal from any Plan that
is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA that
may reasonably result in liability that is material to the Company, (iv)
proceedings to terminate any Plan under Section 4041(c) or 4042 of ERISA that
could result in any liability of the Company or any Affiliate that may
reasonably be material to the Company or (v) the appointment of a trustee for
any Plan in any case that may reasonably result in liability that is material to
the Company. Such notice shall be accompanied by any pertinent documents
including, but not limited to, the relevant notice, correspondence or other
communication and a statement of a Responsible Officer of the Company describing

     SECTION 6.3   LIMITATION ON CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. Create, incur, assume
or suffer to exist any Contingent Obligation except agreements by the Company to
repurchase any accounts receivable or as otherwise permitted under Section 6.1

outstanding at any one time.

     SECTION 6.6   LIMITATION ON DISTRIBUTIONS. Make any Restricted Payment to
any shareholder of the Company, except that, as long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred

                                       37
<PAGE>
and is then continuing, the Company may make distributions to its shareholders
in amounts that would not cause the Company to be in violation of any of
Sections 5.9 or 5.10 hereof and would not cause the Company's Equity to be less
than the sum of (i) all principal amounts outstanding under the Notes, and (ii)
the amounts of all Advances hereunder for which Borrowing Certificates have then
been submitted to Lender (each, an "ELIGIBLE DISTRIBUTION"). Before making any
Eligible Distribution at any time when the Company does not have positive
retained earnings, the Company shall deliver to the Lender a certificate of a
Responsible Officer of the Company (i) setting forth in detail the calculation
supporting the compliance by the Company with the applicable covenants, (both
before and after making such Restricted Payment); (ii) stating that no material
adverse change in the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the

amend, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive compliance with any of the
provisions of, the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or other
material agreements of the Company (other than the Supply Agreement), if such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company
(in each case, taken as a whole) or would otherwise materially and adversely
affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Basic Agreements or the
Letter Agreement.

     SECTION 6.8   TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF SUPPLY AGREEMENT OR LETTER
AGREEMENT. Prior to the earlier of (a) the satisfaction of the obligations of
the Company to purchase, or cause the purchase of, NTI Equipment with an
aggregate purchase price of at least $37,500,000 under the Letter Agreement, or
(b) the Financing Termination Date for the 1994 Notes (except as such Financing
Termination Date might exist solely because of such termination), terminate the
Supply Agreement or the Letter Agreement except for reasonable cause pursuant to
the terms thereof, or modify the Supply Agreement in any way that would cause a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under the Letter Agreement or the Basic Agreements.

     SECTION 6.9   MARKET ENTITY LOAN DOCUMENTS. Except as necessary in a
Permitted Combination under Section 7.5 hereof, terminate, amend, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive compliance with any of the provisions of any Market
Entity Loan Documents without the Lender's prior written consent or without
either substituting Collateral pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof or removing the
Market Entity pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof, if as a consequence thereof the
Collateral Value, taken as a whole, would be materially and adversely affected.

     SECTION 6.10  REGULATION U. Make any borrowing hereunder for the purpose

the business of extending credit to others for

                                       38
<PAGE>
such purpose, and no part of the proceeds of any borrowing hereunder will be
used to purchase or carry any "margin stock" or to extend credit to others for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock."


                              ARTICLE 7. COLLATERAL

     SECTION 7.1   COLLATERAL. The parties intend that the Company's
Obligations will be secured by (i) a valid, perfected, first-priority security
interest in all of the Company's rights, title and interest (but not its
obligations) arising under or out of the Market Entity Notes and the Market
Entity Loan Documents, all as more fully described in the Security Agreement and
Assignments, and (ii) an assignment of the Company's valid, perfected security
interest in the Market Entity Collateral of each Market Entity, as more fully
described in the Security Agreement and Assignments.

     SECTION 7.2   REPLACEMENT COLLATERAL. The Company shall be permitted to
substitute collateral relating to a General Market Entity for collateral
relating to an existing Market Entity as part of the Collateral only on the
following terms and conditions:

          (a) Upon the occurrence of a Default under Section 8.2 hereof, the
     Company may elect to cure such Default by providing Lender with a properly
     completed and executed Assignment (subject to Section 7.7 hereof, with all
     correct and complete attachments) and the rest of the Market Entity Loan
     Package with respect to one or more General Market Entities that are not
     already included in the Collateral ("REPLACEMENT MARKET ENTITY"), if (i)
     the Company has delivered to Lender within twenty (20) days following such
     Default, a duly executed Collateral Release Request with respect thereto;
     (ii) the Collateral Value for the Replacement Market Entity is equal to or
     greater than the outstanding principal amount of the Market Entity Note
     for such Replacement Market Entity; and (iii) the outstanding principal
     amount of the Market Entity Note for such Replacement Market Entity is
     equal to or greater than the outstanding principal amount of the Market
     Entity Note for the Market Entity being replaced (the "REPLACED MARKET
     ENTITY"). For purposes of comparing the respective outstanding principal
     amounts of Market Entity Notes for a Replacement Market Entity and a
     Replaced Market Entity, prepayment of the Market Entity Note for the
     Replaced Market Entity shall be permitted only in amounts that are not
     greater than corresponding prepayments made on account of the Notes,
     notwithstanding Section 7.4 hereof.

          (b) If no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
     the Company shall have the option at any time to substitute the collateral
     relating to one or more Replacement Market Entities for the Collateral
     relating to an existing Market Entity as part of the Collateral by
     providing Lender with a properly completed and executed Assignment
     (subject to Section 7.7 hereof, with all correct and complete attachments)
     and the rest of the Market Entity Loan Package with respect to the
     Replacement Market Entity, if (i) the Company delivers to Lender a duly
     executed Collateral Release Request;

                                       39
<PAGE>
     (ii) the Collateral Value for the Replacement Market Entity is equal to or
     greater than the outstanding principal amount of the Market Entity Note
     for such Replacement Market Entity; and (iii) the outstanding principal
     amount of the Market Entity Note for such Replacement Market Entity is
     equal to or greater than the outstanding principal amount of the Market
     Entity Note for the Replaced Market Entity. For purposes of comparing the
     respective outstanding principal amounts of Market Entity Notes for a
     Replacement Market Entity and a Replaced Market Entity, prepayment of the
     Market Entity Note for the Replaced Market Entity shall be permitted only
     in amounts that are not greater than corresponding prepayments made on
     account of the Notes, notwithstanding Section 7.4 hereof.

          (c) If the foregoing conditions are satisfied, then Lender shall
     accept the Collateral relating to the Replacement Market Entity as part of
     the Collateral and shall, within thirty (30) days after its acceptance of
     the last item necessary for such substitution, deliver to the Company the
     original Market Entity Note and Market Entity Loan Documents for the
     Replaced Market Entity, along with a duly executed UCC-3 form reassigning
     to the Company the Lender's security interest in the Market Entity Loan
     Collateral of the Replaced Market Entity.

     SECTION 7.3   PARTIAL RELEASE OF COLLATERAL. A Market Entity may be
removed from the scope of this Agreement and the Company may obtain a release of
Lender's liens on the portions of the Collateral relating to any particular
Market Entity on the following terms and conditions:

          (a) A Market Entity shall be removed from the scope of this Agreement
     if the Company delivers to the Lender (i) a certificate executed by a
     Responsible Officer of the Company stating (A) that the Market Entity Note
     of a particular Market Entity has been paid in full and the amount paid
     thereon, and (B) the amount of the Market Entity Note Shortfall
     immediately following such payment, and (ii) prepayment of the Obligations
     in the amount, if any, necessary to reduce the Market Entity Note
     Shortfall to $15,000,000 or less. The removal of the Market Entity from
     the scope of this Agreement shall be effective on the later of (x) the
     date such Market Entity Note is paid in full, or (y) the date of Lender's
     receipt of any such necessary prepayment of the Obligations.

          (b) A Market Entity shall be removed from the scope of this Agreement
     if the Company delivers to the Lender (i) a certificate executed by a
     Responsible Officer of the Company stating (A) that a particular Market
     Entity is being removed from the scope of this Agreement, and (B) the
     amount of the Market Entity Note Shortfall immediately following such
     removal, and (ii) prepayment of the Obligations in the amount, if any,
     necessary to reduce the Market Entity Note Shortfall to $15,000,000 or
     less. The removal of the Market Entity from the scope of this Agreement
     shall be effective on the later of (x) the date of Lender's receipt of
     such certificate, or (y) the date of Lender's receipt of any such
     necessary prepayment of the Obligations.

                                       40
<PAGE>
          (c) Within ten (10) days after the later of (i) the Lender's receipt
     of the certificate and any prepayment amount required under Section 7.3(a)
     or 7.3(b), as applicable, and (ii) the Company's delivery to Lender of a
     duly executed Collateral Release Request in connection with such Market
     Entity, and original UCC-3 forms prepared for Lender's signature, the
     Lender shall deliver to the Company the original Market Entity Note and
     Market Entity Loan Documents for such Market Entity, along with duly
     executed UCC-3 forms either (at the Company's option) terminating or
     reassigning to the Company the Lender's security interest in the Market
     Entity Loan Collateral of such Market Entity.

     SECTION 7.4   REQUIRED PREPAYMENT, ETC. UPON MARKET ENTITY SHORTFALL.

          (a) ACTION REQUIRED UPON MARKET ENTITY NOTE SHORTFALL.       If, as of
     the last day of any Calendar Quarter, the Market Entity Note Shortfall is
     greater than $15,000,000, the Company shall, on or before the last
     Business Day of the next Calendar Quarter, take any one of, or any
     combination of, the following actions as necessary to reduce the Market
     Entity Note Shortfall to $15,000,000 or less: (i) pay to Lender a portion
     of the Loans, for application to the Obligations in accordance with
     Section 2.4(c) hereof, (ii) make advances to Market Entities, (iii)
     substitute Collateral pursuant to Section 7.2(b) hereof, or (iv) provide
     Lender with a properly completed and executed Assignment (with all correct
     and complete attachments, subject to Section 7.7 hereof) and the rest of
     the Market Entity Loan Package for a General Market Entity that is not
     already included in the Collateral (a "SUPPLEMENTAL MARKET ENTITY").

          (b) SUBMISSION OF SUPPLEMENTAL OR REPLACEMENT MARKET ENTITY. For
     purposes of this Section 7.4, the Lender shall be deemed to have accepted
     the Collateral relating to a Supplemental Market Entity or a Replacement
     Market Entity as part of the Collateral as of the end of the tenth (10th)
     Business Day after Lender's receipt of any such Assignment (with all
     correct and complete attachments, subject to Section 7.7 hereof) and the
     rest of the Market Entity Loan Package with respect to a Supplemental
     Market Entity or Replacement Market Entity (with a Collateral Release
     Request, in the case of a Replacement Market Entity) (the "REVIEW
     PERIOD"), unless such Assignment and Market Entity Loan Package (and
     Collateral Release Request, in the case of a Replacement Market Entity)
     fail to satisfy the requirements of this Agreement and Lender delivers to
     the Company, prior to the end of the Review Period, a written notice
     identifying the particular requirements that are not satisfied. If Lender
     has so notified the Company prior to the end of the Review Period, the
     Company shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice (the
     "EXTENSION PERIOD") to satisfy the particular requirements identified in
     such notice or to otherwise satisfy the requirements of Section 7.4(a)
     above (in each case, taking into account any reduction in the Market
     Entity Note Shortfall resulting from Replacement Market Entities or
     Supplemental Market Entities accepted by Lender) before the Company shall
     be deemed to be in default with respect to its obligations under this
     Section 7.4. The Extension Period shall be extended for an additional
     thirty (30) days from the last day of the original Extension Period (the
     "ADDITIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD"),

                                       41
<PAGE>
     before the Company shall be deemed to be in default with respect to its
     obligations under this Section 7.4, if the Company delivers to the Lender
     within the original Extension Period a written notice setting forth (i)
     the reasons why the requirements identified in Lender's notice with
     respect to a Supplemental Market Entity or Replacement Market Entity
     cannot reasonably be met within the original Extension Period,
     notwithstanding the Company's commencement within the original Extension
     Period of action reasonably likely to meet such requirements, and (ii) the
     course of action that the Company proposes to take to meet such
     requirements. During such Additional Extension Period, the Company shall
     diligently pursue fulfilling the requirements set forth in Lender's
     original notice, and shall also be entitled to take any combination of the
     actions set forth in Section 7.4(a) to reduce the Market Entity Note
     Shortfall to $15,000,000 or less. During the Extension Period and the
     Additional Extension Period, Lender will accept additional Replacement
     Market Entities or Supplemental Market Entities on the same terms and
     conditions set forth above, except that any combination of a Review
     Period, Extension Period and/or Additional Extension Period for any such
     additional entity shall, in any event, terminate no later than the
     seventy-fourth (74th) day after the last Business Day of such next
     Calendar Quarter referred to in Section 7.4(a).

          (c) ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REGARDING COLLATERAL VALUE. For each
     Supplemental Market Entity or Replacement Market Entity submitted pursuant
     to Section 7.4(a) hereof, the Collateral Value shall be at least equal to
     the outstanding principal amount of the applicable Market Entity Note. For
     additional advances made by the Company to a Market Entity pursuant to
     Section 7.4(a)(ii), the Collateral Value for such Market Entity shall be
     at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of the applicable
     Market Entity Note after such advance.

          (d) DEFAULT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
     8.1(d) hereof, the Company's failure to satisfy timely its obligations
     under this Section 7.4 shall be deemed to be an Event of Default as of the
     last Business Day of the next Calendar Quarter, as described in Section
     7.4(a), or as of the end of the Extension Period (as it may be extended)
     as described in Section 7.4(b).

     SECTION 7.5    COMBINATION OF MARKETS.

          (a) The Company may at any time, if no Event of Default has occurred
     and is continuing, permit or suffer any one or more Market Entities (each,
     a "PREDECESSOR MARKET ENTITY") to enter into any transaction of merger or
     consolidation or amalgamation or restructuring, or to liquidate, windup or
     dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution), or to convey,
     sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
     all of its property, business or assets whether now owned or hereafter
     acquired, without the Lender's prior written consent, if, after giving
     effect to any of the foregoing, (i) a General Market Entity is the
     surviving entity or transferee, as applicable, (ii) such General Market
     Entity owns the assets of such Predecessor Market Entity (subject to the
     security interests granted by such Predecessor Market Entity to the

                                       42
<PAGE>
     Company and assigned to the Lender, but free of any other Liens except for
     Permitted Liens) and holds each FCC License previously held by such
     Predecessor Market Entity except for any such FCC License for an Excluded
     Market, (iii) the Company has delivered to Lender the documents and items
     described in Section 7.5(b) below, as required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
     any disposition of Collateral or Market Entity Collateral in connection
     with any of the foregoing transactions shall not be deemed to have been
     "authorized" within the meaning of Section 9-306(b) of the Code (as
     defined in the Security Agreement). (Any such transaction consummated in
     accordance with this Section 7.5 shall be referred to as a "PERMITTED
     COMBINATION", and any such General Market Entity resulting from a
     Permitted Combination shall be referred to as a "COMBINED MARKET ENTITY").

          (b) The Company shall have delivered to Lender each of the following:
     (i) a written summary of the proposed Permitted Combination, identifying
     the various entities involved and the structure of the transaction(s) at
     issue, including without limitation identification of any Excluded Markets
     by FCC designation and by county location and identification of each of
     the FCC Licenses, Predecessor Market Entities, Market Entities, General
     Market Entities and other entities involved in, or to be created by, such
     transaction(s); (ii) an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of
     EXHIBIT I hereto, executed by the Company and the Combined Market Entity
     with respect to any Market Entity Loan Documents to which such Combined
     Market Entity is not already a named party; (iii) acknowledgment copies of
     UCC-3 amendments and UCC-1 financing statements (executed by such Combined
     Market Entity and, if necessary, by Lender), in proper form, filed in all
     offices necessary to perfect, or continue the perfection of, the security
     interests in the related Market Entity Collateral granted to the Company
     and assigned to the Lender, including without limitation any additional
     fixture filings and new filings or amendments to evidence any change of
     name or structure; (iv) current tax lien and judgment lien searches and
     UCC-11 searches in all such offices, in the names of the Predecessor
     Market Entity and in the name of the Combined Market Entity and other
     entities involved; and (v) copies of the articles of incorporation, by-
     laws, partnership agreement or other organizational documents of the
     Combined Market Entity and appropriate resolutions or other evidence of
     the approval or authorization by the Combined Market Entity of such
     Assumption Agreement and the actions contemplated thereby.

          (c) If such Combined Market Entity is a Partially Financed Market
     Entity, Lender hereby consents to any amendments or modifications to the
     Market Entity Loan Documents executed or assumed by such Combined Market
     Entity that are necessary to conform the Market Entity Loan Package for
     such Combined Market Entity to the form of Market Entity Loan Package for
     a Partially Financed Market Entity. In addition, Lender shall execute such
     UCC-3 amendments and UCC-3 releases as are necessary to conform the Market
     Entity Loan Package for such Combined Market Entity to the form of Market
     Entity Loan Package for a Partially Financed Market Entity, within thirty
     (30) days after

                                       43
<PAGE>
     its receipt of such appropriate UCC-3's and a written request for
     execution thereof from the Company.

     SECTION 7.6   PRIORITY ISSUES. This Section 7.6 is intended to clarify the
Company's position with respect to the Collateral and the Market Entity
Collateral, and shall control in case of conflict with any other representations
and warranties made by the Company in any of the Loan Documents.

          (a) COLLATERAL IN GENERAL. In various provisions of the Basic
     Agreements, the Company makes representations, warranties and covenants to
     Lender that the security interest granted by the Company in each Market
     Entity Note and in the Company's accounts, general intangibles and rights
     to payment, in each case arising from the Market Entity Loan Documents for
     each Market Entity (excluding the Market Entity Loan Collateral), shall
     be, at the time of the Company's execution and delivery to Lender of the
     applicable Assignment and when the Lender has given "value," as defined in
     Section 1-201 of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code, a valid,
     perfected, first-priority security interest, subject to no other liens,
     claims or encumbrances, except for Permitted Liens and as set forth in
     Section 7.6(b) hereof. These representations, warranties and covenants,
     after the first such representation or warranty with respect to the
     Collateral described in this Section 7.6(a) relating to any particular
     Market Entity, are deemed to exclude any non-consensual liens on such
     Collateral.

          (b) MARKET ENTITY COLLATERAL. With respect to the Market Entity
     Collateral, in various provisions of the Basic Agreements, the Company
     makes representations, warranties and covenants to Lender that, upon the
     Company's execution and delivery to Lender of the applicable Assignment,
     and when the Lender has given "value," as defined in Section 1-201 of the
     applicable Uniform Commercial Code, the Company shall have, and shall have
     validly assigned to Lender, a valid, perfected security interest in such
     Market Entity Collateral. The Company is not making any representations or
     warranties as to the priority of its security interest in the Market
     Entity Collateral, but is providing to Lender instead only the searches
     and other recordings reflected in each Assignment. To the extent, if any,
     that the Company is unable to provide adequate fixture filings for a
     particular site of a Market Entity under Section 5(b)(v) of the Security
     Agreement, but complies with Section 7.7 hereof with respect to such
     Market Entity, the Company's representations and warranties as to the
     perfection of security interests shall be deemed to exclude the fixtures
     of such Market Entity located at such site.

     SECTION 7.7 PROBLEM SITES. If, with respect to a proposed Market Entity,
the Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 5(b)(v) of the
Security Agreement for a Market Entity Loan Package with respect to Market
Entity Collateral located at one or more sites used by such proposed Market
Entity, Lender agrees not to reject the Market Entity Loan Package for such
proposed Market Entity solely for such reason, as long as the aggregate

not at any time exceed the Collateral Value for such Market Entity. The Company
further agrees not to, and not to permit any Market Entities to, designate or
treat a Market as an Excluded Market under this Agreement or any Market Entity
Loan Documents after the Amendment Date unless, immediately after the applicable
Market becomes an Excluded Market, the Collateral Value for the Market Entity
holding the FCC License for such Excluded Market is equal to or greater than the
outstanding principal amount of the Market Entity Note for such Market Entity.

or more Market Entities or (ii) any material default, or event or condition that
with notice or the lapse of time or both would become a material default, under
the Market Entity Loan Documents for any one or more Market Entities, shall
constitute a Default hereunder only if, as a consequence thereof the Collateral
Value, taken as a whole, has been or will be materially and adversely affected.
Such Default shall then constitute an Event of Default, unless within thirty
(30) days following such Default, the Company either provides substitute
Collateral for the affected Market Entities pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof or
partially prepays the Obligations with respect to the affected Market Entities

                                       47
<PAGE>
pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof or removes the affected Market Entities pursuant
to Section 7.3 hereof.

     SECTION 8.3   REMEDIES. If an Event of Default has occurred, then (i) if
such event is an Event of Default specified in Section 8.1(f)(i) or 8.1(f)(ii)
hereof, the Commitment shall immediately and automatically terminate and the
Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this
Agreement and any Note shall immediately become due and payable. If such event
is any other Event of Default, either or both of the following actions may be
taken: (i) the Lender may, by written notice to the Company, declare the
Commitment to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the Commitment shall
immediately terminate; and (ii) the Lender may, by written notice to the
Company, declare that an Event of Default has occurred and that the Loans (with
accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and
any Note are due and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately
become due and payable. Except as expressly provided in Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3
hereof, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are
hereby expressly waived.

     SECTION 8.4   ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.

          (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
     Default, Lender shall be entitled to exercise any or all rights and
     remedies available to it under this Agreement, any of the other Basic
     Agreements, the Uniform Commercial Code, or otherwise available at law or
     in equity.

          (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
     Default, without limiting the foregoing, the Lender shall have all the
     rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code,
     including without limitation the right to cause a public or private
     foreclosure sale of any or all of the Collateral pursuant to the Security
     Agreement and Section 9-504 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

          (c) The exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder or under any
     other Basic Agreement by the Lender that may require FCC or PUC approval
     shall be subject to obtaining such approval. Pending such approval, if the
     Company is not disputing in any other forum the Lender's entitlement to
     exercise such rights or remedies, the Company shall not take any
     affirmative action to delay, hinder, interfere with the obtaining of such
     approval.

          (d) In accordance with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. Section 22.917
     (1984), or any successor provision, if applicable, the Lender agrees to
     notify the Company, any affected Market Entity and the FCC in writing at
     least ten (10) days prior to the repossession, in accordance with the
     Basic Agreements or the Market Entity Loan Documents, of all or any part
     of the System which is subject to said regulation.

     SECTION 8.5   CURE OF DEFAULTS. It is further agreed and understood that
should an event or occurrence take place which would otherwise constitute a
Default, if such Default, if curable,

                                       48
<PAGE>
is cured during the applicable period required for the giving of notice, or the
lapse of time, or both if necessary to satisfy the condition of converting the
Default to an Event of Default, or if such Default or Event of Default shall
have been waived in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof, before or after the end
of such applicable period, then such Default shall be retroactively deemed to
constitute neither a Default nor an Event of Default for any purpose of this
Agreement both as to the event itself or the continuance thereof.


                            ARTICLE 9. MISCELLANEOUS

instrument, any of the requirements of the Basic Agreements or any Default or
Event of Default and its consequences. In the case of any waiver, the Company
and the Lender shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder

subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon.

to the benefit of the Company, the Lender, all future holders of any Note, and
their respective successors and assigns.

          (b) ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION BY THE COMPANY.  Other than in
     connection with a transaction permitted by Section 6.4 hereof, the Company
     may not assign or transfer any of its rights nor delegate any of its
     obligations under this Agreement or any other Basic Agreement without the
     prior written consent of the Lender.

          (c) ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION BY THE LENDER. Lender may assign its
     rights and obligations as follows, PROVIDED, however, that Lender shall
     not make assignments or delegations under subsection (i) or (ii) to a
     Competitor without the prior written consent of the Company, which shall
     not be unreasonably withheld.

              (i) PRE-FINANCING TERMINATION DATE. Subject to subparagraph (iii)
          below, on or before the Financing Termination Date, the Lender may not
          delegate any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Basic
          Agreement to any party other than (with notice to the Company) an
          Affiliate of the Lender that is not a Competitor, without the prior
          written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
          withheld. During such period, the Lender may, however, without notice
          to or consent of the Company, assign, transfer, grant a security
          interest in, or pledge all or any part of its rights or title under
          this Agreement and the other Basic Agreements, in whole or in part, to
          any Affiliate of the Lender that is not a Competitor or any third
          party other than a Competitor, for any reason, including, without
          limitation, for the purpose of securing loans to Lender or otherwise.

              (ii) POST-FINANCING TERMINATION DATE.  Subject to subparagraph
          (iii) below, at any time after the Financing Termination Date, the
          Lender may, with notice to but not the consent of the Company,
          delegate its duties and assign, transfer, grant a security interest
          in, or pledge all or any part of its rights or title under this
          Agreement and the other Basic Agreements, in whole or in part, to any
          third party other than a Competitor, for any reason, including,
          without limitation, for the purpose of securing loans to Lender or
          otherwise.

              (iii) EVENT OF DEFAULT. If an Event of Default has occurred and
          is continuing, and the Lender has accelerated the Loans pursuant to
          Section 8.3 hereof, the Lender may, without notice to or consent of
          the Company, delegate its

                                       52
<PAGE>
          duties and assign, transfer, grant a security interest in, or pledge
          all or any part of its rights or title under this Agreement and the
          other Basic Agreements, in whole or in part, to any third party
          (including Competitors), for any reason, including, without
          limitation, for the purpose of securing loans to Lender or otherwise.

          (d) EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT.  Upon receipt of written notice from Lender
     of an assignment by the Lender pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
     9.6, the Company shall, if requested, promptly acknowledge receipt thereof
     in writing, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon the Lender
     shall automatically extend to and be vested in the assignee, and the
     Company shall perform all its obligations with respect to this Agreement
     and the other Basic Agreements for the benefit of such assignee, and, if
     so directed, shall pay all amounts due or to become due hereunder directly
     to such assignee or to any other party designated by such assignee.  The
     Company shall also execute and deliver to Lender such documentation as any
     such assignee may reasonably require in connection with such assignment,
     including an acknowledgment of or consent to the assignment which may
     require the Company to make certain representations or reaffirmations as
     to some of the basic terms and covenants contained herein. Any such
     assignee shall be entitled to rely on the Company's agreements as stated
     herein, as applicable, and shall be considered a third party beneficiary
     thereof.

          (e) EFFECT OF DELEGATION.  If Lender shall delegate its duties under
     this Agreement or the other Basic Agreements pursuant to paragraph (c) of
     this Section 9.6, Lender shall not be relieved of its obligations
     hereunder as a result of any such delegation unless the delegate assumes
     in writing Lender's future obligations hereunder, a copy of which writing
     shall be delivered to the Company, in which event after the date of such
     delegation, the Company's obligations to any such delegate shall be as set
     forth herein with respect to the Lender, and the Company shall not look to
     the Lender to perform any of such delegate's obligations hereunder which
     arise after the date thereof.

     SECTION 9.7   PARTICIPATIONS. The Lender shall be entitled to sell,
transfer or assign participation interests in this Agreement and the other Basic
Agreements to other financial institutions, each of which shall be entitled to
the benefits hereof and of all the Loan Documents to the extent of its
participation interest; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) no participant added before
the Financing Termination Date or before the occurrence of an Event of Default
shall be a Competitor and (ii) Lender shall retain not less than a majority
interest and shall retain all voting control as to material issues (including,
without limitation, releases of Collateral, extension of time for payment,
reduction of amounts payable, declaration or waiver of Defaults or Events of
Default, and amendment of any financial covenants) and (iii) the Company shall
remain entitled to deal only with Lender and not with such participants.

     SECTION 9.8   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more
of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument.

                                       53

     SECTION 9.9   GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement, each Note and the rights and
obligations of the parties under the Basic Agreements shall be governed by, and
construed and interpreted in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of
Illinois except to the extent, if any, that the location of the Collateral may
require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

     SECTION 9.10  INTEGRATION. This Agreement, the Letter Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto constitute the entire understanding between the
Company and the Lender with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof,
and supersede all negotiations, prior discussions, agreements (including
commitment letters), proposals and understandings, written or oral, relating to
the subject matter hereof. Neither of the parties hereto are entering into this
Agreement in reliance on any oral representations or agreements.

     SECTION 9.11  NO JOINT VENTURE. Nothing contained herein or in any of the
Loan Documents shall be deemed to create a joint venture, partnership or
fiduciary relationship between Lender and the Company or their respective
Affiliates.

     SECTION 9.12  INDEMNITY. The Company hereby indemnifies Lender against any
losses, claims, expenses, actions, suits, obligations, liabilities and liens
(and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection therewith), which Lender has sustained or incurred or may sustain or
incur in connection with any of the Collateral or as a consequence of any
default by the Company in the performance or observance of any covenant or
condition contained in this Agreement or the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, the breach of any representation or warranty, any failure of the
Company to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest,
fee or any other amount due hereunder or under any Note, and any failure of the
Company to comply with all applicable Requirements of Law (collectively,
"Claims") except to the extent that any Claims are caused by Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Company's obligations under this
Section 9.12 shall be part of the Obligations and shall be secured by the
Collateral. The Company agrees that upon written notice by Lender of the
assertion of any Claims, the Company shall, at Lender's option, either assume
full responsibility for, or reimburse Lender for the reasonable costs and
expenses of, the defense thereof. The provisions of this Section 9.12 shall
survive the term of this Agreement and payment of the Obligations.

     SECTION 9.13  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

          (a) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Lender acknowledges that information
     that is not available to the public regarding TDS and the Company and
     their Subsidiaries and Affiliates, including the General Market Entities,
     has been, and in the future may be, provided to Lender pursuant to this
     Agreement, and the other Basic Agreements or the Market Entity Loan
     Documents. Any such information shall constitute "Confidential
     Information" if it is written or tangible material conspicuously labeled
     and identified as "confidential and proprietary" or, if oral, if it is
     identified in writing delivered to Lender within fifteen Business Days
     after disclosure as "Confidential."

                                       54
<PAGE>
          (b) NON-CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term "Confidential Information"
     does not include information that:

              (i)  has been or becomes published or is now, or in the future,
              in the public domain through: (x) no fault of the parties; (y)
              any means other than unauthorized disclosure by Lender; or (z)
              disclosure to third parties by the Company without similar
              restriction;

              (ii)      prior to disclosure hereunder, is property within the
              legitimate possession of Lender;

              (iii)     subsequent to disclosure hereunder, is lawfully
              received from a third party having rights therein without
              restriction of the third party's or Lender's rights to
              disseminate the information and without notice of any restriction
              against its further disclosure;

              (iv)      is independently developed by Lender through persons
              who have not had, either directly or indirectly, access to or
              knowledge of such Confidential Information;

              (v)  is disclosed with the written approval of the Company;

              (vi)      at any time, is delivered or disclosed by the Company
              or any Affiliate to the Securities and Exchange Commission or
              other public or regulatory agency;

              (vii)     subject to Section 9.13(d) hereof, is obligated to be
              produced under order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a
              valid administrative or congressional subpoena.

          (c) NONDISCLOSURE AND USE. Lender will not make any public disclosure
     concerning the subject matter of the Confidential Information and will not
     convey any such Confidential Information to any third parties; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that Lender may disclose any Confidential Information (i) to
     Lender's directors, officers, employees or agents, including legal counsel
     and financial advisors, who need to know such information for the purpose
     of evaluating, reviewing, monitoring, enforcing or administering the
     transactions contemplated by the Basic Agreements and the Market Entity
     Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lender or (ii) to appropriate third
     parties in connection with a transaction permitted by Section 9.6 or 9.7
     hereof ("Authorized Third Parties"). Lender agrees that it will not
     deliver any such Confidential Information to such Authorized Third Parties
     unless such Authorized Third Parties agree in writing to be bound by the
     confidentiality agreement contained in this Section 9.13. Lender shall
     provide the same general care to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of
     the Confidential Information as it generally provides to protect its own
     similar confidential information.

                                       55
<PAGE>
     All Confidential Information, unless otherwise specified in writing, shall
     remain the property of the Company, shall be used by Lender or its
     Affiliates only for the purposes intended, and such Confidential
     Information, including all copies thereof, shall be returned to the
     Company after Lender's need for it has expired or upon the request of the
     Company, and in any event, upon termination of this Agreement.

          (d) DISCLOSURE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In the event that Lender is
     requested in any legal, judicial or administrative proceeding to disclose
     any Confidential Information, Lender will give the Company prompt notice
     of such request. The Company may then seek an appropriate protective
     order. If, in the absence of a protective order, Lender is compelled to
     disclose Confidential Information, Lender may disclose such information
     without liability hereunder if Lender gives the Company written notice of
     the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is
     reasonably practicable.

          (e) INJUNCTION. Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
     Confidential Information is considered by the Company to be of a special,
     unique and proprietary character. Upon a breach or threatened breach of
     any provision of this Section 9.13, the Company shall be entitled to, in
     addition to other remedies available to it, injunctive relief to prevent a
     breach or continued breach of this Section 9.13, or any part of it, and to
     secure the enforcement of this Section 9.13.

          (f) TERM. The Lender's obligations under this Section 9.13 shall
     survive for two (2) years following termination of this Agreement;
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
     without obtaining any agreement from any Persons to be bound by this or
     any other confidentiality agreement, Lender shall be entitled to disclose
     Confidential Information to prospective brokers, purchasers, lessees,
     assigns, auctioneers and their respective agents, and/or in judicial or
     administrative proceedings, in each case as reasonably necessary in
     connection with any sale or anticipated sale of any or all of the Loan
     Documents or the Collateral or any other enforcement of Lender's rights or
     remedies under this Agreement or the other Basic Agreements.

          (g) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Lender shall have no monetary liability
     under this Section 9.13 unless an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential
     Information causes or results in a material adverse effect on the
     business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company (in
     each case, taken as a whole), and even in such case, Lender shall only be
     liable for actual, direct damages. Lender shall have no liability for any
     indirect, special, consequential or incidental damages hereunder.

          (h) PUBLICITY. The Company agrees that it will obtain Lender's
     written consent before using or generating any press release,
     advertisement or other similar publicity materials in which the name or
     logo of Lender, General Electric or GE Capital Corporation is used or may
     be reasonably inferred, and will not distribute any such materials in the
     absence of such prior written approval.

                                       56
<PAGE>
     SECTION 9.14  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY
LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY SUCH
ACTION ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY SORT OTHER THAN ACTUAL DAMAGES.

     SECTION 9.15  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT.  This Agreement is an amendment and
restatement of that certain Term Loan Agreement dated as of October 1, 1991,
between the Company and Lender, is not intended to act as a novation or release
or discharge of any indebtedness incurred thereunder or evidenced thereby, and,
from the Amendment Date forward, supersedes any provisions thereof.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Amended and Restated Term
Loan Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

                        SUMMARY OF 1994 BONUS PROGRAM FOR
                            SENIOR CORPORATE STAFF OF
                       UNITED STATES CELLULAR CORPORATION


          The objectives of the 1994 Bonus Program for Senior Corporate Staff
(the "1994 Bonus Plan") of United States Cellular Corporation ("USM") are: (i)
to provide suitable incentives for the senior corporate management of USM to
extend their best efforts to achieve superior results in relation to key
performance targets, (ii) to suitably reward USM's senior corporate management
team in relation to their success in meeting and exceeding these performance
targets, and (iii) to help USM attract and retain talented management personnel
in positions of critical importance to the success of USM.  A team performance
award and an individual performance award are available under the 1994 Bonus
Plan.

          For target performance on the team and individual categories, the 1994
Bonus Plan was designed to generate a targeted 1994 bonus pool equal to the
total of 25% of the aggregate of the base salaries of the Company's executive
officers other than the President.  Under the 1994 Bonus Plan, the size of the
target bonus pool is increased or decreased depending on USM's 1994 achievements
with respect to the performance categories.  No bonus pool is paid under such
plan if minimum performance levels are not achieved in these categories.  The
maximum bonus pool that could be generated, which would require exceptional
performance in all areas, would equal the total of 40% of the aggregate base
salaries of the Company's executive officers.  At target performance, the bonus
pool would be equal to 25% of the aggregate salaries of the Company's executive
officers other than the President.  Of this percentage, 7.5% represents a
targeted individual performance award and a total of 17.5% represents a targeted
team bonus award.  The targeted team award includes a discretionary team award
of 3.5% and an objective award of 14% for a total targeted team bonus award of
17.5%.  The objective performance categories include (i) the increase in net
revenue customers (3.5% of the targeted award), (ii) the increase in earnings
before interest and taxes (7.0% of the targeted award) and (iii) the increase in
net service revenue growth (3.5% of the targeted award).

          The discretionary team performance category, representing 3.5% of the
targeted award of 25%, permits the participants to earn bonus dollars through
USM's performance and their individual performance in areas not measured or not
adequately measured by objective team performance categories.  The President of
USM determines a bonus percentage to award for discretionary team performance
and presents his recommendation to the Chairman for his approval.  This decision
is based primarily on an assessment of the team performance in general,
considering
<PAGE>
all facts and circumstances.  This award may range from 40% of the targeted
award for adequate performance on a team level to 160% of the targeted award for
outstanding performance on a team level.

          The 1994 Bonus Plan also provides a discretionary individual
performance category, representing 7.5% of the targeted percentage of 25%, to
permit the participants to earn bonus dollars through USM's performance and
their individual performance in areas not measured or not adequately measured by
team performance categories.  The President of USM determines a bonus percentage
to award for discretionary individual performance and presents his
recommendation to the Chairman for his approval.  This decision is based
primarily on an assessment of the executive's personal performance.  This award
may range from 40% of the targeted award for adequate performance on an
individual basis to 160% of the targeted award for outstanding performance on an
individual basis.

                     SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
                           (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1994)

                                    SECTION 1
                                  INTRODUCTION

          1.1  TITLE AND PURPOSE.  The title of this Plan shall be the
"Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan".  This
Plan is established by Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (the "Company") to
supplement the benefits under the Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Employees'
Pension Trust I (the "TDS Plan") and the United States Cellular Corporation
Money Purchase Pension Plan (the "USCC Plan"), each of which is intended to
operate as a "qualified" plan as defined under Section 401 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Qualified plans must comply with
Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, which limits the annual compensation of each
employee which can be taken into account under a qualified plan.  This Plan is
established to offset the Code mandated reduction of benefits caused by the
limitation on annual employee compensation to be considered under Section
401(a)(17) of the Code for eligible employees participating in the TDS Plan and
the USCC Plan.  This Plan is intended to be unfunded and maintained primarily
for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees.
<PAGE>
          1.2  DEFINITIONS.  All capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings set forth below, except as otherwise provided in the preamble to or

                            ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFITS

          2.1  ELIGIBILITY.  An employee who is a participant under the TDS Plan

the account established for each Participant pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be

          If a Participant's employment is terminated for Cause, such
Participant shall be entitled to no portion of his account balance under this
Plan.

          3.2  COMMENCEMENT OF PAYMENTS.  The nonforfeitable portion of the
Participant's account determined under Section 3.1, adjusted for the assumed
rate of earnings in the manner described in Section 2.3 (including periods after
the Participant's termination of employment), shall be payable to the
Participant, beginning on the first day of the month next following the later of
his termination of employment and his completion of all forms and applications
requested by the Committee.

          3.3  SCHEDULE OF PAYMENTS.  The nonforfeitable portion of the
Participant's account determined under Section 3.1,

                                       -7-
<PAGE>
adjusted each Plan Year (including periods after any annual installment payments
begin) for the assumed rate of earnings in the manner described in Section 2.3
and reduced for annual installments previously paid under the Plan, shall be
payable in one of the forms described in the following sentence selected by the
Participant on the date he first becomes a Participant and shall commence being
paid on the date determined pursuant to Section 3.2.  The forms available for
payment hereunder are the following:  (a) a single lump sum payment; or (b)
annual installments over a period of 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 years.  Notwithstanding
the Participant's selection of the payment method on the date he becomes a
Participant, the Participant may make a one-time request that payments be made
in accordance with a different form provided under this Section, provided that
such form results in payments over a shorter period than the period formerly
selected by him.  This request shall be irrevocable, must be made to the
Committee prior to the date of the first payment under Section 3.2 and shall be
subject to the approval of the Committee.  The approval of the request shall be
at the sole discretion of the Committee.  If a Participant fails to designate a
payment schedule in accordance with this Section, the nonforfeitable portion of
his account shall be paid in annual installments for a period of ten years.

          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the
event that the Participant owes any amount to an Employer (an "Obligation"), the
payments due hereunder shall be

                                       -8-
<PAGE>
used to offset any Obligation in accordance with the payment schedule selected
by the Participant.  Any amounts not used to offset an Obligation shall be paid
to the Participant or his Beneficiary.

          3.4  SURVIVOR BENEFITS.  If a Participant dies before payment of his
account balance commences, his Beneficiary shall receive the nonforfeitable
portion of his account balance determined under Section 3.1 (after offset of any
Obligation as provided in Section 3.3) in the form selected by the Participant
for payment of his account.  If a Participant dies after payment of his account
balance commences, his Beneficiary shall receive the remaining portion of the
Participant's account balance to which the Participant would have been entitled
had he survived, payable in the same form as payments would have been made to
the Participant had he survived.  Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, a
Beneficiary entitled to payment under this Section may make a one-time request
that payments be made in accordance with a different form provided under Section
3.3, provided that such form results in payments over a shorter period than the
period formerly selected by the Participant.  This request shall be irrevocable,
must be made to the Committee prior to the date of the first payment to the
Beneficiary and shall be subject to the approval of the Committee in the same
manner as provided in Section 3.3.

<PAGE>
          3.5  DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINOR AND DISABLED PERSONS.  If a distribution
is to be made to a minor or to a person who, in the opinion of the Committee, is
unable to manage his affairs by reason of illness or mental incompetency, such
distribution may be made to or for the benefit of any such person in such of the
following ways as the Committee shall direct:  (a) directly to any such minor
person if, in the opinion of the Committee, he is able to manage his affairs,
(b) to the legal representative of any such person, (c) to a custodian under a
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for any such minor person, or (d) to some near
relative of any such person to be used for the latter's benefit.  Neither the
Committee nor the Employer shall be required to see to the application by any
third party of any distribution made to or for the benefit of a Participant or
Beneficiary pursuant to this Section.

          3.6  SMALL BENEFITS PAID IN LUMP SUM.  Notwithstanding any provision
in the Plan to the contrary, if the amount of a Participant's account balance to
be distributed under Article 3 is not more than $10,000, such amount shall be
distributed, as soon as administratively feasible on or after the date on which
such Participant's termination of service occurs, by payment in a lump sum.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

          4.1  EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.  This Plan shall not be construed to give any
Participant the right to be retained in the employ of any Employer nor any right
to benefits not specifically provided for in this Plan.

          4.2  RIGHTS NOT SECURED.  All payments to be made pursuant to this
Plan shall be an obligation of the general assets of the Employers, and no
Employer shall be required to segregate any of its assets in order to provide
for the satisfaction of the obligations hereunder or to make any investment of
assets.  Although the amounts credited to each Participant's account shall be
reflected in the Employers' accounting records, this Plan shall not be construed
to create a trust, custodial, or escrow account nor shall the Participant have
any right, title, or interest in any specific investment reserves, accounts,
funds or a trust that any Employer may accumulate or establish to aid it in
providing benefits under this Plan.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall create
a trust or fiduciary relationship between any Employer and any Participant or
Beneficiary.  Neither a Participant nor his Beneficiary shall acquire any
interest greater than that of an unsecured creditor.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
          4.3  ADMINISTRATION.  This Plan shall be administered by the
Committee.  The Committee shall have the same rights and duties with respect to
this Plan as the plan administrator of the TDS Plan has with respect to the TDS
Plan.  The Committee will apply uniform rules to all Participants similarly
situated.  The determination of the Committee as to any question arising under
this Plan shall be final and binding upon all persons.  The expenses of
administering the Plan shall be borne by the Employers.

          4.4  EFFECT ON OTHER PLANS.  Amounts credited or paid under this Plan
shall not be considered to be compensation for the purposes of any qualified
plan maintained by any Employer.

          4.5  INTERESTS NOT TRANSFERABLE.  Except as provided in Section 3.3
with respect to an Obligation, the interests of the Participants and their
Beneficiaries under the Plan are not subject to the claims of their creditors
and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned or encumbered in any way,
including any assignment, division or awarding of property under state domestic
relations law (including community property law).

          4.6  ADOPTION BY EMPLOYERS.  Any corporation which is or becomes an
"Employer" under the Company Pension Plan may, with the consent of the Company,
become an Employer in this Plan by delivery to the Company of a resolution of
its board of directors or duly authorized committee to such effect, which
resolution shall specify the first Plan Year for which this Plan shall be
effective in respect of the employees of such corporation.

          4.7  TAX LIABILITY.  An Employer may withhold from any payment under
this Plan any taxes required to be withheld plus such sums as such Employer may
reasonably estimate to be necessary to cover any taxes for which the Employer
may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.

          4.8  CONTROLLING LAW.  The law of Illinois and, where applicable, the
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
shall be controlling in all matters relating to the Plan.

                                    SECTION 5
                                 CLAIMS PROCEDURE

          If any Participant or Beneficiary believes he is entitled to benefits
in an amount greater than those which he is receiving or has received, he may
file a claim with the Benefits Department.  Such a claim shall be in writing and
state the nature of the claim, the facts supporting the claim, the amount
claimed and the address of the claimant.  The Benefits Department shall review
the claim and, unless special circumstances require an extension of time, within
90 days after receipt of the claim, give written notice by registered or
certified mail to the claimant of its decision with respect to the claim.  If
special

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
circumstances require an extension of time, the claimant shall be so advised in
writing within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension
exceed 90 days.  The notice sent by the Benefits Department shall be written in
a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if the claim is wholly
or partially denied, set forth the specific reasons for the denial, specific
references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, a
description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant
to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is
necessary, and an explanation of the claim review procedure under this Plan.
The Benefits Department shall also advise the claimant that he or his duly
authorized representative may request a review by the Committee of the denial by
filing with the Committee within 60 days after notice of the denial has been
received by the claimant, a written request for such review.  The claimant shall
be informed that he may have reasonable access to pertinent documents and submit
comments in writing to the Committee within the same 60-day period.  If a
request is so filed, review of the denial shall be made by the Committee and the
claimant shall be given written notice of the Committee's final decision within
sixty days after receipt of such request, unless special circumstances require
an extension of time.  If special circumstances require an extension of time,
the claimant shall be so advised in writing within the initial 60-day period and
in no event shall such an extension exceed 60 days.  The notice of the
Committee's final decision shall include specific reasons for the

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the
decision is based and shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood
by the claimant.

                                    SECTION 6
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

          6.1  AMENDMENT.  The Company may amend this Plan at any time by
resolution duly adopted by its board of directors.  No such amendment shall
reduce or otherwise adversely affect the rights of Participants or Beneficiaries
with respect to amounts accrued hereunder as of the date of such amendment.

          6.2  TERMINATION.  Although the Company expects to continue this Plan
indefinitely, it must necessarily reserve the right to terminate this Plan at
any time by a resolution duly adopted by its board of directors.

                                      -15-

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" or "USM") owns, operates and
invests in cellular markets throughout the United States. USM owns or has the
right to acquire both majority and minority interests in 207 cellular markets at
December 31, 1994, representing 25,201,000 population equivalents ("pops"). USM
managed the operations of 145 cellular markets at December 31, 1994. The Company
expects to divest seven of these markets and manage the operations of 12
additional markets in the future. In total, USM expects to manage 150 markets
under agreements currently in place. Interests in the 57 remaining markets are
managed by others. All 57 of these markets were served by operational systems at
December 31, 1994. The following table is a summary of the Company's markets and
consolidated operations.

The Company's consolidated results of operations include 100% of the revenues
and expenses of the systems serving majority-owned and managed markets plus its
corporate office operations. The December 31, 1994 consolidated results of
operations include 130 markets with a total population of 21.3 million, compared
to 116 markets with a total population of 19.4 million in 1993, and 92 markets
with a total population of 15.0 million in 1992.

Investment income includes the Company's share of the net income or loss of each
of the minority-owned and managed markets and also includes the Company's share
of the net income or loss of each of those markets managed by others for which
the Company follows the equity method of accounting. USM follows the cost method
of accounting for its remaining interests in markets managed by others. This
information is shown in the table below.

</TABLE>

Operating results for 1994 primarily reflect improvement in the Company's more
established markets (those 92 markets consolidated at December 31, 1992), a full
year's operations from the 25 markets added to the consolidated group in 1993,
the acquisition of majority interests in 12 operational markets and the start-up
expenses associated with initiating operations in two additional majority-owned
and managed markets during

1994. Operating revenues, driven primarily by increases in customers served,
rose $118.1 million, or 55%. Operating expenses rose $92.0 million, or 41%.
Operating cash flow increased $46.4 million, or 128%. The Company changed its
financial reporting presentation for outbound, or pass-through, roaming revenue
during 1994 to allow more comparability to other cellular companies.
Pass-through roaming revenue is now treated as an offset to the expense charged
by other cellular carriers, with the net amount included in system operations
expense. Prior years' pass-through roaming revenue and expense have been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

Investment and other income increased $8.4 million, or 37%, due primarily to
increases in investment income. Investment income increased $9.6 million mostly
due to improved results in markets managed by others. Interest expense decreased
$11.3 million primarily due to a reduction in the amount owed under a Revolving
Credit Agreement with USM's parent company, Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.
("TDS"), as a result of the Company's 1993 rights offering. Net income totaled
$16.4 million in 1994 compared to a net loss of $25.4 million in 1993,
reflecting improved operating results, increased investment income and decreased
interest expense.

The Company expects to add a net of nine markets to consolidated operations
during 1995, through the acquisition of majority interests in 16 operational
markets and the divestiture of seven markets currently majority-owned and
managed by the Company. Of the 16 majority interests to be acquired, the Company
currently owns a minority interest in and manages five of these markets. The
Company expects to acquire a majority interest in these five markets and 11
additional markets during 1995.

Management anticipates that operating losses from new markets and the
seasonality of revenue streams and operating expenses may significantly affect
the Company's operating and net results over the next several quarters.

OPERATING REVENUES

OPERATING REVENUES totaled $332.4 million in 1994, up $118.1 million, or 55%,
over 1993. Operating revenues totaled $214.3 million in 1993, up $74.4 million,
or 53%, over 1992. Market acquisitions and start-ups increased operating
revenues $25.5 million, or 12%, in 1994 and $23.2 million, or 17%, in 1993. This
"acquisitions and start-ups" effect is defined as: (i) the operations of markets
added to the consolidated group in 1994 since their respective dates of
acquisition, plus (ii) for any market added to the consolidated group in 1993,
the portion of 1994 operations which correspond to that portion of 1993 prior to
the market's addition to the consolidated group.

SERVICE REVENUES primarily consist of: (i) charges for access, airtime and
value-added services provided to the Company's local retail customers who use
the local systems operated by the Company; (ii) charges to customers of other
systems who use the Company's cellular systems when roaming ("inbound roaming");
and (iii) charges for long-distance calls made on the Company's systems. Service
revenues exclude pass-through roaming revenue as discussed previously. Service
revenues for 1993 and 1992 have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation. Service revenues totaled $318.6 million in 1994, up $114.8
million, or 56%, over 1993. Service revenues totaled $203.8 million in 1993, up
$73.1 million, or 56%, over 1992. The increase was primarily due to the growing
number of local retail customers and the growth in inbound roaming revenue
offset by declining monthly average revenue per customer. Service revenues in
1994 increased 66%, or $135.2 million, due to customer growth and declined 10%,
or $20.4 million, due to decreases in average monthly service revenue per
customer. Acquisitions and start-ups increased service revenues $24.4 million,
or 12%, in 1994 and $22.1 million, or 17%, in 1993. Average monthly service
revenue per customer totaled $80 in 1994 compared to $85 in 1993 and $88 in
1992. The 6% decrease in average monthly service revenue per customer in 1994
was primarily a result of a decrease in per customer inbound roaming revenue and
the decline in average local minutes of use per retail customer. The 4% decrease
in average monthly service revenue per customer in 1993 was primarily a result
of the decline in average local minutes of use per retail customer. Management
anticipates that average monthly service revenue per customer will continue to

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

rate of the Company's customer base exceeds the growth rate of inbound roaming
revenue.

REVENUE FROM LOCAL CUSTOMERS' usage of USM's systems increased $70.4 million, or
60%, in 1994 and $40.5 million, or 53%, in 1993. Growth in the number of
customers in the systems serving the Company's consolidated markets was the
primary reason for the increase in local revenue. The number of customers
increased 61% to 421,000 at December 31, 1994 from 261,000 at December 31, 1993.
The number of customers increased 73% in 1993, up from 150,800 at December 31,
1992. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and dispositions, the Company's
consolidated markets added 142,000 customers in 1994 and 86,600 customers in
1993. Of the 1994 additions, 122,000 were in markets in service and consolidated
at December 31, 1993, representing a 47% increase over the 261,000 customers
served at that date. Of the 1993 additions, 72,400 were in markets in service
and consolidated at December 31, 1992, representing a 48% increase over the
150,800 customers served at that date. While the percentage increase is expected
to be lower in future periods, management anticipates that the total number of
net customer additions will continue to increase. Acquisitions and start-ups
increased local revenue $12.4 million, or 11%, in 1994 and $8.7 million, or 11%,
in 1993.

Average monthly retail revenue per customer declined to $47 in 1994 from $49 in
1993 and $52 in 1992. Monthly local minutes of use per customer averaged 95 in
1994 compared to 103 in 1993 and 121 in 1992. This decline in average local
minutes of use follows an industry-wide trend and is believed to be related to
the tendency of the early customers in a market to be the heaviest users. It
also reflects the Company's and the industry's continued penetration of the
consumer market, which tends to include more lower-usage customers.

INBOUND ROAMING REVENUE increased $33.9 million, or 48%, in 1994 and $28.1
million, or 67%, in 1993. This increase was attributable to the rise in the
number of customers from other systems using the Company's systems when roaming.
Also contributing were the increased number of Company-managed systems and cell
sites within those systems. Monthly inbound roaming revenue per customer
averaged $26 in 1994, $29 in 1993 and $28 in 1992. Acquisitions and start-ups
increased inbound roaming revenue $10.1 million, or 14%, in 1994 and $11.2
million, or 27%, in 1993.

LONG-DISTANCE REVENUE increased $8.8 million, or 63%, in 1994 and $4.4 million,
or 46%, in 1993 as the volume of long-distance calls billed by the Company
increased. Monthly long-distance revenue per customer averaged $6 in 1994, 1993
and 1992. Acquisitions and start-ups increased long-distance revenue $1.7
million, or 12%, in 1994 and $1.9 million, or 20%, in 1993.

EQUIPMENT SALES REVENUES totaled $13.8 million in 1994, up $3.3 million, or 31%,
over 1993. Equipment sales revenues totaled $10.5 million in 1993, up $1.2
million, or 13%, over 1992. Equipment sales reflect the sale of 153,000, 83,000
and 44,400 cellular telephone units in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, plus
installation and accessories revenue. The average revenue per unit was $90 in
1994 compared to $127 in 1993 and $208 in 1992. The average revenue per unit
decline partially reflects the Company's decision to reduce sales prices on
cellular telephones to increase the number of customers, to maintain its market
position and to meet competitive prices as well as to reflect reduced
manufacturers' prices. Also, during 1994 and the second half of 1993, the
Company used promotions which were based on increased equipment discounting. The
success of these promotions led to both an increase in units sold and a decrease
in average equipment sales revenue per unit. Acquisitions and start-ups
increased equipment sales revenues $1.1 million, or 11%, in 1994 and $1.0
million, or 11%, in 1993.

OPERATING EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES totaled $315.0 million in 1994, up $92.0 million, or 41%,
over 1993. Operating expenses totaled $223.0 million in 1993, up $70.3 million,
or 46%, over 1992. Market acquisitions and start-ups increased expenses $30.9
million, or 14%, in 1994 and $30.5 million, or 20%, in 1993.

SYSTEM OPERATIONS EXPENSES increased $12.6 million, or 37%, in 1994 and $10.1
million, or 42%, in 1993, as a result of increases in customer usage expenses
and costs associated with operating the Company's increased number of cellular
systems and the growing number of cell sites within those systems. System

operations expense includes pass-through roaming revenue as an offset to the
expense charged by other carriers to the Company's markets for this roaming
service. System operations expense for 1993 and 1992 has been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation. Costs are expected to continue to increase
as the number of cell sites within the Company's systems grows. Customer usage
expenses represent charges from other telecommunications service providers for
USM's customers' use of their facilities as well as for the Company's inbound
roaming traffic on these facilities, offset somewhat by pass-through roaming
revenue. These expenses also include local interconnection to the landline
network, toll charges and roaming expenses from the Company's customers' use of
systems other than their local systems. Customer usage expenses were $21.6
million in 1994 compared to $18.0 million in 1993 and $13.3 million in 1992, and
represented 7% of service revenues in 1994 compared to 9% in 1993 and 10% in
1992. Maintenance, utility and cell site expenses totaled $25.3 million in 1994
compared to $16.3 million in 1993 and $10.9 million in 1992, primarily
reflecting an increase in the number of cell sites in the systems serving all
majority-owned and managed markets, to 790 in 1994 from 522 in 1993 and 320 in
1992. Acquisitions and start-ups increased system operations expenses $6.1
million, or 18%, in 1994 and $5.5 million, or 23%, in 1993.

MARKETING AND SELLING EXPENSES increased $25.6 million, or 59%, in 1994 and
$12.8 million, or 42%, in 1993. Marketing and selling expenses primarily consist
of salaries, commissions and expenses of field sales and retail personnel and
offices; agent commissions; promotional expenses; local advertising and public
relations expenses. The 1994 increase was primarily due to a 64% rise in the
number of gross customer activations (excluding acquisitions and divestitures),
from 141,700 in 1993 to 232,000 in 1994. The 1993 increase was primarily due to
a 66% rise in the number of gross customer activations (excluding acquisitions
and divestitures), from 85,400 in 1992 to 141,700 in 1993. Cost per gross
customer addition decreased from $453 in 1992 to $414 in 1993 to $408 in 1994.
Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, the Company added 142,000 net new
customers in 1994 compared to 86,600 in 1993 and 50,600 in 1992, increases of
64% and 71% in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The churn rate was 2.3% in 1994 and
1993 and was 2.4% in 1992. Acquisitions and start-ups increased marketing and
selling expenses $6.3 million, or 15%, in 1994 and $4.8 million, or 16%, in
1993.

COST OF EQUIPMENT SOLD increased $13.7 million, or 54%, in 1994 and $8.4
million, or 48%, in 1993. The increases reflect the growth in unit sales related
to both the rise in gross customer activations made through the Company's direct
and retail distribution channels and the 1994 and 1993 promotional sales which
were discussed previously, offset somewhat by falling manufacturer prices per
unit. The average cost to the Company of a telephone unit sold, including
accessories and installation, was $258  in 1994 compared to $309 in 1993 and
$390 in 1992. Acquisitions and start-ups increased cost of goods sold $3.4
million, or 13%, in 1994 and $2.6 million, or 15%, in 1993.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES increased $19.7 million, or 26%, in 1994 and
$23.6 million, or 47%, in 1993. These expenses include the costs of operating
the Company's local business offices and its corporate expenses. This increase
includes the effects of an increase in the number of consolidated markets,
increases in expenses required to serve the growing customer base in existing
markets and an expansion of both local administrative office and corporate
staff, necessitated by growth in the Company's business and the start-up of and
acquisition of additional operations. The Company is using an ongoing clustering
strategy to combine local operations wherever feasible in order to gain
operational efficiencies and reduce its administrative expenses. Acquisitions
and start-ups increased direct field-related general and administrative expenses
$8.4 million, or 11%, in 1994 and $8.3 million, or 16%, in 1993. Operating cash
flow (operating income or loss before minority share plus depreciation and
amortization expense) increased $46.5 million, or 128%, to $82.8 million in 1994
and increased $19.5 million, or 115%, to $36.4 million in 1993. The improvement
in 1993 and 1994 was primarily due to customer growth, which drove an increase
in service revenues, and a slower rate of increase in operating expenses
resulting from improved operational efficiencies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE increased $13.9 million, or 54%, in 1994 and $9.1 million,
or 55%, in 1993. These increases reflect rising average fixed asset balances,
which increased 54% in 1994 and 56% in 1993. Acquisitions and start-ups
increased depreciation expense $2.9 million, or 11%, in 1994 and $3.1 million,
or 19%, in 1993.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased $6.6 million, or 34%, in 1994 and $6.3
million, or 49%, in 1993. These increases are primarily due to increases in
license costs as a result of the acquisition of or the commencement of service
in 14 markets in 1994 and 25 markets in 1993. License costs related to
consolidated markets increased $163.9 million, or 20%, in 1994 and $310.3
million, or 63%, in 1993. Acquisitions and start-ups increased amortization of
intangibles $3.8 million, or 20%, in 1994 and $6.0 million, or 46%, in 1993.

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE MINORITY SHARE

OPERATING INCOME BEFORE MINORITY SHARE totaled $17.4 million in 1994 compared to
losses of $8.7 million in 1993 and $12.7 million in 1992. The operating income
margin (as a percent of service revenues) improved to 5% in 1994 from operating
(loss) margins of (4%) in 1993 and (10%) in 1992. The 1994 operating income and
the improvement in the 1993 operating loss both reflect improved results in the
more established markets and increased revenues resulting from growth in the
number of customers served by the Company's systems, partially offset by costs
associated with the growth of the Company's operations and increased losses on
equipment sales. Acquisitions and start-ups decreased operating income before
minority share $5.4 million in 1994 and increased the operating loss before
minority share by $7.3 million in 1993.

The Company expects service revenues to continue to grow during 1995 as it adds
customers and cell sites to its existing systems, realizes a full year of
revenues from customers and cell sites added in 1994 and completes acquisitions
of operational systems. Additionally, the Company expects expenses to increase
significantly during 1995 as it incurs costs for markets and cell sites added in
1993 and 1994, incurs costs associated with customer and system growth and
acquires existing markets. At least nine markets are expected to be added to
consolidated operations during 1995, through the acquisition of majority
interests in 16 operational markets and the divestiture of seven majority-owned
and managed markets. The Company expects that the costs related to acquiring and
operating new markets may exceed their revenues over the next few quarters.
Additionally, management believes there exists a seasonality in both service
revenues and operating expenses, especially marketing expenses. As a result, the
rate of growth in operating income could be reduced over the next several
quarters.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME totaled $31.0 million in 1994, $22.6 million in 1993
and $43.6 million in 1992. INVESTMENT INCOME was $26.5 million in 1994 compared
to $16.9 million in 1993 and $12.5 million in 1992. The Company's share of the
income or loss from the markets managed by others that are accounted for by the
equity method totaled $26.0 million in 1994 compared to $16.8 million in 1993
and $13.0 million in 1992. There were 17 such markets in 1994, 15 in 1993 and 13
in 1992. The Company's share of income from minority-owned markets it manages
totaled $497,000 in 1994 compared to $143,000 in 1993 and a loss of $499,000 in
1992. There were 11 such markets in 1994 and 18 in both 1993 and 1992.

OTHER (EXPENSE), NET was $1.4 million in 1994 compared to $915,000 in 1993 and
$2.8 million in 1992. In 1994, the Company sold obsolete equipment obtained in
certain acquisitions, recognizing losses of $614,000. In 1993, the Company wrote
off equipment no longer used, for a loss of $677,000. Also in 1993, other
(expense), net was reduced by both the sale of the Company's customer base in
its reseller operation and income recognized related to the settlements of
disputes concerning two of the Company's markets. Income related to these
transactions totaled $495,000 and $925,000, respectively. In 1992, $1.3 million
of costs applicable to unsuccessful license applications and acquisitions were
charged to expense.

GAIN ON SALE OF CELLULAR INTERESTS totaled $3.3 million in 1994, $4.9 million in
1993 and $31.4 million in 1992. The 1994 amount reflects gains recorded on the
exchange of five of the Company's cost-basis cellular investment interests with
another cellular company for minority interests in seven markets in which the
Company owns a controlling interest. The 1993 amount reflects gains recorded on
the sales of two cellular investment interests. In 1992, a $17.1 million gain
was recorded on the completion of a sale to another cellular company of the
Company's 100% interest in a market it managed; an $11.4 million gain was
recorded on the exchange of cost-basis cellular interests with another cellular
company; and a $2.9 million gain was recorded on the sale of an additional
investment interest.

INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES

INTEREST EXPENSE decreased $11.3 million, or 34%, in 1994, on a 37% decrease in
the average amount of debt outstanding. Interest expense increased $13.1
million, or 65%, in 1993, on a 66% increase in the average amount

22

of debt outstanding. Interest expense is primarily related to borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS and borrowings under a series of
financing agreements with an equipment vendor. Borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to prime plus 1.5% (for
a rate of 10.0% at December 31, 1994) and are used to finance system
construction and working capital requirements, investments in and advances to
entities in which the Company has a minority interest, and acquisitions of
cellular interests. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company completed a
rights offering to its common shareholders, the proceeds of which were used to
repay approximately $378 million in debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Agreement. See "Financial Resources and Liquidity." Interest expense relating to
the Revolving Credit Agreement was $17.8 million in 1994, $29.1 million in 1993
and $16.8 million in 1992. The average amount of debt outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Agreement was $204.7 million in 1994, $372.8 million in 1993
and $216.0 million in 1992. The average interest rate on such debt was 8.6% in
1994, 7.5% in 1993 and 7.8% in 1992.

The Company has borrowings outstanding under three financing agreements with an
equipment vendor. Borrowings made under the initial agreement bear interest at a
rate approximating the prime rate (8.5% at December 31, 1994). Borrowings under
the second agreement bear interest at a rate of 2.3% over the 90-day Commercial
Paper Rate of high-grade, unsecured notes (for a rate of 8.6% at December 31,
1994). Borrowings under a third agreement bear interest at a rate of 2.25% over
the same 90-day Commercial Paper Rate (for a rate of 8.5% at December 31, 1994).
Borrowings under the all three vendor financing agreements were used to finance
certain of USM's equipment purchases and construction costs. Interest expense
related to the vendor financing agreements was $3.9 million in 1994, $4.0
million in 1993 and $3.1 million in 1992. The average amount of debt under the
vendor financing agreement was $58.1 million in 1994, $66.4 million in 1993 and
$48.8 million in 1992. The average interest rate on such debt was 7.1% in 1994,
5.7% in 1993 and 6.2% in 1992.

Continued capital expenditures, investments in and advances to entities in which
the Company has a minority interest, and the completion of pending acquisitions
will require additional funding over the next few years. These funding
requirements are anticipated to be at least partially met through additional
debt, which will likely result in increased interest expense as debt balances
increase. Additional borrowings also may be required to fund additional future
acquisitions and their construction and operations. See "Financial Resources and
Liquidity."

INCOME TAX EXPENSE was $4.9 million in 1994, $2.7 million in 1993 and $2.0
million in 1992. Income tax expense includes the federal income taxes of
consolidated subsidiaries not included in the TDS consolidated federal income
tax return. State income tax expense in 1994 and 1993 was primarily related to
subsidiaries generating taxable income after utilization of state net operating
losses. The 1992 income tax expense resulted primarily from state income taxes
generated by the gains on the sale and exchange of cellular interests completed
in 1992. No such taxes were generated by the 1994 or 1993 gains.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective January 1, 1993. The cumulative
effect of the new principle on years prior to 1993 had an immaterial effect on
net loss and loss per share. Income tax expense for 1994 and 1993 reflects the
new accounting principle. Income tax expense amounts for 1992 have not been
restated.

USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members
of the TDS consolidated group. TDS and USM are parties to a Tax Allocation
Agreement under which USM is able to carry forward its losses and credits and
use them to offset any current or future income tax liabilities to TDS. The
amount of the federal net operating loss carryforward available to offset future
taxable income aggregated approximately $165 million at December 31, 1994, and
expires between 2002 and 2009. The amount of the state net operating loss
carryforward available to offset future taxable income aggregated approximately
$227 million at December 31, 1994, and expires between 1998 and 2009.

NET INCOME (LOSS)

NET INCOME totaled $16.4 million in 1994 compared to a net loss of $25.4 million
in 1993 and net income of $6.2 million in 1992. The improvement in 1994 over
1993 resulted from improved operating results in the established markets,
increased investment income and decreased interest expense, partially offset by
the effects of the addition of new markets. On a comparable basis (net of tax),
excluding nonrecurring and unusual items, net loss totaled $30.3 million in 1993
and $24.6 million in 1992. The increased loss in 1993 primarily reflects
increased interest expense offset by improvements in the operating loss. Net
income for 1992 primarily reflects $31.4 million in gains on the sale and
exchange of cellular interests. NET INCOME PER SHARE was $.21 in

                                                                              23


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

1994 compared to a net loss per share of $.45 in 1993 and net income per share
of $.11 in 1992. The improvement in 1994 over 1993 primarily reflects the
improvement in net income offset by the increase in weighted average Common and
Series A Common Shares outstanding. The weighted average number of Common and
Series A Common Shares outstanding for 1994 increased 39% over the shares
outstanding for 1993 primarily as a result of Common and Series A Common Shares
issued in connection with the 1993 rights offering, Common Shares issued in
connection with acquisitions, and the inclusion of dilutive common stock
equivalents in 1994 weighted average common shares outstanding as a result of
the 1994 net income. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding
was similar in 1993 and 1992.

TDS owned an aggregate of 63,879,673 shares of common stock of the Company at
December 31, 1994, representing over 81% of the combined total of the Company's
outstanding Common and Series A Common Shares and over 96% of their combined
voting power. Assuming the Company's Common Shares are issued in all instances
in which the Company has the choice to issue its Common Shares or other
consideration and assuming all issuances of the Company's common stock to TDS
and third parties for completed and pending acquisitions and redemptions of the
Company's Preferred Stock and TDS's Preferred Shares had been completed at
December 31, 1994, TDS would have owned approximately 80.3% of the total
outstanding common stock of the Company and controlled over 95% of the combined
voting power of both classes of its common stock. In the event TDS's ownership
of the Company falls below 80% of the total value of all of the outstanding
shares of the Company's stock, TDS and the Company would be deconsolidated for
federal income tax purposes. TDS and the Company have the ability to defer or
prevent deconsolidation, if deferring or preventing deconsolidation would be
advantageous, by delivering TDS Common Shares and/or cash in lieu of the
Company's Common Shares in connection with certain acquisitions.

INFLATION

Management believes that inflation affects the Company's business to no greater
extent than the general economy.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company operates a capital- and marketing-intensive business. Rapid growth
in markets operated by the Company and customers served has caused financing
requirements for acquisitions, construction and operations to exceed internally
generated cash flow. The Company requires capital to complete acquisitions in
process, to fund construction and operating expenses of the cellular systems it
operates, to fund investments in minority partnership interests in other
cellular markets and to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt.
Management believes that the cellular markets the Company acquires may be
generating losses and that these losses may continue after the Company assumes
those markets' operations. The Company experienced operating losses and net
losses from its inception until the past few quarters. The Company has obtained
substantial funds from external sources during the past several years and
anticipates that it will require funds from external sources over the next few
years.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES provided $84.3 million in 1994, $35.3
million in 1993 and $3.5 million in 1992. Operating cash flow (operating income
or loss before minority share plus depreciation and amortization expense)
provided cash totaling $82.8 million in 1994, $36.4 million in 1993 and $16.9
million in 1992. The 1994 and 1993 increases in operating cash flow primarily
reflect improvement in the Company's more mature markets. Acquisitions and
start-ups increased operating cash flow $1.3 million, or 4%, in 1994 and $1.8
million, or 11%, in 1993. Cash flows from other operating activities (investment
and other income, interest expense, changes in working capital and changes in
other assets and liabilities) provided cash totaling $1.5 million in 1994 and
required cash investments totaling $1.1 million in 1993 and $13.4 million in
1992.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES provided $95.6 million in 1994, $65.4
million in 1993 and $57.5 million in 1992. Cash flows from financing activities
include cash flows from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement with
TDS, vendor financing transactions and sales of Common Shares.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS totaling $75.4 million
and $45.4 million provided a majority of the Company's external financing
requirements in 1994 and 1993, respectively. Borrowings under one of the vendor
financing agreements provided an additional $18.0 million in 1994. The sale of
Common Shares to parties other than TDS in connection with the rights offering
provided an additional $36.8 million of the Company's external financing
requirements in 1993. In connection with the rights offering, debt to TDS under
the Revolving Credit Agreement was reduced by $340.7 million upon the issuance
to TDS of 4.8 million Common Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares.
Borrowings of $36.6 million under one of the vendor financing agreements
provided a majority of the Company's external financing requirements in 1992.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES required cash investments totaling $180.4
million in 1994, $98.6 million in 1993 and $69.6 million in 1992. Such cash
requirements primarily consisted of additions to property, plant, and equipment
and cash requirements for acquisitions and for investments in cellular markets.
Expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $158.2 million in 1994
(of which $9.8 million relates to 1993 additions), representing the construction
of 225 cell sites and other plant additions. Expenditures for property, plant
and equipment totaled $84.9 million in 1993 (excluding noncash expenditures of
$6.6 million), representing the construction of 138 cell sites and other plant
additions. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $53.3 million
in 1992 (excluding noncash expenditures of $2.8 million), representing the
construction of 107 cell sites and other plant additions.

Anticipated capital requirements for 1995 reflect the Company's construction and
system expansion program, funding of working capital needs, investments in
entities in which the Company has a minority interest, scheduled debt repayments
and pending acquisitions. The Company's consolidated construction budget for
1995 is approximately $180 million, consisting primarily of new cell sites to
expand and enhance the Company's coverage in its service areas.

The Company is expanding its operations through acquisitions. During 1994, the
Company completed the acquisition of controlling interests in nine markets and
several additional minority interests. Not included in these totals are the
acquisitions of five controlling interests which resulted from the formation of
a partnership the Company controls. This partnership consists of one previously
controlled market and five other markets in which the Company previously owned a
minority interest. No acquisition costs were incurred during 1994 related to the
formation of this partnership. During 1993, the Company completed the
acquisition of controlling interests in 25 markets and several additional
minority interests. During 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of
controlling interests in 16 markets and several additional minority interests.
Some of the markets acquired during 1994, 1993 and 1992 were subject to
acquisition agreements which were entered into prior to the year in which the
acquisitions were completed. The following table summarizes the consideration
issued for these acquisitions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

Common Shares in 1995 and 1996 related to certain completed acquisitions. The
Company and TDS have the option to deliver TDS Common Shares and/or cash in lieu
of the Company's Common Shares in connection with certain of these acquisitions.

In addition to the acquisitions in the table, in 1994 the Company completed the
exchange of its cost-basis investment interests in five markets for interests in
seven markets the Company controls. Also, in 1992, the Company completed the
exchange of its 100% interests in two markets, its cost-basis investment
interests in two markets and $2.9 million in cash for controlling interests in
two markets and the remaining minority interest in a market the Company
controls.

The Company has an ongoing acquisition program, the funding requirements of
which may be substantial. The Company maintains an ongoing acquisition program
to seek to maximize its future potential, including seeking opportunities to
combine operations and achieve increased economies of scale. These economies of
scale include the sharing of market personnel, equipment and office resources.
The Company plans to continue its acquisition program as long as it is feasible
to acquire cellular interests that fit into its business objectives.

At December 31, 1994, the Company, or TDS for the benefit of the Company, had
agreements pending to acquire controlling interests in seven markets and two
minority interests. The following table summarizes the consideration to be
issued by USM for these acquisitions if they are completed as planned.

Cellular interests acquired by TDS in these transactions are expected to be
assigned to the Company and at the time this occurs the Company will reimburse
TDS for TDS's consideration delivered and costs incurred in such acquisitions.
Of the consideration for these pending acquisitions, the debt under the
Revolving Credit Agreement and 2.7 million of the USM Common Shares are to be
issued to TDS to reimburse TDS for TDS Common Shares to be issued and cash to be
paid to third parties in connection with these pending acquisitions. All of the
2.8 million Common Shares to be issued in connection with pending acquisitions
are expected to be issued in 1995.

Not included in these pending acquisitions are exchanges of cellular interests
pursuant to agreements with four cellular companies. In one agreement, USM will
exchange its controlling interest in one market for a controlling interest in
another market USM currently manages. Under a second agreement, USM will
exchange its 100% interests in one entire market and a partition of another
market plus cash for 100% interests in one entire market and a partition of
another market. In a separate agreement with the same company, USM will sell its
investment interest in one market for cash. In a third agreement, USM will
exchange its 100% interests in two markets for 100% interests in four markets.
Pursuant to a fourth agreement, USM will exchange its 100% interests in three
entire markets and partitions of two other markets for 100% interests in two
markets. Also, the agreement by which USM exchanged its investment interests in
five markets for minority interests in seven markets USM controls during 1994
includes USM's divestiture of another investment interest. This divestiture had
not been completed as of December 31, 1994. Finally, USM has entered into an
agreement to sell its 100% interest in one market for cash.

Management believes the acquisitions, exchanges and sales currently pending will
enhance USM's clustering strategy by divesting of markets which are less
strategic for cash or markets which add to its current clusters. All except one
of the pending acquisition, exchange and sale

agreements are expected to be completed during 1995. Certain of the divestitures
and exchanges will generate substantial gains for book and tax purposes.

TDS and USM are parties to a legal proceeding before the Federal Communications
Commission ("FCC") involving a cellular license in a Wisconsin Rural Service
Area. In March 1995, a preliminary settlement was reached with a group of
Wisconsin telephone companies (the "Settlement Group") involved in that
proceeding, and a definitive agreement was executed with another party to the
same proceeding. The proposed settlements, which follow extensive discovery by
the FCC and other parties, contemplate a summary decision finding that TDS and
its affiliates are fully qualified to be FCC licensees. The final settlements
will be subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement with the Settlement
Group and the action of the judge presiding in the FCC proceeding. See Note 15
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Legal Proceedings (La Star and
Wisconsin RSA 8 Applications), for further discussion of the proceeding
involving the Wisconsin RSA.

LIQUIDITY

The Company anticipates that the aggregate resources required for 1995 will
include approximately: (i) $180 million for capital spending and (ii) $12
million of scheduled debt repayments. Additionally, the Company anticipates it
will reimburse TDS, as each acquisition is completed, for TDS Common Shares
valued at approximately $85.6 million to be issued and $12.0 million in cash to
be paid by TDS to third parties in connection with acquisitions anticipated to
be completed by the end of 1995. The reimbursement to TDS is expected to be
in the form of 2.7 million Common Shares of the Company and borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement totaling $11.2 million. Not included in the above
amounts are those related to any acquisition agreements that the Company may
enter into in 1995. These potential acquisitions may require substantial funding
for both their acquisition and operation during 1995.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had $6 million of cash and cash equivalents,
$67 million remaining under the $300 million Revolving Credit Agreement with TDS
as amended effective November 30, 1994 and $57 million remaining under the new
vendor financing agreement entered into in 1994. Additionally, the Company
anticipates generating an increasing amount of positive cash flows from
operating activities during 1995.

Pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to an
aggregate of $300 million from TDS, at an interest rate equal to 1.5% above the
prime rate. The advances made by TDS under the Revolving Credit Agreement are
unsecured. Interest on the balance due under the Revolving Credit Agreement is
payable quarterly and no principal is payable until March 31, 1996, subject to
acceleration under certain circumstances, at which time the entire principal
balance then outstanding is scheduled to become due and payable. The Company may
prepay the balance due under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time,
in whole or in part, without premium.

The Company maintains shelf registration of its Common Shares and Preferred
Stock under the Securities Act of 1933 for issuance specifically in connection
with acquisitions.

The Company anticipates that it may require substantial funding to acquire
cellular markets and build and operate cellular systems during 1995. The timing
and amount of such funding requirements will depend on the timing of the
completion of pending acquisitions, the number of additional licenses acquired
by the Company, the construction and operational plans for the individual
cellular projects, and other relevant factors. The Company will need to raise
additional capital to meet these requirements. These additional requirements may
be met through internally generated funds, additional borrowings from TDS, the
issuance of equity or debt securities, vendor financing, bank financing, the
sale of assets or a combination of the above. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be made available to the Company on terms or at prices
acceptable to the Company. If sufficient funding is not made available to the
Company on terms and prices acceptable to the Company, the Company would have to
reduce its construction, development and acquisition programs. In the long term,
reduction of the Company's construction, development and acquisition programs
would have a negative impact on the ability of the Company to increase its
consolidated revenues and cash flows.

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
     ACCOUNTING POLICIES

United States Cellular Corporation (the "Company" or "USM"), is an 81.3%-owned
subsidiary of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. ("TDS").

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of USM, its majority-
owned subsidiaries and partnerships in which USM has a controlling majority
partnership interest. There were 130 consolidated operating entities in 1994,
116 in 1993 and 92 in 1992. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. Certain amounts reported in prior years have been
reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

REVENUES

Revenues from operations primarily consist of charges to customers for monthly
access, cellular airtime and data usage, roamer charges, toll charges and
vertical services. Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled
revenues, resulting from cellular service provided from the billing cycle date
to the end of each month and from other cellular carriers' customers using USM's
cellular systems for the last half of each month, are estimated and recorded.
Equipment sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges
to customers for cellular telephone user equipment purchased.

PENSION PLAN

United States Cellular Corporation's Employees' Pension Trust I (the "Pension
Trust"), a qualified noncontributory defined contribution pension plan began
effective January 1, 1994. It provides pension benefits for the employees of
USM. Under this plan, pension benefits and costs are calculated separately for
each participant and are funded currently. Pension costs were $1.0 million in
1994.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per Common and Series A Common Share for the years ended December 31,
1994 and 1992 was computed by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number
of Common Shares, Series A Common Shares and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock equivalents consist of Common
Shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock, Common Shares issuable in
the future to third parties in connection with completed acquisitions and Common
Share options and stock appreciation rights.

Earnings per Common and Series A Common Share for the year ended December 31,
1993 was computed by dividing Net (Loss) by the weighted average number of
Common Shares and Series A Common Shares outstanding during the year.

Pro forma Net (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 1993 would have been
reduced by $25.1 million for the interest expense eliminated by the pro forma
retirement, as of January 1, 1993, of the amount outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Agreement-TDS through the conversion of 4.8 million Common Shares and
5.5 million Series A Common Shares purchased by TDS in connection with the
November 1993 rights offering ("Rights Offering") ($340.7 million) and the
application of the proceeds from the sale of 1.1 million Common Shares to
parties other than TDS in connection with the Rights Offering ($36.8 million).
Under the above circumstances, pro forma (Loss) per Common Share would have been
reduced by $.45 to zero for the year ended December 31, 1993.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the plant assets.
The provision for depreciation as a percentage of average depreciable property,
plant and equipment was 10.5% in 1994, 1993 and 1992.

Property, plant and equipment in service consists of:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and those short-term, highly-liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying
amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates
its fair value.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable consists of amounts owed by customers for both service
provided and equipment sales, by other cellular carriers whose customers
have used USM's cellular systems, by affiliated entities and by other partners
for capital contributions and distributions.

INVENTORY

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
on a specific identification basis.

DEFERRED CHARGES

Deferred start-up costs represent expenses incurred prior to the commencement of
service in each individual market. These costs are capitalized and, upon
commencement of operations, amortized over five years. Deferred start-up costs
include expenses related to constructing the systems and expenses incurred in
preparing to market cellular service.

Other deferred charges primarily represent costs incurred for the development of
new systems and legal and other charges incurred relating to the preparation of
vendor financing agreements. Capitalized costs of systems development are
amortized over a five year period starting when the new system is placed in
service. When vendor financing is finalized for an entity, deferred charges
recorded on that entity's books are amortized over the financing period.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES

USM acquired certain cellular licenses and other cellular interests during 1994,
1993 and 1992. In conjunction with these acquisitions, the following assets were
acquired, liabilities assumed, Common Shares and shares of Redeemable Preferred
Stock issued and equity contributions made by TDS.

During 1994 and 1992, USM recorded gains on the exchange of its minority
interests in five and two Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSAs"), respectively,
which are not included in the table above. See Note 11 Gain on Sale of Cellular
Interests for a discussion of the effects of the exchanges.

During 1993, USM converted $340.7 million of debt under the Revolving Credit
Agreement into equity through the issuance of approximately 4.8 million Common
Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares to TDS in connection with the
Rights Offering.

During 1993, USM recorded $40.3 million of additional borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement as reimbursement to TDS for TDS Common Shares issued
and issuable in lieu of 1.7 million USM Common Shares that were to
be issued in 1994 through 1996 in connection with completed acquisitions.

2.  ACQUISITIONS
USM has acquired cellular interests for cash, promissory notes, USM and TDS
Common Shares, and shares of TDS Preferred Stock.

TDS made capital contributions totaling $9.4 million in 1993 and $7.5 million in
1992 pursuant to TDS's agreement to fund certain cellular license invest-
ments made by USM.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO RSA TRANSFERS
USM entered into two agreements during 1990 to acquire from TDS certain rights,
held directly and indirectly by TDS, in construction permits, licenses and
licensees for 51 Rural Service Areas ("RSAs"). USM agreed to issue an aggregate
of 10.15 million shares of common stock to TDS, consisting of 3.05 million
Common Shares and 7.10 million Series A Common Shares.

In 1993, one RSA Interest was transferred to USM for which USM delivered 31,281
Common Shares and 75,002 Series A Common Shares to TDS. In 1992, four RSA
Interests were transferred to USM for which USM delivered 385,206 Common Shares
and 923,588 Series A Common Shares to TDS.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PENDING ACQUISITIONS. At December 31, 1994, the Company, or TDS for the benefit
of the Company, had entered into agreements to acquire controlling interests in
seven markets and two minority interests representing approximately 1.2 million
population equivalents for an aggregate consideration estimated to be
approximately $101.5 million. If all of the pending acquisitions are completed
as planned, the Company will issue approximately 102,000 of its Common Shares.
TDS will pay approximately $98.3 million in cash and TDS Common Shares. Any
cellular interests acquired by TDS in these transactions are expected to be
assigned to the Company and at the time this occurs the Company will reimburse
TDS for TDS's consideration delivered and costs incurred in such acquisitions in
the form of Common Shares of the Company and notes payable.

3.  INVESTMENT IN LICENSES
Investment in licenses consists of the costs incurred in acquiring Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") licenses or interests in entities which have
filed for or have been awarded FCC licenses to provide cellular service. These
costs include amounts paid to license applicants and owners of interests in
cellular entities awarded licenses; amounts paid for legal, engineering and
consulting services; amounts incurred by USM and its parent, TDS, in acquiring
these interests; and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over 40 years,
upon commencement of operations, or at the date of acquisition when USM acquires
an interest in an operating system. Costs applicable to unsuccessful license
applications and acquisitions are charged to expense. Cellular license costs
with an unamortized financial reporting basis of approximately $305.6 million
have no tax basis because the associated purchase transactions were structured
to be tax-free. This basis difference is goodwill and no deferred taxes have
been provided.

Investment in licenses consists of the following:

4.  MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES
The Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
effective January 1, 1994. SFAS No. 115 addresses the accounting and reporting
for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values
and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be
classified in one of three categories: a) held-to-maturity securities, reported
at amortized cost; b) trading securities, reported at fair value; and c)
available-for-sale securities, reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of
shareholders' equity.

Information regarding the Company's available-for-sale securities is summarized
below.

The Company's net unrealized holding gain on available-for-sale securities was
$1.3 million (net of income taxes of $677,000) in 1994. The Company's net
unrealized holding loss was $626,000 in 1993. These unrealized gains and losses
have been included as an addition to and reduction of common shareholders'
equity, respectively. No sales or transfers of these securities have occurred
during 1994.

5.   REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
USM has unsecured notes payable to TDS and Telecommunications Technologies Fund,
Inc. ("TTF"), a wholly owned subsidiary of TDS, pursuant to a Revolving Credit
Agreement. USM repaid approximately $377.5 million of debt under the Revolving
Credit Agreement with the proceeds of its 1993 Rights Offering.

The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement provide for borrowings with
interest, at the prime rate plus 1.5% (for a rate of 10.0% at December 31,
1994), due quarterly. The Revolving Credit Agreement has been amended by TDS
from time to time to change the size of the borrowing facility. Most recently,
the facility was amended effective November 30, 1994, to provide for borrowings
up to a maximum of $300 million. Any borrowing under the Revolving Credit
Agreement may be

<PAGE>

36


prepaid in whole or in part, without premium, with any prepayment reinstating
credit in the amount of such prepayment. No principal under the Revolving Credit
Agreement is due until March 31, 1996, on which date the Revolving Credit
Agreement terminates and all unpaid principal and accrued interest thereon are
due and payable. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement also include, among
others, restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness and on paying
dividends. The carrying value of USM's borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Agreement approximates their fair value, as the Revolving Credit Agreement is
variable debt with the interest rate based on the prime rate.

6.   LONG-TERM DEBT
USM has three arrangements for the financing of cellular system equipment and
construction costs with an equipment vendor. One is arranged through the
individual entities which USM manages and the other two are with USM directly.
The loans under the first arrangement bear interest at a rate approximating the
prime rate (8.5% at December 31, 1994) and have interest deferred during the
first year. Deferred interest and principal must be repaid over the succeeding
seven years. The loans are secured by all of the assets of these individual
entities and by some or all of the various owners' interests in the entities.
Amounts borrowed which relate to goods or services not provided by the vendor
are guaranteed by USM.

As of December 31, 1994, $22.2 million of financing had been completed under
this arrangement, all of which was for those subsidiaries and partnerships
included in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of financing
outstanding under this arrangement for all consolidated subsidiaries and
partnerships at December 31, 1994 was $2.3 million.

During 1991, USM entered into a second long-term financing agreement with the
same equipment vendor. The agreement provided for new borrowings of up to $52
million to finance USM's equipment purchases and construction costs, and for the
refinancing of previous borrowings of up to $4 million. The borrowings are
senior obligations of USM and are collateralized by a secured interest in the
tangible assets (excluding customer accounts receivable) and certain intangible
assets of certain of USM's operating subsidiaries, excluding any interest in
such operating subsidiaries' FCC licenses. Borrowings have terms of seven to
eight years at an interest rate of 2.3% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate
of high-grade, unsecured notes (for a rate of 8.6% at December 31, 1994). At
December 31, 1994, the amount of new borrowings outstanding was $42.1 million
and the amount of refinancing of previous borrowings outstanding was $2.3
million.


During 1994, USM entered into a third long-term financing agreement with the
same equipment vendor. The agreement provided for, among other things, new
borrowings of up to $75 million to finance USM's equipment purchases and
construction costs. The borrowings are collateralized by the same secured
interest as the 1991 arrangement. Terms of the borrowings are for seven years at
an interest rate of 2.25% over the 90-day Commercial Paper Rate of high-grade,
unsecured notes (for a rate of 8.5% at December 31, 1994). USM had completed
$18.0 million of new borrowings under the new agreement as of December 31, 1994.

The carrying value of USM's long-term debt, $69.3 million, is more than its fair
value, estimated to be $64.3 million. The fair value was estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis.

Long-term debt is as follows:

TAX-DEFERRED SAVINGS PLAN. USM has reserved 26,070 Common Shares for issue under
the TDS Tax-Deferred Savings Plan, a qualified profit-sharing plan pursuant to
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees
have the option of investing their contributions in TDS Common Shares, USM
Common Shares or four other non-affiliated funds.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. USM sold 20,244 Common Shares to its employees at
$16.15 per share in connection with the 1992 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

STOCK OPTION AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN. USM has reserved 1,010,000
Common Shares and 55,000 Series A Common Shares for options granted to key
employees. USM has established a Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan
(as amended on February 1, 1991) that provides for the grant of stock options
and stock appreciation rights to officers and employees. The options are
exercisable one year from the date of the award through November 1, 1997, or
thirty days following the date of the employee's termination of employment, if
earlier. At December 31, 1994, 64,909 stock options were outstanding at a price
of $15.67 per share.

Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") allow the grantee to receive an amount in
Common Shares or cash, or a combination thereof, equivalent to the difference
between the exercise price and the fair market value of the Common Shares on the
exercise date. At December 31, 1994, 45,000 Common Share SARs and 36,000 Series
A Common Share SARs were outstanding at $15.00 per share. These rights expire
from 1998 to 2003 or the date of the person's termination of employment, if
earlier. During 1994, 1993 and 1992, 1,200, 1,800 and 600 Common Share SARs were
exercised, respectively. Compensation expense, measured on the difference
between the option prices and the year-end market price of the Common Shares,
aggregated $71,000 in 1994, $598,000 in 1993 and $67,000 in 1992.

RIGHTS OFFERING
In the fourth quarter of 1993, USM completed a rights offering to holders of its
common stock. Pursuant to the rights offering, common shareholders received one
right for every five shares owned on October 22, 1993. Each right enabled the
holder to purchase one additional share of common stock at the exercise price of
$33.00 per share, which was a 10% discount from the closing market price of
USM's Common Shares on October 22, 1993. USM issued approximately 5.9 million
Common Shares and 5.5 million Series A Common Shares in connection with the
rights offering. Approximately 4.8 million Common Shares and all of the Series A
Common Shares were purchased by TDS.

SERIES A COMMON SHARES
Series A Common Shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Common
Shares. As of December 31, 1994, all of USM's outstanding Series A Common Shares
were held by TDS.

8.   REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
Redeemable Preferred Stock, authorized 5,000,000 shares, has a stated
liquidation value of $100 per share, is not entitled to any dividends and is
redeemable in 1995 through 1996. The Redeemable Preferred Stock is issuable in
series by the Board of Directors, who establish the terms of the issue. At
December 31, 1994, all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock were held by TDS as
reimbursement for TDS Preferred Shares issued in connection with acquisitions.
The fair value of Redeemable Preferred Stock is estimated to be approximately
$30.9 million using the net present value of the Common Shares to

be issued upon conversion, valued at the December 31, 1994 quoted market price.
At December 31, 1994 all of the Redeemable Preferred Stock is redeemable by USM
by the delivery of Common Shares as shown in the following table.

All of the preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 1994 were issued in
1991. During 1994, 8,618 Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares were redeemed for
55,213 USM Common Shares.

9.   INCOME TAXES
USM is included in a consolidated federal income tax return with other members
of the TDS consolidated group.

TDS and USM entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement (the "Agreement") effective
July 1, 1987. The Agreement provides that USM and its subsidiaries be included
in a consolidated federal income tax return and in state income or franchise tax
returns in certain situations with the TDS affiliated group unless TDS requests
otherwise. USM and its subsidiaries calculate their losses and credits as if
they comprised a separate affiliated group. Under the Agreement, USM is able to
carry forward its losses and credits and use them to offset any future income
tax liabilities to TDS. The amount of federal net operating loss carryforward
available to offset future taxable income aggregated approximately $165 million
at December 31, 1994 and expires between 2002 and 2009.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires companies to record all deferred tax
liabilities or assets for the deferred tax consequences of all temporary
differences. Additionally, the statement requires that deferred tax balances be
adjusted to reflect new tax rates when they are enacted into law. The cumulative
effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 109 on years prior to 1993 had an
immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income tax
expense for 1994 and 1993 reflects the new method of accounting; income tax
expense for prior years has not been restated.

In August of 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the
statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent. 1993
federal income tax expense was not affected as a result of this change.

Federal income tax expense recorded in 1994, 1993 and 1992 primarily relates to
consolidated subsidiaries not included in the TDS consolidated federal income
tax return. State income tax expense recorded in 1994 and 1993 was primarily
related to subsidiaries generating taxable income after utilization of state net
operating losses. State income tax expense recorded in 1992 was primarily
generated by the gains on the sale and exchange of cellular interests completed
in 1992. The amount of state net operating loss carryforward available to offset
future taxable income aggregated approximately $227 million at December 31, 1994
and expires between 1998 and 2009. Income tax provisions charged to expense are
summarized below:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A valuation allowance has been provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. During 1994, the
valuation allowance increased $7.6 million primarily due to USM's 1994 net
taxable loss. USM had current deferred tax assets totaling $926,000 at
December 31, 1994, resulting primarily from the allowance for customer
receivables.

The statutory federal income tax rate is reconciled to the Company's effective
income tax rate below.

10.  RELATED PARTIES
USM is billed for all services it receives from TDS, consisting primarily of
information processing and general management services. Such billings are based
on expenses specifically identified to USM and on allocations of common
expenses. Such allocations are based on the relationship of USM's assets and
revenues to the total assets and revenues of TDS. Management believes the method
used to allocate common expenses is reasonable. Billings to USM from TDS
amounted to $22.1 million in 1994, $22.9 million in 1993 and $13.8 million in
1992. Management believes that all expenses and costs applicable to USM are
reflected in the accompanying financial statements on a basis which is
representative of what they would have been if USM operated on a stand-alone
basis.

All markets managed by USM are billed for services they receive from USM
consisting primarily of accounting, billing and engineering services. Such
billings are based on expenses specifically identified to each market and on
allocations of common expenses. Such allocations are based on the relationships
of each market's assets and revenues to the total assets and revenues of all the
markets managed by USM. Billings to nonconsolidated, managed markets amounted to
$5.6 million in 1994, $7.6 million in 1993 and $7.5 million in 1992. Management
believes that all expenses and costs applicable to each market are
representative of what they would have been if each managed
market operated on a stand-alone basis.

USM bills roaming charges to another market when that market's customers roam in
USM-managed markets. When the customer's home market is also a USM-managed
market, the transaction is intercompany in nature and a uniform per-minute
billing rate is used to bill substantially all USM-managed markets. This rate
generally differs from those rates USM uses to bill other non-USM-managed
markets.

Interest income primarily includes interest on loans to managed unconsolidated
markets used to fund these markets' ongoing construction and operating expenses.
Interest income from these markets amounted to $1.9 million in 1994 and
1993 and $2.1 million in 1992.

USM has a Cash Management Agreement with TDS under which USM may from time to
time deposit its excess cash with TDS for investment under TDS's cash management
program. Deposits made under the agreement are available to USM on demand and
bear interest each month at the 30-day Commercial Paper Rate as reported in The
Wall Street Journal, plus 1/4%, or such higher rate as TDS may at its discretion
offer on such deposits.

11.  GAIN ON SALE OF CELLULAR INTERESTS
The gains in 1994 reflect the transfer of USM's cost-basis minority interests in
five MSAs in exchange for additional interests in seven MSAs controlled by USM.
The exchange of the minority interests in the five MSAs has been recorded at the
fair market value of approximately $4.3 million. A gain of $3.3 million,
representing the excess of the fair market value of the MSA interests traded
over the book value of such interests, was included in income for 1994.

The gains in 1993 reflect primarily the sale of two cellular minority interests.
USM received $6.8 million cash consideration on the sales.

The gains in 1992 reflect the sales and exchange of minority- and majority-owned
cellular interests as follows: (a) USM transferred its controlling interests in
two RSAs, its cost-basis minority interests in two MSAs and approximately $2.9
million in cash in exchange for controlling interests in two other MSAs

<PAGE>

and a  minority interest in a combined MSA/RSA system. The exchange of the
controlling interests in the RSAs has been recorded using book values, with no
gain or loss recognized on the exchange. The exchange of the minority interests
in the two MSAs has been recorded at the fair market value of approximately
$15.7 million. A gain of $11.4 million, representing the excess of the fair
market value of the MSA interests traded over the book value of such interests,
was included in income for 1992. (b) USM sold a majority interest in an MSA in
exchange for certain marketable equity securities then valued at $18.2 million.
A gain of $17.1 million was recognized on the sale. (c) USM sold a minority
interest in an MSA for $3.8 million in cash. A gain of $2.9 million was
recognized on the sale.

12.  LEASE COMMITMENTS
USM and certain of its majority-owned partnerships and subsidiaries lease
certain office and cell site locations under operating leases. Future minimum
rental payments required under operating leases that have noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 1994 are as follows:

Rent expense totaled $6.4 million in 1994, $4.7 million in 1993 and $3.2 million
in 1992.

13.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The partnerships and corporations in which USM is a partner or shareholder are
in various stages of development. USM expects to spend approximately $180
million during 1995 for both enhancements to existing systems and construction
of new systems. Under the terms of certain partnership and shareholder
agreements, USM may be committed to funding other partners' or shareholders'
portions of construction and other costs, if sufficient financing is not
available to the individual entities. USM does not expect such individual
financing shortfalls to be material.

USM has an ongoing acquisition program to maximize its growth. For a discussion
of pending acquisitions, see Note 2 Acquisitions.

Under USM's financing arrangement with an equipment vendor, amounts borrowed
which relate to goods or services not provided by that vendor are guaranteed by
USM. As of December 31, 1994, long-term debt in the amount of $1.0 million was
guaranteed by USM under this arrangement.

COLLECTIBILITY OF NOTE RECEIVABLE
As of December 31, 1994, USM loaned a total of $5.0 million to another cellular
company ("Cellular Co.") under a long-term financing agreement. Under the
agreement, USM will provide up to $6 million to finance Cellular Co.'s equipment
purchases and construction costs related to the operations in an RSA. Loans made
under the agreement bear interest at a rate approximating the prime rate plus
1.5%. Borrowings are secured by certain of Cellular Co.'s assets, primarily
those relating to the operations of the aforementioned RSA. All principal
amounts and any interest amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2000 become due and
payable at that time and the agreement terminates on that date. Provisions of
the agreement include Cellular Co. maintaining a minimum cellular subscriber
base, generating a minimum amount of cash flow and restrictions on Cellular Co.
incurring additional indebtedness or paying dividends to partners. USM has no
assurance that Cellular Co. will have sufficient assets at the time the
principal payment is due to repay the loans in full. No accrual has been made
for this possibility and the note is being carried on the balance sheet at the
full loan amount as of December 31, 1994.

STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT
The Company has entered into a standby letter of credit agreement effective July
20, 1994 with a financial institution. This standby letter of credit, which will
not exceed $9.9 million, provides supplemental security in support of a bank
loan to an entity minority-owned by the Company. The bank loan, which is secured
primarily by a first mortgage on the tangible and intangible assets of a
cellular operating system constructed by the minority-owned entity, was arranged
to finance the construction of this cellular system, the acquisition of
customers and the initial operation of the system.

The cellular license for this system was originally awarded to a third party
which constructed its own cellular system. The third party's license application
was subsequently found to be flawed by the FCC, and the license was then awarded
to the entity

                                                                              41


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

minority-owned by the Company. The third party has sought reconsideration of the
license grant to the entity minority-owned by the Company and several appeals
have been filed concerning the FCC's decision, including one by the third party.
If any of these appeals are successful, the license may be removed from the
entity minority-owned by the Company. If the third party resumes providing
cellular service, it will not be obligated to purchase the minority-owned
entity's cellular system. Such removal of the license from the minority-owned
entity constitutes an event of default under its bank loan agreement, and the
bank may call upon the Company's standby letter of credit to satisfy any amounts
still due under this loan agreement.

14.  INVESTMENTS IN CELLULAR PARTNERSHIPS
Investments in cellular partnerships consist of amounts invested in cellular
entities in which USM holds a minority or noncontrolling interest. Investments
in cellular partnerships consist of long-term investments and investments held
for sale or exchange, as follows:

</TABLE>

USM follows the equity method of accounting for its long-term investments which
recognizes, on a current basis, USM's proportionate share of the incomes and
losses accruing to it under the terms of its partnership and shareholder
agreements. The equity method is followed for minority interests in markets that
are managed by USM and for certain markets managed by others.

USM follows the cost method of accounting for its investments in markets held
for sale or exchange, and such investments are recorded at the lower of cost or
market value. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of USM's
investments in cellular partnerships held for sale or exchange due to the lack
of quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair values without
incurring excessive costs. The $13.3 million carrying amount at December 31,
1994, represents primarily the original amounts invested, which management
believes are not impaired.

The following summarizes the unaudited balance sheets and results of operations
of the cellular system partnerships in which USM's investments are accounted
for by the equity method.

In two separate actions filed, on October 7, 1993, and February 15, 1994, now
consolidated, two agents of the competing carrier have named the Los Angeles
SMSA Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") as a defendant. The general
allegations include violations of California Unfair Practices Act and price
fixing. At a recent mandatory settlement conference, plaintiffs asked for $6
million from all defendants to settle

the above claims  ($2.5 million from AirTouch Cellular, including the
Partnership). The proposed settlement offer has not been accepted.

In May 1994, several former and current agents of the competing carrrier have
named the Partnership in only one cause of action. This cause of action alleges
a conspiracy with the competing carrier to fix the prices of cellular service in
violation of state antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are seeking damages in excess
of $100,000 for each of the plaintiff agents.

On November 24, 1993, October 17, 1994 and November 30, 1994, three separate
class action (not yet certified) suits were filed against the Partnership
alleging conspiracy with a competing carrier to fix the price of cellular
service in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are
seeking injunctive relief and substantial monetary damages in excess of $100
million before trebling.

On July 18, 1994, AirTouch Cellular was served with a class action (not yet
certified) suit on behalf of the Partnership's authorized agents. The complaint
alleges "predatory practices" and seeks damages in excess of $1.6 million per
agent, plus statutory treble damages.

15.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings before the FCC and
various state and federal courts. In some cases, the litigation involves
disputes regarding rights to certain cellular telephone systems. The more
significant proceedings involving the Company are described in the following
paragraphs.

LA STAR AND WISCONSIN RSA 8 APPLICATIONS. USM indirectly owns 49% of La Star
Cellular Telephone Company ("La Star"), which was an applicant for a
construction permit for a cellular system in the New Orleans MSA. In June 1992,
the FCC affirmed an Administrative Law Judge's order which had granted the
application of another applicant and dismissed La Star's application. The basis
for the FCC's action was its finding that USM improperly controlled La Star. In
a footnote to its decision, the FCC stated questions regarding the conduct of
USM in that proceeding may be revisited in future proceedings. As a result of
that footnote, FCC authorizations in uncontested FCC proceedings have been
granted to TDS and its subsidiaries subject to any subsequent action the FCC
might take concerning its findings and conclusions in the La Star decision.

La Star, TDS and USM appealed the FCC's decision in the La Star proceeding. On
March 29, 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit vacated the FCC's decision in the La Star proceeding and remanded the
matter to the FCC for further proceedings. On remand, the FCC affirmed the
dismissal of the La Star application but did not address the subject matter of
its footnote in the original La Star decision. As a result, the Wisconsin RSA 8
case, discussed below, now constitutes the only FCC expression calling for
conditions on authorizations to TDS and its subsidiaries.

On February 1, 1994, in a proceeding involving a license originally issued to
TDS for Wisconsin RSA 8, the FCC instituted a hearing to determine whether in
the La Star case USM had misrepresented facts to, lacked candor in its dealings
with or attempted to mislead the FCC and, if so, whether TDS possesses the
requisite character qualifications to hold that Wisconsin license. The FCC
stated in its decision that, pending resolution of the issues in the Wisconsin
proceeding, subsequent authorizations to TDS and its subsidiaries would be
conditioned on the outcome of that proceeding. TDS was granted interim authority
to continue to operate that Wisconsin system pending completion of the hearing.

Following extensive discovery by the FCC and other parties, TDS and USM have
reached preliminary and definitive settlement agreements with parties to the
proceeding contemplating a summary decision finding TDS and its affiliates fully
qualified to be FCC licensees. Pending the negotiation of a definitive
settlement agreement with a group of Wisconsin telephone companies who are
parties to the proceeding, the hearing has been postponed. Final settlement will
also be subject to the action of the judge presiding in the proceeding.

TOWNES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., ET. AL. V. TDS, ET. AL. Plaintiffs Townes
Telecommunications Inc., Tatum Telephone Company and Tatum Cellular Telephone
Company filed a suit on September 4, 1991 in the District Court of Rusk County,
Texas, against both TDS and USM as defendants. Plaintiffs made a number of
allegations, including usurpation, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy,
breach of contract, tortious interference and other claims, and sought a variety
of remedies, including unspecified damages not to exceed $33 million and as much
as $200 million in punitive damages.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The case went to trial on April 25, 1994. On May 5, 1994, the jury returned a
verdict in favor of TDS and USM on all issues. The plaintiffs filed an appeal of
the case on September 12, 1994. The parties have executed an agreement which
settles all matters related to this litigation and this case has been dismissed
with prejudice on February 14, 1995. The settlement agreement requires
plaintiffs to purchase a minority cellular interest from the Company at a
negotiated purchase price which the Company believes approximates fair market
value, and does not require the payment of any money by the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UNITED STATES CELLULAR
CORPORATION:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United States
Cellular Corporation (a Delaware corporation and an 81.3%-owned subsidiary of
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in common
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the financial statements of the Los Angeles SMSA, Baton Rouge MSA and
Nashville/Clarksville MSA limited partnerships. The Company's investment in
these partnerships is reflected in the accompanying financial statements using
the equity method of accounting. The investment in these limited partnerships
represented $45,694,000 and $38,447,000 (or 3.0% and 3.1%) of total consolidated
assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and the equity in their
income represents $21,189,000, $15,364,000 and $10,436,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and is included in the
consolidated net income (loss). The summarized financial information contained
in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes financial
information for the aforementioned partnerships. The financial statements of
those limited partnerships were audited by other auditors whose reports have
been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for those limited partnerships, is based solely on the reports of the
other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of United States Cellular Corporation and Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
method of accounting for income taxes was changed effective January 1, 1993.

The report of other auditors on the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership
referred to above includes explanatory paragraphs relating to uncertainties as
discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
ultimate outcome of these actions is uncertain at this time. Accordingly, no
accrual for these matters has been made in the consolidated financial
statements.
