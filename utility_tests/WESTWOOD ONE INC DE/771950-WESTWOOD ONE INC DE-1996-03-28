ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

GENERAL

Westwood One, Inc. (the "Company" or "Westwood  One") is a leading  producer and
distributor of nationally  sponsored  radio programs and is the nation's  second
largest radio network.  In addition,  the Company owns and operates Westwood One
Broadcasting Services,  Inc. ("WBS"), which provides local traffic, news, sports
and weather  programming  to radio stations and other media outlets in New York,
Chicago,  Los  Angeles  and  Philadelphia.  Westwood  One is managed by Infinity
Broadcasting  Corporation  pursuant to a five-year  Management  Agreement  which
expires on February 3, 1999.

The Company's  principal  source of revenue is selling radio time to advertisers
through one of three operating divisions:  Westwood One Radio Networks, Westwood
One Entertainment (the "Network Divisions"),  and effective March 1996, WBS. The
Company  generates revenue  principally by its Network  Divisions  entering into
radio station affiliation agreements to obtain audience and commercial spots and
then  selling  the  spots  to  national   advertisers.   WBS  generates  revenue
principally  by selling  audience it obtains from radio stations and other media
outlets where it has  operations to local as well as national  advertisers.  The
Company is strategically  positioned to provide a broad range of programming and
services which both deliver audience to advertisers and news, talk,  sports, and
entertainment programs to radio stations.

Westwood  One Radio  Networks  offers  radio  stations  three  traditional  news
services,  CNN Radio, NBC Radio Network and the Mutual Broadcasting System, plus
youth-oriented  network news and  entertainment  programming from The Source, in
addition to eight 24-hour satellite-delivered  continuous play music formats and
weekday and weekend news and entertainment features and programs.

Westwood  One  Entertainment  produces  music,  sports,  talk and special  event
programming.  These  programs  include:  countdown  shows;  music and  interview
programs;  live concert broadcasts;  major sporting events (principally covering
the NFL, Notre Dame football and other college  football and basketball  games);
live,  personality intensive talk shows; and exclusive satellite simulcasts with
HBO and other cable networks.

The Company's  programs are broadcast in every radio market in the United States
measured by The  Arbitron  Ratings  Company  ("Arbitron"),  the  leading  rating
service, as well as being broadcast internationally.

WBS provides radio stations and other media  outlets,  including  television and
cable companies, with local traffic, news, sports and weather programming in New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

Westwood One, through its Divisions,  enables  national  advertisers to purchase
advertising  time  and to have  their  commercial  messages  broadcast  on radio
stations  throughout  the  United  States,   reaching   demographically  defined
listening  audiences.  The Company delivers both of the major demographic groups
targeted by national advertisers:  the 25 to 54-year old adult market and the 12
to 34-year-old  youth market.  The Company  currently sells  advertising time to
over 300 national  advertisers,  including each of the 25 largest  network radio
advertisers. Radio stations are able to obtain quality programming from Westwood
One to meet  their  objective  of  attracting  larger  listening  audiences  and
increasing local advertising  revenue.  Westwood One, through the development of
internal programming as well as through acquisitions, has developed an extensive
tape  library  of   previously   aired   programs,   interviews,   live  concert
performances, news and special events.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

   Radio Broadcasting

As of January 1, 1996, there were approximately  9,750 commercial radio stations
in the United States.

A radio station  selects a style of  programming  ("format") to attract a target
listening audience and thereby attract commercial  advertising  directed at that
audience.  There are many  formats  from which a station may  select,  including
news, talk, sports and various types of music and entertainment programming.


                                       1
<PAGE>

The diversity in program formats has intensified  competition among stations for
local advertising revenue. A radio station has two principal ways of effectively
competing for these revenues.  First, it can  differentiate  itself in its local
market by selecting and successfully executing a format targeted at a particular
audience  thus  enabling  advertisers  to place  their  commercial  messages  on
stations aimed at audiences with certain demographic characteristics.  A station
can also  broadcast  special  programming,  sporting  events  or  national  news
product,  such as supplied by Westwood  One, not  available  to its  competitors
within its format.  National  programming  broadcast on an exclusive  geographic
basis can help  differentiate a station within its market,  and thereby enable a
station to increase its audience and local advertising revenue.

   Radio Advertising

Radio advertising time can be purchased on a local,  regional or national basis.
Local  purchases allow an advertiser to select specific radio stations in chosen
geographic  markets for the  broadcast of  commercial  messages.  However,  this
process can be  expensive  and  inefficient.  Local and regional  purchases  are
typically  best suited for an advertiser  whose  business or ad campaign is in a
specific  geographic  area.  Advertising  purchased  from a radio network is one
method  by which  an  advertiser  gets its  commercial  messages  to a  specific
demographic audience,  achieving national coverage on a cost efficient basis. In
addition,  an  advertiser  can choose to  emphasize  their  message in a certain
market or  markets  by  supplementing  a national  purchase  with  local  and/or
regional purchases.

In recent  years the  increase in the number of program  formats has led to more
demographically  specific  listening  audiences,  making  radio  an  attractive,
alternative medium for national advertisers.  In addition,  nationally broadcast
news, concerts and special event programming have made radio an effective medium
of reach (size of listening audiences) as well as frequency (number of exposures
to the target audience).

To verify audience delivery and demographic  composition,  specific  measurement
information is available to national  advertisers by independent rating services
such as Arbitron and Statistical  Research,  Inc.'s RADAR. These rating services
provide  demographic  information  such as the age  and sex  composition  of the
listening  audiences.  Consequently,  national advertisers can verify that their
advertisements are being heard by their target listening audience.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Westwood One's Network Divisions provide targeted radio audiences and commercial
spots to national  advertisers  through  its  recognized  programming  and other
network products. The Company, through its various radio networks,  produces and
distributes  quality  programming  to radio  stations  seeking to increase their
listening  audience and improve  local and  national  advertising  revenue.  The
Company  sells  advertising  time within its  programs  to national  advertisers
desiring to reach large listening audiences nationwide with specific demographic
characteristics.

In February 1994, the Company acquired Unistar Radio Networks,  Inc. ("Unistar")
for $101,300,000 plus expenses along with the following additional  transactions
(see Notes 4, 7, 8 and 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements):

     (a)  the  sale  by  the  Company  to  Infinity  Network,  Inc.  ("INI"),  a
          wholly-owned   subsidiary   of   Infinity   Broadcasting   Corporation
          ("Infinity"),  of 5,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock and a
          warrant to purchase  up to an  additional  3,000,000  shares of Common
          Stock at an exercise  price of $3.00 per share,  for a total  purchase
          price of $15,000,000;

     (b)  a Management  Agreement  between the Company and Infinity  pursuant to
          which (a) the Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Infinity,  currently  Mel
          Karmazin,  became the Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  (b) the
          Chief Financial Officer of Infinity,  currently Farid Suleman,  became
          the Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Company and (c)  Infinity  began
          managing  the  business  and  operations  for an  annual  base  fee of
          $2,000,000 (adjusted for inflation),  an annual cash bonus (payable in
          the  event  of  meeting  certain  financial  targets)  and  additional
          warrants to acquire up to 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable
          after the  Company's  Common Stock reaches  certain  market prices per
          share.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     (c)  a Voting Agreement  providing for the  reconstitution  of the Board of
          Directors into a nine-member  Board and the voting of Norman  Pattiz's
          shares of the Company's  Common Stock and Class B Stock and the shares
          of the Common Stock held by INI.

In 1996, the Company  expanded its strategy to include  providing local traffic,
news,  sports and weather  programming to radio stations and other media outlets
in selected  cities across the United  States.  In March 1996,  WBS acquired the
operating assets of New York Shadow Traffic Limited Partnership,  Chicago Shadow
Traffic Limited Partnership, Los Angeles Shadow Traffic Limited Partnership, and
Philadelphia Express Traffic Limited Partnership (collectively "Shadow Traffic")
for  $20,000,000  plus expenses,  subject to an adjustment  based on future cash
flow (See Note 17 to Consolidated  Financial  Statements).  In addition, WBS has
options to acquire the Shadow operations in other cities.

      Radio Programming

The Company produces and distributes 24-hour continuous play formats,  regularly
scheduled and special syndicated  programs,  including  exclusive live concerts,
music and interview shows, national music countdowns,  lifestyle short features,
news broadcasts, talk programs, sporting events, and sports features.

The Company controls most aspects of production of its programs, therefore being
able to tailor  its  programs  to  respond to  current  and  changing  listening
preferences.  The  Company  produces  regularly  scheduled  short-form  programs
(typically  5 minutes  or less),  long-form  programs  (typically  60 minutes or
longer) and 24-hour continuous play formats.  Typically, the short-form programs
are  produced  at the  Company's  in-house  facilities  located in Culver  City,
California,  New York, New York and Arlington,  Virginia. The long-form programs
include shows produced entirely at the Company's in-house production  facilities
and recordings of live concert  performances and sports events made on location.
The 24-hour continuous play formats are produced at the Company's  facilities in
Valencia, California.

Westwood One also produces and distributes special event syndicated programs. In
1995 the Company  produced and  distributed  numerous  special  event  programs,
including  exclusive  broadcasts  of REM, Page and Plant and an HBO simulcast of
the Rock'N Roll Hall of Fame concert.

Westwood One obtains most of the programming for its concert series by recording
live concert  performances of prominent  recording artists.  The agreements with
these  artists  often  provide the  exclusive  right to  broadcast  the concerts
worldwide over the radio (whether live or pre-recorded) for a specific period of
time.  The Company  may also obtain  interviews  with the  recording  artist and
retain a copy of the  recording of the concert and the  interview for use in its
radio  programs and as additions to its extensive  tape library.  The agreements
provide the artist with  master  recordings  of their  concerts  and  nationwide
exposure on affiliated radio stations.  In certain cases the artists may receive
compensation.

Westwood  One's  syndicated  programs are  produced at its  in-house  production
facilities.  The Company  determines the content and style of a program based on
the target audience it wishes to reach. The Company assigns a producer,  writer,
narrator  or host,  interviewer  and other  personnel  to record and produce the
programs.  Because Westwood One controls the production  process,  it can refine
the  programs'  content to respond to the needs of its  affiliated  stations and
national  advertisers.  In addition,  the Company can alter  program  content in
response to current and anticipated  audience  demand.

The Company  produces and  distributes  eight  24-hour  continuous  play formats
providing  music,  news and talk  programming  for Country,  Hot Country,  Adult
Contemporary, Soft AC, Oldies, Adult Standards, Adult Rock and Roll and the 70's
formats.  Using its production facilities in Valencia,  California,  the Company
provides all the programming for stations affiliated with each of these formats.
Affiliates  compensate  the Company for these  formats by providing  the Company
with a portion of their commercial air time and, in most cases, cash fees.

The Company  believes  that its tape library is a valuable  asset for its future
programming and revenue generating capabilities. The library contains previously
broadcast programs, live concert performances,  interviews, daily news programs,
sports and  entertainment  features,  Capitol Hill  hearings  and other  special
events.  New programs can be created and  developed at a low cost by  excerpting
material from the library.

      Affiliated Radio Stations

Westwood One's radio network business strategy is to provide for the programming
needs of radio  stations by  supplying to radio  stations  programs and services
that  individual  stations  may not be able to produce on their own. The Company
offers radio stations a wide selection of regularly  scheduled and special event
syndicated  programming  as well  as  24-hour  continuous  play  formats.  These
programs and formats are completely produced by the Company and, therefore,  the
stations  have no  production  costs.  Typically,  each  program is offered  for
broadcast by the Company  exclusively to one station in its  geographic  market,
which  assists  the  station  in  competing  for  audience  share  in its  local
marketplace.  In addition, except for news programming,  Westwood One's programs
contain  available  commercial  air  time  that the  stations  may sell to local
advertisers. Westwood One typically distributes promotional announcements to the
stations and places advertisements in trade and consumer publications to further
promote the upcoming broadcast of its programs.

Westwood One's networks enter into  affiliation  agreements with radio stations.
In the case of news and current events  programming,  the agreements  commit the
station to broadcast only the advertisements  associated with these programs and
allows the station  flexibility to have the news headlined by their newscasters.
The other  affiliation  agreements  require a station to broadcast the Company's
programs and to use a portion of the program's  commercial slots to air national
advertisements  and any related  promotional  spots. With respect to the 24-hour
formats, the Company may also receive a fee from the affiliated stations for the
right to broadcast the formats.  Radio stations in the top 200 national  markets
may also receive compensation for airing national advertising spots.

Affiliation  agreements specify the number of times and the approximate  daypart
each program and advertisement may be broadcast. Westwood One requires that each
station   complete   and   promptly   return  to  the   Company   an   affidavit
(proof-of-performance)  that  verifies the time of each  broadcast.  Affiliation
agreements for Westwood One's  entertainment  programming are non-cancelable for
26 weeks and are automatically  renewed for subsequent  26-week periods,  if not
canceled 30 days prior to the end of the  existing  contract  term.  Affiliation
agreements for Westwood One's news and current events programming  generally run
for a period of at least one year,  are  automatically  renewable for subsequent
periods and are  cancelable  by either the Company or the station  upon 90 days'
notice.

The  Company  has a number of  people  responsible  for  station  relations  and
marketing  its programs to radio  stations.  Station  relationships  are managed
geographically   to  allow  the  marketing  staff  to  concentrate  on  specific
geographical  regions.  This enables the Company's staff to develop and maintain
close,  professional  relationships  with radio station personnel and to provide
them with quick programming assistance.

      National Advertisers

Westwood  One  provides  national  advertisers  with  a  cost-effective  way  to
communicate their commercial  messages to large listening  audiences  nationwide
that have specific  demographic  characteristics.  An advertiser can obtain both
frequency  (number of  exposures  to the  target  audience)  and reach  (size of
listening audience) by purchasing advertising time in the Company`s programs. By
purchasing time in programs  directed to different  formats,  advertisers can be
assured of obtaining high market  penetration and visibility as their commercial
messages  will be broadcast  on several  stations in the same market at the same
time. The Company supports its national sponsors with promotional  announcements
and advertisements in trade and consumer publications. This support promotes the
upcoming  broadcasts  of  Company  programs  and is  designed  to  increase  the
advertisers' target listening audience.

The  Company  sells  its  commercial  time to  advertisers  either  as "bulk" or
"flighted"  purchases.  Bulk purchases are long-term  contracts (26 to 52 weeks)
that are sold "up-front"  (early advertiser  commitments for national  broadcast
time).  Flighted  purchases are contracts for a specific,  short-term  period of
time (one to six  weeks)  that are sold at or above  prevailing  market  prices.
Advertising  prices vary  significantly  based on prevailing market  conditions.
Generally,   the  contracts  provide  that  advertising   orders  are  firm  and
non-cancelable.  The Company's strategy for growth in advertising  revenue is to
increase  the amount of  advertising  time sold on the usually  more  profitable
flighted  basis, to increase  revenue of the non-RADAR  rated  programs,  and to
increase audience size for news, talk and current events programming.


                                       4
<PAGE>

      Local Traffic and Information Programming

In 1996,  the  Company  expanded  its  business to include  the  production  and
distribution of local traffic,  news, sports and weather programming in selected
metropolitan areas (initially New York, Chicago,  Los Angeles and Philadelphia).
The  programming  is  produced  in  facilities  rented by the  Company  in those
metropolitan   areas.   Local  traffic   information  is  obtained  through  the
utilization  of  strategically  placed  cameras  overlooking  portions  of major
freeways,  monitoring police radio bands, phone calls from drivers,  and through
patrolling freeways with rented aircraft.

COMPETITION

The  Company  operates  in a very  competitive  environment.  In  marketing  its
programs to national advertisers, the Company directly competes with other radio
networks  as  well  as  with  independent   radio   syndication   producers  and
distributors.  In addition,  Westwood One competes for advertising  revenue with
network  television,  cable television,  print and other forms of communications
media.  The Company  believes that the high quality of its  programming  and the
strength of its station  relations  and  advertising  sales forces  enable it to
compete  effectively  with other  forms of  communication  media.  Westwood  One
markets its  programs to radio  stations,  including  affiliates  of other radio
networks,  that it believes will have the largest and most  desirable  listening
audience for each of its  programs.  The Company  often has  different  programs
airing on a number of stations in the same  geographic  market at the same time.
The  Company  believes  that in  comparison  with any  other  independent  radio
syndication  producer and distributor or radio network it has a more diversified
selection of programming from which national  advertisers and radio stations may
choose. In addition, the Company both produces and distributes programs, thereby
enabling it to respond more  effectively to the demands of advertisers and radio
stations.

The increase in the number of program  formats has led to increased  competition
among local radio stations for audience.  As stations  attempt to  differentiate
themselves in an increasingly competitive environment,  their demand for quality
programming  available from outside programming  sources increases.  This demand
has been  intensified  by high  operating  and  production  costs at local radio
stations and increased competition for local advertising revenue.

WBS, in the  metropolitan  areas in which it operates,  competes for advertising
revenue with local print and other forms of communications  media. The Company's
principal  competitor   providing  local  traffic,   news,  sports  and  weather
programming is Metro Networks.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Radio broadcasting and station ownership are regulated by the FCC. Westwood One,
as a producer and  distributor  of radio  programs,  is generally not subject to
regulation  by the  FCC.  Shadow  Traffic  utilizes  FCC  regulated  frequencies
pursuant to licenses issued by the FCC.

EMPLOYEES

On March  15,  1996,  Westwood  One had 566  full-time  employees,  including  a
domestic  advertising  sales  force  of 69  people.  In  addition,  the  Company
maintains  continuing  relationships with approximately 58 independent  writers,
program  hosts,  technical  personnel and  producers.  Certain  employees at the
Mutual Broadcasting  System, NBC Radio Networks,  and Unistar Radio Networks are
covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes relations with
its employees and independent contractors are good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company  owns a 7,600  square-foot  building in Culver City,  California  in
which its production  facilities are located; a 14,000 square-foot  building and
an  adjacent  10,000  square-foot  building  in Culver  City,  California  which
contains  administrative,  sales and marketing offices, and storage space; and a
7,700 square-foot  unoccupied building in Culver City. In addition,  the Company

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

On March 1, 1996 there were approximately 315 holders of record of the Company's
Common  Stock,  several  of which  represent  "street  accounts"  of  securities
brokers.  Based upon the number of proxies  requested by brokers in  conjunction
with its shareholders'  meeting on June 13, 1995, the Company estimates that the
total number of beneficial holders of the Company's Common Stock exceeds 4,500.

The Company's Common Stock has been traded in the over-the-counter  market under
the NASDAQ symbol WONE since the Company's  initial public offering on April 24,
1984. The following table sets forth the range of high and low last sales prices
on the  NASDAQ/National  Market  System,  as reported by NASDAQ,  for the Common
Stock for the calendar quarters indicated.

Effective December 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its method of  accounting  for
     capitalized  station  affiliation   agreements  to  expense  the  costs  as
     incurred.  The  effect  of  this  change  in  accounting  method  does  not
     materially affect the comparability of the information reflected herein.
Results for the year ended  December 31, 1994  include  Unistar from the time it
     was acquired in February  1994.
No   cash  dividend  was paid on the  Company's  Common Stock during the periods
     presented above.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

In August  1994,  the Company  changed  its fiscal year end from  November 30 to
December  31  effective   with  the  fiscal  year  ending   December  31,  1994.
Accordingly,  in the  following  discussion  "1995" and "1994" will refer to the
calendar  years 1995 and 1994,  and "1993"  will refer to the fiscal  year ended
November 30, 1993.

On February 3, 1994 the Company  completed the  acquisition of all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Unistar Radio Networks,  Inc.  ("Unistar").
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly,  the operating
results of Unistar  are  included  with  those of the  Company  from the date of
acquisition.

Effective  December 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its method of accounting  for
capitalized station affiliation agreements and income taxes. In order to conform
to  predominate  current  industry  practice,  capitalized  station  affiliation
agreements will be expensed as incurred.  The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting for station  affiliation  expenses in December 1993 was an expense of
$4,344,  or $.23 per share.  SFAS No.  109  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes" was
adopted by the Company in  December  1993.  The  Company  elected not to restate
prior  year's  financial  statements.  Adopting  SFAS No. 109 did not affect the
December 1993 or 1994 results.

In 1993, the Company  classified the results of operations  from Radio & Records
and its Los Angeles and New York radio stations as discontinued operations.  The
Company disposed of these assets during 1993.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Westwood  One  derives  substantially  all of  its  revenue  from  the  sale  of
advertising time to advertisers.  Net revenues  increased 7% to $145,729 in 1995
from  $136,340  in 1994 and  increased  62% in 1994 from  $84,014  in 1993.  The
increases in 1995 and 1994 net revenues were  primarily a result of the purchase
of Unistar in February 1994.

Operating costs and expenses excluding  depreciation and amortization  increased
1% to $106,685  in 1995 from  $105,389  in 1994 and  increased  61% in 1994 from
$65,353 in 1993. The 1995 increase was primarily attributable to the purchase of
Unistar,  partially offset by reductions in affiliate compensation expenses. The
1994 increase was primarily  attributable  to the purchase of Unistar and higher
programming expenses resulting from the production of additional programs.

Depreciation and  amortization  decreased 24% to $13,753 in 1995 from $18,160 in
1994 and  increased  11% in 1994 from  $16,384 in 1993.  The 1995  decrease  was
primarily a result of lower  amortization  of programming  costs and rights from
lower levels of capitalized costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization
expense in 1994 was  primarily a result of the  purchase  of Unistar,  partially
offset  by  lower  amortization  of  programming  costs  and  rights  and  lower
amortization as a result of the Company's  December 1, 1993 change in its method
of accounting for capitalized station affiliation agreements.

Corporate general and  administrative  expenses  increased 36% to $5,976 in 1995
from $4,404 in 1994 and  decreased 1% in 1994 from $4,468 in 1993.  The increase
in 1995 was primarily a result of fees  attributable to the Infinity  Management
Agreement  and higher  compensation  for the  Company's  chairman.  The  nominal
decrease in 1994 is a result of across-the-board  expense cuts, partially offset
by fees attributable to the Infinity Management Agreement.

As a result of the purchase of Unistar, the Company accrued  restructuring costs
of $2,405 in the first quarter of 1994 principally relating to the consolidation
of certain facilities and operations.

Operating  income  increased  223% to  $19,315  in 1995 from  $5,982 in 1994 and
increased  $8,173 in 1994 from an operating loss of $2,191 in 1993. The dramatic
improvement  in 1995 is  attributable  to the  acquisition  of Unistar and lower
amortization  of  programming  costs  and  rights,  partially  offset  by higher
corporate  general  and  administrative  expenses.  The  improvement  in 1994 is
attributable  to the  acquisition  of Unistar and cost  savings  resulting  from
operating  synergies from the Unistar  acquisition,  partially  offset by higher
depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the Unistar acquisition.


                                       9
<PAGE>

Interest  expense  was  $9,524,  $8,802  and  $6,551  in 1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  The increase in 1995 was primarily attributable to twelve months'
interest  in the  current  year for debt  obtained  as a result  of the  Unistar
acquisition and higher interest rates,  partially offset by lower debt levels as
a result of repaying $12,500 in debt in the current year and the 1994 conversion
of 9% Senior  Debentures  to Common  Stock.  The 1994  increase  is  principally
attributable  to higher debt levels as a result of the  acquisition  of Unistar,
partially  offset by the  elimination  of interest  expense on the  Company's 9%
Senior  Debentures  due to their  conversion  to Common  Stock.  Other income is
principally comprised of investment income.

Income (loss) from continuing  operations  increased $12,415 to $9,685 ($.28 per
share) from 1994's loss of $2,730  ($.09 per share) and the 1994 loss  decreased
69% from 1993's loss of $8,682 ($.57 per share).

Loss on discontinued operations,  net of income tax benefit, was $3,140 in 1993.
The loss represents the operating performance of discontinued operations through
March 1, 1993.

The $12,087 provision for loss on disposal of discontinued  operations  included
estimated  future costs and operating  results of the  discontinued  assets from
March 1, 1993 until the date of disposition.

In connection  with the  refinancing  of its senior debt  facility,  the Company
recorded an extraordinary loss of $590 ($.02 per share).

Net  income  increased  $13,005 to $9,685  ($.28 per  share)  from a net loss of
$3,320 ($.11 per share) in 1994 and the 1994 net loss decreased 86% in 1994 from
$23,909 ($1.58 per share) in 1993.

Weighted average shares outstanding  increased 17% to 34,310 in 1995 from 29,414
in 1994 and 94% in 1994 from  15,153 in 1993.  The 1995  increase  is  primarily
attributable to the full year impact of share issuances made in 1994 (conversion
of 9% Senior  Debentures  and sale of 5,000 shares to a subsidiary of Infinity).
The 1994 increase in weighted  average shares is primarily  attributable  to the
conversion of its 9% Senior Debentures into approximately 8,864 shares of Common
Stock and the sale of 5,000 shares of Common Stock to a subsidiary of Infinity.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At December 31,  1995,  the  Company's  cash and cash  equivalents  were $256, a
decrease  of $2,183  from  December  31,  1994.  In  addition,  the  Company had
available borrowings under its loan agreement of $17,500.

For 1995, net cash from operating activities was $24,223, an increase of $21,778
from 1994.  The increase  was  primarily  attributable  to higher cash flow from
operations.  In 1994, net cash from  operating  activities was much lower due to
high working capital requirements as a result of the acquisition of Unistar. Net
cash used by investing  activities was $2,890 principally due to the purchase of
capital equipment.  Consequently,  cash provided before financing activities was
$21,333.

The Company has been  authorized  by its Board of Directors to  repurchase up to
$40,000 of its Common Stock through December 31, 1996.  During 1995, the Company
purchased 607 shares of the Company's  Common Stock and 500 warrants for a total
cost of $14,475. In addition, the Company prepaid $12,500 of its long-term debt.

On March 1, 1996, the Company  purchased the operating assets of New York Shadow
Traffic Limited  Partnership,  Chicago Shadow Traffic Limited  Partnership,  Los
Angeles Shadow Traffic Limited  Partnership,  and  Philadelphia  Express Traffic
Limited Partnership  (collectively  "Shadow Traffic") for $20,000 plus expenses,
subject to an adjustment  based on the future cash flow of Shadow  Traffic.  The
acquisition  will be financed  using the  Company's  existing cash and available
bank borrowings.

Management   believes  that  the  Company's  cash,   available   borrowings  and
anticipated  cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance current and
forecasted operations over the next 12 months.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
OF WESTWOOD ONE, INC.

In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  listed in the index to
consolidated  financial statements and financial statement schedules on page F-1
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Westwood
One, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of
their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the two fiscal  years in the
period ended  December 31, 1995,  the one month ended  December 31, 1993 and for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1993, in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's  management;  our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial  statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these
statements  in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As  discussed  in the  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  effective
December  1, 1993 the  Company  changed its  accounting  policy for  capitalized
station  affiliation  agreements and adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
           (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)


NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned
subsidiaries.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when commercial advertisements are broadcast.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of
less than  three  months to be cash  equivalents.  The  carrying  amount of cash
equivalents  approximates  fair  value  because of the short  maturity  of these
instruments.

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation  is computed  using the  straight  line  method over the  estimated
useful lives of the assets.

MEASUREMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT

At each balance  sheet date,  the Company  determines  whether an  impairment of
Intangible   Assets  has  occurred  based  upon  expectations  of  nondiscounted
broadcast cash flow. Broadcast Cash Flow is based on the consolidated  statement
of operations,  calculated by subtracting from net revenue,  operating costs and
expenses excluding  depreciation and amortization.  To date, the Company has not
experienced an impairment in any of its intangible assets.  However, should such
an impairment  exist, the impairment will be measured as the amount by which the
carrying  amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (FAS 121), "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of".

INCOME TAXES

Effective  December 1, 1993, the Company  implemented,  on a prospective  basis,
Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 109 (FAS 109),  "Accounting for
Income  Taxes"  which  requires  the use of the  asset and  liability  method of
financial  accounting and reporting for income taxes. The adoption of FAS109 did
not affect reported  earnings.  Under FAS 109, deferred income taxes reflect the
tax impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities
recognized for financial  reporting  purposes and the amounts recognized for tax
purposes.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Net income  (loss) per share is based on the weighted  average  number of common
shares and common  equivalent  shares (where inclusion of such equivalent shares
would not be anti-dilutive) outstanding during the year.

PERVASIVENESS OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  at the date of the
financial  statements  and revenue and  expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATION

Certain   amounts  have  been   reclassified   to  be  comparable  to  the  1995
presentation.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING CHANGE:

Effective  December 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its method of accounting  for
capitalized station  affiliation  agreements to expense these costs as incurred.
The Company  believes this method is preferable and conforms to the  predominant
current  industry  practice,   including  Unistar.   Accordingly,   the  Company
recognized  the  cumulative  effect of the change as of  December  1, 1993.  The
non-cash charge to earnings was an expense of $4,344,  or $.23 per share and has
been reflected in the financial statements for the month of December 1993.

NOTE 3 - CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR:

In the third  quarter of 1994,  the  Company  changed  its fiscal  year end from
November 30 to December 31  effective  with the fiscal year ending  December 31,
1994.  The  accompanying  financial  statements  include  audited  statements of
operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash  flows for the one month  transition
period ended December 31, 1993.

NOTE 4 - ACQUISITION OF UNISTAR RADIO NETWORKS, INC.:

On February 3, 1994, the Company  completed the acquisition of all of the issued
and outstanding  capital stock of Unistar Radio Networks,  Inc.  ("Unistar") for
$101,300  plus  expenses.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for as a  purchase.
Accordingly,  the  operating  results of Unistar are included  with those of the
Company  from the date of  acquisition.  Based on  management's  estimates,  the
purchase  price has been  allocated to the fair value of assets and  liabilities

</TABLE>

The Company's  amended senior loan agreement with a syndicate of banks,  lead by
Chase Manhattan  Bank,  provides for a $125,000  revolving  credit facility (the
"Facility"), which is subject to mandatory quarterly reductions. The Facility is
available  until June 30, 2002. At December 31, 1995,  the Company had available
borrowings under the Facility of $110,000. Interest is payable at the prime rate
plus an applicable margin of up to 1.5% or LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up
to 2.5%, at the Company's  option.  Based on the Company's Total Debt Ratio, the
applicable  margins may be reduced to as low as 0% for prime rate loans and 1.0%
for LIBOR loans. At December 31, 1995, the applicable  margins were 0% and 1.0%,
respectively.  At December 31, 1995,  the Company had borrowed  $92,500 at 6.82%
under the Facility.  The Facility is secured by substantially  all the Company's
assets and  contains  covenants  relating  to  dividends,  liens,  indebtedness,
capital  expenditures and interest  coverage and leverage ratios. As a matter of
policy,  the  Company  does not  engage in  derivative  trading.  As part of the
Facility,  the  Company is  required  to enter  into  interest  rate  protection
agreements.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  entered  into  two  interest  rate
protection  agreements  under which the  Company's  interest  rate on $50,000 of
borrowings  under the Facility will not exceed 7% (based on the current margin).
The  agreements  are  effective  from July and August  1995 thru July and August
1996, with each covering $25,000 of borrowings.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures  ("Debentures") are unsecured and
subordinated  in  right of  payment  to  senior  indebtedness.  Interest  on the
Debentures is payable  semiannually  on April 15 and October 15. The  Debentures
are convertible at any time prior to maturity,  unless previously redeemed, into
shares of common  stock of the  Company  at the  conversion  price of $24.58 per
share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

The aggregate  maturities  of long-term  debt for the next five fiscal years and
thereafter,  pursuant to the Company's debt  agreements as in effect at December
31, 1995, are as follows:

NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES:

The Company has  approximately  $80,000 of  available  U.S. net  operating  loss
carryforwards  for tax purposes,  which begin to expire in 2002.  Utilization of
the carryforwards is dependent upon future taxable income and the absence of any
significant  changes  in the  stock  ownership  of the  Company.  For  financial
purposes,  a  valuation  allowance  of $20,639  has been  recorded to offset the
deferred tax assets related to those carryforwards.

NOTE 11 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

In connection with the acquisition of Unistar, the Company sold 5,000,000 shares
of the  Company's  common  stock and a warrant to purchase  up to an  additional
3,000,000  shares to a  subsidiary  of Infinity  (See Note 8) and entered into a
Management Agreement with Infinity.  Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the
Company paid or accrued expenses  aggregating $2,709 to Infinity in 1995 ($1,849
in 1994).  In November  1995,  the Company  entered  into a  transaction  with a
subsidiary  of Infinity that  effectively  eliminated,  for financial  reporting
purposes,  its  obligation  under the Management  Agreement for $3.00  incentive
warrants  covering  500,000 common shares.  The net cost of this transaction was
$5,631.

In  addition,  several of  Infinity's  radio  stations are  affiliated  with the
Company's  radio  networks  and the  Company  purchases  several  programs  from
Infinity.  During 1995 the Company incurred expenses  aggregating  approximately
$14,657 for Infinity affiliations and programs ($12,159 in 1994).

NOTE 15 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

At the end of the Company's first fiscal quarter of 1993, the Company classified
the results of  operations  from Radio & Records  and its two radio  stations as
discontinued  operations.  These three businesses  collateralized  the Company's
debt with Westinghouse  Electric  Corporation  ("WEC"). In June 1993 the Company
completed  the sales of its radio  stations,  and used the net proceeds from the
sales to retire a substantial  portion of its WEC debt. On November 1, 1993, WEC
acquired the outstanding stock of Radio & Records and the net assets of Westwood
One Stations Group for the remaining  balance of the WEC debt,  accrued interest
and any other potential claims. Accordingly, the historical net loss of the

              of the voting equity securities of any such corporation.

              Westwood treats certain  information,  including,  but not limited
              to,  information  about  its  radio  stations,   affiliated  radio
              stations,  marketing programs,  or radio programs, as confidential
              information    (the    "Confidential    Information").    Employee
              acknowledges  and  agrees  that,  during  or after the term of his
              employment,  the sale or  unauthorized  use or  disclosure  of any
              Confidential  Information  obtained  by him during his  employment
              with Westwood constitute unfair competition. Employee promises and
              agrees not to engage in unfair  competition  with Westwood during,
              or after, the term of this Agreement.

     7.       TERMINATION

                   A.  TERMINATION  FOR  CAUSE,   Westwood  may  terminate  this
                   Agreement for cause, as hereinafter defined,  with or without
                   notice,  at any time. If Employee is terminated for cause, he

                   shall be entitled to compensation which has accrued up to the
                   date of  termination,  but Employee  shall not be entitled to
                   any severance or other payment  whatsoever.  The term "Cause"

                   or more of Employee to perform  Employee's  duties under this
                   Agreement.  The term  "incapacity"  shall mean any  physical,
                   mental or other disability  rendering  Employee  incapable of
                   fully performing the services required to be performed by him
                   hereunder;  (2) willful,  habitual, or substantial neglect of
                   duties  by  Employee;   (3)  any  material   breach  of  this
                   Agreement;  (4)  dishonesty  and/or  theft  which  results in
                   significant  harm to the Company;  (5) use or  possession  of
                   illegal drugs in the United States during working hours;  (6)
                   use of alcohol  during  working  hours  (except for  moderate
                   consumption of alcohol during business  entertainment  in the
                   discharge  of  Employee's  duties);  (7)  unethical  business
                   conduct;  (8) negligence in the  performance of duties likely
                   to cause or  actually  causing  personal  injury or  property
                   damage; (9) failure to comply with any rules or regulation of

                   procedures,  or best  interest of  Westwood;  (10)  excessive
                   absenteeism;  and  (11)  Employee's  failure  or  refusal  to
                   perform  the  services   required  of  Employee   under  this
                   Agreement  for a period of two (2) or more  days for  reasons
                   other than vacation, illness, accident, injury, incapacity or
                   authorized leave of absence.

                   B. Westwood may terminate this Agreement  without cause,  for
                   any  reason,  at  its  discretion,  upon  written  notice  to
                   Employee. In such an event, Company, at its option, shall pay
                   Employee  an amount  equal to the  lessor of  fifty-two  (52)
                   weeks of Employee's base salary,  or the remaining  period of
                   this  Agreement,  payable as and when such base salary  would
                   have been due had  Employee  continued  to  render  services.
                   Section 6 of this  Agreement  shall apply so long as Employee
                   continues  to  receive  the base  salary.  In the event  that
                   Employee is terminated  pursuant to the terms of this Section
                   7.B, and Employee has been granted stock  options,  the stock
                   options  will  remain in effect  during  the period for which
                   Company continues to compensate Employee.

                   C. The Company may also immediately  terminate this Agreement
                   in the event of the death of the  Employee  or if he  becomes
                   disabled,  which is defined as the Employee not being able to
                   perform his regular  duties  hereunder  for a period of three
                   (3) consecutive months.

     8.       RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

                   A. RIGHT OF FIRST  REFUSAL If  Employee  receives  or makes a
                   bona fide offer from or to a third party to engage Employee's
                   services upon termination or expiration of the Term,  thereby
                   preventing  the  extension  or  renewal  of  this  Agreement,
                   Employee  agrees  that he will not accept such offer or enter
                   into such an arrangement  before notifying the Company of all
                   the terms upon which such offer has been made.  Notice to the
                   Company of any such bona fide  offer  must be in writing  and
                   must set forth all  substantial  and material  details of the
                   offer,  the  identity  of the  offerer  and  offeree and must
                   include  the   offeree's   written   acknowledgment   of  the
                   willingness  to accept such  offer.  Upon  notification,  the
                   Company shall have four (4) weeks in which to elect to engage
                   Employee's  services  upon at least the same  monetary  terms
                   offered by such other party. Company shall not be required to
                   match any non-monetary terms of such offer. In the event that
                   the  foregoing  four (4) week  period,  or any part  thereof,
                   occurs after the expiration of this Agreement,  then Employee
                   will  continue  to  receive  compensation  based  on the base
                   salary paid to Employee as of the expiration date, until said
                   four (4) week  period  expires.  Subject  to  Company's  sole
                   discretion,  Employee  may be  required to continue to render
                   services  to the  Company  in  accordance  with terms of this
                   Agreement,  during any part of the four (4) week period which
                   occurs after the expiration of the Agreement.

                   If the  Company  does not match  any offer of which  Employee
                   duly notifies the Company and the offeree does not thereafter
                   accept such offer, the terms of this paragraph shall apply to
                   any subsequent offer received by or made by Employee.

                   B. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE Upon the termination of Employee's
                   employment for cause under this  Agreement,  Employee  agrees
                   that  for a  period  of  ninety  (90)  days  from the date of


                                       5
<PAGE>

                   termination,  Employee will not enter into any  employment or
                   other agreement,  directly or indirectly,  with any person or
                   entity who is a direct  competitor  of Company in the network
                   or  syndicated  radio  industry or reveal in any manner,  any
                   information  concerning  the Company's  operations.  Employee
                   will  receive  compensation  for the  ninety  (90) day period
                   based  on  the  base   salary   in  effect  at  the  time  of
                   termination.  This  provision  will not apply if  Employee is
                   terminated without cause.

                   C. RENEWAL  Thirteen  weeks prior to the  expiration  of this
                   Agreement,   the  Company  and   Employee   will  enter  into
                   negotiations  to  extend  the  terms  of this  Agreement.  If
                   Company  determines  not to renew,  Employee  will  receive a
                   severance  amount equal to thirteen (13) weeks of Employees's
                   base salary  compensation and the date of termination will be
                   the expiration  date of this  Agreement.  This provision does
                   not  apply if  Company's  decision  not to renew was based on
                   declining  to match a bona fide offer as set forth in Section
                   8.A above.

     9.       NOTICES

              under or in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and

      necessary  expense reports  requested by the Company.  It is understood by
      the parties that for medical  reasons,  the Company will allow Employee to
      fly "First Class" on all pre-approved business trips.

6.    NON-COMPETITION/UNFAIR COMPETITION

      During the term of this Agreement,  Employee shall not knowingly, directly
      or  indirectly,   engage  or  participate  in  any  business  that  is  in
      competition  with any business of Westwood.  The  foregoing  obligation of
      Employee not to compete with  Westwood  shall not prohibit  Employee  from
      owning or purchasing any corporate  securities of any corporation that are
      regularly traded on a recognized stock exchange or over-the-counter market
      so long as Employee does not own, in the  aggregate,  five percent (5%) or
      more of the voting equity securities of any such corporation.

      Westwood  treats  certain  information,  including,  but not  limited  to,
      information about its radio stations, affiliated radio stations, marketing
      programs,   or  radio   programs,   as   confidential   information   (the
      "Confidential Information"). Employee acknowledges and agrees that, during
      or after  the term of his  employment,  the  sale or  unauthorized  use or
      disclosure  of any  Confidential  Information  obtained  by him during his
      employment with Westwood constitute unfair competition.  Employee promises
      and agrees not to engage in unfair  competition with Westwood  during,  or
      after, the term of this Agreement.

7.    TERMINATION

          A.   TERMINATION FOR CAUSE,  Westwood may terminate this Agreement for
               cause, as hereinafter  defined,  with or without  notice,  at any
               time. If Employee is terminated  for cause,  he shall be entitled
               to compensation  which has accrued up to the date of termination,
               but  Employee  shall not be  entitled to any  severance  or other
               payment  whatsoever.  The  term  "Cause"  as  used  herein  shall
               include, but not be limited to, the following:  (1) the continued
               incapacity for thirteen (13) weeks or more of Employee to perform
               Employee's  duties under this  Agreement.  The term  "incapacity"
               shall mean any  physical,  mental or other  disability  rendering
               Employee  incapable of fully performing the services  required to
               be  performed  by  him  hereunder;  (2)  willful,   habitual,  or
               substantial  neglect  of duties  by  Employee;  (3) any  material
               breach of this Agreement;  (4) dishonesty;  (5) theft: (6) use or
               possession  of illegal  drugs during  working  hours;  (7) use of
               alcohol during working hours (except for moderate  consumption of
               alcohol  during  business   entertainment  in  the  discharge  of
               Employee's   duties);   (8)  unethical   business  conduct;   (9)
               negligence  in the  performance  of  duties  likely  to  cause or
               actually  causing  personal  injury  or  property  damage;   (10)
               excessive  absenteeism or tardiness;  and (11) Employee's failure


                                       3
<PAGE>

               or refusal to perform the  services  required  of Employee  under
               this  Agreement  for a period of two (2) or more days for reasons
               other than vacation,  illness,  accident,  injury,  incapacity or
               authorized leave of absence.

               If at any time Employee fails to perform fully any one or more of
               the obligations hereunder,  or in the event of breach by Employee
               of any representation, warranty, term, obligation or condition of
               this Agreement, Westwood shall have the right at its sole option,
               in  addition  to the rights set forth in this  Agreement  and any
               other right at law or in equity, (i) to discipline  employee,  by
               suspension  from work and/or  suspension  or  reduction in pay or
               otherwise  and/or;  (ii)  to  withhold  such  amount  as  may  be
               appropriate  from any  compensation due or to be due to Employee,
               to  reimburse  Westwood  for any  damages,  direct  or  indirect,
               (Including,  but not limited to,  reasonable legal fees and other
               expenses)  which  Employee's  failure  and/or  breach  has caused
               and/or;  (iii)  extend  the Term of this  Agreement  for a period
               equal to that of the non-performance.

          B.   Westwood may terminate  this  Agreement  without  cause,  for any
               reason,  at its discretion,  upon written notice to Employee.  In
               such an event,  Company,  at its  option,  shall pay  Employee an
               amount equal to the lessor of fifty-two  (52) weeks of Employee's
               base salary,  or the remaining period of this Agreement,  payable
               as and when such base  salary  would  have been due had  Employee
               continued to render  services.  Section 6 of this Agreement shall
               apply so long as Employee continues to receive the base salary.

                                       4
<PAGE>

          C.   The Company may also immediately  terminate this Agreement in the
               event of the death of the  Employee  or if he  becomes  disabled,
               which is defined as the  Employee  not being able to perform  his
               regular  duties  hereunder for a period of three (3)  consecutive
               months.

8.     RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

          A.   RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL If Employee  receives or makes a bona fide
               offer from or to a third party to engage  Employee's  services in
               the network or  syndicated  radio  industry upon  termination  or
               expiration  of the Term,  thereby  preventing  the  extension  or
               renewal  of this  Agreement,  Employee  agrees  that he will  not
               accept  such  offer  or enter  into  such an  arrangement  before
               notifying  the Company of all the terms upon which such offer has
               been made. Notice to the Company of any such bona fide offer must
               be in writing  and must set forth all  substantial  and  material
               details of the offer, the identity of the offerer and offeree and
               must  include  the  offeree's   written   acknowledgment  of  the
               willingness to accept such offer. Upon notification,  the Company
               shall  have two (2) weeks in which to elect to engage  Employee's
               services  upon at least the same  monetary  terms offered by such
               other  party.   Company  shall  not  be  required  to  match  any
               non-monetary terms of such offer.

               If the Company  does not match any offer of which  Employee  duly
               notifies the Company and the offeree does not  thereafter  accept
               such  offer,  the  terms  of this  paragraph  shall  apply to any
               subsequent offer received by or made by Employee.

          B.   COVENANT  NOT TO  COMPETE  Upon  the  termination  of  Employee's
               employment  under this agreement for cause,  Employee agrees that
               for a period  of ninety  (90) days from the date of  termination,
               Employee will not enter into any  employment or other  agreement,
               directly or indirectly, with any person or entity who is a direct
               or indirect  competitor  of Company in the network or  syndicated
               radio  industry,   or  reveal  in  any  manner,  any  information
               concerning  the Company's  operations.  This  provision  will not
               apply if Employee is terminated without cause.

                                       5
<PAGE>

          C.   RENEWAL Thirteen weeks prior to the expiration of this Agreement,
               the Company and Employee will enter into  negotiations  to extend
               the terms of this Agreement.  If Company determines not to renew,
               Employee  will receive a severance  amount equal to thirteen (13)
               weeks of  Employee's  base  salary  compensation  and the date of
               termination  will be the expiration date of this Agreement.  This
               provision  does not apply if Company's  decision not to renew was
               based on  declining  to match a bona  fide  offer as set forth in
               Section 8.A above.

9.    NOTICES

      All notices which any party may be required or may desire to give under or
      in connection  with this  Agreement  shall be in writing and shall be sent
      either: (i) by personal delivery or reputable  overnight courier, in which

          A.   The waiver by either  party of a breach of any  provision of this
               Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as

               be valid  unless in  writing,  executed  by the party or its duly
               authorized representative.

               relationship.

     and deliver to Markowitz,  as the representative of Sellers, a statement of
     the consolidated  current assets and current liabilities of the Business as

     connection  with the  preparation of the Closing  Statement,  Buyer and its
     authorized   representatives,    including   Buyer's   independent   public
     accountants,  will  have the right to review  the  information  used in the
     preparation of the Financial Statements, including, but not limited to, all
     existing workpapers of the accountants which compiled such statements.  The
     Closing  Statement  shall  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP and the
     principles, procedures and elections within GAAP utilized by Sellers in the
     preparation  of the audited  balance  sheet (the "Audited  Balance  Sheet")

     shall  include a liability,  calculated in  accordance  with GAAP,  for all
     accrued  but  unpaid  vacation  in  respect  of  all  Existing   Employees.
     Simultaneously  with its delivery of the Closing  Statement  to  Markowitz,
     Buyer will deliver to Markowitz, as the representative of Sellers,  Buyer's
     calculation of the Adjusted Current Assets.

                   (ii) In the event that the Base Amount  exceeds the  Adjusted
     Current  Assets (the amount of such  excess,  the "Buyer's  Purchase  Price
     Adjustment"),  within 45 days  after the date of  receipt by Sellers of the
     Closing  Statement,  Markowitz  and Sellers  shall,  subject to Section 4.3
     hereof,  either (x) jointly and  severally pay to Buyer by wire transfer in
     immediately  available funds an amount equal to the Buyer's  Purchase Price
     Adjustment or (y) deliver to Buyer a notice,  signed by Markowitz,  stating
     that  Markowitz has elected to allow Buyer to recover the Buyer's  Purchase
     Price Adjustment by crediting the Buyer's Purchase Price Adjustment against
     (A) the  Sellers'  Contingent  Payment,  if any, in the manner set forth in
     Section  4.2(b)(iii)  hereof, (B) the Buyout Amount in the manner set forth
     in Section 9.4(c) hereof, (C) the Second Tier Initial Purchase Price in the

     In the event Sellers and Markowitz  neither pay such Buyer's Purchase Price
     Adjustment  nor  deliver  such notice to Buyer  within such 45-day  period,
     Markowitz  and  Sellers  shall be deemed to have  delivered  to Buyers  the
     certificate  provided  for  in  clause  (y) of  the  immediately  preceding
     sentence of this Section 4.1(b)(ii).

                   (iii) In the event that the Adjusted  Current  Assets  exceed
     the sum of (x) the  Base  Amount  plus (y)  $500,000  (the  amount  of such
     excess, the "Sellers' Purchase Price Adjustment"), within 45 days after the
     date of receipt by Sellers of the Closing Statement,  Buyer shall,  subject
     to Sections 4.3 and 18.4 hereof,  pay to Sellers an amount equal to the sum
     of (i) 60% of the Sellers' Purchase Price Adjustment plus (ii) that portion
     of the  Adjustment  Balance,  if any,  that  Buyer does not elect to pay by
     delivering  Westwood Stock to Sellers pursuant to the next sentence of this
     Section 4.1(b)(iii), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
     Accounts.  Buyer shall have the right, at its sole option, to pay up to 40%
     of the Sellers'  Purchase Price  Adjustment  (such amount,  the "Adjustment
     Balance") by delivering such number of shares of Westwood Stock, rounded up
     or down to the nearest  whole share,  as have a value equal to that portion
     of Sellers' Purchase Price Adjustment Buyer so chooses to pay by delivering
     such Westwood Stock. For purposes of this Section  4.1(b)(iii),  each share
     of Westwood Stock shall be valued based upon a per share price equal to the
     average of the closing price of the Westwood  Stock, as reported on NASDAQ,
     for the ten trading  days  preceding  the second  Business Day prior to the
     date the Sellers' Purchase Price Adjustment is made.

                   (iv)  Subject to Section  4.3 hereof,  the Closing  Statement
     delivered by Buyer to Markowitz  shall be final,  binding and conclusive on
     the parties hereto.

                   (b)  (i)  Subject  to  the  last  sentence  of  this  Section
     4.2(b)(i),  within 60 days  after the end of the Profit  Measuring  Period,
     Buyer will  prepare  and deliver to  Markowitz,  as the  representative  of
     Sellers,  an income  statement  of the  Business  for the Profit  Measuring
     Period (the "Contingent Payment Income Statement").  The Contingent Payment
     Income  Statement  shall  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and the
     principles, procedures and elections within GAAP utilized by Sellers in the
     preparation   of  the  audited  income   statement  (the  "Audited   Income
     Statement") included in the Financial  Statements,  except (A) all interest
     expenses and interest  income of the Business  shall be excluded  from such
     Statement,  (B) all  federal,  state and local  income Tax  expenses of the
     Business shall be excluded from such Statement,  (C) all  depreciation  and
     amortization expenses and interest income of the Business shall be excluded
     from such Statement,  EXCEPT for depreciation  expense  attributable to any
     equipment  that is  acquired  by Buyer in the  ordinary  course of business
     after  the  Closing  Date,  which  equipment  shall  be  depreciated  on  a
     straight-line basis over the useful life of the equipment in question,  (D)
     no income or expense will be recognized in such  Statement  with respect to
     any barter  arrangements  of the  Business , (E) no expense of Westwood for
     indirect  corporate  charges  (such as  internal  charges  for  accounting,
     marketing, finance, management,  administration, human resources and legal)
     shall be  included  in such  Statement,  (F) no  costs,  expenses  or other
     charges   incurred  by  Sellers  in   connection   with  the   transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement,  including, without limitation,  accounting
     and legal  costs,  shall be  included  in such  Statement,  (G) no  expense
     consisting  of any salary or bonus paid to any Existing  Employee  shall be
     included in such Statement to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
     salary or bonus expense  exceeds such  employee's  bonus and salary for the
     calendar year preceding the Closing Date plus a customary raise unless such
     expense has been authorized in writing by Michael D'Ambrose, (H) no expense
     constituting  a   non-recurring   expense,   and  no  income   constituting
     non-recurring income (in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP),
     shall be included in such  Statement and (I) such  Statement  shall include
     the Overhead Charge in respect of all corporate  level overhead  charges of
     the Business during the Profit Measuring  Period.  Simultaneously  with its
     delivery of the Contingent Payment Income Statement,  Buyer will deliver to
     Markowitz  Buyer's  calculation  of the  Adjusted  Profits and the Adjusted
     Profits  Multiple.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to  the
     contrary,  if Buyer pays any Buyout Amount to Markowitz or any Affiliate of
     Markowitz  pursuant  to Section  9.4 hereof  prior to the end of the Profit
     Measuring  Period,  Buyer  shall not be  required to prepare or deliver the
     Contingent Payment Income Statement, the Adjusted Profits Multiple shall be
     deemed  for all  purposes  of this  Agreement  to be  $34,800,000,  and the
     dispute  mechanisms in Section 4.3 shall not apply to such deemed  Adjusted
     Profit Multiple.

     than  $20,000,000  (such  deficit,   the  "Buyer's  Contingent   Payment"),
     Markowitz  and Sellers  shall,  subject to Section  4.3 hereof,  either (x)
     jointly  and  severally  pay to  Buyer  by  wire  transfer  in  immediately
     available  funds an amount equal to the Buyer's  Contingent  Payment,  such
     payment to be made within 30 days of Markowitz's  receipt of the Contingent
     Payment  Income  Statement,  or (y)  deliver  to Buyer a notice,  signed by
     Markowitz,  stating that Sellers and Markowitz  have elected to allow Buyer
     to recover the Buyer's Contingent Payment by crediting such payment against
     (A) any Buyout Amount in the manner set forth in Section 9.4(c) hereof, (B)
     the Second Tier Initial  Purchase  Price in the manner set forth in Section
     11.2(b)  hereof  and/or (C) any Third Tier  Initial  Purchase  Price in the
     manner set forth in Section  12.2(b)  hereof.  In the event  Markowitz  and
     Sellers  neither pay such amount to Buyer nor deliver  such notice to Buyer
     within such 30-day  period,  Markowitz  and Sellers shall be deemed to have
     delivered  to Buyer  the  certificate  provided  for in  clause  (y) of the
     immediately preceding sentence of this Section 4.2(b)(ii).

                   (iii) In the event that the Adjusted Profits Multiple is more
     than $20,000,000  (such excess,  as it may be adjusted pursuant to the next
     sentence of this Section 4.2(b)(iii),  the "Sellers' Contingent  Payment"),
     Buyer,  subject to Sections  4.3 and 18.4  hereof,  shall pay to Sellers an
     amount equal to the sum of (i) 60% of the Sellers'  Contingent Payment plus
     (ii) that portion of the  Contingent  Payment  Balance,  if any, that Buyer
     does not elect to pay by delivering  Westwood Stock to Sellers  pursuant to
     the  next  sentence  of  this  Section  4.2(b)(iii),  by wire  transfer  of
     immediately available funds to the Accounts. Buyer shall have the right, at
     its sole option, to pay up to 40% of the Sellers'  Contingent Payment (such
     amount,  the  "Contingent  Payment  Balance") by delivering  such number of
     shares of Westwood Stock, rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as
     have a value equal to that portion of Sellers'  Contingent Payment Buyer so
     chooses to pay by  delivering  such  Westwood  Stock.  For purposes of this
     Section  4.2(b)(iii),  each share of Westwood  Stock shall be valued  based
     upon a per share price  equal to the  average of the  closing  price of the
     Westwood Stock,  as reported on NASDAQ,  for the ten trading days preceding
     the second Business Day prior to the date the Sellers'  Contingent  Payment
     is made.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Sellers'  Contingent Payment
     shall be reduced by the Carryover Amount, if any, at the time such Sellers'
     Contingent Payment is paid.

                   (iv) Subject to Section 4.3 hereof,  the  Contingent  Payment
     Income  Statement  delivered by Buyer to Markowitz shall be final,  binding
     and conclusive on the parties hereto.

                   4.3  DISPUTE   RESOLUTION.   (a)  This  Section  will  govern
resolution of any disputes between Buyer and Sellers  regarding the calculations
on the Closing Statement, the Contingent Payment Income Statement, or both.

                   (b) Markowitz will have the right, with Sellers'  independent
     public accountant, to review the information used in the preparation of the
     Closing Statement or the Contingent  Payment Income Statement,  as the case
     may be, and to discuss  such  information  and the  preparation  and review
     thereof with the  personnel of Buyer  responsible  therefor.  Markowitz may
     dispute items reflected on the Closing Statement or the Contingent  Payment
     Income  Statement,  as the case may be, only on the basis that such amounts
     (i) resulted from mechanical errors of computation or (ii) were not arrived
     at in  accordance  with the  applicable  accounting  provisions  of Section
     4.1(b)(i) or 4.2(b)(i)  hereof,  as the case may be. In the event Markowitz
     so  disagrees  with any item on the  Closing  Statement  or the  Contingent
     Payment Income  Statement,  as the case may be, Markowitz shall,  within 45
     days after receipt of such Closing  Statement or Contingent  Payment Income
     Statement,  as the case may be,  give  Buyer  notice  of such  disagreement
     specifying  the items in  dispute  (any such item a  "Disputed  Item")  and
     setting forth his proposed adjustments. If the parties and their respective
     accountants  are  unable  to agree on a  resolution  within  15 days  after
     delivery of such notice of disagreement,  then the parties will submit such
     dispute  to  Deloitte  &  Touche  (the   "Arbitrator"),   certified  public
     accountants.  The Arbitrator  shall,  within 30 days after such submission,
     determine and report to the parties upon the Disputed Items and such report
     shall be final,  binding and conclusive on the parties with respect to such
     Disputed Items.

                   (c) Any fees,  expenses and costs of the  Arbitrator  for the
     services  described in Section 4.3(b) with respect to the Closing Statement
     or the Contingent  Payment Income  Statement,  as the case may be, shall be
     allocated among  Markowitz and Sellers,  on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
     other,  in the same  proportion  that the  aggregate  amount  of all of the
     Disputed Items on the Closing  Statement or the  Contingent  Payment Income
     Statement, as the case may be, that are submitted to the Arbitrator and are
     unsuccessfully  disputed by  Markowitz,  bear to the total amount of all of
     the  Disputed  Items on the Closing  Statement  or the  Contingent  Payment
     Income Statement,  as the case may be. Markowitz and Sellers shall bear all
     such fees,  costs and  disbursements  of the Arbitrator with respect to its
     work on the Closing  Statement or the Contingent  Payment Income Statement,
     as the case may be, if this Section 4.3 results in no adjustment being made
     to any  Disputed  Item on such  statement.  Buyer,  on the  one  hand,  and
     Markowitz and Sellers,  on the other, shall each reimburse the other to the
     extent  the other  pays more than the amount so  required  pursuant  to the
     preceding sentence.

                   (d) The term "Adjusted  Closing  Statement",  as used herein,
     shall  mean (x) the  Closing  Statement  delivered  by  Buyer to  Markowitz
     pursuant  to Section  4.1(b)(i)  hereof,  in the event  Markowitz  does not
     dispute  any item on the  Closing  Statement  within 45 days after  receipt
     thereof,  or (y)  the  definitive  Closing  Statement  resulting  from  the
     determinations made by the Arbitrator,  in accordance with this Section 4.3
     (in addition to those items theretofore  agreed to by Buyer and Markowitz),
     in the event  Markowitz  does  dispute  any such item.  The term  "Adjusted
     Contingent  Payment Income Statement",  as used herein,  shall mean (x) the
     Contingent Payment Income Statement  delivered by Buyer to Sellers pursuant
     to Section  4.2(b)(i)  hereof,  in the event Markowitz does not dispute any
     item on the  Contingent  Payment  Income  Statement  within  45 days  after
     receipt thereof, or (y) the definitive  Contingent Payment Income Statement
     resulting from the determinations made by the Arbitrator in accordance with
     this Section 4.3 (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by Buyer
     and Markowitz), in the event Markowitz does dispute any such item.

                   (e) Payment of the Buyer's  Purchase  Price  Adjustment,  the
     Sellers' Purchase Price Adjustment,  the Buyer's  Contingent Payment or the
     Sellers' Contingent Payment, as the case may be, shall be delayed until the
     final  resolution of all disputes  regarding such  adjustment or payment as
     provided in this Section 4.3,  upon which event such  adjustment or payment
     shall be paid in accordance Section 4.1(b)(ii),  4.1(b)(iii), 4.2(b)(ii) or
     4.2(b)(iii)  hereof,  as the  case  may  be,  within  10  days  thereafter,
     together,  in each  case,  with  interest  on such  amount  from the period
     Markowitz  first received the Closing  Statement or the Contingent  Payment
     Income  Statement,  as the case may be,  through  the date such  payment is
     made, calculated at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually.

     action to take by eminent domain or otherwise to condemn any portion of any
     premises  which  are the  subject  of the  Real  Property  Leases.  To each
     Seller's  and  Markowitz's  knowledge,  there  exists no writ,  injunction,

     enforceable and in full force and effect with respect to the Seller that is
     a party thereto. No Seller nor, to Sellers' or Markowitz's  knowledge,  any

     Lease,  and no event has occurred and is continuing  that  constitutes  or,

     violation or breach  thereunder.  No amount payable under any Real Property
     Lease is past due. No Seller has received  any notice of a default,  offset
     or  counterclaim  under any Real Property Lease or any other  communication
     asserting  non-compliance with any Real Property Lease. Each Seller has the
     exclusive  right to use and  occupy  the  premises  leased  under each Real
     Property Lease to which such Seller is a party. Each Seller enjoys peaceful

     Property  Lease to which it is a party  to Buyer in  accordance  with  this

     enforceability and continuity of any such lease.

Assets are so owned and which are so licensed.  Sellers have  delivered to Buyer
copies of all material documents and true and complete memoranda  describing the

Intellectual  Property Asset and no Seller or Affiliate thereof has received any

audit with respect to Taxes by any  Governmental  Authority and no  Governmental
Authority is now asserting in writing against any Seller any deficiency or claim
for Taxes.  No event has occurred  that could impose on Buyer any  liability for
any Taxes due or to become due from any Seller from any taxing authority.

and safety  permits  necessary for the  operation of the Business,  and all such
permits  are in full force and  effect  and  Sellers  are in  compliance  in all
material  respects with the terms and conditions of each such permit.  There are
no outstanding Liens on any Seller's interest in any of the Real Property Leases
under any Environmental Laws. No Seller has received any notice, or is aware of,
any  administrative  or judicial  investigations,  proceedings  or actions  with
respect to material violations,  alleged or proven, of Environmental Laws by any
Seller or any tenants or  subtenants of any Seller,  or otherwise  involving the
Real Property Leases or the operations  conducted on the property subject to the
Real Property Leases.

Seller's  knowledge,  is there  any  substantial  threat  of a  release)  of any
Hazardous  Substance  at  or  from  the  Real  Property  Leases  in  amounts  or
concentrations  requiring  remediation  under  or  that  would  violate  current
Environmental  Laws in any material respect.  There are no Hazardous  Substances
present on the Real Property  Leases except for ordinary  quantities of properly

     occurring or existing as of, or confinements or treatments commencing prior
     on or to, the Closing Date,  subject in the case of any such  liability for
     compensation or other payroll items, to clause (a) of Section 3.1 hereto.

                   8.9  INSTALLATION OF CAMERAS.  Prior to the Closing,  Sellers
shall use their  reasonable  efforts  to  install  the  traffic  cameras  at the
locations and at the times described in SCHEDULE 8.10.

                   8.10 NAME CHANGE;  POST-CLOSING USE OF TRADEMARKS.  Within 30
days of the Closing,  each Seller and each  Affiliate of Markowitz  shall change
its name to  eliminate  the words  "Shadow  Traffic",  "Express  Traffic" or any
derivatives thereof. From and after the Closing Date, no Seller and no Affiliate
of Markowitz  shall use any of the trademarks  listed on SCHEDULE 7.7 hereof nor
any  derivatives  thereof in the conduct of such  Seller's  or such  Affiliate's
respective  business,  except pursuant to the license  agreement  referred to in
Sections 13.9 and 14.5 hereof.

<PAGE>

                   9.2 RENEWAL OF CONTRACTS.  Prior to the Closing,  each Seller
shall use its  reasonable  efforts to renew any  Contract to be assumed by Buyer
hereunder  pursuant  to Section  3.1 which by its terms  expires  or  terminates
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,  provided that any such
renewal shall be on terms and conditions  consistent  with the past practices of
the Business.

                   9.3  TREATMENT  OF BOOKS AND  RECORDS.  For a period of three

shall  give  Markowitz  notice of its  intended  action and an  opportunity  for
Markowitz  to retain any of the books or records  proposed  to be  discarded  or
destroyed  by Buyer.  Prior to the  destruction  of any such  books or  records,
Sellers and Markowitz shall have the right, upon reasonable advance request,  to
have access to such books and records during normal business hours to enable any
of them to  fulfill  the Tax and  ordinary  course  partnership  obligations  of
Sellers.

                   9.4  POST-CLOSING   RESTRICTION  ON  BUYER.  (a)  Subject  to
Sections  9.4(b) and 9.4(c)  hereof,  Buyer  covenants  and agrees that from and
after the Closing Date it will not conduct,  directly or indirectly  through any
Affiliate  (other than Infinity  Broadcasting  Corporation  or any  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Infinity  Broadcasting  Corporation),  any Local  Content  Radio
Programming in any Second Tier Radio Market or Third Tier Radio Market,  in each
case to the extent (and only to the extent) that the  advertising  inventory for
such  Local  Content  Radio  Programming   consists   primarily  of  ten  second
advertising  units,   PROVIDED  that  the  foregoing  provision  shall  have  no
application  to and shall  not be  deemed to limit in any way any Local  Content
Radio  Programming  Business in any Second Tier Radio Market or Third Tier Radio
Market that Buyer is conducting,  directly or indirectly  through any Affiliate,
as of the date of this Agreement.

                   (b) The  covenants  set forth in Section  9.4(a) hereof shall
     terminate (i) with respect to each Second Tier Radio Market, upon the first
     to occur of (A) the first  anniversary of the Second Tier Closing Date, (B)
     the expiration  (without  exercise) of the put and call  arrangements  with
     respect to the Second Tier Assets set forth in Section  11.1 hereof and (C)
     Buyer's payment of the Buyout Amount with respect to such Second Tier Radio
     Market under Section  9.4(c) hereof and (ii) with respect to any Third Tier
     Radio Market,  upon the first to occur of (V) the first  anniversary of the
     Third Tier Closing Date with respect to such Third Tier Radio  Market,  (W)
     the expiration  (without  exercise) of the put and call  arrangements  with
     respect to such Third Tier Radio  Market set forth in Section  12.1 hereof,
     (X) Markowitz's  failure to comply with any of the covenants in Section 9.5
     hereof  with  respect  to such Third Tier  Radio  Market,  (Y)  Markowitz's
     decision to cease to conduct Local Content  Radio  Programming  Business in
     such Third Tier Radio  Market  pursuant  to the third  sentence  of Section
     9.5(a) hereof and (Z) Buyer's  payment of the Buyout Amount with respect to
     such Third Tier Radio Market under Section 9.4(c) hereof.

<PAGE>

                   (c) At any time  following  the Closing  Date,  Buyer may, by
     delivering a written notice to Markowitz (the "Buyout  Notice"),  terminate
     the covenants set forth in Section 9.4(a) hereof with respect to any of the
     Second Tier Radio  Markets or Third Tier Radio Markets by paying the Buyout
     Amount  applicable  to such Radio Market to  Markowitz,  such payment to be
     made on such date as Buyer  specifies  in the  Buyout  Notice.  Any  Buyout
     Amount  otherwise  payable by Buyer to Markowitz  under this Section 9.4(c)
     shall be reduced  by an amount  equal to the  Carryover  Amount on the date
     such Buyout Amount is paid.  Upon delivery of any Buyout Notice,  Markowitz
     shall  promptly   provide  Buyer  with  a  certificate  (a  "Start-Up  Cost
     Certificate")   setting  forth  all  of  Markowitz's  and  his  Affiliates'
     out-of-pocket  expenses, if any, incurred in connection with fulfilling the
     applicable covenants set forth in Section 9.5(a) hereof for the period from
     the Closing Date to the date such Buyout  Notice is delivered to Markowitz,
     together  with  reasonable  supporting  documentation  of  such  costs.  In
     addition,  upon  delivery of any Buyout  Notice  with  respect to any Radio
     Market which has been profitable  during the six-month period most recently
     completed  prior to the  delivery of such Buyout  Notice,  Markowitz  shall
     promptly provide Buyer with a certificate containing a projected net income
     statement for such Radio Market for the  twelve-month  period following the
     delivery  of  such  Buyout  Notice  (a  "Projection   Certificate").   Each
     Projection Certificate shall be prepared in good faith by Markowitz,  shall
     be  consistent  with the past  performance  of the  business  in such Radio
     Market and shall  employ the  methodology  described  in Section  4.1(b)(i)
     applicable to the  preparation of the Contingent  Payment Income  Statement
     for the  Business.  Buyer shall have the right to dispute any Start-Up Cost
     Certificate  or Projection  Certificate  in the manner set forth in Section
     9.4(d) hereof.

                   (d) Buyer shall have the right to dispute  any amount  listed
     on any Start-Up Cost  Certificate or the net income  calculation  listed on
     any Projection Certificate,  as the case may be (each a "Disputed Amount").
     If Buyer is unable to reach an agreement with Markowitz regarding each such
     Disputed   Amount  within  15  days  of  the  delivery  of  the  applicable
     certificate,  Buyer and Markowitz  shall submit the dispute  regarding each
     such  Disputed  Amount to  arbitration  using the  procedures  set forth in
     Section 21.8 hereof. In any such arbitration, the Board shall determine and
     report  upon each such  Disputed  Amount  and such  report  shall be final,
     binding and  conclusive  on Buyer and  Markowitz  with respect to each such
     Disputed  Amount,  PROVIDED  that if,  after  giving  effect to the Board's
     resolution of any Disputed Amount  relating to the net income  reflected on
     any Projection Certificate,  the net income for the applicable Radio Market
     would not vary from the  calculation of such net income as reflected on the
     applicable  Projection  Certificate by 10% or more, then the calculation of
     such net income as reflected on such Projection Certificate shall be final,
     binding and  conclusive  on Buyer and  Markowitz  for all  purposes of this
     Section 9.4.

                   (e)  Buyer  may  pay  up to  40%  of  any  Buyout  Amount  by
     delivering  Westwood  Stock to Markowitz,  such Westwood Stock to be valued
     based on a per share price  equal to the  average of the  Closing  Price of
     Westwood Stock,  as reported on NASDAQ,  for the ten trading days preceding
     the Second Business day before such Buyout Amount is paid.

                   (f) Simultaneously  with Buyer's payment of the Buyout Amount
     for any Second  Tier Radio  Market or Third  Tier Radio  Market,  Markowitz
     shall transfer all of the assets and  businesses  used in the Local Content
     Radio  Programming  Business  used in such Radio Market to Buyer,  free and
     clear of all Liens and without any additional  cost to Buyer other than the
     payment of the  Buyout  Amount  with  respect  to such  Radio  Market.  The
     non-purchase  price  related  terms and  conditions  with  respect  to such
     transfer  shall be comparable to the terms and  conditions  that would have
     applied to such transfer were it made pursuant to the applicable provisions
     of Section 11.2 or 12.2 hereof, as the case may be. Upon the receipt of any
     Buyout  Notice from Buyer,  Buyer and  Markowitz  shall use and shall cause
     their Affiliates to use their respective best efforts to negotiate, execute
     and  deliver to Buyer a transfer  agreement  under which all of such assets
     will be delivered to Buyer in accordance with the two immediately preceding
     sentences.

                   (g) Buyer  acknowledges that the covenants  contained in this
     Section 9.4 hereof were a material and necessary inducement for Sellers and
     Markowitz to agree to the transactions  contemplated hereby, and that Buyer
     will realize  significant  monetary benefit from these  transactions,  that
     violations of any of the covenants  contained in Section 9.4(a) hereof will
     cause  irreparable  and continuing  damage to Sellers and  Markowitz,  that
     Sellers and Markowitz  shall be entitled to  injunctive or other  equitable
     relief from any court of  competent  jurisdiction  restraining  any further
     violation  of such  covenants  and that  such  injunctive  relief  shall be
     cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which Sellers
     and Markowitz may be entitled.

                   9.5  ACTIVITIES  OF MARKOWITZ IN THE FIRST,  SECOND AND THIRD
TIER RADIO MARKETS;  NON-COMPETES.  (a) Markowitz  shall use his best efforts to
establish,  develop and operate a Local  Content Radio  Programming  Business in
each of the Third Tier Radio  Markets  consistent  with the  timetable  for such
Third Tier Radio  Markets set forth on SCHEDULE 1.1.  Upon  commencement  of any
Local  Content  Radio  Programming  Business  in any Third  Tier  Radio  Market,
Markowitz shall promptly  deliver a notice to Buyer specifying the date on which
such  business  commenced in such Third Tier Radio Market.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  Markowitz  shall have the right upon 30 days advance notice to Buyer
to cease to operate the Local  Content Radio  Programming  Business in any Third
Tier  Radio  Market if such  business,  in  Markowitz's  reasonable  good  faith
judgment, is, and will continue to be, financially unprofitable.

                   (b) Markowitz  shall neither  conduct nor be associated  with
     (as a director, officer, employee, equity holder, partner or otherwise) any
     Local  Content  Radio  Programming  Business in any First Tier Radio Market
     from and after the Closing  Date.  In  addition,  Markowitz  shall  neither
     conduct nor be associated with (as a director,  officer,  employee,  equity
     holder,  partner or otherwise) any Local Content Radio Programming Business
     in any Second  Tier Radio  Market or Third Tier Radio  Market  prior to the
     earlier of (i) the expiration of the put and call arrangements with respect
     to such market under  Article XII or XIII  hereof,  as the case may be, and
     (ii) the Second Tier  Closing  Date or Third Tier Closing Date with respect
     to such  market,  as the case may be,  except,  in each  case,  through  an
     Affiliate that will be subject to the  applicable  put and call  provisions
     set forth in Articles XII and XIII hereof;  provided that,  notwithstanding
     the  foregoing,  the  covenants  set  forth in this  Section  9.5(b)  shall
     continue in effect  forever  with respect to any Third Tier Radio Market in
     which  Markowitz  ceases  to  operate  a Local  Content  Radio  Programming
     Business as permitted under the third sentence of Section 9.5(a) hereof.

                   9.6 SPECIAL CALL RIGHTS. In the event Markowitz exercises his
right  pursuant  to the third  sentence  of  Section  9.5(a)  hereof to cease to
operate a Local  Content  Radio  Programming  Business  in any Third  Tier Radio
Market,  Buyer may, at any time thereafter,  by delivering  notice to Markowitz,
require  Markowitz  to transfer  all of the assets and  businesses  used in such
Local  Content  Radio  Programming  Business in such Third Tier Radio  Market to
Buyer,  free and clear of all Liens and without  cost to Buyer.  The other terms
and  conditions  of any such  transfer  shall be  comparable  to the  terms  and
conditions of this  Agreement  with respect to the First Tier Markets.  Upon the
receipt of any such notice from Buyer,  Markowitz  shall use and shall cause his
Affiliates  to use their  respective  best  efforts to  negotiate,  execute  and
deliver to Buyer a transfer  agreement  under  which all of such  assets will be
delivered to Buyer in accordance with the two immediately preceding sentences.

Markowitz  such (i) sales and marketing  support,  (ii) legal services and (iii)
general  managerial  services as are  specifically  requested by Markowitz  (the
"Other  Services";  and together with the Overhead  Services,  the  "Services").
Notwithstanding  anything  in this  Article X to the  contrary,  Buyer  shall be
obligated  to  provide  Other  Services  only  to  the  extent  (x)  it  employs
individuals who are available to, and capable of,  providing such Services,  (y)
the Other Services can be provided  without  disrupting  Buyer's  conduct of its
ongoing  business  operations and (z) such services are utilized by such Service

Markowitz and his Affiliates in the Second Tier Radio Markets and the Third Tier
Radio Markets.  The parties will conduct such joint marketing activities subject
to mutual agreement on the nature and terms of such  activities.  All such joint
marketing efforts will be conducted under Buyer's name.

                   10.3 TERMINATION.  Buyer's obligation to provide the Services
shall  commence on the Closing Date and shall  terminate  (a) in the case of any
Service Recipient engaged in any Local Content Radio Programming Business in any
Second  Tier Radio  Market,  upon the  earliest  to occur of (i) the Second Tier
Closing  Date,  (ii) the  expiration  of the put and call  rights  described  in
Section 11.1 hereof with respect to the Second Tier Assets and (iii) Markowitz's
failure to perform his covenant in Section 9.5 hereof with respect to the Second
Tier Radio Market in which such Service Recipient operates,  and (b) in the case
of any Service Recipient engaged in any Local Content Radio Programming Business
in any of the Third Tier Radio  Markets,  upon the  earliest to occur of (w) the
Third Tier  Closing  Date with  respect to the Third Tier Radio  Market in which
such Service Recipient  operates,  (x) the expiration of the put and call rights
described  in Section 12.1 hereof with respect to the Third Tier Radio Market in
which such Service Recipient  operates,  (y) Markowitz's  failure to perform his
covenant in Section 9.5 hereof  with  respect to the Third Tier Radio  Market in

with  respect to each  Service  provided  by Buyer  pursuant  to this  Article X
(collectively  the "Service  Costs").  Without  limiting the  generality  of the
foregoing,  with respect to any Service, the Service Costs shall include (i) all
salary and employee  benefit costs  attributable to those employees of Buyer who
provide such Service for the periods of time during which such employees provide
such  Service  and (ii)  all  other  out-of-pocket  costs  incurred  by Buyer in
connection  with providing such Service or  maintaining  administrative  records
relating to such Service.

                   10.5  BILLING AND  PAYMENT.  No later than 30  Business  Days

Costs.  Sellers and Markowitz,  jointly and severally,  shall be responsible for
paying each such statement in full within 15 days of receipt.  Without  limiting
any other right of Buyer,  payments  made later than 15 days shall accrue simple
interest at 10% per annum (or such lesser rate as may be the legal  maximum rate
of interest).

                                   ARTICLE XI

                   RIGHTS REGARDING SECOND TIER RADIO MARKETS

                   11.1 PUT AND CALL RIGHTS. (a) Subject to Section 11.3 hereof,
at any time during the 30 day period  beginning on the third  anniversary of the
Closing Date, Markowitz may, by delivering notice to Buyer (the "Second Tier Put
Notice"), require Buyer to purchase all of the Second Tier Assets and the Second
Tier Business  from  Markowitz or any Affiliate of Markowitz for the Second Tier
Initial  Purchase  Price and on the  other  terms  and  conditions  set forth in
Section 11.2.  If, prior to the 30th day following the third  anniversary of the
Closing,  Markowitz has not (i) previously  delivered the Second Tier Put Notice
or (ii)  delivered a written  notice to Buyer  stating  that he does not wish to
deliver the Second Tier Put Notice,  Markowitz shall be deemed to have delivered
the  Second  Tier Put  Notice  to Buyer on the  30th  day  following  the  third
anniversary of the Closing Date.

                   (b) Subject to Section 11.3 hereof, at any time during the 30
day period beginning on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer may, by
delivering  notice  to  Markowitz  (the  "Second  Tier  Call  Notice"),  require

                   11.2 TERMS OF PUT OR CALL.  (a) Upon  delivery  of the Second
Tier Put Notice or the Second Tier Call  Notice,  as the case may be,  Buyer and
Markowitz shall each use their respective best efforts to promptly  negotiate an
asset purchase  agreement (the "Second Tier Purchase  Agreement") for the Second
Tier Assets and Second Tier Business that,  subject to the last sentence of this
Section 11.2(a),  conforms in all material  respects to the terms and conditions
of this  Agreement  with  respect to the sale and purchase of the Assets and the
Business.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  the Second Tier
Purchase  Agreement shall contain (i) a purchase price  adjustment  based on the
difference  between  the  audited  adjusted  current  assets of the Second  Tier
Business as of the closing under the Second Tier Purchase Agreement (the "Second
Tier Closing Date")  compared to an amount equal to the revenues for such Second
Tier Business during the two completed  months  immediately  prior to the Second
Tier Closing Date, (ii) a second purchase price  adjustment based on the audited
adjusted  pre-tax  profits of the Second Tier Business  during the first full 12
calendar  months  following  the Second Tier Closing Date compared to the Second
Tier  Adjusted  Profits,  and  (iii)  representations,   warranties,  covenants,
conditions and indemnities with respect to the Second Tier Assets and the Second
Tier  Business  that  are  comparable  in all  material  respects  to  the  like
representations,  warranties, covenants, conditions and indemnities agreed to by
Buyer  and  Sellers  herein  with  respect  to  the  Assets  and  the  Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  unlike this Agreement,  the Second Tier Purchase
Agreement  shall  provide  that (A)  Buyer may  offset  any  amounts  owed to it
pursuant to Section 18.1 hereof against the Second Tier Initial  Purchase Price,
or any purchase price adjustment it must make in favor of the seller thereunder,
(B)  any  purchase  price  adjustment  must  be  paid  by  Buyer  or the  seller
thereunder,  as the case may be, in cash within 90 days following the definitive
determination of such purchase price adjustment,  (C) Buyer may pay up to 40% of
the Second Tier Initial  Purchase Price, and any purchase price  adjustment,  by
delivering Westwood Stock, to such seller and (D) in the event that Buyer elects
to pay any portion of the Second Tier Initial  Purchase Price by delivering such
Westwood Stock,  (i) each share of Westwood Stock shall be valued based on a per
share  price equal to the average of the  closing  price of Westwood  Stock,  as
reported on NASDAQ,  for the ten trading days preceding the second  Business Day
before the Second Tier  Closing  Date and (ii) Buyer and such seller  shall make
appropriate and conventional  representations  and warranties to each other with
respect to such Westwood Stock.

                   (b) The Second Tier Purchase Agreement shall provide that the
Second Tier  Initial  Purchase  Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Carryover  Amount at the time the Second Tier Initial Purchase Price is paid and
shall be  appropriately  adjusted  to reflect  any  transfer  of any Second Tier
Assets or Second Tier Businesses pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof.

parties  under  Sections  11.1(a) and 11.1(b)  hereof with respect to any Second

                    RIGHTS REGARDING THIRD TIER RADIO MARKETS

                   12.1 PUT AND CALL RIGHTS. (a) Subject to Section 12.3 hereof,

                   12.2 TERMS OF PUT OR CALL.  (a) Upon delivery of a Third Tier
Put Notice or a Third Tier Call Notice,  as the case may be, with respect to any
Third Tier Radio  Market,  Buyer and Markowitz  shall each use their  respective
best  efforts to  promptly  negotiate  an asset  purchase  agreement  (each such
agreement,  a "Third Tier Purchase  Agreement") for all of the Third Tier Assets
and Third Tier  Business  for such Third Tier  Radio  Market,  which  Third Tier
Purchase Agreement shall,  subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.2(a),
conform in all material  respects to the terms and  conditions of this Agreement
with  respect to the sale and purchase of the Assets and the  Business.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  such Third Tier Purchase  Agreement
shall contain (i) a purchase price  adjustment  based on the difference  between
the audited  adjusted  current  assets of the Third Tier Business and Third Tier
Assets for such Third Tier Radio Market as of the closing  under such Third Tier
Purchase  Agreement (a "Third Tier Closing Date") compared to an amount equal to
the  revenues  for such Third Tier  Business  during  the two  completed  months
immediately  prior to such Third Tier Closing Date, (ii) a second purchase price
adjustment  based on the  audited  pre-tax  adjusted  profits  of the Third Tier
Business and Third Tier Assets for such Third Tier Radio Market during the first
full 12 calendar  months  following such Third Tier Closing Date compared to the
adjusted  profits of such Third Tier Business and Third Tier Assets utilized for
calculating the Third Tier Initial Purchase Price under such Third Tier Purchase
Agreement  and (iii)  representations,  warranties,  covenants,  conditions  and
indemnities  with  respect to the Third Tier  Business and the Third Tier Assets
for such Third Tier Radio Market that are comparable in all material respects to
the like  representations,  warranties,  covenants,  conditions and  indemnities
agreed to by Buyer  and  Sellers  herein  with  respect  to the  Assets  and the
Business.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  each Third Tier Purchase  Agreement
shall  provide  that (A)  Buyer  may  offset  any  amounts  owed to it under the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement, the Second Tier Purchase Agreement
or any other  Third Tier  Purchase  Agreement  against  the Third  Tier  Initial
Purchase Price under such Third Tier Purchase  Agreement,  or any purchase price
adjustment Buyer must make in favor of the seller  thereunder,  (B) any purchase
price adjustment thereunder must be paid by Buyer or the seller, as the case may
be, within 90 days following the definitive determination of such purchase price
adjustment,  (C) Buyer may pay up to 40% of the purchase price  thereunder,  and
any purchase price adjustment,  by delivering Westwood Stock, to such seller and
(D) in the event that Buyer  elects to pay any portion of any Third Tier Initial
Purchase Price by delivering  Westwood  Stock,  (i) each share of Westwood Stock
shall be valued  based on a per share  price equal to the average of the closing
price of  Westwood  Stock,  as  reported  on NASDAQ,  for the ten  trading  days
preceding  the second day before such Third Tier Closing Date and (ii) Buyer and
such  seller  shall  make  appropriate  and  conventional   representations  and
warranties to each other with respect to such Westwood Stock.

                   (b) Each Third Tier  Purchase  Agreement  shall also  provide
that the Third Tier  Initial  Purchase  Price  under  such  Third Tier  Purchase
Agreement  shall be reduced by an amount  equal to the  Carryover  Amount at the
time such Third Tier Initial Purchase Price is paid.

                   12.3  TERMINATION  OF PUT AND  CALL  RIGHTS.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event Markowitz exercises his
right  pursuant  to the third  sentence  of  Section  9.5(a)  hereof to cease to
operate a Local  Content  Radio  Programming  Business  in any Third  Tier Radio
Market,  the put and call  rights of the  parties  under  Sections  12.1(a)  and
12.1(b)  hereof with respect to such Local  Content Radio  Programming  Business
shall expire and  terminate  and have no further  force or effect.  In addition,
notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the  contrary,  all put and call
rights of the parties under Sections  12.1(a) and 12.1(b) hereof with respect to
all Third Tier Radio  Markets  shall  expire and  terminate  and have no further
force or effect  immediately  upon  Buyer's  delivery of the Buyout  Notice with
respect to such Third Tier Radio Market under Section 9.4(c) hereof.

     arising out of the matters referred to in such clauses exceeds $200,000, in
     which event Sellers and Markowitz shall only be required to indemnify Buyer
     with respect to the aggregate amount of such Losses that exceed $200,000.

                   18.2  INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. (a) GENERAL.  Notwithstanding
the Closing,  Buyer covenants and agrees to defend,  indemnify and hold harmless
each Seller, its Affiliates and the partners,  officers,  directors,  employees,
agents,  advisers and representatives of each such Person from and against,  and
pay or  reimburse  each such Person for,  any and all Losses  resulting  from or
arising out of:

                   (i) any inaccuracy in any  representation or warranty made by
              Buyer  herein  or  in  any  certificate,  document  or  instrument
              delivered to any Seller  hereunder (in each case,  without  taking
              into  account  any  qualification  as to  materiality  or material
              adverse effect contained in such representations or warranties);

                   (ii)  any  failure  of  Buyer  to  perform  any  covenant  or
              agreement  hereunder  or fulfill any other  obligation  in respect
              hereof;

                   (iii) any  liability,  obligation or commitment of any Seller
              expressly assumed by Buyer under Section 3.1 hereof; and

                   (iv)  the  ownership  of the  Assets  or the  conduct  of the
              Business  subsequent  to  the  Closing  Date,  including,  without
              limitation,  any action taken by Michael D'Ambrose with respect to
              any First  Tier Radio  Market in  accordance  with the  Employment
              Agreement,  except,  in each case,  to the extent  such Loss is an
              Excluded Liability.

                   (b) LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.  Notwithstanding anything
     in  Section  18.2(a)  of this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  to the  extent
     indemnification  is sought under  clause (i) of Section 18.2 hereof,  Buyer
     shall  not be  required  to  provide  any such  indemnification  until  the
     aggregate  amount of Losses  resulting  from or arising  out of the matters
     referred to in such clause (i) exceeds $200,000, in which event Buyer shall
     only be required to  indemnify  Sellers and  Markowitz  with respect to the
     aggregate amount of such Losses that exceed $200,000.

                   18.3  INDEMNIFICATION  PROCEDURES.  In the case of any  claim
asserted by a third party against a party entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (the  "Indemnified  Party"),  notice shall be given by the Indemnified
Party to the  party  required  to  provide  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after such Indemnified  Party has actual knowledge of any claim
as to which indemnity may be sought,  and the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying  Party (at the  expense of such  Indemnifying  Party) to assume the
defense of any claim or any litigation  resulting  therefrom,  provided that (a)
the counsel  for the  Indemnifying  Party who shall  conduct the defense of such
claim or litigation shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified  Party,
(b) the Indemnified  Party may  participate in such defense at such  Indemnified
Party's expense, and (c) the omission by any Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its  indemnification
obligation  under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission results
in a failure of actual notice to the  Indemnifying  Party and such  Indemnifying
Party is materially  damaged as a result of such failure to give notice.  Except
with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying  Party,
in the defense of any such claim or  litigation,  shall  consent to entry of any
judgment  or order,  interim or  otherwise,  or enter into any  settlement  that
provides for injunctive or other  nonmonetary  relief  affecting the Indemnified
Party or that does not include as an  unconditional  term  thereof the giving by
each  claimant or  plaintiff  to such  Indemnified  Party of a release  from all
liability  with  respect  to such  claim or  litigation.  In the event  that the
Indemnified  Party shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense
of any claim subject to indemnification  hereunder or any proposed settlement of
any such claim by the  Indemnifying  Party might be expected to affect adversely
the Indemnified Party's tax liability or, if Buyer is the Indemnified Party, the
ability of Buyer to conduct the Business, or that the Indemnified Party may have
available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with
one or more of those that may be available to the Indemnifying  Party in respect
of such claim or any litigation  relating  thereto,  the Indemnified Party shall
have the right at all times to take over and assume  control  over the  defense,
settlement,  negotiations  or litigation  relating to any such claim at the sole
cost of the Indemnifying  Party,  provided that if the Indemnified Party does so
take over and assume control,  the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim
or  litigation  without  the written  consent of the  Indemnifying  Party,  such
consent  not to be  unreasonably  withheld.  In the event that the  Indemnifying
Party  does  not  accept  the  defense  of any  matter  as above  provided,  the
Indemnified  Party shall have the full right to defend against any such claim or


                                       61
<PAGE>

demand  and shall be  entitled  to settle or agree to pay in full such  claim or
demand.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall still
provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying
Party and the  Indemnified  Party shall cooperate in the defense of any claim or
litigation  subject  to this  Section  18.3  and the  records  of each  shall be
available to the other with respect to such defense.

                   18.4 OFFSET.  Without  limiting the  liability of Sellers and
Markowitz  under this Article  XVIII or Buyer's other  remedies,  Buyer shall be
entitled (a) to withhold from any amounts  payable under Section  4.1(b)(iii) or
4.2(b)(iii) hereof or from any Buyout Amount, any amount of indemnity claimed by
Buyer under Section 18.1 pending final  resolution as to the amount of indemnity
owed by Sellers and Markowitz and (b) to offset any amounts due it under Section
18.1 against any amounts  payable by Buyer to Sellers under Section  4.1(b)(iii)
or 4.2(b)(iii) hereof or from any Buyout Amount.

                   18.5 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The indemnification provisions of this
Article XVIII shall be the sole and exclusive  remedy of the parties against one
another with respect to any claim for monetary relief under this Article XVIII.

                               TERMINATION RIGHTS

                   19.1  TERMINATION.  (a) This  Agreement  may be terminated by
either Buyer on the one hand or Markowitz on the other,  if the party seeking to
terminate (and in the case of Markowitz, each Seller) is not in material default
or  breach  of this  Agreement,  upon  written  notice  to the  other  upon  the
occurrence of any of the following:

                   (i) if the Closing has not occurred by March 30, 1996;

                   (ii) the failure of the  condition  set forth in Section 13.9
              hereof; or

                   (iii) if there shall be in effect any final  judgment,  final
              decree or order that would prevent or make unlawful the Closing.

                   19.2  LIABILITY.  The  termination  of this  Agreement  under
Section  19.1 shall not  relieve any party of any  liability  for breach of this
Agreement prior to the date of termination.

                                   ARTICLE XX

                             REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

                   Each Seller and Markowitz  recognizes  that, in the event any
Seller or Markowitz  defaults in the  performance  of its  obligations  to close
under this Agreement,  monetary  damages alone will not be adequate.  Therefore,
unless Buyer is in default in the  performance of its obligations to close under
this Agreement,  Buyer shall be entitled,  in addition to bringing an action for
indemnification  under Article XVIII hereof,  to obtain specific  performance of
the  terms  of  this  Agreement.  In any  action  to  enforce  specifically  the
performance of this Agreement, each Seller and Markowitz shall waive the defense
that there is  another  adequate  remedy at law or equity and agrees  that Buyer
shall have the right to obtain specific  performance of Sellers' and Markowitz's
obligations to close under the terms of this Agreement without being required to
prove actual damages,  post bond or furnish other security other than to pay the
full Initial Purchase Price and otherwise  perform its closing  obligations.  In
addition, Buyer shall be entitled to obtain from Sellers and Markowitz,  jointly
and  severally,  court costs and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees incurred by it in
enforcing its rights hereunder,  plus interest at the Delaware statutory rate on
the amount of any judgment  obtained  against any Seller or  Markowitz  from the
date of default  by such  Seller or  Markowitz  until the date of payment of the
judgment.  As a condition to seeking  specific  performance,  Buyer shall not be
required to have tendered the Initial Purchase Price specified in Section 2.4 of
this Agreement,  but shall be required to demonstrate that it is ready,  willing
and able to do so and to perform its other closing  obligations  in all material
respects.

                                OTHER PROVISIONS

                   21.1 CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each Seller, Markowitz and Buyer shall
keep  confidential  and  not  use or  disclose  any  information  previously  or
hereafter  obtained by it pursuant to this Agreement  (the party  receiving such
information is hereinafter referred to as the "Receiving Party") with respect to
the other or such other's partners, parents, subsidiaries,  affiliates, or other
related entities (the party, or such party's  partners,  parents,  subsidiaries,
affiliates,  or other related  entities,  with respect to which the  information
relates is hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosing Party") in connection with
this Agreement and the negotiations preceding this Agreement, including, without
limitation information provided pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof (such information
is hereinafter referred to as the "Confidential Information"), and the Receiving
Party  will use such  Confidential  Information  solely in  connection  with the
transactions   contemplated   by  this  Agreement,   and  if  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby are not  consummated  for any reason,  the Receiving  Party
shall either return to the Disclosing  Party,  without retaining a copy thereof,
or destroy any schedules,  documents or other written  information  constituting
Confidential Information (or prepared based upon such Confidential  Information)
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  hereby and
the  negotiations  preceding this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of
the  foregoing,   the  Receiving  Party  shall  be  permitted  to  disclose  any
Confidential  Information  to  such  of  its  partners,  Affiliates,   officers,
directors,   employees,  agents,  lenders  and  representatives   (collectively,
"Agents") as have a need to know such  Confidential  Information,  provided such
Agents shall be informed that  disclosure of such  Confidential  Information  by
such Agents would be in contravention hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Receiving  Party  shall not be  required  to keep  confidential  or  return  any
information  which (i) is known or available  through other lawful sources,  not
bound by a  confidentiality  agreement with the Disclosing  Party, or (ii) is or
becomes publicly known other than as a result of the disclosure by the Receiving
Party or its Agents,  or (iii) is required to be disclosed  pursuant to an order
or request or a judicial or  governmental  authority  (provided  the  Disclosing
Party is given  reasonable  prior written  notice),  or (iv) is developed by the
Receiving  Party  independently  of,  and is not based  upon,  the  Confidential
Information.

                   21.2 PUBLICITY.  Except as required by Applicable Law or with
the other parties' express written  consent,  no party to this Agreement nor any
Affiliate  of any  party  shall  issue  any  press  release  or make any  public
statement  (oral  or  written)  regarding  this  Agreement  or the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                   21.3 BENEFIT AND ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto and their  respective
successors  and assigns.  Neither Buyer nor any Seller may assign this Agreement
without the prior written  consent of Buyer,  in the case of any such assignment
by any Seller, or Markowitz,  in the case of any such assignment by Buyer except
that (i) Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
of its  Affiliates  in the manner set forth in  Section  2.2 of this  Agreement,
PROVIDED  that any such  assignment  shall  not  relieve  Buyer  from any of its
obligations  under this  Agreement  and (ii)  Buyer may assign its rights  under
Article  XVIII of this  Agreement  to any lender  which  provides  financing  in
connection with the consummation of this Agreement.

                   21.4  ACQUISITION OF PARTNERSHIP  INTERESTS.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  the parties hereto agree that Buyer
may, by  delivering  notice to Markowitz at any time prior to the Closing  Date,
require Sellers and Markowitz to execute an amendment to this Agreement pursuant
to which Buyer shall purchase all of the  outstanding  partnership  interests of
one or more of CSTLP,  NYSTLP,  LASTLP  and PETLP  rather  than  purchasing  the
portion of the Assets  held by such  Sellers.  Sellers and  Markowitz  shall use
their  respective  best  efforts to cause all other  holders of the  outstanding
partnership interests of such Sellers to execute and deliver such amendment. Any
such amendment (i) will not alter any of the financial,  risk-shifting  or other
non-structural  terms  of  this  Agreement  regarding  Buyer's  purchase  of the
Business  and (ii) shall  include  provisions  which are  customary  in purchase
agreements for the purchase of partnership interests.

                   21.5 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This  Agreement and the exhibits and
schedules  hereto embody the entire  agreement and  understanding of the parties
hereto  and  supersede   any  and  all  prior   agreements,   arrangements   and
understandings relating to the matters provided for herein. No amendment, waiver
of compliance with any provision or condition hereof or consent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing signed
by the party against whom  enforcement  of any  amendment,  waiver or consent is
sought.

                   21.6  HEADINGS.  The headings set forth in this Agreement are
for convenience  only and will not control or affect the meaning or construction
of the provisions of this Agreement.

                   21.7 CHOICE OF LAW. The  construction and performance of this
Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard
to its  principles of conflict of laws,  and the state and federal courts of New
York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any controversy or claim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement.

                   21.8  ARBITRATION  PROCEDURES.  Any  dispute  arising  out of
Section  9.4(d)  hereof  shall  be  submitted  to the  decision  of a  Board  of
Arbitration  composed of two arbitrators and an umpire (hereinafter  referred to
as the "Board").  The members of the Board shall be  disinterested in the matter
at issue.  Buyer and  Markowitz  shall each  appoint an  arbitrator  and the two
arbitrators shall choose an umpire before  instituting the hearing.  If Buyer or
Markowitz,  as the case may be, fails to appoint its  arbitrator  within 15 days
after being  requested to do so by the other  party,  the other party shall also
appoint the second  arbitrator.  If the two  arbitrators  fail to agree upon the
appointment of an umpire within 15 days after their nominations the umpire shall
be appointed by the American Arbitration Association.  The claimant shall submit
its initial brief within 10 days from appointment of the umpire.  The respondent
shall submit its brief within 10 days after receipt of the claimant's  brief and
the  claimant  shall  submit a reply brief  within 10 days after  receipt of the
respondent's  brief.  The Board shall make its decision within 20 days following
the termination of the hearings unless the parties consent to an extension.  The
majority  decision of the Board  shall be final and binding  upon all parties to
the proceeding. Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator.  Except
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,  all other costs and expenses
in connection with each  arbitration  proceeding,  including all expenses of the
umpire, shall be allocated among Buyer and Markowitz in the same proportion that
the  aggregate  amount of all of the Disputed  Amounts that are submitted to the
Board in such arbitration and are unsuccessfully  disputed by Buyer, bear to the
total  amount  of all of the  Disputed  Amounts  submitted  to the Board in such
arbitration.
