   Item 1.     Business

   General

   Westwood  One, Inc.  (the "Company"  or "Westwood  One") is  the leading
   producer and  distributor of nationally sponsored radio  programs and is
   the nation's second largest radio network.  

   The  Company's  principal source  of revenue  is  selling radio  time to
   advertisers  through one of its  two operating divisions:   Westwood One
   Radio  Networks and Westwood  One Entertainment (the  "Divisions").  The
   Company  generates revenue  principally by  its Divisions  entering into
   radio station  affiliation agreements to obtain  audience and commercial
   spots and then selling  the spots to national advertisers.   The Company
   is  strategically positioned to provide a broad range of programming and
   services which  both deliver  audience to  advertisers  and news,  talk,
   sports, and entertainment programs to radio stations.   
   
   Westwood One Radio Networks offers radio stations three traditional news
   services, CNN  Radio,  NBC Radio  Network  and the  Mutual  Broadcasting
   System, plus youth-oriented  network news and  entertainment programming
   from  The  Source,  in  addition to  eight  24-hour  satellite-delivered
   continuous  play  music  formats  and  weekday  and   weekend  news  and
   entertainment features and programs.
   
   Westwood  One Entertainment  produces  music, sports,  talk and  special
   event programming.  These  programs include: countdown shows;  music and
   interview programs;  live  concert  broadcasts;  major  sporting  events
   (principally covering  the NFL,  Notre Dame football  and other  college
   football and basketball games);  live, personality intensive talk shows;
   and exclusive satellite simulcasts with HBO and other cable networks.


                                    1<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

   The Company's programs are broadcast in every radio market in the United
   States  measured  by  The  Arbitron Ratings  Company  ("Arbitron"),  the
   leading rating service, as well as being broadcast internationally.

   Westwood  One, through  its Divisions,  enables national  advertisers to
   purchase  advertising  time  and   to  have  their  commercial  messages
   broadcast  on  radio stations  throughout  the  United States,  reaching
   demographically defined listening audiences.   The Company delivers both
   of the major demographic  groups targeted by national advertisers:   the
   25  to 54-year old adult market and  the 12 to 34-year-old youth market.
   The  Company  currently  sells advertising  time  to  over  300 national
   advertisers, including each of the 25 largest network radio advertisers.
   Radio  stations are able to obtain quality programming from Westwood One
   to meet  their objective of  attracting larger  listening audiences  and
   increasing  local  advertising  revenue.    Westwood  One,  through  the
   development of internal programming as well as through acquisitions, has
   developed  an  extensive  tape  library of  previously  aired  programs,
   interviews, live  concert performances, news  and special  events.   The
   Company  uses its  library  as  a  major source    of  new  programming,
   enhancing  the  Company's  future  programming  and  revenue  generating
   capabilities.  



    Industry Background

         Radio Broadcasting

    As of January 1,  1995, there were approximately 9,750  commercial radio
    stations in the United  States.  The radio broadcast  industry, however,
    remains highly fragmented with no broadcaster permitted to own more than
    40  radio  stations.    This  fragmentation  is  due  primarily  to  FCC
    limitations on multiple station ownership.
          
    A  radio station selects a style  of programming ("format") to attract a
    target  listening audience  and  thereby attract  commercial advertising
    directed at  that audience.  There are many formats from which a station
    may select, including news,  talk, sports and various types of music and
    entertainment programming.  

    The  diversity  in program  formats  has  intensified competition  among
    stations  for  local  advertising revenue.    A  radio  station has  two
    principal ways of effectively  competing for these revenues.   First, it
    can  differentiate  itself  in   its  local  market  by   selecting  and
    successfully  executing a format targeted at  a particular audience thus
    enabling  advertisers to  place  their commercial  messages on  stations
    aimed at audiences  with certain demographic characteristics.  A station
    can also broadcast special programming, sporting events or national news
    product,  such as  supplied  by  Westwood  One,  not  available  to  its
    competitors  within its  format.  National  programming broadcast  on an

                                    2<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    exclusive geographic basis can  help differentiate a station within  its
    market, and thereby enable a station to increase its audience  and local
    advertising revenue.  

         Radio Advertising 

    Radio advertising time can be purchased on a local, regional or national
    basis.  Local  purchases allow  an advertiser to  select specific  radio
    stations in chosen  geographic markets for  the broadcast of  commercial
    messages.   However, this process  can be expensive  and time-consuming,
    and may  not permit  the advertiser  to select  the specific  program in
    which  its  advertisements  will  be  broadcast.    Local  and  regional
    purchases  are typically best suited for an advertiser whose business or
    ad campaign is  in a  specific geographic area.   Advertising  purchased
    from a  radio network is one  method by which an  advertiser targets its
    commercial  messages  to a  specific demographic  audience.   A national
    advertising  purchase can enable an advertiser  to achieve its objective
    with one  purchase,  at a  lower  cost per  listener,  and to  select  a
    particular  program  environment in  which  its  advertisements will  be
    broadcast.  

    In recent years the increase in the number of program formats has led to
    more demographically  specific  listening  audiences,  making  radio  an
    attractive, alternative  medium for national advertisers.   In addition,
    nationally broadcast  news, concerts and special  event programming have
    made radio an effective medium of reach (size of listening audiences) as
    well as frequency (number of exposures to the target audience).  

    To  verify  audience  delivery  and  demographic  composition,  specific
    measurement  information  is   available  to  national  advertisers   by
    independent rating  services such as Arbitron  and Statistical Research,
    Inc.'s  RADAR.   These rating  services provide  demographic information
    such  as the  age  and  sex  composition  of  the  listening  audiences.
    Consequently, national advertisers can verify that their  advertisements
    are being heard by their target listening audience.  

         Business Strategy 

    Westwood One  provides targeted radio audiences and  commercial spots to
    national  advertisers  through  its  recognized  programming  and  other
    network  products.   The Company,  through its  various radio  networks,
    produces and  distributes quality programming to  radio stations seeking
    to  increase their  listening  audience and  improve local  and national
    advertising  revenue.   The Company  sells  advertising time  within its
    programs  to  national advertisers  desiring  to  reach large  listening
    audiences nationwide with specific demographic characteristics.  

    In 1993 the Company developed and implemented a strategy to focus on its
    core radio network business and to reduce debt by divesting of all other
    businesses.  In  refocusing on  its core network  and radio  syndication

                                       3<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    business,  the  Company   has  concentrated  on  across-the-board   cost
    reductions  in order to improve profitability and, in February 1994, the
    Company took a major step  to enhance its future and ability  to compete
    by acquiring  Unistar Radio Networks, Inc.  ("Unistar") for $101,300,000
    plus expenses along with the  following additional matters in connection
    with the acquisition:

            (a)  the  sale by the Company to Infinity Network, Inc. ("INI"), a
                 wholly-owned subsidiary of Infinity  Broadcasting Corporation
                 ("Infinity"), of 5,000,000 shares of the Company's Common
                 Stock and a warrant to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000
                 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per  
                 share, for a total purchase price of $15,000,000;


            (b)  a  Management  Agreement  between the  Company  and  Infinity
                 pursuant  to  which  (a)   the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of
                 Infinity, currently Mel Karmazin,  became the Chief Executive
                 Officer of  the Company, (b)  the Chief Financial  Officer of
                 Infinity, currently Farid Suleman, became the Chief Financial
                 Officer of the  Company and (c)  Infinity began managing  the
                 business and operations for an annual base fee  of $2,000,000
                 (adjusted for  inflation), an  annual cash bonus  (payable in
                 the  event   of  meeting  certain   financial  targets)   and
                 additional  warrants to  acquire  up to  1,500,000 shares  of
                 common stock  exercisable  after the  Company's common  stock
                 reaches certain market prices per share.

            (c)  a Voting  Agreement providing  for the reconstitution  of the
                 Board of Directors into a nine-member Board and the voting of
                 Norman  Pattiz's shares  of  the Company's  Common Stock  and
                 Class B Stock and the shares of the Common Stock held by INI.

    The Company financed  the acquisition ($101,300,000), with  a new senior
    loan from a syndicate of banks in the amount of $125,000,000.




         Radio Programming

    The  depth  of Westwood  One's  programming has  grown  through internal
    expansion and through acquisition.  The Company produces and distributes
    24-hour  continuous  play  formats,   regularly  scheduled  and  special
    syndicated  programs,  including  exclusive  live  concerts,  music  and
    interview shows,  national music  countdowns, lifestyle  short features,
    news broadcasts, talk programs, sporting events, and sports features. 

    The  Company  controls  most  aspects  of  production  of its  programs,
    therefore being  able to tailor its  programs to respond to  current and

                                         4<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    changing  listening   preferences.    The  Company   produces  regularly
    scheduled short-form  programs (typically 5 minutes  or less), long-form
    programs  (typically 60 minutes  or longer) and  24-hour continuous play
    formats.    Typically,  the  short-form  programs  are  produced  at the
    Company's in-house  facilities located  in Culver City,  California, New
    York,  New York and Arlington, Virginia.  The long-form programs include
    shows produced entirely at  the Company's in-house production facilities
    and  recordings of live concert  performances and sports  events made on
    location.    The 24-hour  continuous play  formats  are produced  at the
    Company's facilities in Valencia, California.

    Westwood  One also  produces  and distributes  special event  syndicated
    programs.  In 1994 the Company produced and distributed numerous special
    event  programs, including  exclusive broadcasts  of the  Rolling Stones
    Voodoo  Lounge concert  tour, Sting  Live, an  HBO simulcast  of Barbara
    Streisand  and  an MTV  simulcast of  "The  Eagles: Hell  Freezes Over."
    Westwood  One   believes  these  broadcasts  have   contributed  to  its
    reputation and are an integral part of its business strategy to increase
    its share of the national radio network advertising market.

    Westwood  One obtains most of the programming  for its concert series by
    recording live concert performances of prominent recording artists.  The
    agreements  with  these artists  often  provide the  exclusive  right to
    broadcast  the concerts worldwide over  the radio (whether  live or pre-
    recorded) for  a specific period of  time.  The Company  may also obtain
    interviews with the  recording artist and retain a copy of the recording
    of the concert and  the interview for use  in its radio programs  and as
    additions to its  extensive tape  library.  The  agreements provide  the
    artist with master recordings of their  concerts and nationwide exposure
    on affiliated radio stations.  In certain cases the artists may  receive
    compensation.

    Westwood  One's  syndicated  programs   are  produced  at  its  in-house
    production  facilities.  The Company determines the content and style of
    a program based on the target audience it wishes  to reach.  The Company
    assigns a  producer, writer,  narrator or  host,  interviewer and  other
    personnel  to record  and produce  the programs.   Because  Westwood One
    controls  the production process, it can refine the programs' content to
    respond  to   the  needs  of   its  affiliated  stations   and  national
    advertisers.   In  addition, the  Company can  alter program  content in
    response to current and anticipated audience demand.     

    The  Company  produces and  distributes  eight  24-hour continuous  play
    formats providing  music, news  and  talk programming  for Country,  Hot
    Country,  Adult Contemporary, Format 41, Oldies, AM only, Adult Rock and
    Roll and the 70's formats.  Using its production facilities in Valencia,
    California,  the  Company  provides  all the  programming  for  stations



                                         5<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    affiliated with  each  of  these  formats.   Affiliates  compensate  the
    Company for  these formats by  providing the  Company with a  portion of
    their commercial air time and, in most cases, cash fees.

    The  Company believes  that its  tape  library is  a valuable  asset and
    significantly enhances  its future  programming  and revenue  generating
    capabilities.  The library  contains previously broadcast programs, live
    concert  performances,  interviews,  daily  news  programs,  sports  and
    entertainment features, Capitol Hill  hearings and other special events.
    New programs  can be created and  developed at a low  cost by excerpting
    material from the library.  

  
         Affiliated Radio Stations

    Westwood One's radio network business strategy addresses the programming
    needs and financial limitations  of radio stations.  The  Company offers
    radio stations a wide selection of regularly scheduled and special event
    syndicated  programming  as well  as  24-hour  continuous play  formats.
    These programs and formats  are completely produced by the  Company and,
    therefore,  the  stations have  no  production costs.    Typically, each
    program  is  offered for  broadcast by  the  Company exclusively  to one
    station in its geographic market, which assists the station in competing
    for audience  share in its local  marketplace.  In  addition, except for
    news  programming, Westwood One's  programs contain available commercial
    air time  that the stations may sell to local advertisers.  Westwood One
    typically  distributes promotional  announcements  to the  stations  and
    places  advertisements in  trade  and consumer  publications to  further
    promote the upcoming broadcast of its programs.

    Westwood  One's networks  enter into  affiliation agreements  with radio
    stations.    In the  case of  news and  current events  programming, the
    agreements  commit  the station  to  broadcast  only the  advertisements
    associated with  these programs and  allows the  station flexibility  to
    have the news  headlined by  their newscasters.   The other  affiliation
    agreements  require a station to broadcast the Company's programs and to
    use  a portion  of  the  program's  commercial  slots  to  air  national
    advertisements and any related  promotional spots.  With respect  to the
    24-hour formats, the  Company, in most  cases, also receives a  fee from
    the affiliated stations for  the right to broadcast the  formats.  Radio
    stations in the top  200 national markets may also  receive compensation
    for airing national advertising  associated with the Company's  news and
    current events programming.

    Affiliation  agreements specify the number  of times and the approximate
    time of day each program  and advertisement may be broadcast.   Westwood
    One  requires  that each  station complete  and  promptly return  to the
    Company an  affidavit (proof-of-performance)  that verifies the  time of
    each broadcast.  Affiliation agreements for Westwood One's entertainment
    programming  are  non-cancelable  for  26 weeks  and  are  automatically

                                    6<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    renewed for subsequent 26-week periods, if not canceled 30 days prior to
    the  end  of the  existing contract  term.   Affiliation  agreements for
    Westwood One's news and  current events programming generally run  for a
    period  of at least one year, are automatically renewable for subsequent
    periods and are cancelable by either  the Company or the station upon 90
    days' notice.

    The Company has a number of people responsible for station relations and
    marketing  its programs  to  radio stations.  Station relationships  are
    managed geographically to allow the marketing staff to concentrate on 
    specific  geographical regions.   This  enables the  Company's staff  to
    develop  and  maintain  close,  professional  relationships  with  radio
    station personnel and to provide them with quick programming assistance.
   
         National Advertisers

    Westwood One provides national advertisers  with a cost-effective way to
    communicate  their commercial  messages  to  large  listening  audiences
    nationwide   that  have  specific   demographic  characteristics.     An
    advertiser  can obtain both frequency (number of exposures to the target
    audience)  and   reach  (size  of  listening   audience)  by  purchasing
    advertising  time  in the  Company`s programs.    By purchasing  time in
    programs  directed to different  formats, advertisers can  be assured of
    obtaining  high market  penetration and  visibility as  their commercial
    messages will be broadcast on several stations in the same market at the
    same  time.  The Company supports its national sponsors with promotional
    announcements  and advertisements  in trade  and consumer  publications.
    This support promotes the upcoming broadcasts of Company programs and is
    designed to increase the advertisers' target listening audience.

    The Company sells its commercial time to advertisers either as "bulk" or
    "flighted"  purchases.  Bulk purchases are long-term contracts (26 to 52
    weeks)  that  are  sold  "up-front" (early  advertiser  commitments  for
    national  broadcast  time).   Flighted  purchases  are  contracts  for a
    specific, short-term  period of time (one to six weeks) that are sold at
    or above prevailing market prices.  The Company's strategy for growth in
    advertising revenue is to  increase the amount of advertising  time sold
    on  the usually more profitable  flighted basis, to  increase revenue of
    the  non-RADAR rated programs, and  to increase audience  size for news,
    talk and current events programming.

    Competition

    The  Company operates in a  very competitive environment.   In marketing
    its programs to national advertisers, the Company directly competes with
    other  radio  networks  as  well  as  with  smaller   independent  radio
    syndication  producers  and distributors.    In  addition, Westwood  One
    competes  for   advertising  revenue  with  network   television,  cable
    television,  print and other forms of communications media.  The Company
    believes that the high  quality of its  programming and the strength  of

                                       7<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    its  station relations and advertising sales forces enable it to compete
    effectively  with other  forms  of communication  media.   Westwood  One
    markets its  programs  to radio stations, including affiliates  of other
    radio  networks, that  it  believes  will  have  the  largest  and  most
    desirable  listening audience  for each  of its  programs.   The Company
    often has  different programs airing on a number of stations in the same
    geographic  market  at the  same time.    The Company  believes  that in
    comparison  with any  other independent  radio syndication  producer and
    distributor  or radio  network  it has  a  larger and  more  diversified
    selection  of  programming from  which  national  advertisers and  radio
    stations  may  choose.   In  addition,  the  Company  both produces  and
    distributes programs, thereby enabling it to respond more effectively to
    the demands of advertisers and radio stations.


    The  increase in  the  number of  program formats  has led  to increased
    competition  among  local radio  stations  for  audience.   As  stations
    attempt  to differentiate  themselves  in  an  increasingly  competitive
    environment, their demand for quality programming available from outside
    programming sources increases.  This demand has been intensified by high
    operating and  production costs  at local  radio stations and  increased
    competition for local advertising revenue.


         Government Regulation

    Radio  broadcasting  and station  ownership  are regulated  by  the FCC.
    Westwood One, as a  producer and distributor  of radio programs, is  not
    subject to regulation by the FCC.

    Employees

    On  February  15,  1995,  Westwood  One  had  414  full-time  employees,
    including a domestic advertising sales force of 46 people.  In addition,
    the  Company maintains  continuing  relationships with  approximately 50
    independent writers,  program hosts, technical personnel  and producers.
    Certain employees at the Mutual Broadcasting System, NBC Radio Networks,
    and  Unistar  Radio  Networks   are  covered  by  collective  bargaining
    agreements.    The Company  believes  relations with  its  employees and
    independent contractors are good.

    Item 2. Properties

    The Company owns a 7,600 square-foot building in Culver City, California
    in which its  production facilities  are located;  a 14,000  square-foot
    building and  an adjacent 10,000  square-foot building  in Culver  City,
    California  which contains administrative,  sales and marketing offices,
    and storage space; and a 7,700 square-foot unoccupied building in Culver
    City.   In addition, the  Company leases offices  in New  York; Chicago;
    Detroit; Dallas; Arlington, Virginia and Valencia, California.

    Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Stock and Related Shareholder
               Matters

    On March 1, 1995 there were approximately 370 holders of record of the 
    Company's Common Stock, several of which represent "street accounts" of 
    securities brokers.  Based upon the number of proxies requested by brokers 
    in conjunction with its shareholders' meeting on August 18, 1994, the 
    Company estimates that the total number of beneficial holders of the 
    Company's Common Stock exceeds 4,500.  

    The Company's Common Stock has been traded in the over-the-counter market
    under the NASDAQ symbol WONE since the Company's initial public offering on
    April 24, 1984.  The following table sets forth the range of high and low 
    last sales prices on the NASDAQ/National Market System, as reported by 
    NASDAQ, for the Common Stock for the calendar quarters indicated.

    Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
         Condition and Results of Operations
               (In thousands except for share and per share amounts)

    In August 1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end from November 30 to 
    December 31 effective with the fiscal year ending December 31, 1994.  
    Accordingly, in the following discussion "1994" will refer to the calendar
    year 1994, "1993" will refer to the fiscal year ended November 30, 1993 and
    "1992" will refer to the fiscal year ended November 30, 1992.

    On February 3, 1994 the Company completed the acquisition of all of the 
    issued and outstanding capital stock of the Unistar Radio Networks, Inc.
    ("Unistar").  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and 
    accordingly, the operating results of Unistar are included with those of the
    Company from the date of acquisition.

    Effective December 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    capitalized station affiliation agreements and income taxes.  In order to 
    conform to predominate current industry practice, capitalized station 
    affiliation agreements will be expensed as incurred.  The cumulative effect 
    of the change in accounting for station affiliation expenses in December 
    1993 was an expense of $4,344, or $.23 per share.  SFAS No. 109 "Accounting 
    for Income Taxes" was adopted by the Company in December 1993.  The Company
    elected not to restate prior year's financial statements.  Adopting SFAS No.
    109 did not affect the December 1993 or current period results.

    In 1993, the Company classified the results of operations from Radio & 
    Records and its Los Angeles and New York radio stations as discontinued 
    operations.  The Company disposed of these assets during 1993.

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Westwood One derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale of 
    advertising time to advertisers.  Net revenues increased 62% to $136,340 in
    1994 from $84,014 in 1993 and decreased 3% in 1993 from $86,376 in 1992. The
    increase in 1994 net revenues was primarily a result of the purchase of 
    Unistar in February 1994.  The decrease in 1993 net revenues was attributed 
    to the non-recurrence of the Company's exclusive radio coverage of the 1992 
    Summer Olympics, partially offset by net revenue growth associated with an 
    overall increase in the network radio marketplace.

    Operating costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization 
    increased 61% to $105,389 in 1994 from $65,353 in 1993 and decreased 15% in 
    1993 from $77,335 in 1992.  The 1994 increase was primarily attributable to 
    the purchase of Unistar and higher programming expenses resulting from the 
    production of additional programs.  The 1993 decrease was primarily due to 
    cost reduction programs associated with affiliate compensation, programming,
    news and related staff expenses, and the non-recurrence of the 1992 Summer 
    Olympics.


                                        12<PAGE>





      <PAGE>

    Depreciation and amortization increased 11% to $18,160 in 1994 from $16,384
    in 1993 and decreased 17% in 1993 from $19,661 in 1992.  The increase in 
    1994 was primarily a result of the purchase of Unistar, partially offset by
    lower amortization of production costs and lower amortization as a result of
    the Company's December 1, 1993 change in its method of accounting for 
    capitalized station affiliation agreements.  The reduction in 1993 was 
    primarily due to lower amortization of production costs and lower write-
    offs resulting from fewer terminated station affiliation agreements.


    Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 1% to $4,404 in 1994
    from $4,468 in 1993 and decreased 26% in 1993 from $6,017 in 1992.  The 
    nominal decrease in 1994 is a result of across-the-board expense cuts, 
    partially offset by fees attributable to the Infinity Management Agreement.
    The decrease in 1993 was attributable to across-the-board expense cuts and 
    the non-recurrence of a 1992 one-time charge for a vested benefit related 
    to an executive officer's employment contract.

    As a result of the purchase of Unistar, the Company accrued restructuring
    costs of $2,405 in the first quarter of 1994 principally relating to the
    consolidation of certain facilities and operations.  Approximately $2,100
    of these costs were paid in 1994, with the balance scheduled to be paid in
    1995.  

    Severance and termination expenses of $2,063 in 1992 were principally due to
    management changes implemented to achieve future efficiencies.

    Operating income increased $8,173 to $5,982 in 1994 from an operating loss 
    of $2,191 in 1993 and the 1993 operating loss decreased 88% from $18,700 in
    1992. The significant improvement in 1994 is attributable to the acquisition
    of Unistar and cost savings resulting from operating synergies from the 
    Unistar acquisition, partially offset by higher depreciation and 
    amortization expense as a result of the Unistar acquisition.  The 1993 
    improvement was primarily due to extensive cost reduction programs and the 
    non-recurrence of prior year severance and termination expenses, partially 
    offset by the non-recurrence of profit from the 1992 Summer Olympics.

    Interest expense was $8,802, $6,551 and $5,562 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, 
    respectively.  The 1994 increase is principally attributable to higher debt
    levels as a result of the acquisition of Unistar, partially offset by the 
    elimination of interest expense on the Company's 9% Senior Debentures due to
    their conversion to Common Stock.

    Other income is principally comprised of investment income.  The other 
    expense of $301 in 1992 was due principally to a provision to write-down a 
    parcel of real estate that was held for sale to its net realizable value, 
    partially offset by investment income.

    Equity in net loss of an unconsolidated subsidiary represents the Company's 
    share of the operating performance of WNEW-AM, which was sold in August 
    1992.

      <PAGE>

   Loss on the sale of an unconsolidated subsidiary of $6,536 in 1992 represents
   the provision for the sale of WNEW-AM, which closed on December 15, 1992.

   Loss from continuing operations decreased 69% to $2,730 ($.09 per share) from
   $8,682 ($.57 per share) in 1993 and 59% in 1993 from $21,397 ($1.44 per 
   share) in 1992.

   Loss on discontinued operations, net of income tax benefit, was $3,140 in 
   1993 and $2,721 in 1992. The 1993 loss represents the operating performance 
   of discontinued operations through March 1, 1993.  

   The $12,087 provision for loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
   included estimated future costs and operating results of the discontinued 
   assets from March 1, 1993 until the date of disposition.


   In connection with the refinancing of its senior debt facility, the Company 
   recorded an extraordinary loss of $590 ($.02 per share).

   The net loss decreased 86% to $3,320 ($.11 per share) in 1994 from $23,909 
   ($1.58 per share) in 1993 and 1% in 1993 from $24,118 ($1.62 per share) in 
   1992.

   Weighted average shares outstanding increased 94% to 29,414 in 1994 from 
   15,153 in 1993 and 2% in 1993 from 14,906 in 1992.  The 1994 increase in 
   weighted average shares is primarily attributable to the conversion of its 9%
   Senior Debentures into approximately 8,864 shares of Common Stock and the 
   sale of 5,000 shares of Common Stock to a subsidiary of Infinity.

      Liquidity and Capital Resources

   At December 31, 1994, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were $2,439, a 
   decrease of $1,429 from November 30, 1993.  In addition, the Company had 
   available borrowings under its Loans of $15,000.

   For 1994, net cash from operating activities was $2,445, an increase of 
   $4,739 from 1993.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher cash 
   flow from operations and an increase in accounts payable due to the Unistar 
   acquisition, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting
   principally from the Unistar acquisition.  Net cash used by investing 
   activities was $111,731 principally due to the purchase of Unistar.  
   Consequently, cash used before financing activities was $109,286.

   In the first quarter of 1994, the Company entered into a new senior loan 
   agreement with a syndicate of banks which was comprised of a $15,000 
   revolving facility and $110,000 in term loans which mature on November 30, 
   2001.  In addition, the Company sold 5,000 shares of Common Stock and a 
   warrant to purchase up to an additional 3,000 shares of Common Stock at an 
   exercise price of $3.00 per share (subject to certain vesting conditions) to
   a subsidiary of Infinity for $15,000.  Proceeds from the loans and Common

    Stock sale were used to finance the acquisition of Unistar ($101,300), repay
    borrowings outstanding under its previous senior debt agreement ($8,841) and
    for working capital.  In addition, from December 1993 through March 1994, 
    holders of approximately $31,058 of the Company's 9% Senior Debentures 
    converted their debentures to approximately 8,864 shares of Common Stock.  
    In August 1994, the Company prepaid $5,000 on its term loans which mature on
    November 30, 2001.  At December 31, 1994, the outstanding balance of the 
    Company's term loans were $105,000.  In January 1995, the Company prepaid an
    additional $2,500 on its term loans.  As a result, the Company's next 
    scheduled principal repayment of $2,500 is due in November 1995.

    Management believes that the Company's cash, available borrowings and 
    anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance current 
    and forecasted operations over the next 12 months.

                REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


    To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
    of Westwood One, Inc.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index to
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules on page
    F-1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
    Westwood One, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994, November 30, 
    1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
    the year ended December 31, 1994, the one month ended December 31, 1993 and 
    for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended November 30, 1993, in 
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial 
    statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our 
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
    on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance 
    with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and 
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, 
    on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and 
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
    financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
    reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

    As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, effective 
    December 1, 1993 the Company changed its accounting policy for capitalized 
    station affiliation agreements and adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".

                    (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)

NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned 
subsidiaries.  

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when commercial advertisements are broadcast.

Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity 
of less than three months to be cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of cash 
equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these 
instruments.

Depreciation
Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets.

Programming Costs and Rights
The Company defers a portion of its costs for recorded library material and 
produced radio entertainment programs with a life of longer than a year.  
Recorded library material includes previously broadcast programs, live 
concert performances, interviews, news and special events.  Programming costs 
and rights ("Production costs") are amortized using the straight line method 
over the period of expected benefit, not to exceed five years.  The current 
portion of deferred production costs represents the portion to be amortized 
over the next twelve months.
        
Measurement of Intangible Asset Impairment
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of Intangible Assets.  
The Company considers the ability to generate positive broadcast cash flow 
(based on the consolidated statement of operations, calculated by subtracting 
from net revenue, operating costs and expenses excluding depreciation and 
amortization) as the key factor in determining whether the assets have been 
impaired.  To date, the Company has not experienced an impairment in any of 
its intangible assets.

Income Taxes
Effective December 1, 1993, the Company implemented Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes" which 
requires the use of the asset and liability method of financial accounting 
and reporting for income taxes.  Under FAS 109, deferred income taxes reflect 
the tax impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and 
liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
recognized for tax purposes.

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common 
shares and common equivalent shares (where inclusion of such equivalent shares 
would not be anti-dilutive) outstanding during the year.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Reclassification
Financial statements for all prior periods have been reclassified to conform
to the 1994 presentation.  

NOTE 2 - Accounting Change:

Effective December 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for 
capitalized station affiliation agreements to expense these costs as incurred.  
The Company believes this method is preferable and conforms to the 
predominant current industry practice, including Unistar.  Accordingly, the 
Company recognized the cumulative effect of the change as of December 1, 1993.  
The non-cash charge to earnings was an expense of $4,344, or $.23 per share 
and has been reflected in the financial statements for the month of December 
1993.

NOTE 3 - Change in Fiscal Year:

In the third quarter of 1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end from 
November 30 to December 31 effective with the fiscal year ending December 31, 
1994.  The accompanying financial statements include audited statements of 
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the one month transition 
period ended December 31, 1993.

NOTE 4 - Acquisition of Unistar Radio Networks, Inc.:

On February 3, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the 
issued and outstanding capital stock of Unistar Radio Networks, Inc. 
("Unistar").  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.  Accordingly, 
the operating results of Unistar are included with those of the Company from 
the date of acquisition.  Based on management's estimates, the purchase price 
has been allocated to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.  The 
excess of cost over net assets of acquired company resulting from the 
transaction is being amortized over 40 years.

The pro forma unaudited combined condensed results of operations of the 
Company and Unistar for the years ended December 31, 1994 and November 30, 
1993 (presented as though the combination had occurred on December 1, 1992 
after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments) are as follows:

            (Loss) Per Share from Continuing Operations         ( $.03)         (  $.15) 
</TABLE>


The foregoing pro forma results of operations principally reflect adjusting 
historical interest expense, depreciation and amortization, the sale of 5,000 
newly issued shares of common stock to a subsidiary of Infinity and 
restructuring costs based on the transaction being completed at the beginning 
of the periods presented.  No adjustments were made to historical results for 
potential cost reductions due to the elimination of duplicate facilities and 
costs resulting from the acquisition of Unistar.  However, 1994 pro forma 
results reflect the benefit of cost reductions to the extent that they have 
been realized.

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the 
fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition.

Station affiliation agreements are comprised of values assigned to agreements 
acquired as part of the purchase of radio networks and are amortized using an 
accelerated method over 40 years.  Intangible assets, except for acquired 
station affiliation agreements, are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
40 years.

The Company's senior loan agreement with a syndicate of banks provides for 
$110,000 in term loans ("Term Loans") and a $15,000 revolving facility 
("Revolver") which mature on November 30, 2001 (referred to collectively as 
"The Loans").  Interest is payable at the prime rate plus an applicable 
margin of up to 1.5% or LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 2.5%, at 
the Company's option.  Based on the Company's Total Debt Ratio, the applicable 
margins may be reduced to as low as .5% for prime rate loans and 1.5% for 
LIBOR loans.  At December 31, 1994, the applicable margins were 1.0% and 2.0%, 
respectively.  Principal on the Term Loans is payable quarterly starting 
February 28, 1995, however in 1994, the Company prepaid the quarterly 
installments due on February 28, 1995 and May 31, 1995 resulting in a 
December 31, 1994 balance of $105,000.  The Loans are secured by substantially 
all the Company's assets and contain covenants relating to dividends, liens,
indebtedness, capital expenditures and interest coverage and leverage ratios.  
As a matter of policy, the Company does not engage in derivative trading, 
however as part of The Loans, the Company is required to enter into interest 
rate protection agreements.  Accordingly, the Company has entered into two 
interest rate protection agreements under which the Company's interest rate 
on $50,000 of borrowings under The Loans will not exceed 8% (based on the 
current margin).  The agreements are effective from July and August 1995 thru 
July and August 1996, with each covering $25,000 of borrowings.  At 
December 31, 1994, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under 
the Revolver.

The 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures ("Debentures") are unsecured 
and subordinated in right of payment to senior indebtedness.  Interest on the 
Debentures is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15.  The Debentures 
are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, 
into shares of common stock of the Company at the conversion price of $24.58 
per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

During 1994, the Company repaid the Term Notes which were outstanding at the 
beginning of the year ($7,000).  In addition, the 9% Convertible Senior 
Subordinated Debentures, which were outstanding on November 30, 1993, were 
converted into approximately 8,864,000 shares of common stock.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the next five fiscal years and 
thereafter, pursuant to  the Company's debt agreements as in effect at 
December 31, 1994, are as follows:

With the exception of the Company's Debentures, the fair value of short and 
long-term debt approximates its carrying value.  The fair value of the 
Debentures at December 31, 1994 was approximately $10,350, based on its quoted 
market price.

NOTE 8 - Shareholders' Equity:

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of Common stock, Class B 
stock and Preferred stock.  Common stock is entitled to one vote per share

3 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share 
(subject to certain vesting conditions) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Infinity Broadcasting Corporation for $15,000.

In December 1992, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 
41,500 shares of common stock to an officer of the Company for services 
performed in fiscal 1992.

As part of a Management Agreement between the Company and Infinity Broadcasting
Corporation ("Infinity"), a subsidiary of Infinity was given warrants to acquire
up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging between $3.00 and $5.00
per share, subject to adjustment, which are exercisable after the Company's 
common stock reaches certain market prices per share.  At December 31, 1994, 
500,000 warrants were exercisable at $3.00 per share.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On December 1, 1986, the Chairman of the Board was granted options not covered 
by the Plans to acquire 525,000 shares of common stock, which vested ratably 
over a seven-year term or immediately upon a change in control of the Company.  
The options became exercisable at the fair market value of the common stock, 
as defined, on the date of vesting.  At December 31, 1994, all the options 
granted are exercisable at exercise prices ranging from $1.67 to $16.31 per 
share.

NOTE 10 - Income Taxes:

Effective December 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for 
income taxes as required by FAS109.  As permitted under the new rules, prior 
year financial statements have not been restated, and adoption of FAS109 did 
not affect reported earnings.

The Company has approximately $90,000 of available U.S. net operating loss 
carryforwards for tax purposes.  Utilization of the carryforwards is dependent 
upon future taxable income and they begin to expire in 2002.  As a result of 
the Company's prior and pending debt and equity transactions, some of the 
Federal net operating losses may be subject to certain limitations.  For 
financial purposes, a valuation allowance of $27,781 has been recorded to 
offset the deferred tax assets related to those carryforwards.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the Company's 
balance sheet and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Significant 
components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 
1994 follow:

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


NOTE 15 - Discontinued Operations:  

At the end of the Company's first fiscal quarter of 1993, the Company 
classified the results of operations from Radio & Records and its Los Angeles 
(KQLZ-FM) and New York (WYNY-FM) radio stations as discontinued operations.  
These three businesses collateralized the Company's 16% Debentures and 
Revolving Credit Facility with Westinghouse Electric Corporation ("WEC"). In 
June  1993 the Company completed the sales of its Los Angeles and New York 
radio stations, and used the net proceeds from the sales to retire the 
Company's 16% Debentures and reduce the outstanding balance of its Revolving
Credit Facility.  On November 1, 1993, WEC acquired the outstanding stock of 
Radio & Records and the net assets of Westwood One Stations Group for the 
outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, accrued interest and 
any other potential claims.  Accordingly, the historical net loss of the 
Company's owned-and-operated radio stations and Radio & Records have been 
reported separately from continuing operations, and the prior periods have 
been restated (including an allocation of interest of $7,043 and $12,273 for 
fiscal 1993 and 1992 respectively).  

The Company made a provision for the loss on the disposition of these assets 
including estimated future costs and operating results from March 1, 1993 
until the date of disposition, of $12,087.  Revenue from discontinued 
operations for fiscal 1993 and 1992 were $22,282 and $36,443, respectively.

Notes:  Short-term borrowings during the years covered by this schedule consist 
of loans made under various established credit lines.  The average amount 
outstanding during each period was computed by dividing the average outstanding 
principal balance by 365 days.  The weighted average interest rate during each 
period was computed by dividing the actual interest expense on such borrowings 
by the average amount outstanding during that period.

     meeting of stockholders shall be held at such location as may be
     determined by the Board of Directors or, if no such determination

     for which the meeting is called may, in the case of an annual
     meeting, and shall, in the case of a special meeting, also be
     stated.  If mailed, such notice shall be directed to a stockholder
     at his address as it shall appear on the stock books of the
     Corporation, unless he shall have filed with the Secretary of the
     Corporation a written request that notices intended for him be
     mailed to some other address, in which case such notice shall be
     mailed to the address designated in such request.  When a meeting
     is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of
     the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced
     at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the
     adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which
     might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the
     adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the
     adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
     a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
     stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

          Section 2.05. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS.  All annual and special
     meetings of stockholders shall be conducted in accordance with
     such rules and procedures as the Board of Directors may determine
     subject to the requirements of applicable law, and as to matters
     not governed by such rules and procedures, as the chairman of such
     meetings shall determine.  The chairman of any annual or special
     meetings of stockholders shall be the Chairman of the Board.  The
     Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary, a person designated
     by the Chairman of the Board, shall act as secretary of the
     meeting.

          Section 2.06.  QUORUM.  At any meeting of stockholders, the
     presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of
     shares then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote
     representing a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at the
     meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business;
     provided, however, that this Section 2.06 shall not affect any
     different requirement which may exist under statute, pursuant to

                                      2
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     the rights of any authorized class or series of stock, or under
     the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the
     "Certificate") for the vote necessary for the adoption of any
     measure governed thereby.  In the absence of a quorum, the
     stockholders present in person or by proxy, by majority vote and
     without further notice, may adjourn the meeting from time to time
     until a quorum is attained.  At any reconvened meeting following
     such an adjournment at which a quorum shall be present, any
     business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
     meeting as originally notified.

          Section 2.07.  VOTES REQUIRED.  A majority of the votes cast
     at a duly called meeting of stockholders, at which a quorum is
     present, shall be sufficient to take or authorize action upon any
     matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless the vote
     of greater or different number thereof is required by statue, by
     the rights of any authorized class of stock or by the Certificate. 
     Unless the Certificate or the resolution of the Board of Directors
     adopted in connection with the issuance of shares of any class or
     series of stock provides for a greater or lesser number of votes
     per share, or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding
     share of stock, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote
     on each matter submitted to a vote of meeting of stockholders.

          Section 2.08.  CUMULATIVE VOTING.  Except as otherwise
     provided by applicable law, there shall be no cumulative voting
     permitted in the election of Directors, or any other matter
     brought before the stockholders.

          Section 2.09.  PROXIES.  A stockholder may vote the shares
     owned of record by him either in person or by proxy executed in
     writing (which shall include writings sent by telex, telegraph,
     cable or facsimile transmission) by the stockholder himself or by
     his duly authorized attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be valid
     after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for
     a longer period.  Each proxy shall be in writing, subscribed by
     the stockholder or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, and
     dated, but it need not be sealed, witnessed or acknowledged.


          Section 2.10.  STOCKHOLDER ACTION.  Any action required or
     permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must
     be effected at a duly called annual meeting or special meeting of
     stockholders of the Corporation, unless such action requiring or
     permitting stockholder approval is approved by a majority of the
     Continuing Directors (as defined in the Certificate), in which
     case such action may be authorized or taken by the holders of
     outstanding shares of stock having not less than the minimum
     voting power that would be necessary to authorize or take such
     action at a meeting of stockholders at which all shares entitled

                                      3
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     to vote thereon were present and voted, provided all other
     requirements of applicable law and the Certificate have been
     satisfied.

          Section 2.11.  LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  The Secretary of the
     Corporation shall prepare and make (or cause to be prepared and
     made), at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
     stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
     at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the
     address of, and the number of shares registered in the name of,
     each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of
     any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during
     ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days
     prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the
     meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the
     notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where
     the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced and
     kept at the time and place of the meeting during the duration
     thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

          Section 2.12.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  In advance of any
     meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may appoint
     Inspectors of Election to act at such meeting or at any
     adjournment or adjournments thereof.  If such Inspectors are not
     so appointed or fail or refuse to act, the chairman of any such
     meeting may (and, upon the demand of any stockholder or
     stockholder's proxy, shall) make such an appointment.

          The number of Inspectors of Election shall be one (1) or
     three (3) as directed by the Chairman of the Board from time to
     time.  If there are three (3) Inspectors of Election, the
     decision, act or certificate of a majority shall be effective and
     shall represent the decision, act or certificate of all.  No such
     Inspector need be a stockholder of the Corporation.


          The Inspectors of Election shall determine the number of
     shares outstanding, the voting power of each, the shares
     represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the
     authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; they shall receive
     votes, ballots, or consents, hear and determine all challenges and
     questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote,
     count and tabulate all votes or consents, determine when the polls
     shall close and determine the result; and finally, they shall do
     such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with
     fairness to all stockholders.  On request, the Inspectors shall
     make a report in writing to the secretary of the meeting
     concerning any challenge, question or other matter as may have
     been determined by them and shall execute and deliver to such
     secretary a certificate of any fact found by them.

                                 DIRECTORS

          Section 3.01.  POWERS.  The business and affairs of the
     Corporation shall be managed by and be under the direction of the
     Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall exercise all the
     power of the Corporation, except those that are conferred upon or
     reserved to the stockholders by statute, the Certificate or these
     Bylaws.

          Section 3.02.  NUMBER.  Except as otherwise fixed pursuant
     to the provisions of Section 4 of Article Fourth of the
     Certificate in connection with rights to elect additional
     directors under specified circumstances which may be granted to
     the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, par value
     One Cent ($0.01) per share of the Corporation ("Preferred Stock"),
     the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by
     resolution of the Board of Directors but shall not be less than
     three (3).  The Board of Directors shall consist of nine (9)
     directors until changed as herein provided.

          Section 3.03.  INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE DIRECTORS.  At least
     thirty three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the members of the
     Board of Directors of the Corporation shall at all times be
     "Independent Outside Directors," which term is hereby defined to
     mean any director who: has not been an officer or employee of the
     Corporation or Infinity Broadcasting Corporation or any of their
     respective subsidiaries, or any other person having a relationship
     which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors or a committee
     thereof, would interfere with the exercise of independent
     judgement in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

          Section 3.04.  ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE.  Except as
     provided in Section 3.07 hereof and subject to the right to elect
     additional directors under specified circumstances which may be
     granted, pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of Article Fourth
     of the Certificate, to the holders of any class or series of
     Preferred Stock, directors shall be elected by the stockholders of
     the Corporation.  The Board of Directors shall be and is divided
     into three classes:  Class I, Class II and Class III.  The number
     of directors in each class shall be the whole number contained in
     the quotient obtained by dividing the authorized number of
     directors (fixed pursuant to Section 3.02 hereof) by three.  If a
     fraction is also contained in such quotient, then additional
     directors shall be apportioned as follows:  if such fraction is
     one-third, the additional director shall be a member of Class I;
     and if such fraction is two-thirds, one of the additional
     directors shall be a member of Class I and the other shall be a
     member of Class II.  Except as otherwise required by applicable
     law, each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of

     <PAGE>

     the third annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
     following the annual meeting at which such director was elected.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
     3.04:  each director shall serve until his successor is elected
     and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal; no
     decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the
     term of any incumbent director; and additional directors, elected
     pursuant to Section 4 of Article Fourth of the Certificate in
     connection with rights to elect such additional directors under
     specified circumstances which may be granted to the holders of any
     class or series of Preferred Stock, shall not be included in any
     class, but shall serve for such term or terms and pursuant to such
     other provisions as are specified in the resolution of the Board
     of Directors establishing such class or series.

          Section 3.05.  ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.  At the
     organizational meeting immediately following the annual meeting of
     stockholders, the directors shall elect a Chairman of the Board
     from among the directors, who shall hold office until the
     corresponding meeting of the Board of Directors in the next year
     and until his successor shall have been elected or until his
     earlier resignation or removal.  Any vacancy in such office may be
     filled for the unexpired portion of the term in the same manner by
     the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting.

          Section 3.06.  REMOVAL.  Subject to the right to elect
     directors under specified circumstances which may be granted
     pursuant to Section 4 of Article Fourth of the Certificate to the
     holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, any director
     may be removed from office only as provided in Article Tenth of
     the Certificate.

          Section 3.07.  VACANCIES AND ADDITIONAL DIRECTORSHIPS. 
     Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 4 of Article
     Fourth of the Certificate in connection with rights to elect
     additional directors under specified circumstances which may be
     granted to the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock,
     newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
     number of directors and any vacancies on the Board of Directors
     resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or
     other cause shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a
     majority of the remaining directors then in office, regardless of
     their class, even though less than a quorum of the Board of
     Directors.  Any director elected in accordance with the preceding
     sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of
     the class of directors in which the new directorship was created
     or the vacancy occurred and until such director's successor shall
     have been elected and qualified or until such director's death,
     resignation or removal, whichever first occurs.  No decrease in

     <PAGE>

     the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall
     shorten the term of any incumbent director.

          Section 3.08.  REGULAR AND SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Regular
     meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held immediately
     following the annual meeting of the stockholders, and at such
     other times as shall be from time to time set by the Board of
     Directors, unless a regular meeting is otherwise called by the
     Chairman of the Board in accordance with applicable law.

          Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held
     upon call by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the
     Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President, or any two
     directors, except that when the Board of Directors consists of one
     director, then the one director may call a special meeting. 
     Except as otherwise required by law, notice of each special
     meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him at his
     residence or usual place of business, at least two days before the
     day on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at
     such place by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile transmission or
     telephoned or delivered to him personally, not later than the day
     before the day on which the meeting is to be held.  Such notice
     shall state the time and place of such meeting, but need not state
     the purpose or purposes thereof, unless otherwise required by law,
     the Certificate or these Bylaws.

          Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who
     shall attend such meeting in person or who shall waive notice
     thereof, before or after such meeting, in a signed writing.

          Section 3.09.  QUORUM.  At all meetings of the Board of
     Directors, a majority of the fixed number of directors shall
     constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except that
     when the Board of Directors consists of one director, then the one
     director shall constitute a quorum.  In the absence of a quorum,
     the directors present, by majority vote and without notice other
     than by announcement, may adjourn the meeting from time to time
     until a quorum shall be present.  At any reconvened meeting
     following such an adjournment at which a quorum shall be present,
     any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at
     the meeting as originally notified.

          Section 3.10.  VOTES REQUIRED.  Except as otherwise provided
     by applicable law or by the Certificate, the vote of a majority of
     the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is
     present shall be sufficient to pass any measure.

          Section 3.11.  PLACE AND CONDUCT OF MEETINGS.  Each regular
     meeting and special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be
     held at a location determined as follows:  The Board of Directors

                                      7
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     may designate any place, within or without the State of Delaware,
     for the holding of any meeting.  If no such designation is made: 
     (i) any meeting called by a majority of the directors shall be
     held at such location, within the county of the Corporation's
     principal executive office, as the directors calling the meeting
     shall designate; and (ii) any other meeting shall be held at such
     location, within the county of the Corporation's principal
     executive office, as the Chairman of the Board may designate or,
     in the absence of such designation, at the Corporation's principal
     executive office.  Subject to the requirements of applicable law,
     all regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors shall
     be conducted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the
     Board of Directors may approve and, as to matters not governed by
     such rules and procedures, as the chairman of such meeting shall
     determine.  The chairman of any regular or special meeting shall
     be the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence a person
     designated by the Board of Directors.  The Secretary, or in the
     absence of the Secretary a person designated by the chairman of
     the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.  Meetings of
     the Board of Directors may be held through use of conference
     telephone or similar communications equipment so long as all
     members participating in such meeting can hear one another at the
     time of such meeting.  Participation in such a meeting constitutes
     presence in person at such meeting.

          Section 3.12.  ACTION BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT.  Any
     action required or permitted to be taken by the Board may be taken
     without a meeting, if all members of the Board shall individually
     or collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written
     consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the
     proceedings of the Board.  Such action by written consent shall
     have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of such
     Directors.

          Section 3.13.  FEES AND COMPENSATION.  Directors shall be
     paid such compensation as may be fixed from time to time by
     resolutions of the Board of Directors (a) for their usual and
     contemplated services as directors, (b) for their services as
     members of committees appointed by the Board of Directors,
     including attendance at committee meetings as well as services
     which may be required when committee members must consult with
     management staff, and (c) for extraordinary services as directors
     or as members of committees appointed by the Board of Directors,
     over and above those services for which compensation is fixed
     pursuant to items (a) and (b) in this Section 3.13.  Compensation
     may be in the form of an annual retainer fee or a fee for
     attendance at meetings, or both, or in such other form or on such
     basis as the resolutions of the Board of Directors shall fix. 
     Directors shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred
     by them in attending meetings of the Board of Directors and

                                      8
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     committees appointed by the Board of Directors and in performing
     compensable extraordinary services.  Nothing contained herein
     shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the
     Corporation in any other capacity, such as an officer, agent,
     employee, consultant or otherwise, and receiving compensation
     therefor.

          Section 3.14.  COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
     Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board of
     Directors may from time to time establish committees, including
     standing or special committees, which shall have such duties and
     powers as are authorized by these Bylaws or by the Board of
     Directors.  Committee members, and the chairman of each committee,
     shall be appointed by the Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the
     Board, in conjunction with the several committee chairmen, shall
     make recommendations to the Board of Directors for its final
     action concerning members to be appointed to the several
     committees of the Board of Directors.  Any member of any committee
     may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Board of
     Directors.  Vacancies which occur on any committee shall be filled
     by a resolution of the Board of Directors.  If any vacancy shall
     occur in any committee by reason of death, resignation,
     disqualification, removal or otherwise, the remaining members of
     such committee, so long as a quorum is present, may continue to
     act until such vacancy is filled by the Board of Directors.  The
     Board of Directors may, by resolution, at any time deemed
     desirable, discontinue any standing or special committee.  Members
     of standing committees, and their chairmen, shall be elected
     yearly at the organizational meeting of the Board of Directors
     which is held immediately following the annual meeting of
     stockholders.

          Section 3.15.  MEETINGS OF COMMITTEES.  Each committee of
     the Board of Directors shall fix its own rules of procedure
     consistent with the provisions of applicable law and of any
     resolutions of the Board of Directors governing such committee. 
     Each committee shall meet as provided by such rules or such
     resolution of the Board of Directors, and shall also meet at the
     call of its chairmen or any two (2) members of such committee. 
     Unless otherwise provided by such rules or by such resolution, the
     provisions of these Bylaws under Article III entitled "Directors"
     relating to the place of holding meetings and the notice required
     for meetings of the Board of Directors shall govern the place of
     meetings and notice of meetings for committees of the Board of
     Directors.  A majority of the members of each committee shall
     constitute a quorum thereof, except that when a committee consists
     of one (1) member, then the one (1) member shall constitute a
     quorum.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the members
     present at the time and place of any meeting may adjourn the
     meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present and the
     meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice or waiver. 
     Except in cases where it is otherwise provided by the rules of
     such committee or by a resolution of the Board of Directors, the
     vote of a majority of the members present at a duly constituted
     meeting at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to pass
     any measure by the committee.

                                 ARTICLE V
             INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
                        AND OTHER CORPORATE AGENTS

          To the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General
     Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
     (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
     such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
     indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
     provide prior to such amendment), the Corporation shall indemnify
     and hold harmless against all expenses, liability and loss
     (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
     ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
     settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by each person who was
     or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any
     threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
     whether or not by or in the right of the Corporation, and whether
     civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise (any
     such action, suit or proceeding being hereinafter in this Article
     referred to as a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such
     person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
     Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
     as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
     partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
     service with respect to employee benefit plans, or was a director,

                                      12

     <PAGE>

     officer, employee or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation
     which was a predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of
     another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation
     (any such person being hereafter in this Article referred to as an
     "indemnifiable party").  The right to indemnification conferred by
     this Article shall be a contract right.  Where required by law,
     the indemnification provided for in this Article shall be made
     only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination, in
     the manner provided by law, that the indemnification of the
     indemnifiable party is proper in the circumstances.  The
     Corporation shall advance to indemnifiable parties expenses
     incurred in defending any proceeding prior to the final
     disposition thereof subject to the receipt of such undertakings
     from such indemnifiable party as shall be required by the
     applicable law.  This Article shall create a right of
     indemnification for each such indemnifiable party whether or not
     the proceeding to which the indemnification relates arose in whole
     or in part prior to adoption of this Article (or the adoption of
     the comparable provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation's
     predecessor corporation) and, in the event of the death of an
     indemnifiable party, such right shall extend to such indemnifiable
     party's heirs and legal representatives.


          If a claim under this Article is not paid in full by the
     Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been
     received by the Corporation, the indemnifiable party may at any
     time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
     unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part,
     the indemnifiable party shall be entitled to be paid also the
     expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any
     such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
     expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
     final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
     required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the
     indemnifiable party has not met the standards of conduct which
     make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for
     the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
     but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
     Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
     its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
     stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
     commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
     is proper in the circumstances because he or she met the
     applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General
     Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
     (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
     its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
     standard or conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
     presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard

                                      13

     <PAGE>

     of conduct.

          The right of indemnification hereby given shall not be
     exclusive of any right such indemnifiable party may have, whether
     by law or under any agreement, insurance policy, vote of the Board
     of Directors or stockholders, or otherwise.

          The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
     insurance on behalf of any indemnifiable party against any
     liability asserted against or incurred by the indemnifiable party
     in such capacity or arising out of the indemnifiable party's
     status as such whether or not the Corporation would have the power
     to indemnify the indemnifiable party against such liability.

                                ARTICLE VI
                                   STOCK

          Section 6.01.  CERTIFICATES.  Except as otherwise provided
     by law, each stockholder shall be entitled to a certificate or
     certificates which shall represent and certify the number and
     class (and series, if appropriate) of shares of stock owned by him
     in the Corporation.  Each certificate shall be signed in the name
     of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief
     Executive Officer or a Vice President together with the Secretary,
     or an Assistant Secretary, or the Chief Financial Officer.  Any or
     all of the signatures on any certificate may be facsimile.  In
     case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or
     whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall
     have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before
     such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation
     with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer
     agent or registrar at the date of issue.

          Section 6.02.  TRANSFER OF SHARES.  Shares of stock shall be
     transferable on the books of the Corporation only by the holder
     thereof, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon the
     surrender of the certificate representing the shares to be
     transferred, properly endorsed, to the Corporation's registrar if
     the Corporation has a registrar.  The Board of Directors shall
     have power and authority to make such other rules and regulations
     concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates of
     the Corporation's stock as it may deem expedient.

          Section 6.03.  TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS.  The
     Corporation may have one or more transfer agents and one or more
     registrars of its stock whose respective duties the Board of
     Directors or the Secretary may, from time to time, define.  No
     certificate of stock shall be valid until countersigned by a
     transfer agent, if the Corporation has a transfer agent, or until
     registered by a registrar, if the Corporation has a registrar. 

                                      14
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     The duties of transfer agent and registrar may be combined.

          Section 6.04.  STOCK LEDGERS.  Original or duplicate stock
     ledgers, containing the names and addresses of the record
     stockholders of the Corporation, and the number of shares of each
     class of stock held by them, shall be kept at the principal
     executive office of the Corporation or at the office of its
     transfer agent or registrar.  The Secretary or his designee shall
     prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
     stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
     at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
     address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in
     the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the
     examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
     meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
     ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city
     where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in
     the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place
     where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall also be produced
     and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole
     time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
     present.

          Section 6.05.  RECORD DATES.  The Board of Directors shall
     fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of
     determining stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any
     meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or
     stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
     distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise
     any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of
     stock, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any
     other proper purpose.  Such date in any case shall be not more
     than sixty (60) days, and in case of a meeting of stockholders,
     not less than ten (10) days, prior to the date on which the
     particular action, requiring such determination of stockholders,
     is to be taken.  Only those stockholders of record on the date so
     fixed shall be entitled to any of the foregoing rights,
     notwithstanding the transfer of any such stock on the books of the
     Corporation after any such record date fixed by the Board of
     Directors.

          Section 6.06.  NEW CERTIFICATES.  In case any certificate of
     stock is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board of
     Directors may authorize the issuance of a new certificate in place
     thereof upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable;
     or the Board of Directors may delegate such power to any officer
     or officers or agents of the Corporation; but the Board of
     Directors or such officer or officers or agents, in their
     discretion, may refuse to issue such a new certificate unless the
     Corporation is ordered to do so by a court of competent

                                      15

     <PAGE>

     jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the Corporation, or its officers or
     agents, may require the owner of a lost, stolen, mutilated or
     destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the
     Corporation a bond (or other security) sufficient to indemnify it
     against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss,
     theft, mutilation or destruction of any such certificate or the
     issuance of new certificates or uncertified shares.


          Section 6.07.  STOCK PURCHASE PLANS; STOCK OPTION PLANS.

          1.   The Corporation may adopt and carry out a stock
     purchase plan or agreement or stock option plan or agreement
     providing for the issue and sale, for such consideration as may be
     fixed, of its unissued shares, or of issued shares acquired or to
     be acquired, to one or more of the employees or directors of the
     Corporation or of a subsidiary or to a trustee on their behalf and
     for the payment for such shares in installments or at one time,
     and may provide for aiding any such persons in paying for such
     shares by compensation for services rendered, promissory notes or
     otherwise.

          2.   A stock purchase plan or agreement or stock option
     plan or agreement may include, among other features, the fixing of
     eligibility for participation therein, the class and price of
     shares to be issued or sold under the plan or agreement, the
     number of shares which may be subscribed for, the method of
     payment therefor, the reservation of title until full payment
     therefor, the effect of the termination of employment, an option
     or obligation on the part of the Corporation to repurchase the
     shares upon termination of employment, subject to applicable law,
     restrictions upon transfer of the shares and the time limits of
     and termination of the plan.

                                ARTICLE VII
                             CORPORATE RECORDS

     adequate and correct books and records of account, shall keep
     minutes of the proceedings of the stockholders, Board of Directors
     and committees of the Board of Directors and shall keep at its
     principal executive office, or at the office of its transfer agent
     or registrar, a record of its stockholders, giving the names and
     addresses of all stockholders and the number and class of shares
     held by each.  Such minutes shall be kept in written form.  Such
     other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in
     any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible
     written form within a reasonable time.

     the purpose thereof, by any stockholder or holder of a voting
     trust certificate at any reasonable time during usual business
     hours, for any proper purpose.  This right of inspection shall
     extend to the records of the subsidiaries, if any, of the

                  THIS  SECOND AMENDMENT is  made effective as  of February 2,
            1994 with reference  to the Employment Agreement dated October 18,
            1993  by and between Westwood One, Inc. (the "Company") and Norman
            J.  Pattiz ("Employee"), as  amended by the  First Amendment dated
            January 26, 1994 (the "Agreement").

                  WHEREAS, Employee  and the  Company desire to  amend certain
            provisions  of the Agreement and except for such amendment to have
            such Agreement remain in full force and effect;

              This Agreement dated as of April 19, 1990 (as from time to time
            amended and in effect, this "Agreement") is among UniStar
            Communications Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("UniStar"),
            UniStar Radio Networks, Inc. ("Networks"; UniStar and Networks are

              The Executive is currently employed by the Networks as
            Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer.  The parties desire
            to provide for the Executive's continued employment by Networks on
            behalf of the Company in those capacities in accordance with the
            provisions of this Agreement.

            hereby accepts such employment and agrees to perform the services
            specified herein, all upon and subject to the terms and conditions
            hereinafter stated.

              2.   Duties.  The Executive shall serve the Company as a

            control of, the Co-Chairmen of the Company and the Board of
            Directors of the Company (the "Board").  The Executive shall have
            such duties, authority and responsibilities as are normally
            associated with his positions and as may be determined from time
            to time by the Co-Chairmen and the Board consistent with his
            position with Networks.  The Executive shall devote his best
            efforts and all of his business time to the performance of his
            duties under this Agreement and shall perform them faithfully,
            diligently and competently.  The Executive shall not engage in
            outside activities if such activities would materially interfere
            with the performance of his duties under this Agreement.

              3.   Salary.  The Company shall pay to the Executive, as
            compensation in full for the Executive's services hereunder,

              8.   Termination.

                   (a)  Death, Disability or Discharge Without Cause.  If the
            Executive dies during the Employment Term, this Agreement shall
            automatically terminate and the Company shall have no further
            obligation to the Executive or his estate except to reimburse the
            Executive for accrued and unpaid base salary, accrued
            out-of-pocket expenses pursuant to Section 6 hereof, and the
            obligation, to the extent required under the Consolidated Omnibus
            Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA"), to provide to the family of
            the Executive a temporary extension of medical insurance coverage
            at group rates, which premium the family member requesting such
            continued coverage shall be obligated to pay in full. If, during
            the Employment Term, the Executive is prevented by reason of
            disability from performing his duties for 180 consecutive calendar
            days, then the Company may, by notice to the Executive subsequent
            thereto, terminate his employment under   this Agreement as of the
            date of the notice.  If the Executive's employment is terminated
            by reason of disability, the Executive    shall continue to
            receive his base salary, reduced by any payments received by the
            Executive under the Company's long-term disability program, for a
            period of six months following such termination and the
            opportunity to extend medical coverage pursuant to and in
            accordance with COBRA (at the cost of the Executive), but shall
            not be obligated to provide any other benefits described in this
            Agreement.  Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, if the
            Executive is discharged by the Company "without cause," as defined
            in paragraph (b) below, then the Company shall remain obligated to
            pay to him an amount equal to his base salary for the lesser of
            (i) one year and (ii) the remainder of the Employment Term, all
            reimbursement for accrued out-of-pocket expenses due to the
            Executive under Section 6 hereof, as well as to provide the
            Executive with continued medical coverage pursuant to and in
            accordance with COBRA (until the earlier of such time as is
            provided for under COBRA on such time as the Executive obtains
            major medical coverage from another employer), but shall not be
            obligated to provide any other benefits described in this
            Agreement.

                   (b)  Discharge for Cause.  Prior to the end of the
            Employment Term, the Company, upon 30 days prior written notice,
            may discharge the Executive for cause and terminate this Agreement
            without any further obligation to the Executive except to pay the
            Executive's (i) accrued and unpaid base salary through the date of
            termination, (ii) unreimbursed accrued out-of-pocket expenses
            pursuant to Section 6 hereof and (iii) any benefits required to be
            provided under COBRA.  For purposes of this Agreement, a discharge
            for "cause" shall mean a discharge resulting from (A) fraud,
            theft, gross malfeasance, or other similar actions on the part of
            the Executive (including, without limitation, conduct of a

                                             3

            felonious or criminal nature, embezzlement or misappropriation of
            corporate assets) in each case affecting the Company or that in
            the reasonable judgment of the Board (taking into account all
            relevant circumstances) would likely have a material and
            demonstrable adverse effect on the Company or the business or
            professional reputation of the Executive; (B) the chronic
            addiction of the Executive to drugs or alcohol which adversely
            affects the performance of the Executive's duties under this
            Agreement; (C) the Executive's willful failure, refusal or neglect
            to perform the services reasonably required of him as and when
            directed by, or to follow the policies or directives of, both of
            the Co-Chairmen of the Company or the Board after written notice
            from the Co-Chairmen or the Board (which notice shall specifically
            identify the manner in which the Co-Chairmen or the Board, as the
            case may be, believes that the Executive has failed); or (D) gross
            misconduct of the Executive in the discharge of his duties
            hereunder or gross misconduct that, in the reasonable judgment of
            the Board, may become a matter of public knowledge and that, in
            the reasonable judgment of the Board, may have a material and
            demonstrable adverse effect on the business, condition or affairs
            of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.  If the Executive
            is discharged by the Company for any reason other than those
            enumerated in this Section 8(b) or by reason of disability, such
            discharge shall be deemed to be a discharge "without cause."

                 (c)  Voluntary Termination by Executive.  If the Executive
            voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company, the
            Company shall not be obligated to make any further payments of
            base salary, signing bonus or provide any other benefits under
            this Agreement (other than those benefits required to be provided
            to the Executive under COBRA).

                 (d)  Termination as a Result of change of Control.  If the
            Executive's employment is terminated for any reason (including,
            without limitation, voluntary termination by the Executive) within
            six months after a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined),
            then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8(a), the Company
            shall pay to the Executive an amount equal to (i) the Executive's
            then base salary for a period of one year and (ii) all
            reimbursement for accrued out-of-pocket expenses due to the
            Executive under Section 6 hereof, which amounts shall be payable
            in one payment on the data of termination of his employment, and
            the Company shall continue to provide the Executive with continued
            medical coverage pursuant to and in accordance with COBRA, but
            shall not be required to make any other payments or provide any
            other benefits to the Executive.  For purposes of this Section
            8(d), "Change of Control" shall mean, such time as Messrs.
            Nicholas J. Verbitsky, C.T. Robinson, William C. Moyes and Richard
            W. Clark and their respective affiliates shall no longer own in
            the aggregate in excess of 30% of the voting stock of the Company

            and shall all cease to be members of the Board; or (b) as neither
            Mr. Nicholas J. Verbitsky or Mr. C. T. Robinson is the chief
            executive officer of the Company.

              9.   Covenant Not to Compete.

                   (a)  In consideration of the employment by the Company of
            the Executive under this Agreement, the Executive agrees that (i)
            during the Executive's employment with the Company and (ii) unless
            (x) the Executive is terminated without cause or (y) the Executive
            remains in the employ of the Company for the entire Employment
            Term and is not offered continued employment with the Company
            pursuant to a new employment agreement the terms of which are
            substantially similar to the terms of this Agreement, then for the
            two-year period following any termination of the Executive's
            employment with the Company, the Executive will not, without the
            prior written approval of the Board, directly or indirectly,
            either as an employee, employer, consultant, agent, principal,
            partner, stockholder, officer, director, or in any other
            individual or representative capacity, engage in any business
            situated anywhere in the United States (or its territories or
            possessions) or activity substantially similar to that of the
            Company or any subsidiary (i) conducted during the Employment
            Term, or (ii) under active consideration by the Company or any of
            its subsidiaries at the time of termination or within six months
            prior thereto, including, without limitation, the radio network
            business, radio research and consulting business, marketing and
            sales of radio programming or the ownership of radio stations in
            markets where the Company owns radio stations at the time the
            Executive resigns or is discharged. The obligations of the
            Executive pursuant to this Section 9(a)(ii) shall only be in
            effect for a one-year period if his employment with the Company
            terminates because of a "Change of Control" as pursuant to Section
            8(d) hereof.

                   (b)  The Executive agrees that during the employment Term
            and thereafter, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly,
            disclose to anyone at any time (except in the regular course of
            the Company's business or as required by law), or use in
            competition with the Company or any subsidiary, any information
            acquired by the Executive during his employment hereunder with
            respect to any confidential or secret aspect of the Company's or
            any subsidiary's operations or affairs unless such information has
            become public knowledge other than by reason of unauthorized
            actions (direct or indirect) of the Executive.

                   (c)  The Executive shall not, directly or indirectly,
            either during the term of the Executive's  employment under this
            Agreement or for a period of one year thereafter, solicit the
            services of any person who was a full-time employee of the Company

                                             5

            or any subsidiary during the last year of the term of the
            Executive's employment under this Agreement.

                   (d)  All files, records (including any records relating to
            customers or customer accounts), documents, questionnaires,
            handbooks and similar items relating to the business of the
            Company or any subsidiary shall remain the exclusive property of
            the Company or such subsidiary, and all such items shall be
            immediately returned to the Company or such subsidiary upon the
            termination of the Executive's employment with the Company.

                   (e)  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Executive
            from using his learned skills, know-how or general business
            experience, including such skills, know-how and experience gained
            while working for the Company.

               10.  Confidential Information.

                   (a)  The Executive recognizes and acknowledges that the
            Executive may receive certain confidential information and trade
            secrets ("Secrets") concerning the Company's business and affairs
            that may be of great value to the Company.  The Executive
            therefore agrees that during the term hereof he will not disclose
            or exploit any such Secrets, except (i) with the prior written
            consent of the Company; (ii) as he may be required to do so by
            applicable law: (iii) as required by the Company in the ordinary
            course of his employment hereunder: or (iv) with respect to
            Secrets published or non-confidential manner.

                   (b)  After the Executive's employment with the Company
            ceases, he shall not disclose or exploit any idea, literary
            material or similar property which during the term hereof was
            under development or being produced by the Company which the
            Executive obtained directly by reason of his employment hereunder,
            except as may be excused by Section lO(a) of this Agreement.

                   (c)  The Company expressly agrees that Employee's contacts,
            relationships and knowledge of the broadcasting industry, its
            trade procedures and practices and all other knowledge customarily
            possessed by senior executives in positions similar to the
            Executive's position with the Company as such may now and
            hereafter exist shall not be deemed to be Secrets hereunder.

               11.  Remedies.

                   (a)  The Executive acknowledges that the remedy at law for
            breach of his covenants under Section 9 or 10 hereof would be
            inadequate and, accordingly, in the event of any breach or
            threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of Section 9
            or 10 hereof, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all

                                             6

      <PAGE>

            other remedies, to an injunction restraining any such breach
            (without posting any bond or other security).

                   (b)  It is agreed that in the event the covenants of the
            Executive contained in Section 9 or 10 hereof shall finally be
            determined by any court (i) to be void or unenforceable in any
            particular area or jurisdiction, and if such determination is
            affirmed on appeal, if any, then the parties hereto shall consider
            such covenants to be amended and modified so as to eliminate
            therefrom the particular area or jurisdiction as to which such
            covenants are held to be void or otherwise unenforceable, and as
            to all other areas and jurisdictions covered by such covenants,
            the terms and provisions hereof shall remain in full force and
            effect as originally written; or (ii) to be effective in any
            particular area or jurisdiction only if such covenants are
            modified to limit their duration or scope, and if such
            determination is upheld on appeal, if any, then the parties hereto
            shall consider such covenants to be amended and modified with
            respect to the particular area or jurisdiction so as to comply
            with the order of such court or other constituted legal authority,
            and as to all other areas and jurisdictions, and the Executives
            covenants contained herein shall remain in full force and effect
            as originally written.

                   (c)  The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive any
            termination of this Agreement.

              12.  Unique Services.  The services of the Executive hereunder
            are of a special, unique and extraordinary character that gives
            them a particular value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or
            adequately compensated in damages in an action at law, and a
            breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement will
            cause the Company great and irreparable injury and damage. 
            Accordingly, unless the Executive validly exercises his right to
            terminate this Agreement as expressly provided herein, the
            Executive hereby expressly agrees that the Company shall be
            entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and
            other equitable relief in order to prevent a breach of this
            Agreement by the Executive.  This provision shall not, however, be
            construed as a waiver of any rights which the Company may have in
            the premises for damages or otherwise.

              13.  Warranties and Representation of the Executive. The
            Executive hereby warrants and represents to the Company as
            follows:

                   (a)  The Executive's execution and delivery of this
            Agreement does not violate or conflict with any provision of any
            document, instrument or agreement (oral or written) to which the
            Executive is subject.

                   (b)  The Executive has not paid or accepted, and will not
            pay or accept any money, service or other valuable consideration
            for the inclusion of any plug, reference or product
            identification, or any other matter, in any program to be
            broadcast on any radio network of the Company, or cause or permit
            any other violation of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as
            amended.

                   (c)  The Executive agrees that all of the results of the
            Executive's services hereunder during the term of this Agreement
            shall be deemed to have been accomplished in the course of the
            Executive's employment hereunder and all proprietary interest, if
            any, therein, shall, for all purposes, as between the Executive
            and the Company, its successors, licensees and assigns, belong to
            the Company and be the Company's exclusive property.

                   (d)  The Executive hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the
            Company and its successors and assigns harmless of and from any
            and all losses, damages, costs and expenses, including, without
            limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in
            connection with the breach of violation of any of the warranties,
            representations, covenants or agreements made the Executive
            herein.

               14.  Insurance.  The Company may secure in its own name or
            otherwise and at its own expense, life, accident, or other
            insurance covering the Executive, or the Executive and others, and
            the Executive shall not have any right, title or interest in or to
            any such insurance.  If the Executive shall be required to assist
            the Company to procure such insurance, the Executive agrees that
            he shall submit to such medical and other examinations, and shall
            sign such applications and other instruments in writing, as may be
            reasonably required by the Company and any insurance company to
            which application for such insurance shall be made.

               15.  Notices.  Notices required or permitted to be sent under
            this Agreement shall be deemed effective on the earlier of receipt
            or four (4) business days after being deposited in the United

            of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and
            legal representatives of the Executive.

              18.  No Implied Waiver. Failure to insist upon strict compliance

            party hereto of a breach of any provision of thing Agreement by
            the other party shall not be construed to waive any subsequent

                         (c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, if any
               changes in accounting principles from those used in the
               preparation of the audited financial statements referred to in
               Section 7.02 hereof are hereafter required or permitted by the
               rules, regulations, pronouncements and opinions of the Financial
               Accounting Standards Board or the American Institute of Certified
               Public Accountants (or successors thereto or agencies with
               similar functions) and are adopted by the Company or any of its
               Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified
               public accountants and such changes result in a change in the
               method of calculation of any of the financial covenants,
               standards or terms in or relating to Section 3.04, Section 8 or
               any other provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
               to enter into discussions with a view to amending such provisions
               so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result
               that the criteria for evaluating the financial condition of the
               Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries shall be the same after
               such changes as if such changes had not been made, provided that
               no change in such accounting principles that would affect the
               method of calculation of any of said financial covenants,
               standards or terms shall be given effect in such calculations
               until such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to
               the Majority Banks, to so reflect such change in accounting
               principles.


                         (d)  The Company will maintain its accounts and the
               accounts of its Subsidiaries on the basis of a fiscal year ending

               fiscal quarters in each Fiscal Year will be February 28 or 29 (as
               the case may be), May 31 and August 31 of each year,
               respectively; provided that (i) the Company may, by prior written
               notice to the Administrative Agent and the Banks, change the last
               day of the Fiscal Year and of each of its Subsidiaries to
               December 31 (and will thereupon change the last days of its and
               its Subsidiaries first three fiscal quarters in each Fiscal Year
               to March 31, June 30 and September 30, respectively); and (ii) in
               connection with any such change in the basis of the Fiscal Year,
               the Company, the Banks and the Administrative Agent hereby agree
               to enter into discussions, promptly after the Company has given
               the written notice referred to in clause (i) above, with a view
               to amending this Agreement to address to the mutual satisfaction
               of the parties the effect of such change on the financial and
               other covenants contained herein and on the other terms and <PAGE>

                    outstanding in an amount less than the amount of such series
                    of Commitments as then in effect, which would have been
                    required to be made if Loans had been outstanding in an
                    aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of
                    such Commitments on the date of such occurrence.

                Lending Office for Loans of such type.

                payable by the Company at any time hereunder and under the Notes

                Note") of the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1
                hereto, dated the Closing Date, payable to the order of such 
                Bank in a principal amount equal to the amount of such Bank's

                substantially the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, dated the Closing 
                Date, payable to the order of such Bank in a principal amount

                          (c)  The date, amount, type, interest rate, and
                duration of Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan of any
                series held by any Bank, and each payment made on account of the
                principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank on its books
                and, prior to any transfer of the Note evidencing such Loans of
                such series held by such Bank, endorsed by such Bank on the
                schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof;
                provided that the failure of such Bank to make any such
                recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of
                the Company to make a payment when due of any amount owing under
                such Note.

                          (d)  No Bank shall be entitled to have its Notes
                subdivided, by exchange for promissory notes of lesser
                denominations or otherwise, except in connection with a 
                permitted assignment of all or any portion of such Bank's 
                relevant Commitments, Loans and/or Notes pursuant to Section

                Continuation as provided in Section 4.05 hereof; and (b) 
                Eurodollar Loans may be Converted only on the last day of an 
                Interest Period for such Loans.  All borrowings, Conversions and
                Continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest 
                Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant 
                to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, at no 
                time will the aggregate number of Eurodollar Tranches exceed 
                six.  As used in this Section 2.08, the term "Eurodollar 
                Tranche" is the collective reference to Eurodollar Loans the 
                Interest Periods with respect to which begin on the same date 
                and end on the same later date (whether or not such Eurodollar 
                Loans shall originally have been
                made on the same date).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
                without limiting the rights and remedies of the Banks under
                Section 10 hereof, in the event that any Event of Default shall
                have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may
                (and at the request of the Majority Banks shall) suspend the
                right of the Company to Convert any Loan into a Eurodollar Loan,
                or to Continue any Loan as a Eurodollar Loan, in which event all
                Loans shall be Converted (on the last day(s) of the respective
                Interest Periods therefor) into Base Rate Loans or, if
                outstanding as Base Rate Loans, Continued as Base Rate Loans.

                          (a)  The Company hereby promises to pay to the
                Administrative Agent for account of each Term Loan Bank the
                aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans held by such Bank 
                in 28 installments payable on the Principal Payment Dates as 
                follows (each such installment to be in an amount equal to the
                product of (i) the aggregate amount of the Term Loans made to 
                the Company on the Closing Date times (ii) the percentage set

                          3.02  Interest.

                          (a)  The Company hereby promises to pay to the
               Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the
               unpaid principal amount of each Loan held by such Bank for the
               period commencing on and including the date of such Loan to but
               excluding the date such Loan is paid in full, at the following
               rates per annum:

                              (i)  during any period while such Loan is a Base
                    Rate Loan, the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time)
                    plus the Applicable Margin; and

                             (ii)  during any period while such Loan is a
                    Eurodollar Loan, for each Interest Period relating thereto,
                    the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan for such Interest Period
                    plus the Applicable Margin.


                         (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the maximum
               extent permitted by the law of the State of New York, the Company
               hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent interest at
               the applicable Post-Default Rate on the aggregate principal
               amount of and interest on Loans and on all other amounts payable
               by the Company hereunder and under the other Basic Documents from
               and after the occurrence and during the continuance of each
               Payment Default (such interest to be paid for the account of the
               respective Banks or the Administrative Agent to which such
               principal, interest or other amount not paid when due is
               payable).

                         (c)  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable
               (i) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, quarterly on the Quarterly
               Dates, (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, on the last day of
               each Interest Period therefor and, if such Interest Period is
               longer than three months, at three-month intervals following the
               first day of such Interest Period, and (iii) in the case of any
               Loan, upon the payment or prepayment thereof or the Conversion of
               such Loan to a Loan of the other type (but only on the principal
               amount so paid, prepaid or Converted), except that interest
               payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to
               time on demand.  Promptly after the determination of any interest
               rate provided for herein or any change therein, the
               Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks to
               which such interest is payable and to the Company.

                         3.03  Optional Prepayments.  Subject to Section 4.04
               hereof, the Company shall have the right to prepay Loans made to
               it at any time or from time to time, provided that:  (a) the
               Company shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such
               prepayment as provided in Section 4.05 hereof (and, upon the date
               specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to be
               prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder); and (b) each
               partial prepayment shall, at the option of the Company, be
               applied to the prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans or the Term
               Loans pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate
               principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans so
               prepaid (the amount of the Term Loans so prepaid to be applied to
               the remaining installments of such Loans in the inverse order of
               maturity); provided that, if the Company so elects in the related
               notice of prepayment referred to in clause (a) above, all or that
               part (as specified by the Company in such notice) of any amount
               required by clause (b) above to be applied to the installments of
               the Term Loans in the inverse order of maturity shall instead be
               applied to the installments of the Term Loans in the direct order
               of their maturity except that no such installment scheduled to be
               paid after the date which is 180 days after the date of such
               prepayment may be prepaid pursuant to this proviso.

                         3.04  Mandatory Prepayments.  The Company shall prepay
               the Loans as follows:

                         (a)  Dispositions.  Upon the receipt by the Company or
               any Subsidiary of the proceeds of any Disposition (other than any
               Disposition permitted by Section 8.12(c) hereof), the principal
               of the Loans shall, to the extent the net proceeds of such
               Disposition (when taken together with the aggregate amount of net
               proceeds of all other Dispositions (other than any permitted by
               said Section 8.12(c) during such Fiscal Year) shall exceed
               $250,000, be prepaid (as specified in paragraph (f) below) in an
               amount equal to such net proceeds.  For purposes of this
               Section 3.04(a), "net proceeds" shall mean all cash amounts
               received in respect of any such Disposition (including any cash
               amounts received by way of deferred payment pursuant to a note
               receivable or otherwise but only as and when received), net of
               (i) expenses incurred in connection with such Disposition and
               taxes paid (or reasonably estimated to be payable) in connection
               therewith and (ii) contractually required repayments of
               Indebtedness payable to Persons other than the Banks hereunder to

                the extent secured by a Lien on the relevant Properties that are
                the subject of such Disposition.

                         (b)  Casualty Events.  In the event of the receipt by
               the Company or any Subsidiary of the proceeds of any property or
               casualty insurance (excluding, however, any business interruption
               insurance), except to the extent such proceeds are to be applied
               reasonably promptly towards the repair, reconstruction or
               replacement of the property the damage to or loss of which gave
               rise to the payment thereof, the principal of the Loans shall be
               prepaid (as specified in paragraph (f) below) in an amount equal
               to such proceeds, provided that (i) for purposes of determining
               the amount of such proceeds to be so applied, such proceeds shall
               be net of taxes paid (or reasonably estimated to be payable) in
               connection therewith and of contractually required repayments of
               Indebtedness payable to Persons other than the Banks hereunder to
               the extent secured by a Lien on such Property and (ii) subject to
               clause (i) above, unless the Majority Banks otherwise agree, if
               at the time such proceeds are received by the Company or any of
               its Subsidiaries a Payment Default shall have occurred and be
               continuing, such proceeds shall be applied to the prepayment of
               the Loans in the manner required by this Section 3.04(b) and
               shall not be used for the repair, reconstruction or replacement
               of such property.


                         (c)  Excess Cash Flow, Etc.  Upon the date of the
               delivery to the Administrative Agent of the financial statements
               of the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) hereof for each Fiscal
               Year (as used herein, the "immediately preceding Fiscal Year")
               commencing with the Fiscal Year ending on November 30, 1994, but
               in no event later than April 30 of the next succeeding Fiscal
               Year, the principal of Loans shall be prepaid (as specified in
               paragraph (f) below) in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of
               (i) 50% of Excess Cash Flow for the immediately preceding Fiscal
               Year plus (ii) the aggregate amount of payments made by the
               Company and its Subsidiaries during such immediately preceding
               Fiscal Year to redeem Class Action Warrants to the extent
               permitted by Section 8.09(g) hereof.

                         (d)  Equity Issuances.  Upon any Equity Issuance, the
               principal of the Loans shall be prepaid (as specified in
               paragraph (f) below) in an amount equal to 50% of the net
               proceeds thereof.  For purposes of this Section 3.04(d), "net
               proceeds" shall mean, with respect to any Equity Issuance, the 







            <PAGE>

       


                                              - 39 -



               aggregate amount of all cash received by the Company and its
               Subsidiaries in respect thereof and the fair market value of all
               non-cash consideration received by the Company and its
               Subsidiaries in respect thereof, net of expenses incurred by the
               Company and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith.

                         (e)  Reductions of Revolving Credit Commitments.  Upon
               each reduction in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
               Commitments pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof to an aggregate
               amount less than the then aggregate outstanding principal amount
               of the Revolving Credit Loans, Revolving Credit Loans shall be
               prepaid in the amount required so that, after giving effect
               thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
               Revolving Credit Loans is less than or equal to the amount of the
               Revolving Credit Loan Commitments as so reduced.


                         (f)  Application and Timing of Payments.  Each
               prepayment under this Section 3.04 shall be applied, first, to
               the prepayment of the Term Loans (such prepayment to be applied
               to the remaining installments of such Loans in the inverse order
               of maturity), and then, after all Term Loans have been paid in
               full, to the prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans.  The Company
               shall give notice to the Administrative Agent of each prepayment
               pursuant to this Section 3.04 in the same manner and at the same
               time as is required for any optional prepayment pursuant to
               Section 3.03 hereof.  

                         Section 4.  Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations;
               Etc.


                          4.01  Payments.

                         (a)  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein or
               therein, all payments of principal, interest and other amounts to
               be made by each Obligor under this Agreement and the other Basic
               Documents, shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available
               funds, to the Administrative Agent at account number
               NYAO-DI-900-9-000002 maintained by the Administrative Agent with
               Chase at the Principal Office, not later than 11:00 a.m. New York
               time on the date on which such payment shall become due (each

                          (b)  The Administrative Agent or any Bank for whose
                account any such payment is to be made, may (but shall not be
                obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not
                made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of any Obligor
                with it (with notice to the Company and, if such Obligor is not
                the Company, such Obligor).

                          (c)  The Company shall, at the time it makes any
                payment under this Agreement or any Note, notify the Administra-
                tive Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s)
                thereof) of the Loans or other amounts payable by the Company
                hereunder to which such payment is to be applied in which case
                such payment shall be so applied, subject to Sections 3.03, 3.04
                and 4.02 hereof (and in the event that it fails to so specify,
                the Administrative Agent may distribute the amount of such
                payment to the Banks in such manner as the Majority Banks may
                determine to be appropriate, subject to said Sections 3.03, 3.04

               Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in
               respect of which such payment is made.


                          (e)  All payments by each Obligor hereunder shall be
                made without deduction, set-off or counterclaim.

                          (f)  If the due date of any payment under this
                Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day which is not
                a Business Day such payment shall be made on the immediately
                preceding Business Day and interest on any principal so paid
                shall be payable to, but excluding, the date such payment is
                made.

                    reduction of the amount of each series of Commitments shall
                    be applied to such series, pro rata according to the
                    respective unused amounts of the Commitments of such series;

                         (b)  the making, Conversion and Continuation of Loans
                    of a particular type and series (other than Conversions
                    provided for by Section 5.04 hereof) shall be made pro rata
                    among the Banks holding Loans of such type and series
                    according to the respective principal amounts of their
                    Commitments of such series (in the case of making Loans) or
                    their Loans of such series (in the case of Conversions and
                    Continuations of Loans), and Eurodollar Loans of a
                    particular type and series having the same Interest Period
                    shall be allocated pro rata among the Banks according to the
                    amounts of their respective Loans of such type and series;


                          (c)  each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans
                     of a particular type and series shall be made to the
                     Administrative Agent for account of the Banks holding Loans
                     of such type and series pro rata in accordance with the
                     respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such
                     type and series held by such Banks; and

                          (d)  each payment of interest on Loans of a particular
                     type and series shall be made to the Administrative Agent
                     for account of the Banks holding Loans of such type and
                     series pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest
                     on Loans of such type and series then due and payable to
                     such Banks.


                         4.03  Computations.  Interest on Eurodollar Loans shall
               be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days
               elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
               occurring in the period for which such interest is payable and
               interest on Base Rate Loans and commitment fees shall be computed
               on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
               and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding
               the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or
               commitment fee is payable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
               each day that the Base Rate is calculated by reference to the
               Federal Funds Rate, interest on Base Rate Loans shall be computed
               on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed. <PAGE>

               Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the
               amount and the series of the Commitments to be terminated or

               be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the date of
               borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment (which

               Interest Period shall specify the Loans to which such Interest
               Period is to relate.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly
               notify the relevant Banks of the contents of each such notice. 
               In the event that the Company fails to select the type of any
               Loan, or the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar
               Loan, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this
               Section 4.05, such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan)
               will be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last
               day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (if
               outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then
               outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan.

               Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a
               Bank or the Company (the "Payor") prior to the date on which the
               Payor is to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (in the
               case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder
               or (in the case of the Company) a payment to the Administrative
               Agent for account of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such
               payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice
               shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend
               to make the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the
               Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has
               been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall
               not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the
               intended recipient(s) on such date and, if the Payor has not in
               fact made the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the
               recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the <PAGE>

               Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with
               interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
               commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
               Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent
               recovers such amount at, if such recipient is a Bank, a rate per
               annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day or, if such
               recipient is the Company, at a rate per annum equal to the Base
               Rate then in effect plus (if such Required Payment related to the
               making of a Base Rate Loan) the Applicable Margin for Base Rate
               Loans and, if such recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such
               payment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover
               such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with interest as
               aforesaid.

                          4.07  Sharing of Payments, Etc.

                          (a)  Each Obligor agrees that, in addition to (and
                without limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or
                counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be
                entitled, at its option, to offset balances held by it for
                account of such Obligor at any of its offices, in Dollars or in
                any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any
                of such Bank's Loans or any other amount payable to such Bank
                hereunder, that is not paid when due (regardless of whether such
                balances are then due to such Obligor), in which case it shall
                promptly notify the Company (and, if such Obligor is not the
                Company, such Obligor) and the Administrative Agent thereof,
                provided that such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not
                affect the validity thereof.


                         (b)  (i)  Prior to the date the principal amount then
                    outstanding of, and accrued interest on, the Loans become
                    due and payable pursuant to Section 10 hereof, if any Term
                    Loan Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or
                    interest on any of the Term Loans or payment of any other
                    amount under this Agreement, any Note evidencing Term Loans
                    held by it or the Security Agreement through the exercise of
                    any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or
                    similar right or otherwise, and, as a result of such
                    payment, such Term Loan Bank shall have received a greater
                    percentage of the principal or interest then due hereunder
                    in respect of Term Loans held by such Term Loan Bank than
                    the percentage of principal or interest then due and payable

                    Loan Banks received by the other Term Loan Banks, such Term
                    Loan Bank shall promptly purchase from such other Term Loan
                    Banks participations in (or, if and to the extent specified
                    by such Term Loan Bank, direct interests in) the Term Loans
                    held by such other Term Loan Banks (or in interest due
                    thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such
                    other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable,
                    to the end that all of such Term Loan Banks shall share the
                    benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses which
                    may be incurred by such Term Loan Bank in obtaining or
                    preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with
                    the principal and/or interest on the Term Loans then due and
                    payable held by each of such Term Loan Banks.  To such end
                    all the Term Loan Banks shall make appropriate adjustments
                    among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or
                    otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be
                    restored.

                        (ii)  Prior to the date the principal amount then
                    outstanding of, and accrued interest on, the Loans become
                    due and payable pursuant to Section 10 hereof, if any
                    Revolving Credit Bank shall obtain payment of any principal
                    of or interest on any of the Revolving Credit Loans or
                    payment of any other amount under this Agreement, any Note
                    evidencing Revolving Credit Loans held by it or the Security
                    Agreement through the exercise of any right of set-off,
                    banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise,
                    and, as a result of such payment, such Revolving Credit Bank
                    shall have received a greater percentage of the principal or
                    interest then due hereunder in respect of Revolving Credit
                    Loans held by such Revolving Credit Bank than the percentage
                    of principal or interest then due and payable hereunder in
                    respect of Revolving Credit Loans held by the other
                    Revolving Credit Banks received by the other Revolving
                    Credit Banks, such Revolving Credit Bank shall promptly
                    purchase from such other Revolving Credit Banks
                    participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by
                    such Revolving Credit Bank, direct interests in) the
                    Revolving Credit Loans held by such other Revolving Credit
                    Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in
                    such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
                    time as shall be equitable, to the end that all of such
                    Revolving Credit Banks shall share the benefit of such
                    excess payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred

                    such Revolving Credit Bank in obtaining or preserving such
                    excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the principal
                    and/or interest on the Revolving Credit Loans then due and
                    payable held by each of such Revolving Credit Banks.  To
                    such end all the Revolving Credit Banks shall make
                    appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of
                    participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is
                    rescinded or must otherwise be restored.
                        (iii)  On and after the date the principal amount then
                    outstanding of, and accrued interest on, the Loans become
                    due and payable pursuant to Section 10 hereof, if any Bank
                    shall obtain payment of any principal of or interest on the
                    Loans of any series or payment of any other amount under
                    this Agreement, any Note held by it or the Security
                    Agreement or otherwise through the exercise of any right of
                    set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right,
                    and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have
                    received a greater percentage of the principal or interest
                    then due hereunder in respect of the Loans held by such Bank
                    than the percentage of principal or interest then due and
                    payable hereunder in respect of the Loans held by the other
                    Banks received by the other Banks holding Loans it shall
                    promptly purchase from such other Banks participations in
                    (or if and to the extent specified by such Bank, direct
                    interests in) the Loans of such series held by such other
                    Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in
                    such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
                    time as shall be equitable, to the end that all of such
                    Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of
                    any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining
                    or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance
                    with the principal and/or interest on the Loans of such
                    series then due and payable held by each of such Banks.  To
                    such end all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments
                    among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or
                    otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be
                    restored.

                         (c)  Each Obligor agrees that any Bank so purchasing
               such a participation (or direct interest) may exercise all rights
               of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with
               respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a <PAGE>

                owing to such Bank in the amount of such participation.

                         (d)  Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to
               exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to
               exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right
               with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of any
               Obligor.  If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
               other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a
               set-off to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Bank shall, to
               the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
               secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks
               entitled under this Section 4.07 to share in the benefits of any
               recovery on such secured claim.

                         (a)  The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from
               time to time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be
                necessary to compensate it for any costs which such Bank
               determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any
               Eurodollar Loans hereunder or its obligation to make any
               Eurodollar Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount
               receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of any of such Loans
               or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in
               amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"),
               resulting from any Regulatory Change which:


                         (i)  changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
                    payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in
                    respect of any of such Loans (other than taxes imposed on or
                    measured by the overall net income of such Bank or of its
                    Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by the
                    jurisdiction in which such Bank is incorporated or has its
                    principal office or such Applicable Lending Office); or

                         (ii)  imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit
                    or similar requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement
                    utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate for
                    such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other<PAGE>

                     such Bank (including any of such Loans or any deposits
                     referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in
                     Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such Bank
                     (including the Commitments of such Bank hereunder); or


                        (iii)  imposes any other condition affecting this
                     Agreement or its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit
                     or liabilities) or its Commitments.

               If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this
               Section 5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a
               copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such
               Bank to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
               Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the Regulatory Change
               giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case
               the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable);
               provided, that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
               Bank to receive the compensation so requested.

                          (b)  Without limiting the effect of the provisions of
               paragraph (a) of this Section 5.01, in the event that, by reason
               of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either (i) incurs Additional
               Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level
               of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
               such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the
               interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in
               this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other
               assets of such Bank which includes Eurodollar Loans or
               (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a
               category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if
               such Bank so elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the
               Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Bank to make or
               Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans
               hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases
               to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04
               hereof shall be applicable).

                         (c)  Without limiting the effect of the foregoing
               provisions of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the
               Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time on
               request such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary
               to compensate such Bank (or, without duplication, the bank
               holding company of which such Bank is a subsidiary) for any costs
               which it determines are attributable to the maintenance by such <PAGE>

               force of law) of any court or governmental or monetary authority
               (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii) implementing any
               risk-based capital guideline or requirement (whether or not
               having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply
               therewith would be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by
               any government or governmental or supervisory authority
               implementing at the national level the Basle Accord (including,
               without limitation, the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of
               the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR
               Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) and the Final

               without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate
               of return on assets or equity of such Bank (or any Applicable
               Lending Office or such bank holding company) to a level below
               that which such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such
               bank holding company) could have achieved but for such law,

               of this Section 5.01(c), "Basle Accord" shall mean the proposals
               for risk-based capital framework described by the Basle Committee
               on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper
               entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and
               Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended, modified and
               supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement
               thereof.


                         (d)  Each Bank shall notify the Company of any event
               occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such
               Bank to compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this
               Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable after it obtains actual
               knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation and
               will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the
               Loans of such Bank affected by such event if such designation
               will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
               compensation and will not, in the reasonable opinion of such
               Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
               shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending
               Office located in the United States of America, provided that no
               Bank shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 5.01
               for any costs incurred more than six months prior to the date the

               respective Bank requests such compensation from the Company. 
               Each Bank will furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth
               the basis and amount of each request by such Bank for
               compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. 
               Determinations and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this
               Section 5.01 of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to
               paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01, or of the effect of
               capital maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
               Section 5.01, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans
               or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it
               in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate
               such Bank under this Section 5.01, shall be conclusive, provided
               that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable
               basis.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.01 to the
               contrary, no Bank shall be entitled to compensation (i) if any
               increase in costs results from any Bank failing to comply with
               any of the requirements set forth in Section 5.06(a) or (ii) for
               any costs to a Bank that are already taken into account in the
               determination of the applicable interest rate.


                         5.02  Limitation on Eurodollar Loans.  Anything herein
               to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the deter-
               mination of any Eurodollar Base Rate for any Eurodollar Loans for
               any Interest Period:


                          (a)  the Administrative Agent determines, which
                     determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of
                     interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the
                     definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof
                     are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
                     relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of
                     interest for such Eurodollar Loans as provided herein; or

                         (b)  if such Loans are Term Loans and/or Revolving
                    Credit Loans, the Majority Term Loan Banks and/or Majority
                    Revolving Credit Banks, respectively, determine, which
                    determination shall be conclusive, and notify the Adminis-
                    trative Agent that the relevant rates of interest referred
                    to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in
                    Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of
                    interest for Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period is to
                    be determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to
                    such Banks of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans for
                    such Interest Period; <PAGE>





            <PAGE>

               then the Administrative Agent shall give the Company and each of
               the Banks which are to make or which hold such Loans prompt
               notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect,
               such Banks shall be under no obligation to make additional
               Eurodollar Loans, to Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base
               Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and each outstanding Eurodollar
               Loan held by such Bank shall, on the last day of the then current
               Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan, be Converted
               automatically into Base Rate Loans in accordance with
                Section 2.08 hereof.


                         5.03  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision
               of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any
               Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to
               make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall
               promptly notify the Company thereof (with a copy to the
               Administrative Agent) and such Bank's obligation to make or
               Continue, or to Convert Loans of the other type into, Eurodollar
               Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Bank may again
               make and maintain Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions
               of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

                         5.04  Treatment of Affected Loans.  If the obligation
               of any Bank to make Eurodollar Loans or Continue, or to Convert
               Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
               pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, such Bank's Eurodollar
               Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on
               the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such
               Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
               Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank
               may specify to the Company with a copy to the Administrative
               Agent) and, unless and until such Bank gives notice as provided
               below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03
               hereof which gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:


                         (a)  to the extent that such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of
                    any series have been so Converted, all payments and
                    prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to
                    such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of such series shall be applied
                    instead to its Base Rate Loans of such series; and


                          (b)  all Loans which would otherwise be made or<PAGE>





            <PAGE>

                     of such Bank which would otherwise be Converted into
                     Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

               If such Bank gives notice to the Company with a copy to the
               Administrative Agent that the circumstances specified in
               Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof which gave rise to the Conversion of
               such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of any series pursuant to this
               Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such Bank agrees to do
               promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when
               Eurodollar Loans of such series held by other Banks are
               outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Loans of such series shall be
               automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next
               succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar
               Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect
               thereto, all Loans of such series held by such Banks and by such
               Bank are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, types and
               Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Loans of
               such series.

                         5.05  Compensation.  The Company shall pay to the
               Administrative Agent for account of each Bank, upon the request
               of such Bank through the Administrative Agent, such amount or
               amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
               Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such
               Bank determines is attributable to:


                         (a)  any payment, prepayment or Conversion of a
                    Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank for any reason (including,
                    without limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant
                    to Section 10 hereof) on a date other than the last day of
                    the Interest Period for such Loan; or

                         (b)  any failure by the Company for any reason
                    (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the
                    conditions precedent specified in Section 6 hereof to be
                    satisfied) to borrow a Eurodollar Loan from such Bank on the
                    date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice of
                    borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof.

               Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such
               compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
               of (i) the amount of interest which otherwise would have accrued
               on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted or not
               borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, <PAGE>

               prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of
               the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case
               of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which
               would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at
               the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
               over (ii) the amount of interest which otherwise would have
               accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the
               interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the
               London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading banks in
               amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities
               comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such
               Bank).  Each Bank will furnish a certificate to the Company
               setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank
               for compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.05,
               such certificate to be conclusive as to the amount of
               compensation to which such Bank is entitled provided the
               determination of such amount is made on a reasonable basis.

                          5.06  U.S. Taxes.

                         (a)  Prior to the date of the initial Loans hereunder,
               and from time to time thereafter if requested by the Company or
               the Administrative Agent or required because, as a result of a
               change in law or a change in circumstances or otherwise, a
               previously delivered form or statement becomes incomplete or
               incorrect in any material respect, each Bank organized under the
               laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide,
               if applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Company with
               complete, accurate and duly executed forms or other statements
               prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States
               certifying such Bank's exemption from, or entitlement to a
               reduced rate of, United States withholding taxes (including
               backup withholding taxes) with respect to its beneficial interest
               in payments to be made to such Bank hereunder and under the
               Notes.  If such Bank has transferred a beneficial interest in any
               part of the Notes payable to it, it will forward to the Company
               or the Administrative Agent any such statements or forms executed
               by the Person to which it has transferred such beneficial
               interest.

                         (b)  The Company and the Administrative Agent shall be
               entitled to deduct and withhold any and all present or future
               taxes or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
               from payments hereunder or under the Notes, if and to the extent<PAGE>

               that the Company or the Administrative Agent in good faith
               determines that such deduction or withholding is required by the
               law of the United States, including, without limitation, any
               applicable treaty of the United States.  In the event the Company
               or the Administrative Agent shall so determine that deduction or
               withholding of taxes is required, it shall advise the affected
               Bank as to the basis of such determination prior to actually
               deducting and withholding such taxes.  In the event the Company
               or the Administrative Agent shall so deduct or withhold taxes
               from amounts payable hereunder, it (i) shall pay to or deposit
               with the appropriate taxing authority in a timely manner the full
               amount of taxes it has deducted or withheld; (ii) shall provide
               evidence of payment of such taxes to, or the deposit thereof
               with, the appropriate taxing authority and a statement setting
               forth the amount of taxes deducted or withheld, the applicable
               rate, and any other information or documentation reasonably
               requested by the Banks from whom the taxes were deducted or
               withheld; and (iii) shall forward to such Banks any official tax
               receipts or other documentation with respect to the payment or
               deposit of the deducted or withheld taxes as may be issued from
               time to time by the appropriate taxing authority.  Unless the
               Company and the Administrative Agent shall have received forms or
               other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments
               hereunder or under any Note are not subject to United States
               withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by
               an applicable tax treaty, the Company or the Administrative Agent
               may withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory
               rate in the case of payment to or for any Bank organized under
               the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States.

                         (c)  Each Bank organized under the laws of the United
               States or any state thereof agrees (i) that as between it and the
               Company or the Administrative Agent, it shall be the Person to
               deduct and withhold taxes, and to the extent required by law it
               shall deduct and withhold taxes, on amounts that such Bank may
               remit to any other Person(s) by reason of any undisclosed sale of
               a participation in this Agreement to such other Person(s)
               pursuant to Section 12.06; and (ii) to indemnify the Company and
               the Administrative Agent and any officers, directors, agents or
               employees of the Company or the Administrative Agent against and
               to hold them harmless from any tax, interest, additions to tax,
               penalties, reasonable counsel and accountants fees and
               disbursements arising from the assertion by any appropriate
               taxing authority of any claim against them relating to a failure<PAGE>

                to withhold taxes as required by law with respect to amounts
                described in clause (i) of this paragraph (c).

                         (d)  Each assignee of a Bank's interest in this
               Agreement in conformity with Section 12.06 shall be bound by this
               Section 5.06, so that such assignee will have all of the
               obligations and provide all of the forms and statements and all
               indemnities, representations and warranties required to be given
               under this Section 5.06.  Unless the Company shall have consented
               in writing to such assignment, no such assignee of a Bank's
               interest in this Agreement shall have the right to any payment
               under this Section 5.06 in excess of the amount that would have
               been payable by the Company to the assignor Bank.

                         (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
               any withholding taxes shall become payable solely as a result of
               any change in any statute, treaty, ruling, determination or
               regulation occurring after the Initial Date (as hereinafter
               defined) in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
               Note to any Bank (or any participant in a Loan held by a Bank) or
               the Administrative Agent (i) the sum payable by the Company shall
               be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
               required deductions (including deductions applicable to
               additional sums payable under this Section 5.06) such Bank (or
               any participant in a Loan held by a Bank) or the Administrative
               Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
               would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
               Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall
               pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
               or other authority in accordance with applicable law.  For
               purposes of this Section 5.06, the term "Initial Date" shall mean
               (i) in the case of the Administrative Agent, the date hereof,
               (ii) in the case of each Bank as of the date hereof, the date
               hereof and (iii) in the case of any other Bank, the date it
               becomes a Bank hereunder pursuant to Section 12.06.  No amount
               payable hereunder to a holder of a participation in a Loan shall
               be greater in amount than the amount that would have been paid to
               the holder of the Loan had it retained the Loan and not sold the
               participation therein.

                          (f)  If as a result of withholding taxes becoming
                payable in connection with any amount payable to or with respect
                to a Bank (i) the sum payable by the Company is increased
                pursuant to clause (i) of Section 5.06(e) hereof and (ii) such<PAGE>

               Bank utilizes a credit against any tax liability arising
               hereunder for which it is liable (other than the income tax
               liability directly satisfied by such withholding), then such Bank
               shall promptly pay to the Company an amount equal to such amount
               as the Bank estimates in a good faith exercise of its judgment
               represents the credit so utilized (not to exceed the
               corresponding sum payable by the Company pursuant to
               Section 5.06(e) hereof), provided that a Bank shall not be
               obligated to make any payment hereunder to the extent such
               payment would result in such Bank's being in a worse after-tax
               economic position than if amounts paid to such Bank had not been
               subject to withholding taxes.  In the event the credit is later
               disallowed, deferred or recaptured for any reason, the Company
               will pay the Bank such amount as will equal the amount of the
               credit so disallowed, deferred or recaptured, provided that the
               Company shall not be obligated to pay any amount hereunder to a
               Bank with respect to any credit that is later disallowed or
               recaptured in excess of the amount paid hereunder to the Company
               by such Bank in respect of such credit.  In any such case, the
               applicable Bank shall provide to the Company a statement in
               reasonable detail setting forth the determination of such credit
               utilized by such Bank.

               that (a) the Company at all times following the Closing Date owns
               (subject only to the Lien of the Security Agreement) all of the
               Unistar Shares and (b) except as permitted by Section 8.12
               hereof, the Company and each of its other Subsidiaries at all
               times owns (subject only to the Lien of the Security Agreement)
               at least the same percentage of the issued and outstanding shares
               of each class of stock of each of its other Subsidiaries as is
               owned by it on the date of this Agreement.  Without limiting the
               generality of the foregoing, none of the Company nor any of its
               Subsidiaries shall sell, transfer or otherwise Dispose of any
               shares of stock of any Subsidiary owned by them, nor permit any
               such Subsidiary to issue any shares of stock of any class
               whatsoever to any Person (other than to the Company or to another
               Obligor).  In the event that (a) any such additional shares of
               stock shall be issued by any such Subsidiary or (b) any Obligor
               shall create or Acquire any new Subsidiary (subject to
               Section 8.12(b) hereof) and shall thereby become the owner of
               shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary, in each case, the
               respective Obligor agrees forthwith to deliver to the
               Administrative Agent, pursuant to the Security Agreement, the
               certificates evidencing such shares of stock, accompanied by
               undated stock powers executed in blank and shall take such other
               action as the Administrative Agent shall request to perfect the
               security interest created therein pursuant to the Security
               Agreement (and each of the Banks hereby authorizes the
               Administrative Agent to take such action, and to execute such
               documents and other instruments, as may be necessary to give
               effect to the creation and perfection of such security
               interests).


                          8.19  Modifications of Certain Documents; Subordinated
                Debt.

                         (a)  The Company will not, without the prior consent of
               the Majority Banks, (i) waive, amend or otherwise modify any
               provision of any of the Subordinated Debt Documents, (ii) waive,
               amend or otherwise modify any provision of any of the
               Unistar/Infinity Transaction Documents in any manner that could <PAGE>

               have a material adverse effect on the Banks, or (iii) waive,
               amend or otherwise modify any provision of the Class Action
               Warrants in any manner that is materially adverse to the Company.

                          (b)  The Company will not, and will not permit any
                Subsidiary to, amend or otherwise modify any provision of its
                charter or by-laws in any manner that would have a material
                adverse effect on the Banks without the prior consent of the
                Majority Banks. 


                         (c)  Except as permitted by Sections 8.09(a) and
               8.09(b) hereof, the Company will not, without the prior consent
               of the Majority Banks, exercise any option or right under any of
               the Subordinated Debt Documents to prepay, redeem, defease, or to
               make any payment the effect of which is to prepay, redeem or
               defease, any of the Subordinated Debt. 

                         (d)  The Company will at all times exercise its option
               under Section 1402 of the 6-3/4% Debenture Indenture (and take
               all action as shall be necessary to give effect to such exercise)
               to apply all 6-3/4% Debentures that shall have been redeemed or
               converted on or prior to the Closing Date as a credit against the
               mandatory sinking fund payments required from time to time by
               said Indenture.

                         9.01  Guarantee.  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
               hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each of the Banks and
               the Agents and their respective successors and assigns the prompt
               payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by
               acceleration, by mandatory or optional prepayment or otherwise) 
               of (a) the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the
               Banks to, and the Note held by each Bank of, the Company and all
               other amounts from time to time owing to the Banks or the
               Administrative Agent by the Company under this Agreement and
               under the Notes and by each of the Obligors under each of the
               other Basic Documents, and (b) all obligations of the Company to
               any Bank in respect of Interest Rate Protection Agreements
               entered into by the Company and such Bank pursuant to
               Section 8.13 hereof, in each case strictly in accordance with the
               terms thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called<PAGE>





            <PAGE>

             the "Guaranteed Obligations").  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors <PAGE>

               hereby further jointly and severally agrees that if any of the
               Guaranteed Obligations shall not be paid in full when due
               (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory or
               optional prepayment or otherwise), such Subsidiary Guarantor will
               promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever,
               and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or
               renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be
               promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by
               acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such
               extension or renewal.


                         9.02  Obligations Unconditional.  The obligations of
               each of the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 9.01 hereof are
               absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of
               the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of
               the obligations of any other Obligor under this Agreement or any
               other Basic Document or any substitution, release or exchange of
               any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed
               Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
               law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which
               might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
               defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
               Section 9.02 that the obligations of the each of the Subsidiary
               Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint
               and several, under any and all circumstances.  Without limiting
               the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the extent
               permitted by applicable law, the occurrence of any one or more of
               the following shall not affect the liability of any of the
               Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 9:


                          (i)  at any time or from time to time, without notice
                     to such Subsidiary Guarantor, the time for any performance
                     of or compliance with any of its Guaranteed Obligations
                     shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall
                     be waived;


                        (ii)  any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions
                     of this Agreement or any other Basic Document shall be done
                     or omitted;

                        (iii)  the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
                     shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations<PAGE>

                    Document shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of
                    the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be
                    released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt
                    with; or


                         (iv)  any lien or security interest granted as security
                     for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be
                     perfected.

               Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby expressly waives
               diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
               notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any of the Agents
               and the Banks exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed
               against any other Obligor under this Agreement or any other Basic
               Document or against any other Person under any other guarantee
               of, or security for, any of such Subsidiary Guarantor's
               Guaranteed Obligations.

                         9.03  Reinstatement.  The obligations of each of the
               Subsidiary Guarantors under this Section 9 shall be automatically
               reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
               by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of
               any of the Obligor's Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must
               be otherwise restored by any holder of the Guaranteed
               Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy
               or reorganization or otherwise and each of the Obligors jointly
               and severally agrees that it will indemnify each of the Agents
               and the Banks on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
               (including, without limitation, fees of counsel) incurred by such
               Agent or such Bank in connection with such rescission or
               restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in
               defending against any claim alleging that such payment
               constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment
               under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.


                         9.04  Subrogation.  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
               hereby jointly and severally agrees that until the payment and
               satisfaction in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and the
               expiration and termination of all Commitments under this
               Agreement it shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by
               reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 9.01
               hereof, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against any other<PAGE>

                Obligations or any security for any of such Guaranteed
                Obligations.

                         9.05  Remedies.  Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
               jointly and severally agrees that, as between the Subsidiary
               Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Banks, on the
               other hand, the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
               and the Notes may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as
               provided in Section 10 hereof (and shall be deemed to have become
               automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in
               said Section 10) for purposes of Section 9.01 hereof
               notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
               preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
               automatically due and payable) as against the Company and that,
               in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being
               deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such
               obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Company) shall
               forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for
               purposes of said Section 9.01.


                          9.06  Continuing Guarantee.  The guarantee in this
                Section 9 is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all
                Guaranteed Obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
                whenever arising.


                          9.07  Rights of Contribution.  The Subsidiary
                Guarantors hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any of
                them (an "Excess Funding Guarantor") shall pay any Guaranteed
                Obligations under Section 9.01 hereof in excess of such Excess
                Funding Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as hereinafter defined) of
                such Guaranteed Obligations, the other such Obligors shall, on
                demand (but subject to the next sentence hereof), pay to such
                Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to their respective Pro
                Rata Shares of such Excess Funding Guarantor's payment.  The
                payment obligation of each of such Subsidiary Guarantors to any
                Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section 9.07 shall be
                subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
                in full of the obligations of such Obligor under the other
                provisions of this Section 9 and such Excess Funding Guarantor
                shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such
                excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such
                obligations.  For the purposes hereof, "Pro Rata Share" shall
                mean, for any Subsidiary Guarantor, a percentage equal to the<PAGE>





            <PAGE>

              percentage that the excess of the fair value of its assets as at <PAGE>

                December 31, 1993 over the amount of its liabilities (including
                contingent liabilities) as at such date is of the excess of the
                aggregate value of the assets of all other Subsidiary Guarantors
                as at such date over their aggregate liabilities (including
                contingent liabilities) as at such date.


                         9.08  Limitation on Subsidiary Obligor Obligations.  In
               any action or proceeding involving any State corporate law, or
               any State or Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
               other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the
               obligations of any of the Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 9.01
               hereof would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of
               Section 9.07 hereof, be held or determined to be void, invalid or
               unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other
               creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under said
               Section 9.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to
               the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any
               further action by Subsidiary Guarantor, any Bank, the Agents or
               any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the
               highest amount which is valid and enforceable and not
               subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in
               such action or proceeding.


                          Section 10.  Events of Default.  If one or more of the
                following events (herein called "Events of Default") shall occur
                and be continuing:

                         (a)  The Company shall default in the payment or
                    prepayment when due of any principal of or interest on any
                    Loan; or the Company shall default in the payment of any fee
                    or any other amount payable by it hereunder which shall
                    remain unremedied for a period of three days; or the Company
                    shall default in the payment of any fee or other amount
                    payable by it under the Security Documents for a period of
                    five days after notice from the intended recipient of such
                    fee or other amount; or

                          (b)  The Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
                     default in the payment when due of any principal of or
                     interest on any of its other Indebtedness aggregating
                     $250,000 or more beyond any applicable grace periods, or in
                     the payment when due of any amount under any Interest Rate
                     Protection Agreement for a notional principal amount <PAGE>

                    exceeding $1,000,000; or the Company shall become obligated
                    to purchase or otherwise acquire, prior to the stated
                    maturity thereof, any of its other Indebtedness aggregating
                    $250,000 or more, or any event specified in any note,
                    agreement, indenture or other document evidencing or
                    relating to any such Indebtedness or any event specified in
                    any Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall occur if the
                    effect of such other event is to cause, or would (after
                    giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace
                    period) permit the holder or holders of such Indebtedness
                    (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders)
                    to cause, such Indebtedness to become due, or to be prepaid,
                    purchased or otherwise acquired in full (whether by
                    redemption, purchase, offer to purchase or otherwise), prior
                    to its stated maturity or, in the case of an Interest Rate
                    Protection Agreement, to permit the payments owing under
                    such Interest Rate Protection Agreement to be liquidated; or

                         (c)  Any representation, warranty or certification made
                    or deemed made in any Basic Document (or in any modification

               formalities of any kind all of which are hereby expressly waived
               by the Obligors and (ii) in the case of the occurrence of an

                          Section 11.  The Agents


                          11.01  Appointment, Powers and Immunities.  Each Bank
                hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative
                Agent to act as its agent hereunder and under the other Basic
                Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the
                Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the
                other Basic Documents, together with such other powers (if any)
                as are reasonably incidental thereto.  None of the Co-Agents, in
                their capacity as Co-Agents, shall have any duties or
                responsibilities under this Agreement or any fiduciary
                relationship with the Administrative Agent, or any Bank, and no
                implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties or
                liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Basic
                Document or otherwise exist against any Co-Agent in its capacity
                as Co-Agent hereunder.  No Agent (which term, either in the
                singular or the plural, as used in this sentence and in
                Section 11.05 and the first sentence of Section 11.06 hereof
                shall include reference to such Agent's affiliates and its own
                and its affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents): 
                (a) shall have any duties or responsibilities except those <PAGE>

               expressly set forth in the Basic Documents with respect to such
               Agent (if any); (b) shall by reason of any Basic Document be a
               trustee for any of the Banks or the other Agents; (c) shall be
               responsible to any of the Banks or the other Agents for any
               recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
               any Basic Document, or in any certificate or other document
               referred to or provided for in, or received by it under any Basic
               Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
               enforceability or sufficiency of any Basic Document or any other
               document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any
               failure by any Obligor or any other Person to perform any of its
               obligations hereunder or thereunder; (d) except as expressly
               required by any Basic Document, shall be required to initiate or
               conduct any litigation or collection proceedings under any Basic
               Document; or (e) shall be responsible for any action taken or
               omitted to be taken by it under any Basic Document or under any
               other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein
               or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its
               own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limiting the
               generality of the foregoing, each of the Agents shall be
               conclusively entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set
               forth in Section 6 hereof have been satisfied unless such Agent
               has received a notice to the effect that any of such conditions
               have not been satisfied from either the Majority Banks or, if the
               related borrowing is of a Term Loan, the Majority Term Loan
               Banks, or, if the related borrowing is of a Revolving Credit
               Loan, the Majority Revolving Credit Banks, in each case referring
               to the relevant subsection(s) and stating that the relevant
               condition(s) have not been satisfied or unless the Company so
               notifies such Agent.  Each Agent may employ agents and
               attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence
               or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
               such Agent in good faith.  Each Agent may deem and treat the
               payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof
               unless and until a notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
               shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent, together
               with a notice of such assignment or transfer to the Company. 
               Each of the Banks hereby irrevocably authorizes the
               Administrative Agent to execute, deliver and/or perform each of
               the Security Documents.  The Administrative Agent is hereby
               authorized to determine whether the cost to the Obligors is
               disproportionate to the benefit to be realized by the Banks by
               perfecting a Lien in any given Property, or whether any given
               Property is immaterial or of inconsequential value, and if the<PAGE>

                Administrative Agent makes any such determination the applicable
                Obligor(s) shall not be required to perfect a Lien on such
                Property in favor of the Administrative Agent.  

                         11.02  Reliance by Each Agent.  The Administrative
               Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or
               other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex,
               telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and
               to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person
               or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
               independent accountants and other experts selected by the
               Administrative Agent.  As to any matters not expressly provided
               for by this Agreement or any other Basic Document, the
               Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
               acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or thereunder in
               accordance with instructions given by the Majority Banks or, if
               and to the extent required hereby or by any other Basic Document,
               in accordance with instructions given by all of the Banks, the
               Majority Term Loan Banks and/or the Majority Revolving Credit
               Banks, as the case may be, and such instructions of such Banks
               and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
               binding on all of the Banks or, if applicable, on all of the Term
               Loan Banks and/or Revolving Credit Banks, as the case may be.

                          11.03  Defaults.


                         (a)  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or
               notice of the occurrence of a Default (except, in the case of the
               Administrative Agent only) unless it has received notice from
               another Agent, a Bank or the Company specifying such Default and
               stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".  In the event
               that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the
               occurrence of a Default, it shall give prompt notice thereof to
               the Banks.


                          (b)  The Administrative Agent shall (subject to
                Sections 11.01, 11.05 and 11.07 hereof) take such action with
                respect to any Default as shall be directed by the Majority
                Banks, or, if and to the extent required herein or in any other
                Basic Document, all of the Banks, the Majority Term Loan Banks
                and/or the Majority Revolving Credit Banks, as the case may be,
                provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall<PAGE>





            <PAGE>

                shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from <PAGE>

               taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem
               advisable in the best interest of all of the Banks, except to the
               extent that this Agreement expressly requires that such action be
               taken, or not be taken, only with the agreement or consent of the
               Majority Banks, the Majority Term Loan Banks, the Majority
               Revolving Credit Banks or all of the Banks.

                         11.04  Rights as a Bank.  With respect to its
               Commitment(s) and the Loans made by it, each Agent (and any
               successor to any Agent) in its capacity as a Bank hereunder or
               under any Basic Document shall have the same rights and powers
               hereunder or thereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the
               same as though it were not acting as an Agent, and the term
               "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
               include each Agent in its individual capacity.  Each Agent (and
               any successor to any Agent) and its affiliates may (without
               having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from,
               lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust
               or other business with any of the Obligors (and any of their
               Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting as an Agent,

                         11.05  Indemnification.  The Banks agree to indemnify
               the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under
               Section 12.03 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of the
               Company under said Section 12.03) ratably in accordance with the

               Commitments are then in effect, the aggregate unused amount of
               such Commitments held by the Banks, for any and all liabilities,

                terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents, provided
                that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the
                extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful 
                misconduct of the party to be indemnified.


                         11.06  Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks.  Each
               Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
               any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
               information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
               analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries and decision to
               enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
               without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on
               such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
               the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
               taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the
               other Basic Documents.  No Agent shall be required to keep itself
               informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligor or
               other party of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents
               or any other document referred to or provided for herein or
               therein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Company or
               any of its Subsidiaries.  Except for notices, reports and other
               documents and information expressly required to be furnished to
               the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent shall
               have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any
               credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
               condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
               (or any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession
               of such Agent or any of its affiliates.

                          11.07  Failure to Act.  Except for action expressly
                required of the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the
                other Basic Documents, the Administrative Agent shall in all
                cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder
                and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its
                satisfaction from the Banks of their indemnification obligations
                under Section 11.05 hereof against any and all liability and
                expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
                continuing to take any such action.

                         11.08  Resignation or Removal of Agents.  Subject to
               the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided
               below, each Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof

               Administrative Agent and any Co-Agent may each be removed at any
               time with or without cause by the Majority Banks.  Upon any such
               resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right
               to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Co-Agent, as the
               case may be, in each case (except during the continuance of a
               Default or an Event of Default) with the consent of the Company
               (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that
               any failure of the Company to object to a proposed successor
               Agent within 15 days after notice of the proposed appointment to
               the Company shall be deemed to constitute consent of the Company
               to such appointment of such proposed successor Agent.  If no
               successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
               Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
               after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
               Majority Banks' removal, as the case may be, and consented to by
               the Company (but only if the consent of the Company to the
               appointment of a successor Agent is required as provided above),
               then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the relevant Banks,
               appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Bank which has an
               office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus
               of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment
               as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
               shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
               powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
               retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
               obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or
               removal hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this Section 11
               shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
               actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
               an Agent.


                          11.09  Collateral Sub-Agents.  Each Bank by its
                execution and delivery of this Agreement agrees that, in the
                event it shall hold any Investments of any Obligor constituting
                part of the Collateral under and as defined in the Security
                Agreement, such Investments shall be held in the name and under
                the control of such Bank, and such Bank shall hold such
                Investments as a collateral sub-agent for the Administrative
                Agent under the Security Agreement.  Each Obligor and Bank, by
                its execution and delivery of this Agreement hereby consents to
                the foregoing. <PAGE>

               Commitments (if then in effect) or Revolving Credit Loans and
               Revolving Credit Commitments (if then in effect), as the case may
               be, is assigned to the assignee.  Upon written notice to the
               Company and the Administrative Agent of an assignment permitted
               hereunder (which notice shall identify the assignee, the amount <PAGE>

               of the assignor's Loan(s) and Commitment(s) assigned in detail
               reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), the
               assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment, the
               obligations, rights and benefits of a Bank hereunder holding the
               Loan(s) and/or Commitment(s) assigned to it (in addition to the
               Loan(s) and Commitment(s) of such series, if any, theretofore
               held by such assignee).  In connection with the assignment by a
               Bank of all or any portion of its Loan(s) and/or Commitment(s) to
               another Person as permitted hereunder, upon request of such Bank
               or such Person, the Company will issue promissory notes in
               substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 or A-2 hereto (as
               appropriate) (as such form may have been modified), each dated
               the date of the Notes originally issued hereunder (or, if
               interest has been paid on such Loan(s), the last day through
               which interest shall have been paid on such Loan(s)) and payable
               to the order of such Person in a principal amount equal to the
               Loan(s) so assigned and otherwise duly completed, and the
               assigning Bank shall make an appropriate notation on the schedule
               attached to the related Note(s) held by it as to the principal
               amount of the Loan(s) and/or Commitment(s) so assigned.

                          (b)  If any assignment made pursuant to paragraph (a),
                above shall be made to any Person that is organized under the
                laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America
                or any State thereof, such Person shall furnish such
                certificates, documents or other evidence to the Company and the
                Administrative Agent as shall be required by Section 5.06 hereof
                to evidence such Person's exemption from U.S. withholding taxes
                with respect to any payments under or pursuant to this Agreement
                because any such payments to such Person are effectively
                connected with the conduct by such Person of a trade or business
                in the United States.

                         (c)  A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more
               other Persons a participation in all or any part of any Loans
               held by it, or in its Commitment(s), provided that each purchaser
               of a participation (a "Participant"), except as otherwise
               provided in Section 4.07(c) or 5.06(e) hereof, shall not have any
               other rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note or any
               other Basic Document (the Participant's rights against such Bank
               in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the
               agreements executed by such Bank in favor of the Participant). 
               Each Bank's right to sell such participations is subject to the
               following conditions:  (i) such Bank's obligations under this <PAGE>




            <PAGE>

               Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment(s), if
               any, hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall
               remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations
               and (iii) the Obligors, the Agents, and the other Banks shall
               continue to be entitled to deal solely and directly with such
               Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under
               this Agreement.  All amounts payable by the Company to any Bank
               under Section 5 hereof in respect of the Loan(s) held by it, and
               its Commitment(s), shall be determined as if such Bank had not
               sold or agreed to sell any participations in such Loan(s) and
               Commitment(s), and as if such Bank were funding and maintaining
               each of such Loan(s) and Commitment(s) in the same way that it is
               funding and maintaining the portion of such Loan and Commitment
               in which no participations have been sold.  In no event shall a
               Bank that sells a participation agree with the Participant to
               take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or under any
               other Basic Document except that such Bank may agree with the
               Participant that it will, on behalf of the Participant, request
               the Company to furnish information to such Bank for delivery to
               the Participant, of the type specified in Section 8.01(m) hereof
               and may further agree with the Participant that it will not,
               without the consent of the Participant, agree to any of the
               following (but only if and to the extent that such agreement
               would have an adverse effect on the Participant):  (i) increase
               or extend the term, or extend the time or waive any requirement
               for the reduction or termination, of such Bank's related
               Commitment(s), (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of
               principal of or interest on the related Loan or Loans or any
               portion of any fee hereunder payable to the Participant,
               (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal or
               (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, or any
               fee hereunder payable to the Participant, to a level below the
               rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive such
               interest or fee.


                          (d)  Anything in this Section 12.06 to the contrary
               notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any
               portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as
               collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
               Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating
               Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment
               shall release the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

                         (e)  A Bank may furnish any information concerning the
               Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank
               from time to time to assignees and participants (including
               prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the
               provisions of Section 12.12(b) hereof.


                         12.07  Survival.  The obligations of the Company under
               Sections 5.01, 5.05, 5.06 and 12.03 hereof and the obligations of
               the Banks under Sections 11.05 and 12.12 hereof shall survive the
               repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. 
               In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to
               be made by a notice of any borrowing, herein or pursuant hereto
               shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and
               no Bank shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any
               Loan hereunder, any Default which may arise by reason of such
               representation or warranty proving to have been false or
               misleading, notwithstanding that such Bank or any of the Agents
               may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such
               representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time
               such extension of credit was made.

               any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall

               hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
               counterpart.

                         12.10  Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  This
               Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in

               ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
               OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

               offered or provided to it (in connection with this Agreement or
               otherwise) by each Bank or by one or more subsidiaries or

                                   AMENDMENT NO. 1


      AMENDMENT NO. 1 dated as of August 12, 1994, between WESTWOOD ONE, INC.,
      a  corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
      State  of  Delaware (the  "Company"); each  of  the Subsidiaries  of the
      Company  identified under  the  caption "SUBSIDIARY  GUARANTORS" on  the
      signature  pages hereto  (individually,  a  "Subsidiary Guarantor"  and,
      collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors');  each of the Banks party  to
      the Credit Agreement  referred to below; BANK OF  MONTREAL and THE FIRST
      NATIONAL  BANK OF BOSTON, as  Co-Agents for said  Banks (individually, a
      "Co-Agent" and, collectively, the  "Co-Agents"); and THE CHASE MANHATTAN
      BANK  (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION), as agent for said Banks (in such capacity,
      together  with  its successors  in  such  capacity, the  "Administrative
      Agent").

      The  Company,  the  Subsidiary  Guarantors, the  lenders  party  thereto
      (individually, a  "Bank" and, collectively, the  "Banks"), the Co-Agents
      and the Administrative Agent are parties to  a Credit Agreement dated as
      of  February 1, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), providing, subject to the
      terms and conditions thereof, for loans to be made by  said Banks to the
      Company  in an  aggregate principal  amount not  exceeding $125,000,000.
      The  Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the  Banks wish to amend the
      Credit  Agreement  in certain  respects,  and  accordingly, the  parties
      hereto hereby agree as follows:

      Section  1.  Definitions.  Except as otherwise defined in this Amendment
      No. 1,  terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined
      therein.

      Section 2.  Amendments.   Upon the execution and delivery hereof  by the
      Company, each of the  Subsidiary Guarantors and the Majority  Banks, but
      effective as of  the date hereof, the second proviso  to Section 3.03 of
      the  Credit  Agreement  shall be  amended  to  read in  its  entirety as
      follows:

            "; provided  that, if the Company so  elects in the related notice
            of  prepayment referred to in  clause (a) above,  all or that part
            (as  specified  by  the Company  in  such  notice)  of any  amount
            required by clause (b) above to  be applied to the installments of
            the Term Loans in  the inverse order of maturity shall  instead be
            applied as follows:

                  (i)    first,  such  prepayment  shall  be  applied  to  the
                  installments  of the Term Loans  scheduled to be  paid on or
                  prior to the later of  (x) August 31, 1995 and (y)  the date
                  180 days after the date of such prepayment (such later date,
                  the "Specified Date") in the direct order of  the maturities
                  thereof;


                                          1

   <PAGE>

                  (ii)  then (after  prepayment in  full of  the pre-Specified
                  Date installments of the  Term Loans pursuant to  clause (i)
                  above),  (x) one-half  of the  remainder of  such prepayment
                  shall be applied to  the post-Specified Date installments in
                  the direct order  of the maturities thereof and (y) one-half
                  of  the remainder of such prepayment shall be applied to the
                  post-Specified  Date installments  in  the inverse  order of
                  their maturities; provided that the aggregate amount applied
                  to the post-Specified  Date installments in  connection with
                  the  instant  prepayment  pursuant  to   clause  (x)  above,
                  together  with   the  aggregate   amount  of  all   previous
                  prepayments of the post-Specified Date installments pursuant
                  to said clause (x), shall not exceed $5,000,000; and

                  (iii) finally,  any amount  not applied pursuant  to clauses
                  (i)  and  (ii)  above  shall  be  applied to  the  remaining
                  installments of the Term  Loans in the inverse order  of the
                  maturities thereof."

      Section  3.    Representations and  Warranties.    The  Company and  the
      Subsidiary Guarantors  represent  and  warrant  to the  Banks  that  the
      representations  and warranties  set forth  in Section  7 of  the Credit
      Agreement are true and complete on the date hereof as if  made on and as
      of such  date (or, if any  such representation or warranty  is expressly
      stated  to have been  made as of  a specific  date, as of  such specific
      date) and as  if each reference  in said Section  7 to "this  Agreement"
      included reference to this Amendment No. 1.

      Section  4.   Miscellaneous.   Except  as  herein provided,  the  Credit
      Agreement shall remain  unchanged and in  full force  and effect.   This
      Amendment No.  1 may be executed  in any number of  counterparts, all of
      which taken  together  shall  constitute one  and  the  same  amendatory
      instrument and  any of the parties hereto may execute this Amendment No.
      1  by  signing  any such  counterpart.  This  Amendment No.  1  shall be
      governed  by, and construed in accordance with,  the law of the State of
      New York.

                                   AMENDMENT NO. 3

      AMENDMENT  NO. 3 dated  as of February  23, 1995,  between WESTWOOD ONE,
      INC., a corporation duly  organized and validly existing under  the laws
      of  the State of Delaware  (the "Company"); each  of the Subsidiaries of
      the Company identified under the  caption "SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS" on the
      signature  pages hereto  (individually,  a "Subsidiary  Guarantor"  and,
      collectively, the  "Subsidiary Guarantors"); each of the  Banks party to
      the  Credit Agreement referred to below;  BANK OF MONTREAL and THE FIRST
      NATIONAL  BANK OF BOSTON, as  Co-Agents for said  Banks (individually, a
      "Co-Agent" and, collectively, the  "Co-Agents"); and THE CHASE MANHATTAN
      BANK  (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION), as agent for said Banks (in such capacity,
      together  with  its successors  in  such  capacity, the  "Administrative
      Agent").

      The  Company,  the  Subsidiary  Guarantors, the  lenders  party  thereto
      (individually, a  "Bank" and, collectively, the  "Banks"), the Co-Agents
      and the Administrative Agent are parties  to a Credit Agreement dated as
      of February  1, 1994  (as heretofore  amended, the  "Credit Agreement"),
      providing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for  loans to be
      made by said  Banks to the Company in an  aggregate principal amount not
      exceeding $125,000,000.

      The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Banks and the Administrative
      Agent  wish to  amend  the Credit  Agreement  in certain  respects  and,
      accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

      Section 1.   Definitions.  Except as otherwise defined in this Amendment
      No. 3, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used  herein as defined
      therein.

      Section  2.  Amendments.  Upon the  execution and delivery hereof by the
      Company, each of the  Subsidiary Guarantors and the Majority  Banks, but
      effective  as of Closing Date, the Credit  Agreement shall be amended as
      follows:

            A.     General.   References  in  the Credit  Agreement (including
      references  to  the  Credit  Agreement  as   amended  hereby)  to  "this
      Agreement" (and indirect references such as hereunder "hereby", "herein"
      and "hereof") shall  be deemed to be references to  the Credit Agreement
      as amended hereby.

            B.    Interest  Rate Protection Agreements.   Section 8.13  of the
      Credit Agreement shall  be amended  by deleting the  phrase "to  protect
      itself against fluctuations in the rates  of interest on the Loans as to
      a notional  principal amount at  least equal  to 50% of  the Loans  then
      outstanding" and substituting the following therefor:

            "to protect itself  against fluctuations in the rates  of interest
            on  the Loans as to a notional  principal amount at least equal to
            40% of the Loans then outstanding".

      Section  3.    Representations and  Warranties.    The  Company and  the
      Subsidiary  Guarantors  represent and  warrant  to  the  Banks that  the
      representations  and warranties  set forth  in Section  7 of  the Credit
      Agreement are true and complete on the date hereof as if made on  and as
      of such  date (or, if any  such representation or warranty  is expressly
      stated to  have been made  as of  a specific date,  as of such  specific
      date) and  as if each  reference in said  Section 7 to  "this Agreement"
      included reference to this Amendment No. 3.

      Section  4.   Miscellaneous.   Except  as  herein provided,  the  Credit
      Agreement shall  remain unchanged and  in full  force and effect.   This
      Amendment No.  3 may be executed  in any number of  counterparts, all of
      which  taken  together shall  constitute  one  and the  same  amendatory
      instrument  and any of the parties hereto may execute this Amendment No.
      3  by  signing any  such  counterpart.  This Amendment  No.  3 shall  be
      governed by, and  construed in accordance with, the law  of the State of
      New York.



      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the  parties hereto have caused this Amendment No. 3
      to  be duly executed  and delivered as  of the day  and year first above

     adjacent  property   by  Owner  or  others,   nor  (iv)  any
     inconvenience  or  annoyance  to  Tenant  or  injury  to  or
     interruption of Tenant's  business by reason  of any of  the
     events  or   occurrences  referred   to  in   the  foregoing
     subdivisions (i) thorough (v), shall constitute an actual or
     constructive  eviction,  in whole  or  in  part, or  entitle
     Tenant to  any abatement or  diminution of rent,  or relieve
     Tenant  from any  of its  obligations under  this Lease,  or
     impose  any  liability upon  Owner,  or its  agents,  or any
     lessor under any ground or underlying lease, other than such
     liability  as may be imposed  upon Owner by  law for Owner's
     negligence or the negligence  of Owner's agents, servants or
     employees in the operation or maintenance of the Building or
     for  the breach  by Owner  of any  express covenant  of this
     Lease on  Owner's part  to  be performed.   Tenant's  taking
     possession  of  the  Demised Premises  shall  be  conclusive
     evidence,  as  against  Tenant,   that,  at  the  time  such
     possession  was  so  taken,  the Demised  Premises  and  the
     Building were in good and satisfactory condition and Owner's
     Initial Construction was substantially completed.  Access to
     the Demised  Premises by  Tenant's contractors as  permitted
     by,  and in  accordance with  the provisions  of Schedule  A
     shall not be deemed to constitute possession  of the Demised
     Premises  for  purposes  of  this Section  8.01,  or  affect
     Owner's obligation to complete Owner's initial construction.

                               ARTICLE 9
                 DESTRUCTION - FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY

     Section 9.01. If  the Demised Premises  shall be damaged  by
     fire  or other  casualty  and if  Tenant  shall give  prompt
     notice to Owner of such  damage, Owner, at Owner's  expense,
     shall  repair  such damage.  However,  Owner  shall have  no
     obligation to  repair any damage to, or to replace, Tenant's
     Personal  Property  or  any  other property  or  effects  of
     Tenant.  Except  as otherwise provided  in Section 9.03,  if
     the entire  Demised Premises shall be  rendered untenantable
     by reason of any such damage, the Fixed Rent shall abate for
     the period  from the  date of such  damage to the  date when

                                  10
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     such damage shall have  been repaired, and if only a part of
     the Demised Premises shall  be so rendered untenantable, the
     Fixed  Rent shad  abate  for such  period in  the proportion
     which  the area  of  the part  of  the Demised  Premises  so
     rendered untenantable bears to the total area of the Demised
     Premises.  However, if, prior to  the date when  all of such
     damage shad  have  been repaired,  any part  of the  Demised
     Premises so  damaged shall be rendered  tenantable and shall
     be  used  or occupied  by Tenant  or  any person  or persons
     Claiming through or  under Tenant, then the  amount by which
     the Fixed  Rent shall  abate shall be  equitably apportioned
     for the period from the date of any such use or occupancy to
     the  date when  all such  damage  shall have  been repaired.
     Owner  agrees that if it is reimbursed by its rent insurance
     policies covering  the Building for a  time period following
     the  date that the  Demised Premises,  or any  part thereof,
     shall  once again  become tenantable and  prior to  the date
     Tenant  shall resume  the  conduct of  its  business in  the
     Demised Premises or such part  thereof, in which time period
     Tenant enters  the Demised Premises to  perform work therein
     to  re-install or  repair its  business equipment  and other
     personal property, any abatement  with respect to such space
     shall extend beyond the  date that such space has  become so
     tenantable by  the number of  days that such  rent insurance
     policy  provides Owner  with  reimbursement  for  Tenant  to
     perform such work.  Owner further agrees to attempt, in good
     faith, to give to Tenant a non-binding notice estimating the
     date  that the  Demised Premises  or the  applicable portion
     thereof shall  become tenantable at least  fifteen (15) days
     prior thereto, without any liability if the Demised Premises
     are  not  rendered tenantable  by  the  date  fixed in  said
     notice.   Tenant hereby  expressly waives the  provisions of
     Section 227  of the New York  Real Property Law,  and of any
     successor law  of  like import  then  in force,  and  Tenant
     agrees that the provisions of this Article shall govern  and
     control  in  lieu  thereof.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing
     provisions  of this  Section,  if, prior  to  or during  the
     Demised  Term,  (i) the  Demised  Premises  shad be  totally
     damaged  or rendered  wholly untenantable  by fire  or other
     casualty, and  if  Owner shall  decide  not to  restore  the
     Demised  Premises, or (ii) the  Building shall be so damaged
     by  fire  or  other   casualty  that,  in  Owner's  opinion,
     substantial alteration, demolition, or reconstruction of the
     Building  shall  be required  (whether  or  not the  Demised
     Premises shall have been damaged  or rendered untenantable),
     then, in any of  such events, Owner, at Owner's  option, may
     give to Tenant, within  ninety (90) days after such  fire or
     other casualty,  a five (5)  days' notice of  termination of
     this  Lease and,  in the  event such  notice is  given, this
     Lease and the Demised Term shall  come to an end and  expire

                                  11

     <PAGE>

     (whether or  not said  term shall  have commenced)  upon the
     expiration of said five (5) days  with the same effect as if
     the  date of  expiration  of said  five  (5) days  were  the
     Expiration Date, the  Fixed Rent shall be apportioned  as of
     such  date and  any prepaid  portion of  Fixed Rent  for any
     period after such date shall be refunded by Owner to Tenant.
     If Owner shall be obligated to repair any damage pursuant to
     this Section, Owner agrees to commence such repairs within a
     reasonable  time after  the  occurrence of  such damage  and
     thereafter   to  complete   such  repairs   with  reasonable
     diligence (without  any obligation, however, to employ labor
     at overtime or other premium pay rates).

     Section  9.02. Owner now has  and shall attempt to maintain,
     throughout  the  Demised  Term, in  Owner's  fire  insurance
     policies covering  the Building,  provisions  to the  effect
     that  such  policies shall  not  be  invalidated should  the
     insured waive, in writing, prior to a loss, any or all right
     of  recovery against  any party  for loss  occurring to  the
     Building.  In  the  event  that  at any  time  Owner's  fire
     insurance carriers shall exact an additional premium for the
     inclusion of  such or  similar provisions, Owner  shall give
     Tenant  notice thereof.  In such event, if Tenant agrees, in
     writing, to reimburse Owner  for such additional premium for
     the remainder of the Demised  Term, Owner shall require  the
     inclusion  of such  or  similar provisions  by Owner's  fire
     insurance carriers.  As long  as such or  similar provisions
     are  included in  Owner's  fire insurance  policies then  in
     force, Owner hereby waives (i) any obligation on the part of
     Tenant to make repairs  to the Demised Premises necessitated
     or occasioned by fire  or other casualty that is  an insured
     risk under  such policies,  and (ii)  any right of  recovery
     against Tenant, any other  permitted occupant of the Demised
     Premises, and  any of  their servants, employees,  agents or
     contractors,  for  any  loss  occasioned by  fire  or  other
     casualty that is an insured risk under such policies. In the
     event that at any time Owner's fire insurance carriers shall
     not  include  such or  similar  provisions  in Owner's  fire
     insurance policies,  the waivers set forth  in the foregoing
     sentence shall,  upon notice  given by Owner  to Tenant,  be
     deemed of no  further force  or effect.   During any  period
     while  the  foregoing waiver  of  right  of recovery  is  in
     effect, Owner  shall  look solely  to the  proceeds of  such
     policies to compensate Owner for any loss occasioned by fire
     or  other  casualty  which is  an  insured  risk  under such
     policies or  under other  insurance policies covering  risks
     against which  a reasonably prudent landlord  in the Borough
     of  Manhattan  would  carry  insurance  for  similar  office
     buildings.

     Section  9.03. Except  as expressly  provided Section  9.02,
     nothing contained in this Lease shall  relieve Tenant of any
     liability to Owner or to its insurance carriers which Tenant
     may  have under  law  or the  provisions  of this  Lease  in
     connection with any  damage to the  Demised Premises or  the
     Building  by fire  or  other  casualty. Notwithstanding  the
     provisions of  Section 9.01,  if any such  damage, occurring
     after  any date when the  waivers set forth  in Section 9.02
     are no  longer in force and  effect, is due to  the fault or
     neglect  of Tenant,  any  person claiming  through or  under
     Tenant,  or   any  of  their  servants,  employees,  agents,
     contractors, visitors  or licensees, then there  shall be no
     abatement of Fixed Rent by reason of such damage.

     Section 9.04.  Tenant acknowledges that it  has been advised
     that  Owner's  insurance  policies  do  not  cover  Tenant's
     Personal  Property or  any other property  of Tenant  in the
     Demised   Premises;  accordingly,   it  shall   be  Tenant's
     obligation to  obtain  and maintain  insurance covering  its
     property  in  the  Demised  Premises  and  loss  of  profits
     including,  but not  limited to,  water damage  coverage and
     business interruption  insurance.  Tenant shall  attempt  to
     obtain   and  maintain,  throughout  the  Demised  Term,  in
     Tenant's fire and other insurance policies covering Tenant's
     Personal  Property  and  other  property of  Tenant  in  the
     Demised  Premises, and  Tenant's  use and  occupancy of  the
     Demised Premises,  and/or Tenant's profits (and  shall cause
     any  other permitted  occupants of  the Demised  Premises to
     attempt  to  obtain  and  maintain,  in  similar  policies),
     provisions to  the effect that  such policies  shall not  be
     invalidated should the insured waive, in writing, prior to a
     loss, any or  all right  of recovery against  any party  for
     loss  occasioned  by fire  or  other  casualty which  is  an
     insured  risk under such policies  in the event  that at any
     time  the insurance  carriers  issuing such  policies  shall
     exact  an additional  premium for  the inclusion of  such or
     similar  provisions, Tenant shall give Owner notice thereof.
     In such event,  if Owner  agrees, in  writing, to  reimburse
     Tenant or  any person claiming  through or under  Tenant, as
     the case  may  be,  for  such  additional  premium  for  the
     remainder  of the  Demised  Term, Tenant  shall require  the
     inclusion of  such or  similar provisions by  such insurance
     carriers. As long as such or similar provisions are included
     in  such insurance  policies  then in  force, Tenant  hereby
     waives (and agrees to cause any other permitted occupants of
     the Demised Premises to execute and deliver to Owner written
     instruments  waiving) any right  of recovery  against Owner,
     any lessors under any ground or underlying leases, any other
     tenants  or occupants  of  the Building,  and any  servants,
     employees, agents  or contractors  of Owner  or of any  such

     lessor, or of any  such other tenants or occupants,  for any
     loss  occasioned  by  fire or  other  casualty  which is  an
     insured risk under such  policies. In the event that  at any
     time  such  insurance  earners  shall not  include  such  or
     similar provisions in any  such insurance policy, the waiver
     set  forth in  the  foregoing sentence  (or  in any  written
     instrument executed  by any other permitted  occupant of the
     Demised  Premises) shall,  upon  notice given  by Tenant  to
     Owner,  be deemed of no further force or effect with respect
     to  any insured risks under  such policy from  and after the
     giving  of  such notice.  During any  period while  any such
     waiver of right  of recovery  is in effect,  Tenant, or  any
     other  permitted occupant  of the  Demised Premises,  as the
     case  may  be, shall  look solely  to  the proceeds  of such
     policies  to  compensate  Tenant  or  such  other  permitted
     occupant for any loss occasioned  by fire or other  casualty
     which  is an insured risk under such policies or under other
     insurance policies covering risks against which a reasonably
     prudent  tenant  with  a  similar  use  in  the  Burough  of
     Manhattan would carry insurance.  (See Article 41)


                                       ARTICLE 10
                                     EMINENT DOMAIN

     Section 10.01. If the whole of the Demised Premises shall be
     acquired  for any  public  or quasi-public  use or  purpose,
     whether by  condemnation or by deed in lieu of condemnation,
     this Lease  and the Demised Term shall end as of the date of
     the vesting  of title with the  same effect as if  said date
     were  the Expiration  Date. If  only a  part of  the Demised
     Premises shall be  so acquired or condemned then,  except as
     otherwise  provided  in this  Section,  this  Lease and  the
     Demised Term  shall continue in  force and effect  but, from
     and  after the date of the vesting  of title, the Fixed Rent
     shall be reduced  in the  proportion which the  area of  the
     part of  the Demised Premixes so acquired or condemned bears
     to the total area of  the Demised Premises immediately prior
     to such acquisition or  condemnation. If only a part  of the
     Real Property  shall be so  acquired or condemned,  then (i)
     whether  or  not  the  Demised Premises  shall  be  affected
     thereby,  Owner,  at Owner's  option,  may  give to  Tenant,
     within sixty  (60) days next  following the date  upon which
     Owner  should have received  notice of  vesting of  title, a
     five (5) days' notice of termination of this Lease, and (ii)
     if  the part of the  Real Property so  acquired or condemned
     shall contain more than ten (10%) per cent of the total area
     of  the   Demised   Premises  immediately   prior  to   such
     acquisition  or  condemnation,  or  if, by  reason  of  such
     acquisition or condemnation, Tenant no longer has reasonable
     means of access to the Demised Premises, Tenant, at Tenant's

                                  14
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     option,  may give  to  Owner, within  sixty  (60) days  next
     following  the date  upon which  Tenant shall  have received
     notice  of  vesting of  title, a  five  (5) days'  notice of
     termination  of this Lease. In  the event any  such five (5)
     days notice  of termination  is given,  by Owner or  Tenant,
     this Lease  and the  Demised Term shall  come to an  end and
     expire  upon the expiration of  said five (5)  days with the
     same effect as  if the date of  expiration of said five  (5)
     days  were the  Expiration Date.  If a  part of  the Demised
     Premises shall  be so acquired  or condemned and  this Lease
     and the Demised Term shall not be terminated pursuant to the
     foregoing provisions  of  this Section,  Owner,  at  Owner's
     expense, shall restore that part of the Demised Premises not
     so acquired or  condemned to a self-contained rental unit in
     the event of any  termination of this lease and  the Demised
     Term pursuant to the provisions  of this Section, the  Fixed
     Rent shall be 
     apportioned  as of  the  date of  such  termination and  any
     prepaid portion of Fixed Rent for any period after such date
     shall be refunded by Owner to Tenant.

     Section 10.02.  In  the event  of  any such  acquisition  or
     condemnation  of all or any part of the Real Property, Owner
     shall be entitled to  receive the entire award for  any such
     acquisition  or  condemnation,  Tenant shall  have  no claim
     against Owner  or the condemning authority for  the value of
     any unexpired  portion of the Demised Term and Tenant hereby
     expressly assigns to  Owner all of its  right in and  to any
     such  award.  Nothing contained  in  this  Section shall  be
     deemed  to  prevent  Tenant  from  making  a  claim  in  any
     condemnation  proceedings  for the  value  of  any items  of
     Tenant's Personal Property which are compensable, in law, as
     trade fixtures.


                              ARTICLE 11
                       ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

     Section 11.01.  Tenant, for itself, its heirs, distributees,
     executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors
     and assigns,  covenants that,  without the prior  consent of
     Owner in each instance,  it shall not (i) assign  whether by
     merger, consolidation or otherwise, mortgage or encumber its
     interest in this lease, in whole or in part, or (ii) sublet,
     or  permit the  subletting of,  the Demised Premises  or any
     part thereof  or (iii)  permit the  Demised Premises  or any
     part thereof to be occupied, or used for desk space, mailing
     privileges or  otherwise, by  any person other  than Tenant.
     Subject  to  the  provisions  of Section  42.02,  the  sale,
     pledge,  transfer  or other  alienation  of (a)  any  of the

                                  15

     <PAGE>

     issued and outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant
     (unless  such  stock  is  publicly traded  on  a  recognized
     security  exchange  or over-the-counter  market) or  (b) any
     interest  in   any  partnership  or  joint  venture  Tenant,
     however,  accomplished, and whether  in a single transaction
     or in a  series of related or  unrelated transactions, shall
     be  deemed for the purposes of this Section as an assignment
     of this Lease which shall require the prior consent of Owner
     in each instance.

     Section  11.02.    If Tenant's  interest  in  this Lease  is
     assigned,  whether or not in violation  of the provisions of
     this Article, Owner  may collect rent from the  assignee; if
     the Demised Premises or  any part thereof are sublet  to, or
     occupied  by, or  used  by, any  person  other than  Tenant,
     whether  or not in  violation of this  Article, Owner, after
     default by Tenant  under this Lease,  may collect rent  from
     the subtenant, user or occupant. In either case, Owner shall
     apply the net amount collected to the rents reserved in this
     Lease,   but  neither   any  such   assignment,  subletting,
     occupancy,  or use,  whether with  or without  Owner's prior
     consented nor  any such collection or  application, shall be
     deemed a waiver of  any term, covenant or condition  of this
     Lease  or   the  acceptance  by  Owner   of  such  assignee,
     subtenant, occupant or user as  tenant The consent by  Owner
     to any  assignment, subletting,  occupancy or use  shall not
     relieve  Tenant from  its obligation  to obtain  the express
     prior   consent  of   Owner   to  any   further  assignment,
     subletting, occupancy or use. The listing  of any name other
     than that of Tenant  on any door of the Demised  Premises or
     on  any directory  or in  any elevator  in the  Building, or
     otherwise,  shall not operate to vest in the person so named
     any  right or  interest  in this  Lease  or in  the  Demised
     Premises  or the Building,  or be  deemed to  constitute, or
     serve  as a  substitute  for,  any  prior consent  of  Owner
     required under this Article,  and it is understood that  any
     such listing shall constitute  a privilege extended by Owner
     which  shall  be  revocable at  Owner's  will  by notice  to
     Tenant.  Tenant agrees  to pay  to Owner  reasonable counsel
     fees  incurred  by Owner  in  connection  with any  proposed
     assignment  of  Tenant's  interest  in  this  Lease  or  any
     proposed  subletting of  the  Demised Premises  or any  part
     thereof. Neither any assignment of Tenant's interest in this
     Lease nor any  subletting, occupancy or  use of the  Demised
     Premises  or  any  part thereof  by  any  person  other than
     Tenant,  nor any collection of rent by Owner from any person
     other  than  Tenant as  provided  in this  Section,  nor any
     application of  any such rent  as provided  in this  Section
     shall,  in   any  circumstances,  relieve   Tenant  of   its
     obligation fully to observe and perform the terms, covenants

                                  16

     <PAGE>

     and conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed
     and performed.

     Section 11.03. As long as Tenant is not in default under any
     of  the  terms, covenants  or  conditions of  this  Lease on
     Tenant's  part  to  be  observed  or  performed  beyond  the
     applicable grace period provided in the Lease  for curing of
     such default.  Owner agrees not to unreasonably withhold  or
     delay Owner's  prior consent to sublettings by Tenant of all
     or parts of  the Demised Premises to not  more than four (4)
     subtenants.  Each  such  subletting shall  be  for undivided
     occupancy by the subtenant (ie. with no further right on the
     part of such subtenant to further sublet space) of that part
     of  the  Demised  Premises  affected thereby,  for  the  use
     permitted in this Lease, and at no time shall there  be more
     than  four (4)  occupants, including  Tenant in  the Demised
     Premises.   Without Owner's prior consent,  Tenant shall not
     (a) negotiate or enter  into a proposed subletting with  any
     tenant, subtenant or  occupant of any space  in the Building
     or (b) publicly advertise  the Demised Premises or  any part
     thereof  for subletting at a rental lower than the higher of
     (i) the Fixed Rent,  then in effect, allocable to  the space
     sought to be sublet or (ii) the rental at which the Owner is
     then offering to  rent comparable space in  the Building. At
     least  thirty (30)  days prior  to any  proposed subletting,
     Tenant shall submit to Owner a statement containing the name
     and  address of  the  proposed  subtenant  and  all  of  the
     principal terms  and conditions of  the proposed  subletting
     including, but not limited to, the proposed commencement and
     expiration dates  of the  term thereof. Unless  the proposed
     sublet area shall constitute an entire floor or floors, such
     statement shall  be accompanied by a  floor plan delineating
     the proposed sublet area.  Owner may, however, withhold such
     consent if, in Owner's reasonable judgment, the occupancy of
     the proposed subtenant will tend to impair the character  or
     dignity of  the Building  or impose any  additional material
     burden upon Owner in the operation of the Building or if the
     owner  shall have  any  other reasonable  objections to  the
     proposed subletting.   In the  event of any  dispute between
     Owner and Tenant as to the reasonableness of Owner's failure
     or refusal to  consent to any subletting, such dispute shall
     be  submitted   to  arbitration,  in   accordance  with  the
     provisions  of Article  36.   Notwithstanding the  foregoing

     Premises  (said portion  is referred  to as  the "Eliminated
     Space")  from  the   Demised  Premises  during   the  period
     (referred to as the  "Elimination Periods) commencing on the
     date  (referred to  as the  "Elimination  Date") immediately
     prior to the proposed  commencement date of the term  of the
     proposed  subletting, as  set forth  in such  statement, and
     ending  on the proposed expiration  date of the  term of the
     proposed subletting, as set forth in  such statement, and in

     Elimination   Period;  (ii)   Tenant  shall   surrender  the
     Eliminated Space  to Owner  on or  prior to  the Elimination
     Date in the same  manner as if said Date were the Expiration

     reasonably  exercised,   to  make  the  Eliminated  Space  a
     self-contained rental unit with access through  corridors to
     the elevators and core toilets serving the Eliminated Space,
     and if the  Demised Premises shall contain  any core toilets
     or  any corridors  (including any  corridors proposed  to be
     constructed  by Owner  pursuant to this  subdivision [iii]),
     providing access from the Eliminated Space to the core area,

     the name and location of such tenant or other occupant; (iv)
     during the  Elimination Period, the Fixed  Rent and Tenant's
     Proportionate Share  (as defined in Article  23), shall each
     be   reduced  in  the  proportion  which  the  area  of  the
     Eliminated  Space bears  to the  total area  of  the Demised
     Premises   immediately  prior   to   the  Elimination   Date
     (including an equitable portion of the area of any corridors
     referred to in subdivision (iii) of this sentence as part of
     the  area  of  the  Eliminated  Space  for  the  purpose  of
     computing  such  reduction),  and  in  the  event  that  the
     Eliminated  Space shall  be  the  entire  Demised  Premises,
     during the  Elimination Period, Tenant shall  have no rights
     with  respect to  the Demised  Premises nor  any obligations
     with  respect to  the Demised  Premises, including,  but not
     limited  to,  any  obligations  to pay  Fixed  Rent  or  any
     increases therein  or any  additional rent, and  any prepaid
     portion of  Fixed Rent for any period  after the Elimination
     Date allocable  to the Eliminated Space shall be refunded by
     Owner   to  Tenant;   (v)  there   shall  be   an  equitable
     apportionment of any increase in the  Fixed Rent pursuant to
     Article  23 for the Escalation Year  and Tax Escalation Year
     (as  defined in Article  23) in which  said Elimination Date
     shall occur, (vi)  if the Elimination Period shall end prior
     to the  Expiration Date, the  Eliminated Space, in  its then
     existing condition (provided such condition shall enable the
     Eliminated Space  to be  used reasonably for  general office
     purposes), shall be deemed restored to and once again a part
     of the  Demised Premises during  the period (referred  to as
     the  "Restoration  Period")  commencing  on  the  date  next
     following the  expiration  of  the  Elimination  Period  and
     ending on the Expiration  Date, (vii) during the Restoration
     Period, if  any, the  Fixed Rent and  Tenant's Proportionate
     Share, shall each  be increased in the  proportion which the
     area of the Eliminated  Space bears to the total area of the
     Demised Premises  immediately prior to  the commencement  of
     the Restoration  Period (including  an equitable  portion of
     the area of  any corridors referred to  in subdivision (iii)
     of this  sentence as a  part of the  area of the  Eliminated
     Space for the purpose of computing such increase) and in the
     event  that the Eliminated Space shall be the entire Demised
     Premises,  during  the   Restoration  Period,  the   Demised
     Premises,  in its  then  existing condition  (provided  such
     condition  shall  enable the  Eliminated  Space  to be  used
     reasonably for  general office  purposes),  shall be  deemed
     restored  to Tenant  and Tenant  shall have all  rights with
     respect  to the Demised Premises which are set forth in this
     Lease  and  all  obligations  with respect  to  the  Demised
     Premises  which are set forth in  this Lease, including, but
     not limited  to, the  obligations for the  payment of  Fixed
     Rent  and any increases therein  and any additional rent (as

     they would have been adjusted if Tenant occupied the Demised
     Premises  during the  Elimination Period); and  (viii) there
     shall  be an equitable apportionment of  any increase in the
     Fixed  Rent pursuant to  Article 23 for  the Escalation Year
     and Tax Escalation  Year in which the Restoration Period, if
     any, shall commence; however, notwithstanding the foregoing,
     Owner and Tenant acknowledge the possibility that all or any
     of  the tenants or occupants of the Eliminated Space may not
     have vacated  and surrendered  all or  any  portions of  the
     Eliminated  Space  to  Owner  by  the  commencement  of  the
     Restoration Period; accordingly, notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary  contained in the foregoing  provisions of this
     Section  (x)  the  Restoration   Period  applicable  to  the
     Eliminated Space  shall commence on the  commencement of the
     Restoration Period with expect to those portions, if any, of
     the Eliminated Space which are vacant on the commencement of
     the Restoration  Period and with respect  to those portions,
     if any, of the Eliminated Space  which are not vacant on the
     commencement of  the  Restoration Period  on the  respective
     later  date  or  dates  upon  which  such  portions  of  the
     Eliminated  Space become  vacant and  Owner gives  notice to
     Tenant of such vacancy and the Expiration Date
     shall not be  affected thereby, the  increases in the  Fixed
     Rent  and  Tenant's Proportionate  Share shall  be equitably
     adjusted to reflect the fact that all or any portions of the
     Eliminated  Space have  not been restored  to Tenant  on the
     commencement of  the Restoration Period but  are restored to
     Tenant and included back  in the Demised Premises on  a date
     or dates  after the  commencement of the  Restoration Period
     and  (y) except as set  forth in this  sentence, neither the
     validity of this  Lease nor the obligations of  Tenant under
     this  Lease shall be affected  thereby and (z) Tenant waives
     any right to rescind  this Lease and to recover  any damages
     which  may  result  from  the failure  of  Owner  to deliver
     possession of all or  any portion of the Estimated  Space on
     the commencement  of the Restoration Period.  At the request
     of Owner, Tenant shall execute  and deliver an instrument or
     instruments in form satisfactory to Owner, setting forth any
     modifications  to this  Lease contemplated  in  or resulting
     from  the  operation of  the  foregoing  provisions of  this
     Section;  however, neither  Owner's failure  to request  any
     such instrument  nor Tenant's failure to  execute or deliver
     any  such  instrument  shall   vitiate  the  effect  of  the
     foregoing provisions  of this Section. The  failure by Owner
     to exercise  any option under  this Section with  respect to
     any subletting shall not  be deemed a waiver of  such option
     with  respect  to any  extension of  such subletting  or any
     subsequent subletting  of the  premises affected  thereby or
     any  other portion of the Demised Premises. Owner and Tenant
     agree  that (xx)  any increase  in the  rental value  of the

     pursuant to the provisions of this Lease, as such Fixed Rent
     may  be  increased  from  time  to  time  pursuant   to  the
     provisions of this Lease, and (yy) any consideration paid to
     Tenant or any  subtenant or other person claiming through or
     under  Tenant  in  connection  with  an  assignment  of  the
     Tenant's interest  in  this Lease  or  the interest  of  any
     subtenant or  other person claiming through  or under Tenant
     under any sublease whether  or not such assignment shall  be
     effected with  court approval in  a proceeding of  the types
     described  in subsection 16.01 (c) or (d), or in any similar
     proceeding,  or otherwise,  shall accrue  to the  benefit of
     Owner and not to the benefit  of Tenant, or of any subtenant
     or  other person claiming through or under Tenant, or of the
     creditors of Tenant or of any such subtenant or other person
     claiming through  or under Tenant Accordingly,  it is agreed
     that  if Owner shall fail  to exercise its  option to sooner
     terminate  this   Lease  in  connection  with  any  proposed
     subletting  by Tenant  of all  or substantially  all of  the
     Demised  Premises, or  its option  to eliminate  the Demised
     Premises  or  to eliminate  from  the  Demised Premises  any
     portion thereof  in connection with any  proposed subletting
     by  Tenant of  the entire  Demised Premises  or  any portion
     thereof,  or  if  any  subtenant or  other  person  claiming
     through or under Tenant  shall sublet all or any  portion of
     the  Demised Premises, Tenant shall pay to Owner a sum equal
     to  any  Subletting  Profit,  as such  term  is  hereinafter
     defined. All rentals and other sums payable by any subtenant
     to  Tenant  or to  any  subtenant or  other  person claiming
     through  or   under  Tenant  in  connection   with  (i)  any
     subletting of the  entire Demised Premises in excess  of the
     Fixed Rent then payable by Tenant to Owner under this Lease,
     or  (ii) any subletting of a portion of the Demised Premises
     in  excess of that proportion  of the fixed  Rent payable by
     Tenant  to  Owner under  this Lease  which  the area  of the
     portion of the Demised Premises so Sublet bears to the total
     area  of  the Demised  Premises,  are  referred to,  in  the
     aggregate   as   "Subletting  Profit";   in   computing  any
     Subletting Profit  there shall  be deducted first  brokerage
     commission, reasonable legal and other professional fees and
     Alteration costs (which Alteration costs shall not exceed an
     amount equal  to Twenty  Five ($25.00) Dollars  per rentable
     sq.  ft.  of  the  sublet  space  in  question),  reasonable

     subtenant or other person  claiming through or under Tenant,
     shall assign or have  assigned its interest as  Tenant under
     this  Lease or its interest as  subtenant under any sublease
     as the case may be, whether or not such assignment  shall be
     effected with court  approval in a  projecting of the  types
     described in subsections 16.01 (c) or (d), or in any similar
     proceeding,  or otherwise Tenant  shall pay  to Owner  a sum
     equal to  any consideration paid to Tenant  or any subtenant
     or other  person claiming through  or under Tenant  for such
     assignment. All  sums payable  hereunder by Tenant  shall be
     paid to Owner as additional rent  immediately upon such sums
     being  paid (after the  permitted deductions from Subletting
     Profits  referred to  in  the preceding  provisions of  this
     section have  first  been  recouped) to  Tenant  or  to  any
     subtenant or  other person claiming through  or under Tenant
     and, if requested by Owner, Tenant shall promptly enter into
     a written  agreement with Owner setting forth  the amount of
     such sums  to be  paid to  Owner,  however, neither  Owner's
     failure  to  request the  execution  of  such agreement  nor
     Tenant's failure to execute such agreement shall vitiate the
     provisions  of  this  Section.  For  the  purposes  of  this
     Section, a trustee, receiver  or other representative of the
     Tenant's  or any  subtenant's  estate under  any federal  or
     state  bankruptcy  act shall  be  deemed  a person  claiming
     through  or under Tenant.   Neither  Owner's consent  to any
     subletting nor  anything contained in this  Section shall be
     deemed to  grant to any  subtenant or other  person claiming
     through  or  under Tenant  the right  to  sublet all  or any
     portion of the Demised  Premises or to permit  the occupancy
     of all or  any portion  of the Demised  Premises by  others.
     Neither  any subtenant referred  to in this  Section nor its
     heirs,   distributes    executors,   administrators,   legal
     representatives,  successors nor  assigns without  the prior
     consent of Owner in each instance, shall (i) assign, whether
     by merger, consolidation or otherwise, mortgage or  encumber
     its interest in any sublease,  in whole or in part, or  (ii)
     sublet,  or  permit the  subletting  of,  that part  of  the
     Demised  Premises affected  by such  subletting or  any part
     thereof, or  (ii) permit such  part of the  Demised Premises
     affected  by  such subletting  or  any  part  thereof to  be
     occupied  or  used for  desk  space,  mailing privileges  or
     otherwise, by any  person other than such  subtenant and any
     sublease shall  provide that any violation  of the foregoing
     provisions  of this  sentence shall be  an event  of default
     thereunder. The sale,  pledge, transfer or other  alienation

     transactions,  shall  be deemed  for  the  purposes of  this
     Section  as  an  assignment  of such  sublease  which  shall
     require  the prior consent of Owner in each instance and any
     sublease shall so provide.

     Section 11.04.  In the event  that, at any time after Tenant
     may  have assigned  Tenant's  interest in  this Lease,  this
     Lease shall  be disaffirmed or rejected in any proceeding of
     the  types described in subsections 16.01 (c) and (d), or in
     any similar proceeding,  or in the  event of termination  of
     this Lease by reason  of any such proceeding or by reason of
     lapse of time following notice of termination given pursuant
     to Section 16.01 based upon any of the Events of Default set
     forth  in said  subsections, Tenant,  upon request  of Owner
     given  within  thirty  (30)  days next  following  any  such
     disaffirmance, rejection or  termination (and actual  notice
     thereof to Owner in  the event of a disaimance  or rejection
     or in the event of termination other  than by act of Owner),
     shall (i) pay to  Owner all Fixed Rents additional  rent and
     other charges due and  owing by the assignee to  Owner under
     this  Lease to and including the date of such disaffirmance,
     rejection or termination, and (ii) as "tenant", enter into a
     new  lease with  Owner of  the Demised  Premises for  a term

     unless sooner terminated as  in such lease provided, at  the
     same  Fixed Rent  and then  executory terrns,  covenants and
     conditions as are contained  in this Lease, except  that (a)
     Tenant's rights under the  new lease shad be subject  to the
     pouessory  rights of the  assignee under this  lease and the
     posseuory right of any person claiming through or under such
     assignee or by virtue of any  statute or of any order of any
     court,  and (b) such  new lease  shall require  all defaults
     existing under this  Lease to  be cured by  Tenant with  due
     diligence, and  (c) such new  lease shall require  Tenant to
     pay all increases in  the Fixed Rent reserved in  this Lease
     which, had this lease  not been so disaffirmed,  rejected or
     terminated,  would have  accrued  under  the  provisions  of
     Article  23   of  this   lease  after  the   date  of   such
     disaffirmance, rejection or termination  with respect to any
     period prior thereto.  in the event Tenant  shall default in
     its obligation to enter into said new lease for a period  of
     ten (10) days next following Owner's request therefor, then,
     in  addition to all other  rights and remedies  by reason of
     such default, either at  law or in equity, Owner  shall have
     the same rights and remedies against Tenant as if Tenant had
     entered  into  such  new  lease  and  such  new   lease  had
     thereafter  been  terminated  as  at  the  commencement date
     thereof by  reason of  Tenant's default  thereunder. Nothing

     facilities,  and the use thereof,  as well as access thereto
     through the Demised Premises  for the purposes of operation,

     Owner. Owner also reserves  the right at any time  to change
     the  arrangement  or  location  of  entrances,  passageways,
     doors,  doorways, corridors, elevators,  stairs, toilets and

     does  not  permanently  ant unseasonably  obstruct  Tenant's
     access to  the Demised  Premises. Nothing contained  in this
     Article shall impose any  obligation upon Owner with respect
     to the  operation, maintenance, alteration or  repair of the
     Demised Premises or the Building.

     Section  13.03. Owner and its agents shall have the right to

     any representative of the fire, police, building, sanitation
     or  other   department  of   the  City,  State   or  Federal
     Governments. Neither anything contained in this Section, nor
     any  action  taken by  Owner  under this  Section,  shall be
     deemed to  constitute recognition  by Owner that  any person
     other than Tenant has any right or interest in this Lease or
     the Demised Premises.

     Section 13.04. The exercise by Owner or its agents or by the
     lessor under any ground or underlying lease or the holder of
     any mortgage affecting the Building or the Real  Property of
     any right reserved  in this Article shall not  constitute an
     actual or  constructive eviction,  in whole  or in part,  or
     entitle Tenant  to any abatement  or diminution of  rent, or
     relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease,
     or impose any liability  upon Owner, or its agents,  or upon
     any  lessor under any ground or underlying lease or upon the

                              VAULT SPACE

     Section  14.01.  The Demised  Premises  do  not contain  any
     vaults, vault space or other space outside the boundaries of
     the Real  Property,  notwithstanding anything  contained  in
     this Lease or  indicated on any  sketch, blueprint or  plan.
     Owner  makes no  representation  as to  the location  of the
     boundaries  of the Real Property. All vaults and vault space
     and  all  other space  outside  the boundaries  of  the Real
     Property  which Tenant may be permitted to use or occupy are
     to be used or occupied under a revocable license, and if any
     such license shall  be revolted,  or if the  amount of  such
     space shall  be diminished or required by any Federal, State
     or  Municipal Authority  or by  any public  utility company,
     such  revocation,  diminution   or  requisition  shall   not
     constitute an  actual or constructive eviction,  in whole or
     in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of
     rent, or relieve  Tenant from any  of its obligations  under
     this Lease, or impose any liability upon Owner. Any fee, tax
     or charge imposed by any governmental authority for any such
     vault, vault space when Tenant uses such vault, vault  space
     or other space shall be paid by Tenant.

     Section 15.01. Tenant will not at any time use or occupy, or
     permit  the use  or occupancy  of, the  Demised Premises  in
     violation of  any Certificate(s)  of Occupancy  covering the
     Demised Premises. Owner agrees that a temporary or permanent
     Certificate(s)  of Occupancy  covering the  Demised Premises
     will be  in force  on the  Commencement Date  permitting the
     Demised Premises  to be used as  "offices". However, neither
     such  agreement, nor any other provision  of this Lease, nor
     any act  or omission  of Owner, its  agents or  contractors,
     shall be  deemed to constitute a  representation or warranty

     that  the  Demised Premises  or  any  part thereof,  may  be

          (a)  if Tenant shall default in the payment when due of

     Rent  or in the payment when due of any additional rent, and
     such default shall continue  for a period of seven  (7) days
     after notice by Owner to Tenant of such default; or

          (b)  if  Tenant  shall  default in  the  observance  or
     performance of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease
     on Tenant's part to be observed or performed (other than the

     Fixed Rent  and additional  rent) and  Tenant shall  fail to
     remedy  such default within  ten (10)  days after  notice by
     Owner to Tenant  of such default,  or if such default  is of
     such a nature that  it cannot be completely remedied  within
     said  period of ten (10) days and Tenant shall not commence,
     promptly  after   receipt  of  such  notice   or  shall  not
     thereafter  diligently prosecute  to  completion, all  steps
     necessary to remedy such default; or

          (c)  if  Tenant  shall  file a  voluntary  petition  in

     applicable  federal, state  or  other statute  or law,  such
     proceeding  shall not  have  been dismissed,  or if,  within
     ninety  (90)  days after  the  appointment  of any  trustee,

     performance of  any term, covenant or  condition on Tenant's

     Owner  of  space in  the  Building  and such  default  shall
     continue  beyond any grace  period set  forth in  such other
     lease for the remedying of such default; or
           
          (f)  if the  Demised Premises  shall become  vacant for
     more  than  one  hundred   eighty  (180)  consecutive  days,
     deserted or abandoned; or

          (g) if  Tenant's interest  in this Lease  shall devolve
     upon or pass  to any person, whether by operation  of law or
     otherwise, except as expressly  permitted under Article  11,
     then,  upon the occurrence, at  any time prior  to or during
     the Demised Term, of any one or more such Events of Default,
     Owner, at any  time thereafter, at Owner's  option, may give
     to Tenant a  five (5)  days' notice of  termination of  this
     Lease and, in the event such notice is given, this Lease and
     the Demised Term shall come to an end and expire (whether or
     not  said term shall have  commenced) upon the expiration of
     said five  (5) days with the  same effect as if  the date of
     expiration of said five (5)  days were the Expiration  Date,

     under  this Lease shall  have been guaranteed  by any person

     shall  have been  assigned,  the word  "Tenant"  as used  in
     subsections (c) and (d) of Section 16.01, shall be deemed to
     mean any one or more of the persons primarily or secondarily
     liable  for  Tenant's obligations  under  this  Lease.   Any
     monies  received by Owner from or on behalf of Tenant during
     the pendency of any  proceeding of the types referred  to in
     mid  subsections  (c)  and  (d)  shall  be  deemed  paid  as
     compensation  for  the use  and  occupation  of the  Demised
     Premises  and the  acceptance  of any  such compensation  by

                                  28

     Owner shall not be  deemed an acceptance of rent or a waiver
     on the part of Owner of any rights under Section 16.01.

                               REMEDIES

     Section 17.01.  If Tenant shall default in  the payment when
     due of any installment of Fixed Rent or in  the payment when
     due of any increase in the Fixed Rent or any additional rent
     and  such default shall continue  for a period  of seven (7)
     days after notice by  Owner to Tenant of such default, or if
     this Lease and the Demised Term  shall expire and come to an
     end as provided in Article 16:

          (a) Owner and its  agents and servants may immediately,
     or at  any time  after such default  or after the  date upon
     which  this Lease and the Demised Term shall expire and come
     to an end, reenter the Demised Premises or any part thereof,
     without  notice, either  by  summary proceedings  or by  any
     other  applicable  action  or  proceeding, or  by  force  or
     otherwise  (without being liable  to indictment, prosecution
     or damages therefor), and may repossess the Demised Premises
     and dispossess Tenant and any other persons from the Demised
     Premises  and  remove  any  and all  of  their  property and
     effects from the Demised Premises; and

          (b) Owner,  at Owner's option,  may relet the  whole or
     any  part or  parts of  the Demised  Premises, from  time to
     time,  either in  the name  of Owner  or otherwise,  to such
     tenant  or tenants, for such term or terms ending before, on
     or  after the Expiration Date, at such rental or rentals and
     upon  such other conditions,  which may  include concessions
     and free rent periods, as Owner, in its sole discretion, may
     determine.  Owner  shall have  no  obligation  to relet  the
     Demised Premises or any  part thereof and shall in  no event
     be  liable  for refusal  or  failure  to relet  the  Demised
     Premises or any part  thereof, or, in the event  of any such
     reletting, for  refusal or failure  to collect any  rent due
     upon  any such  reletting, and  no  such refusal  or failure
     shall operate to  relieve Tenant of any liability under this
     Lease or otherwise  to affect any such  liability; Owner, at
     Owner's   option,  may   make  such   repairs  replacements,
     alterations, additions, improvements, decorations  and other
     physical changes in and to the Demised Premises as Owner, in
     its  sole discretion,  considers advisable  or  necessary in
     connection  with any such  reletting or  proposed reletting,
     without relieving  Tenant of any liability  under this Lease
     or otherwise affecting any such liability.

     Section  17.02.  Tenant hereby  waives  the  service of  any
     notice  of  intention  to  re-enter or  to  institute  legal
     proceedings  to that end which may  otherwise be required to
     be given under any present or future law. Tenant, on its own
     behalf  and on  behalf of  all persons  claiming  through or
     under Tenant,  including all creditors, does  further hereby
     waive any and all  rights which Tenant and all  such persons
     might otherwise  have under  any  present or  future law  to
     redeem the Demised Premises, or to re-enter or repossess the
     Demised Premises, or to restore the operation of this Lease,
     after (i) Tenant shall have been  dispossessed by a judgment
     or by warrant of any court or judge, or (ii) any re-entry by
     Owners  or (iii) any expiration or termination of this Lease
     and  the Demised  Term,  whether such  dispossess, re-entry,
     expiration or  termination shall be  by operation of  law or
     pursuant  to  the  provisions   of  this  Lease.  The  words
     "re-enter",  "re-entry"  and "re-entered"  as  used  in this
     Lease  shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  restricted  to  their
     technical  legal  meanings. In  the  event  of a  breach  or
     threatened breach by Tenant, or any persons claiming through
     or  under Tenant, of any term, covenant or condition of this
     Lease  on Tenant's part  to be observed  or performed, Owner
     shall have the right  to enjoin such breach and the right to
     invoke any other remedy allowed by law or in equity as if re
     entry, summary proceedings and  other special remedies  were
     not provided in  this Lease  for such breach.  The right  to
     invoice the  remedies hereinbefore  set forth  is cumulative
     and shall not preclude Owner  from invoking any other remedy
     allowed by law or in equity.

                                DAMAGE

     Section 18.01.  If this  Lease  and the  Demised Term  shall
     expire and come  to an end as provided in  Article 16, or by
     or  under any  summary  proceeding or  any  other action  or
     proceeding, or if Owner  shall re-enter the Demised Premises
     as  provided in  Article  17, or  by  or under  any  summary
     proceeding or any  other action or proceeding, then,  in any
     of said events:

          (a)  Tenant   shall  pay  to  Owner   all  Fixed  Rent,
     additional rent  and other changes payable  under this Lease
     by Tenant to Owner to the date upon which this Lease and the
     Demised Term shall have expired and come to an end or to the
     date of reentry upon  the Demised Premises by Owner,  as the
     case may be; and

          (b)  Tenant shall also be  liable for and  shall pay to

                                  30

     <PAGE>

     Owner,   as  damages,   any  deficiency   (referred  to   as
     "Deficiency") between the Fixed  Rent reserved in this Lease
     for the  period which  otherwise would have  constituted the
     unexpired portion of the Demised Term and the net amount, if
     any,  of  rents  collected  under  any   reletting  effected
     pursuant  to the provisions of Section 17.01 for any part of
     such period (first deducting  from the rents collected under
     any  such reletting  all of  Owner's expenses  in connection
     with the termination of  this Lease or Owner's reentry  upon
     the Demised Premises and  with such reletting including, but
     not   limited  to,   all   repossession   costs,   brokerage
     commissions,  legal  expenses,  attorney's fees,  alteration
     costs and  other expenses of preparing  the Demised Premises
     for such reletting).  Any such Deficiency  shall be paid  in
     monthly installments by Tenant on the days specified in this
     Lease for payment of installments of Fixed Rent, Owner shall
     be entitled  to recover from Tenant  each monthly Deficiency
     as the same  shall arise, and no suit to  collect the amount
     of  the Deficiency  for  any month  shall prejudice  Owner's
     right to collect the Deficiency for  any subsequent month by
     a  similar  proceeding  Solely  for  the  purposes  of  this
     subsection (b), the  term "Fixed Rent" shall mean  the Fixed
     Rent in effect immediately prior to the date upon which this
     Lease and the Demised Term shall have expired and come to an
     end,  or the date of  re-entry upon the  Demised Premises by
     Owner, as  the case may be, adjusted,  from time to time, to
     reflect any increases which would have been payable pursuant
     to  any of the provisions  of this Lease  including, but not
     limited  to, the provisions of  Article 23 of  this Lease if
     the term hereof had not been terminated; and

          (c)  At  any time  after  the Demised  Term  shall have
     expired  and come to an  end or Owner  shall have re-entered
     upon  the Demised Premises, as  the case may  be, whether or
     not Owner  shall have collected any  monthly Deficiencies as
     aforesaid, Owner  shall be entitled to  recover from Tenant,
     and  Tenant  shall  pay to  Owner,  on  demand,  as and  for
     liquidated  and  agreed final  damages, a  sum equal  to the
     amount  by which the Fixed  Rent reserved in  this Lease for
     the  period  which  otherwise  would  have  constituted  the
     unexpired portion of  the Demised Term exceeds the then fair
     and reasonable rental value of  the Demised Premises for the
     same period, both discounted to present worth at the rate of
     eight (8%) per  cent per annum.  If, before presentation  of
     proof of such liquidated damages to any court, commission or
     tribunal, the  Demised Premises, or any  part thereof, shall
     have  been  relet by  Owner for  the period  which otherwise
     would have constituted the  unexpired portion of the Demised
     Term,  or any part thereof, the amount of rent reserved upon
     such  reletting shall be deemed, prima facie, to be the fair

                                  31
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the
     Demised Premises so relet during the  term of the reletting.
     Solely for  the purposes of  this subsection  (c), the  term
     "Fixed Rent" shall mean the Fixed Rent in effect immediately
     prior to the date upon which this Lease and the Demised Term
     shall  have expired  and come  to  an end,  or  the date  of
     re-entry upon the Demised Premises by Owner, as the case may
     be,  adjusted  to  reflect  any increases  pursuant  to  the
     provisions  of Article  23 for  the Escalation Year  and Tax
     Escalation Year immediately preceding such event.

     Section 18.02. If the Demised Premises, or any part thereof,
     shall  be relet together  with other space  in the Building,
     the rents collected or reserved under any such reletting and
     the  expenses  of  any  such reletting  shall  be  equitably
     apportioned  for the  purposes  of this  Article 18.  Tenant
     shall  in no  event be  entitled to  any rents  collected or
     payable under any reletting, whether or not such rents shall
     exceed  the  Fixed  Rent  reserved in  this  Lease.  Nothing
     contained in Articles 16, 17 or this Article shall be deemed
     to  limit or preclude the  recovery by Owner  from Tenant of
     the  maximum amount allowed to be obtained as damages by any
     statute  or rule of law, or of  any sums or damages to which
     Owner may be entitled  in addition to the damages  set forth
     in Section 18 01.



                              ARTICLE 19
                     FEES AND EXPENSES; INDEMNITY

     Section  19.01. If Tenant shall default in the observance or
     performance of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease
     on  Tenant's part to be observed or performed, Owner, at any
     time thereafter and without notice in cases of emergency and
     after  the expiration  of  applicable grace  periods in  all
     other cases,  may remedy  such default for  Tenant's account
     and at  Tenant's expense, without thereby  waiving any other
     rights or remedies of Owner with respect to such default.

     Section 19.02. Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Owner and
     Owner's  agents  harmless  of   and  from  all  loss,  cost,
     liability, damage and expense including, but not limited to,
     reasonable  counsel fees,  penalties and  fines incurred  in
     connection with or arising from (i) any default by Tenant in
     the observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants
     or  conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed
     or  performed,  or  (ii)  the  breach   or  failure  of  any
     representation or warranty made by Tenant in this  Lease, or
     (iii)  the use or occupancy or manner of use or occupancy of
     the  Demised  Premises  by  Tenant or  any  person  claiming

                                  32

     through  or under  Tenant, or  (iv) any  acts, omissions  or
     negligence of Tenant or any such person, or the contraction,
     agents, servants, employees, visitors or licensees of Tenant
     or any such person, in or about the Demised Premises  or the
     Building either  prior to,  during, or after  the expiration
     of, the  Demised Term,  including, but  not limited  to, any
     acts, omissions or negligence in the making or performing of
     any Alterations. Tenant further agrees to indemnify and save
     harmless Owner,  Owner's agents,  and the lessor  or lessors
     under all ground or underlying leases, of and from all loss,
     cost,  liability,  damage  and expense,  including,  but not
     limited  to, knowable counsel  fees, incurred  in connection
     with or arising from any claims  by any persons by reason of
     injury to persons  or damage to  property occasioned by  any
     use, occupancy,  act, omission or negligence  referred to in
     the preceding sentence. If any action or proceeding shall be
     brought against Owner  or Owner's agents,  or the lessor  or
     lessors under any ground or underlying lease, based upon any
     such  claim and  if Tenant,  upon notice  from Owner,  shall

     any sums due  to Owner  hereunder with respect  to such  Tax
     Escalation Year nor shall it deprive Tenant of any credit to
     which  it  otherwise  might  be  entitled  to  for  any  Tax
     Escalation Year  pursuant to the provisions  of subsection C
     of  this  Section  23.03.  Tenant  acknowledges  that  under
     present  law, Taxes are payable by Owner (i) with respect to
     a  fiscal  year  commencing  July  1st  and  ending  on  the
     following June 30th,  and (ii) in  two (2) installments,  in
     advance, the  first of which is payable on July 1st, and the
     second  and  final  payment  of  which  is  payable  on  the
     following January 1st.  Within ten (10) days next  following
     rendition of  the first Owner's Tax Statement which shows an
     increase  in the  Fixed Rent  for any  Tax Escalation  Year,
     Tenant  Shall pay  to Owner  one-half of  the amount  of the
     increase shown upon such Owner's Tax Statement for  such Tax
     Escalation Year (including any apportionment pursuant to the
     provisions  of   subsection  B   of  Section   23.02);  and,
     subsequently, provided  Owner shall have  rendered to Tenant
     an Owner's  Tax  Statement, Tenant  shall pay  to Owner  not
     later than thirty (30) days  prior to the date on  which the
     installment  of Taxes is required to be  paid by Owner a sum
     equal to one  half (1/2) of Tenant's  Proportionate Share of
     Taxes payable with  respect to  such Tax  Expiation Year  as
     shown  on   such  Owner's  Tax  Statement,   Tenant  further
     acknowledges that  it  is the  purpose  and intent  of  this
     Section 23.03  to provide Owner with  Tenant's Proportionate

                                  41
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     Share of the  increases in  the Fixed Rent  pursuant to  the
     provisions of this  subsection A thirty  (30) days prior  to
     the time such instrument of Taxes is required  to be paid by
     Owner  without  penalty  or interest.    Accordingly, Tenant
     agrees if the number of such installments and/or the date of
     payment thereof and/or the fiscal  year used for the purpose
     of Taxes  shall change then  (a) at  the time that  any such
     revised installment is payable by Owner, Tenant shall pay to
     Owner  the amount  which shall  provide Owner  with Tenant's
     Proportionate  Share  of  the  increase in  the  Fixed  Rent
     pursuant to  the provisions of Section  23.02A applicable to
     the revised installment of Taxes then required to be paid by
     Owner. and (b) this  Article shall be appropriately adjusted
     to reflect such change and the time for  payment to Owner of
     Tenant's  Proportionate Share  of any  increase in  Taxes as
     provided in  this Article shall be  appropriately revised so
     that   Owner   shall  always   be  provided   with  Tenant's
     Proportionate Share of the increase in the Fixed Rent thirty
     (30) days prior to  the installment of Taxes required  to be
     paid by  Owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions of
     this subsection A to  the contrary, in the event  the holder
     of any  mortgage affecting  any ground or  underlying lease,
     including, but  not limited  to, the Ground  and Development
     Rights Lease,  shall require Owner to  make monthly deposits
     on  account of real estate taxes, then this Article shall be
     appropriately adjusted to reflect the requirement that Owner
     make  monthly deposits  on account  of real estate  taxes so
     that  Owner  shall  always  be  provided  with   one-twelfth
     (1/12th) of Tenant's Proportionate Share of such increase in
     the  Fixed Rent  with  respect to  any  Tax Escalation  Year
     thirty  (30)  days prior  to the  payment  by Owner  of such
     monthly deposits on account of real estate taxes.

          B. Tenant  acknowledges that its obligations  under the
     provisions of  subsection 23.02.A. will be  greater if Owner
     fails to obtain a  Tax Deferral and agrees that  Owner shall
     have  no liability to Tenant nor shall Tenant be entitled to
     any abatement or diminution of rent if Owner fails to obtain
     a  Tax   Deferral.  Tenant  further  acknowledges  that  its
     obligations  under  the  provisions  of  subsection 23.02.A.
     shall  increase  during and  at  the expiration  of  the Tax
     Deferral Period as the law and regulations pursuant to which
     Owner  may  obtain  a  Tax  Deferral  provides  for  limited
     deferrals of  tax payments  for  the first  (1st) seven  tax
     years following the issuance of a certificate of eligibility
     (100%  for the first three  years, 80% for  the fourth year,
     60%  for the fifth year, 40% for  the sixth year and 20% for
     the  seventh year)  and the  payment by  Owner of  the total
     amount of  tax payments deferred commencing  in the eleventh
     tax  year  following  the   issuance  of  a  certificate  of

                                  42
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     eligibility, through  and including  the twentieth  tax year
     following such issuance,  by adding an  amount equal to  10%
     percent  of the total amount of tax payments deferred to the
     amount  of tax otherwise  assessed and payable  in each such
     tax year.

          C.  If, as a  result of  any application  or proceeding
     brought  by or  on  behalf of  Owner  for reduction  of  the
     assessed  valuation of  the Real  Property there shall  be a
     decrease in Taxes  for any Tax Escalation  Year with respect
     to which Owner Shell have previously rendered an Owner's Tax
     Statement.  the next monthly  instalment or  installments of
     Fixed  Rent   following  such  decrease  shall   include  an
     adjustment of the  Fixed Rent for  such Tax Escalation  Year
     reflecting a credit to  Tenant equal to the amount  by which
     (i) the Fixed Rent  actually paid by Tenant with  respect to
     such  Tax  Escalation Year  (as  increased  pursuant to  the
     operation  of  the provisions  of  subsection  A of  Section
     23.02),  shall  exceed  (ii)  the Fixed  Rent  payable  with
     respect to  such Tax Escalation Year  (as increased pursuant
     to the  operation  of  the  provisions of  subsection  A  of
     Section  23.02) based  upon such  reduction of  the assessed
     valuation.

     Section  23.04. A. The  Fixed Rent for  each Escalation Year
     shall be increased by a sum equal to Tenant's  Proportionate
     Share of Operating Expenses for such Escalation Year.

          B.  Unless  the  Commencement  Date shall  occur  on  a
     January  1st, any increase in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the
     provisions of  subsection A  of this Section  23.04 for  the
     Escalation Year  in which the Commencement  Date shall occur
     shall be apportioned in that  percentage which the number of
     days  in the period  from the Commencement  Date to December
     31st of such Escalation Year, both inclusive, shall bear  to
     the total number of days in such Escalation Year. Unless the
     Demised Term shall  expire on a December  31st, any increase
     in the Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of subsection A
     of this Section 23.04  for the Escalation Year in  which the
     date of the expiration of the Demised Term shall occur shall
     be  apportioned in that percentage  which the number of days
     in  the period from January  1st of such  Escalation Year to
     such date of expiration, both  inclusive, shall bear to  the
     total number of days in such Escalation Year.

          C. In the determination of any income in the Fixed Rent
     pursuant to the foregoing  provisions of this Section 23.04,
     if the  Building shall not  have been fully  occupied during
     any Escalation Year, Operating Expenses for such  Escalation
     Year  shall   be  equitably  adjusted  (by   including  such

                                  43
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     additional  expenses as  Owner would  have incurred)  to the
     extent, if any, required to reflect full occupancy.

     Section 23.05. A.   Owner shall render to Tenant,  either in
     accordance with the  provisions of Article 27 or by personal
     delivery  at  the  Demised Premises,  an  Owner's  Operating
     Expense Statement with respect to each Escalation Year on or
     before the next succeeding October 1st.  Owner's failure  to
     render an Owner's  Operating Expense Statement  with respect
     to any Formation  Year shall not prejudice  Owner's right to
     recover any sums due to Owner hereunder with respect to such
     Escalation Year.
        
          B. Within thirty (30)  days next following rendition of
     the first Owner's Operating Expense Statement which shows an
     increase in the Fixed Rent  for any Escalation Year,  Tenant
     shall pay to Owner the entire  amount of such increase.   In
     order to provide for  current payments on account of  future
     increases in  the Fixed Rent  payable by Tenant  pursuant to
     the provisions of subsection 23.04 A,  Tenant shall also pay
     to Owner at such time, provided Owner has given to Tenant  a
     Monthly Escalation  Installment Notice,  a sum equal  to the
     product of (i) the  Monthly Escalation lnstallment set forth
     in  such notice multiplied by  (ii) the number  of months or
     partial months which shall  have elapsed between January 1st
     of the Escalation Year in which such payment is made and the
     date of  such payment less  any amounts theretofore  paid by
     Tenant  to Owner on account  of increases in  the Fixed Rent
     for such Escalation Year  pursuant to the provisions  of the
     penultimate sentence  of this  Section  23.05 B;  thereafter
     Tenant   shall   make  payment   of  a   Monthly  Escalation
     installment  throughout each  month  of  the  Demised  Term.
     Monthly Formation installments shall be added to and payable
     as  part   of  each  monthly  installment   of  Fixed  Rent.
     Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary  contained in  the
     foregoing provisions of this Article, prior to the rendition
     of the first Owner's Operating Expense Statement which shows
     an increase in the fixed Rent for any Escalation Year, Owner
     may render  to Tenant a pro-forma  Owner's Operating Expense
     Statement containing a bona fide estimate of the increase in
     the  Fixed  Rent  for  the  Escalation  Year  in  which  the
     Commencement Date  shall occur. Following  the rendition  of
     such  pro-forma Owner's Operating  Expense Statement, Tenant
     shall  pay to Owner a sum equal  to one twelth (1/12) of the
     estimated increase  in the Fixed Rent shown thereon for such
     Escalation Year multiplied by the number of months which may
     have elapsed between the Commencement Date  and the month in
     which such payment is  made and thereafter pay to  Owner, on
     the first day of  each month of the Demised  Term (until the
     rendition  by Owner  of the  first Owners  Operating Expense

                                  44

     <PAGE>

     Statement) a sum equal to  one-twelth (1/12) of the increase
     in the Fixed Rent shown on  such pro-forma Owner's Operating
     Expense Statement.  Any sums paid pursuant to the provisions
     of  the  immediately  preceding sentence  shall  be credited
     against  the sums  required to  be paid  by Tenant  to Owner
     pursuant to the Owner's  Operating Expense Statement for the
     first  Escalation Year for which there is an increase in the
     Fixed Rent pursuant to the provisions of subsection A.

          C. Following rendition  of the first Owner's  Operating
     Expense  Statement and  each  subsequent  Owner's  Operating
     Expense Statement a reconciliation shall be made as follows:
     Tenant  shall be debited with any increase in the Fixed Rent
     shown  on  such  Owner's  Operating  Expense  Statement  and
     credited with the  aggregate amount, if any,  paid by Tenant
     in  accordance with the  provisions of subsection  B of this
     Section  on account  of future increases  in the  Fixed Rent
     pursuant  to subsection  23.04.A. which  has  not previously
     been credited against  increases in the Fixed  Rent shown on
     Owner Operating Expense Statements. Tenant shall pay any net
     debit  balance  to  Owner   within  thirty  (30)  days  next
     following rendition by Owner,  either in accordance with the
     provisions  of Article  27 or  by personal  delivery  at the
     Demised Premises of  an invoice for such  net debit balance;
     any  net credit balance  shall be  applied as  an adjustment
     against the next accruing Monthly Escalation Installment.

     Section  24.02. No  act or  thing done  by Owner  or Owner's
     agents  during the  Demised  Term shall  constitute a  valid
     acceptance of  a surrender of  the Demised  Premises or  any
     remaining  portion  of the  Demised  Term  except a  written
     instrument accepting such surrender,  executed by Owner.  No
     employee  of  Owner or  of  Owner's  agents shall  have  any
     authority to accept the keys  of the Demised Premises  prior
     to the termination of  this Lease and the Demised  Term, and
     the delivery of  such keys  to any such  employee shall  not
     operate as a termination of this Lease or a surrender of the
     Demised Premises;  however, if Tenant desires  to have Owner
     sublet the  Demised Premises for Tenant's  account, Owner or
     Owner's  agents are authorized to receive said keys for such
     purposes   without  releasing   Tenant  from   any  of   its
     obligations  under this  Lease,  and Tenant  hereby relieves
     Owner  of any liability  for loss of,  or damage to,  any of
     Tenant's property  or other effects in  connection with such
     subletting.  The failure of Owner to seek redress for breach
     or violation  of, or to  insist upon the  strict performance
     of,  any  term,  covenant  or  condition of  this  Lease  on
     Tenant's part to be observed or performed, shall not prevent
     a  subsequent act  or omission  which would  have originally
     constituted a breach or violation of any such term, covenant

                                  45

     or  condition from  having all  the force  and effect  of an
     original breach or violation.  The receipt by Owner  of rent
     with knowledge of the  breach or violation by Tenant  of any
     term, covenant or  condition of this Lease on  Tenant's part
     to  be observed or performed shall not be deemed a waiver of
     such  breach or  violation. Owner's  failure to  enforce any
     Building Rule against Tenant or against any  other tenant or
     occupant of the Building shall not be deemed a waiver of any
     such Building  Rule. No  provision of  this  Lease shall  be
     deemed to have been waived by Owner unless such waiver shall
     be set forth in  a written instrument executed by  Owner. No
     payment by Tenant  or receipt  by Owner of  a lesser  amount
     than the  aggregate of  all Fixed Rent  and additional  rent
     then due under this Lease  shall be deemed to be other  than
     on account of the first accruing of all such items  of Fixed
     Rent  and  additional  rent  then  due,  no  endorsement  or
     statement on any check and no letter accompanying any  check
     or  other  rent payment  in any  such  lesser amount  and no
     acceptance  of any such check or other such payment by Owner
     shall constitute  an accord and satisfaction,  and Owner may
     accept  any  such  check  or payment  without  prejudice  to
     Owner's  right to  recover the  balance of  such rent  or to
     pursue any other legal remedy.

     freight elevators for the exclusive use of another tenant of
     the  Building and  Tenant shall  have no  right to  use such
     elevator  without  Owner's consent.    Tenant  shall not  be
     Charged  any fee  for the  use of  the freight  elevators in
     connection with Tenant's move into the Demised Premises.

     Section  29.02.  Owner,  at Owner's expense  (subject to the
     provisions of this Section and Section 29.04), shall furnish
     and distribute to the  Demised Premises through the Building
     heating, ventilating  and air  conditioning (referred to  as
     "HVAC") systems, when required for the comfortable occupancy
     of the  Demised Premises, heated, cooled ant outside air, at
     reasonable  temperatures, pressures and  degrees of humidity
     and in reasonable  volumes and velocities,  on a year  round
     basis, from 8.00 a m. to 6.00 p.m. on business days.  Tenant
     understands,  however,  that  the  equipment which  will  be
     employed in  distributing air will be  connected to Tenant's
     electric meter  and Tenant shall be  appropriate for payment
     of    all   electricity    consumed   by    such   equipment
     Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of  this Section,
     Owner Shall  not be responsible  if the normal  operation of
     the HVAC  systems shall fail  to provide conditioned  air at
     reasonable temperatures pressures or degrees  of humidity or
     in reasonable  volumes or velocities  in ny portions  of the
     Demised  Premises (a) which  shall have an  electric load in
     excess  of three and one-half (1/2) watts per square foot of
     usable area for all purposes (including lighting and power),
     or  which shall have a  human occupancy factor  in excess of
     one person per 100  square feet of usable area  (the average
     electrical load  and human  occupancy factors for  which the
     HVAC  systems have  been  designed) or  (b)  because of  any
     rearrangement  of partitioning or  other Alterations made or
     performed by or on  behalf of Tenant or any  person claiming
     through or  under Tenant Notwithstanding such  design of the
     HVAC  systems,  Tenant  acknowledges  that  Owner's  Initial

                                  49

     <PAGE>

     Construction  shall provide  for an  electrical load  in the
     Demised Premises which  than conform to  the New York  State
     Energy Conservation Construction Code, and which accordingly
     may be less than three and one-half (3 1/2) watts per square
     foot of usable area for all purposes (including lighting and
     power.) Whenever said HVAC  systems are in operation, Tenant
     agrees to cause all  the windows in the Demised  Premises to
     be  kept  closed and  to cause  the  venetian blinds  in the
     Demised Premises to be  kept closed if necessary because  of
     the  position of  the sun.  Tenant agrees  to cause  all the
     windows in the  Demised Premises to  be closed whenever  the
     Demised  Premises are not  occupied. Tenant  shall cooperate
     fully with Owner at  all times and abide by  all regulations
     and requirements  which Owner may  reasonably prescribe  for
     the proper  functioning and protection of  the Building HVAC
     systems. 

     Section 29. 03. A.   Provided Tenant shall keep  the Demised
     Premises in  order, Owner,  at Owner's expense,  shall cause
     the  of office areas of  the Demised Premises  to be cleaned
     substantially in accordance with  the standards set forth in
     Schedule  C, all of  the terms, covenants  and conditions of
     which are incorporated  in this Lease by reference and shall
     be deemed a part of this Lease, as though fully set forth in
     the  body of this  Lease and  shall cause  Tenant's ordinary
     office waste paper refuse to be removed, provided that Owner
     shall  not be  required  to  empty  garbage  cans  having  a
     capacity in excess of nine (9) gallons.  Tenant acknowledges
     that Owner's obligation  to cause  the office  areas of  the
     Demised Premises to be cleaned excludes any portions  of the
     Demised  Premises not  used as  office areas  (e.g, storage,
     mail   and   computer    areas,   private   lavatories    in
     contradistinction to  core  toilets used  for  the  storage,
     preparation, service or consumption of food or beverages and
     the  broadcasting areas  of the  Demised Premises).   Tenant
     shall  pay Owner at Building standard rates or, if there are
     no such rates, at  reasonable rates, for the removal  of any
     of  Tenant's refuge  or rubbish  other than  ordinary office
     waste  paper  refuse,  from  the Building,  and  Tenant,  at
     Tenant's expense,  shall cause  all portions of  the Demised
     Promises not used as  office areas to be cleaned daily  in a
     manner/satisfactory to  Owner. Tenant also  shall cause  all
     portions  of  the  Demised  Premises used  for  the  storage
     preparation, service or consumption  of food or beverages to
     be exterminated against  infestation by  vermin, roaches  or
     rodents regularly and, in  addition, whenever there shall be
     evidence   of   any  infestation.   Tenant   shall  contract
     independently with Owner or its cleaning services contractor
     for the removal  of such  other refuse and  rubbish and  for
     cleaning services  in addition  to those furnished  by Owner

                                  50
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     and  for the  purpose  of  providing extermination  services
     required to be performed by Tenant.

          B. Tenant  acknowledges and is aware  that the cleaning
     services required to  be furnished by Owner pursuant to this
     Section  may be  furnished  by a  contractor or  contractors
     employed  by Owner and agrees that Owner shall not be deemed
     in default  of any  of  its obligations  under this  Section
     29.03 unless such default shall continue for an unreasonable
     period of  time after  notice from  Tenant to  Owner setting
     forth the specific nature of such default.

     Section  29.04. A.  Tenant shall make arrangements to supply
     all electricity in the  Demised Premises, including, but not
     limited to,  electricity to  serve the Air  conditioning and
     ventilating equipment  and hot water heater  to be installed
     by  Owner  as  part  of  Owner's  Initial  Construction,  by
     contracting  directly with  the  public utility  corporation
     furnishing electricity  to the  Building and shall  pay said
     utility corporation for all current consumed in or about the
     Demised  Premises.  In  connection  with  the  purchase   of
     electric energy by Tenant, Owner shall install on each floor
     comprising the Demised  Premises a meter  pan for one  meter
     which  measures  both demand  and consumption.  Tenant shall
     arrange  with   such  public  utility  corporation  for  the
     installation,  at Tenant's  sole cost  and expense,  of such
     meter.

          B. If  either the  quantity or character  of electrical
     service   is  changed  by  the  public  utility  corporation
     supplying electrical service to the Building or is no longer
     available  or  suitable  for Tenants  requirements,  no such
     change, unavailability or  unsuitability shall constitute an
     actual or  constructive  eviction, in  whole or  in part  or
     entitle Tenant to  any abatement or  diminution of rent,  or
     relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this lease,
     or impose any liability upon Owner, or its agents, by reason
     of inconvenience or  annoyance to  Tenant, or  injury to  or
     interruption of Tenant's business or otherwise.

          C. Owner represents that the electrical feeder or riser
     capacity serving  the Demised Premises  on the  Commencement
     Date  shall be adequate  to serve the  lighting fixtures and
     electrical  receptacles  installed in  the  Demised Premises
     initially by Owner pursuant,  to the provisions of Paragraph
     II of Schedule A and HVAC equipment required to be installed
     in the Demised Premises  initially by Owner pursuant  to the
     provisions  of Paragraph  I  of Schedule  A. Any  additional
     feeders or  risers to supply  Tenant's additional electrical
     requirements, and  all other equipment proper  and necessary

                                  51
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     in  connection  with  such   feeders  or  risers,  shall  be
     installed by Owner upon  Tenant's request, at the  sole cost
     and expense  of Tenant, provided that,  in Owner' reasonable
     judgement, such additional feeders  or risers are  necessary
     and are  permissible  under applicable  laws  and  insurance
     regulations and  the installation of such  feeders or risers
     will not cause permanent damage or injury to the Building or
     the  Demised  Premises or  cause  or create  a  dangerous or
     hazardous  condition  or  entail excessive  or  unreasonable
     alterations or repairs to, interfere with, or disturb, other
     tenants or occupants of  the Building. Tenant covenants that
     at no time shall the use of electrical energy in the Demised
     Premises  exceed the  capacity  of the  existing feeders  or
     wiring  installations then  serving  the  Demised  Premises.
     Tenant shall not  make or  perform or permit  the making  or
     performance of, any  Alterations to wiring  installations or
     other  electrical  facilities  in  or  serving  the  Demised
     premises  without  the  prior   consent  of  Owner  in  each
     instance.

     Section 29.05.  If Tenant  requires, uses or  consumes water
     for  any  purpose  in  addition  to  ordinary  lavatory  and
     drinking purposes, Owner may install a hot water meter and a
     cold water meter and thereby measure Tenant's consumption of
     water for all purposes.  Tenant shall pay to Owner  the cost
     of any such meters and their installation, and Tenant  shall
     keep any  such meters and any such installation equipment in
     good working order and repair, at Tenant's cost and expense.
     Tenant agrees to  pay for  water consumed as  shown on  said
     meters and  sewer charges, taxes and  any other governmental
     charges  thereon, as  and  when bills  are rendered.  Tenant
     understands  that the hot water  heater will be connected to
     Tenant's electric meter and that Tenant shall be responsible
     for payment  of all  electricity consumed by  such equipment
     For  the  purposes of  determining  the amount  of  any sums
     required  to be paid by  Tenant under this  Section, all hot
     and cold water  consumed during any period  when such meters
     are not in good  working order shall be deemed  to have been
     consumed at the rate of consumption of such water during the
     most comparable period when such meters were in good working
     order.

     Section  29.06. The Fixed  Rent does not  reflect or include
     any charge  to Tenant for the furnishing  or distributing of
     any  freight  elevator  or  HVAC  services  to  the  Demised
     Premises during  periods (referred to as "Overtime Periods")
     other  than the  hours  and days  set  forth above  in  this
     Article  for   the  furnishing  and  distributing   of  such
     services.  Accordingly,  if  Owner  Shall  furnish  any such
     freight elevator or HVAC services to the Demised Premises at

                                  52
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     the request of Tenant  during Overtime Periods, Tenant shall
     pay Owner for such services at the standard rates then fixed
     by  Owner for the  Building or,  if no  such rates  are then
     fixed, at reasonable  rates. Owner shall not be  required to
     furnish  any such services  during Overtime  Periods, unless
     Owner  has received  reasonable advance  notice from  Tenant
     requesting  such services.  If  Tenant fails  to give  Owner
     reasonable  advance notice  requesting such  services during
     any  Overtime  Periods, then,  whether  or  not the  Demised
     Premises are habitable during such Periods, failure by Owner
     to  furnish  or distribute  any  such  services during  such
     Periods  shall  not  constitute  an  actual or  constructive
     eviction,  in whole  or in  part, or  entitle Tenant  to any
     abatement or diminution  of rent, or relieve Tenant from any
     of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability
     upon Owner  or  its agents  by  reason of  inconvenience  or
     annoyance  to  Tenant,  or  injury  to  or  interruption  of
     Tenant's business or otherwise.

     Section 29.07. Owner reserves the right  to stop the service
     of  the  HVAC,  elevator,  plumbing,  electrical  or   other
     mechanical  systems  or  facilities  in  the  Building  when
     necessary by reason of accident or emergency, or for repairs
     alterations,  replacements or  improvements,  which, in  the
     judgment  of Owner  are desirable  or necessary,  until said
     repairs,  alterations,  replacements  or improvements  shall
     have  been completed.  The exercise  of such right  by Owner
     shall not constitute an  actual or constructive eviction, in
     whole  or in  part, or  entitle Tenant  to any  abatement or
     diminution of  rent,  or  relieve  Tenant from  any  of  its
     obligations under  this Lease, or impose  any liability upon
     Owner or its  agents by reason of inconvenience or annoyance
     to  Tenant,  or  injury   to  or  interruption  of  Tenant's
     business, or otherwise.

     conditions  of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed or

     (or such subsequent Owner) Shall have no liability to Tenant
     for  the return of the Security and Tenant shall look solely

     within the meaning of the forming sentence.

     Section 35.02. Provided Tenant is not then in default in the
     observance or performance of any  of the terms, covenants or

     unreasonably  to  withhold  such  consent  or  approval,  or
     otherwise. Each  party shall pay its own  counsel and expert
     witness  fees and  expense, if  any, in connection  with any
     arbitration held pursuant to  the provisions of this Section
     and  the parties will share  all other expenses  and fees of
     any such arbitration.

     physically (i) interfere in  any way with the rights  of any

     receiving antenna or  dish or similar  equipment or (b)  use

     granted any credit or  allowance by Owner may be  removed by
     Tenant  at or  prior to the expiration  of the Demised  Term

     applicable grace periods for the curing of such defaults and
     further  provided that  Tenant,  at Tenant's  sole cost  and
     expense, shall repair any damage caused by such removal and,

     shall be  totally destroyed or  rendered wholly untenantable
     and there shall be  less than two  (2) years of the  Demised
     Term remaining at that time, then if Owner does not exercise
     its  right to  terminate this  Lease in accordance  with the
     provisions  of subdivision  (i) of  said Section  9.01, then
     Tenant  shall have the right  to terminate this  Lease as of

     self-operative  upon  any  such  request,  and   no  further
     instrument  shall  be  required   to  give  effect  to  said
     provisions. Tenant, however, upon request of any such owner,
     holder,  or lessee,  agrees to execute,  from time  to time,
     instruments in confirmation  of the foregoing  provisions of

     any award in condemnation or of  any fire insurance policies
     affecting the  Building, or impose  upon any such  holder or
     lessor any liability  (i) for the erection or  completion of
     the  Building. or (ii) in the event of damage or destruction
     to the  Building or the  Demised Premises, for  any repairs,
     replacements,  rebuilding  or  restoration  except   as  can
     reasonably  be   accomplished  from  the   net  proceeds  of
     insurance actually  received by, or made  available to, such
     holder  or lessor, or (iii)  for any default  by Owner under
     this  Lease  occurring prior  to  any date  upon  which such
     holder or lessor shall become Tenant's landlord, or (iv) for
     any credits, offsets  or claims against the rent  under this
     Lease as the result of any acts  of Owner committed prior to

     the  existence   of  any  one  or  more   of  the  following
     circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  commencement  of  any
     foreclosure  of  any such  mortgage or  at  the time  of the

     curing of such default;

          C. Tenant  shall not have  paid rent in  advance beyond

     or  the  rents  payable  hereunder,  to the  holder  of  any
     mortgage or the lessor under any ground or underlying lease,
     whether  the assignment  shall be  conditional in  nature or
     otherwise, Tenant  agrees that (a) the  execution thereof by
     Owner  and the acceptance by such holder or lessor shall not
     be deemed an  assumption by such holder or lessor  of any of
     the obligations of  the Owner under  this Lease unless  such
     holder or  lessor shall, by  written notice sent  to Tenant,
     specifically otherwise elect,  and (b) except as  aforesaid,
     such holder or  lessor shall  be treated  as having  assumed
     Owner's  obligations hereunder only  upon the foreclosure of
     such holder's  mortgage or the termination  of such lessor's
     lease  and the taking of  possession of the Demised Premises
     by such holder or lessor, as the case may be.

     the contrary, in  the event the Commencement Date  shall not
     have occurred on  or prior  to April 1,  1991, Tenant  shall
     have  a single option to  cancel this Lease  and the Demised
     Term by giving notice to  Owner of such cancellation  within
     ten (10) days next following said  date, as said date may be
     extended  pursuant  to  the  following  provisions  of  this

     Tenant hereunder  shall be promptly returned  to Tenant, and
     Owner and  Tenant shall  be released  and discharged of  and
     from any and  all further liability under  the provisions of

     the   number  of  days,  if  any,  of  delay  or  delays  in
     substantial  completion  of  Owner  s  Initial  Construction

     other  plans and specifications or in supplying information,
     or in  approving plans,  specifications or estimates,  or in
     giving authorizations or  by reason  of any  Change Work  as

     reason of any delays in the delivery of such modular systems
     supplied  by  Tenant or  by reason  of  any similar  acts or
     omissions of Tenant plus  (iii) the number of days,  if any,
     of  delay or  delays  in substantial  completion of  Owner's
     Initial Construction  occasioned  by reason  of  strikes  or
     other labor disputes, fire  or other casualty (or reasonable
     delays  in adjustment  of  insurance), accidents,  orders or
     regulations  of  any  Federal, State,  County  or  Municipal
     authority,  or by  any other  cause beyond  Owner's control,

     to  those   hereinbefore  enumerated.    The  provisions  of
     subparagraph II (2) of  Schedule A shall not be  affected by
     the provisions of this Section.  Notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary  contained in the foregoing  provisions of this
     Section, in the event Tenant shall  use or occupy all or any
     part of  the Demised Premises  for the  conduct of  business
     prior  to the  Commencement  Date, the  foregoing option  to
     terminate this Lease in
     accordance with the  provisions of this Section  shall be of
     no further force or effect.

     except  that Owner shall not be required to make any repairs
     referred  to in  subdivisions  (i) (ii)  and  (iii) of  this
     sentence    if  Tenant  is obligated  to  make  such repairs
     pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing  provisions of this Section,  Owner shall have
     no obligation to make any repairs or replacements unless and
     until specific  notice of the necessity  therefor shall have
     been given by Tenant to Owner.

     Section 49.02. If (i) Owner shall default in its obligations
     to  make   repairs  solely  in  the   Demised  Premises,  in
     accordance with  the provisions  of Section 49.01,  and (ii)
     Tenant shall  notify Owner of the existence  of such default

     within ten  (10) business  days after  said notice  or shall

     diligence the  work necessary to  cure such  default or  (y)
     fail  to notify Tenant  within ten (10)  business days after
     said  notice  that Owner  is unable  to  start to  cure such
     default because of inability to obtain materials, or strikes
     or  other  labor  disputes,   fire  or  other  casualty  (or
     reasonable  delays in  adjustment of  insurance), accidents,
     orders  or  regulations of  any  Federal,  State, County  or

     reasonable  control,  whether or  not  such  cause shall  be
     similar  in  nature to  those  hereinbefore enumerated,  and
     thereafter fail  to commence curing such  default within ten
     (10) business days  after such inability  or other cause  no
     longer exists  and to complete  such curing in  a reasonably

     default.   In  the event  Tenant cures  any such  default in
     accordance with  the foregoing  provisions of  this Section,
     any  reasonable expenditures  made  by Tenant  to cure  such
     default shall be  repaid by  Owner to  Tenant within  twenty
     (20) days after demand and, if  Owner fails to pay any  such
     sum  within such twenty  (20) day period,  Tenant may offset
     and  deduct   such  sum  from  the   next  accruing  monthly
     installments of Fixed Rent.

     Section 51.01. A.    Tenant shall have  the right to require
     Owner  to  return to  Tenant  that portion  of  the security
     deposited by Tenant and  then held by Owner pursuant  to the
     provisions  of Article  35 in  the event  that prior  to the
     return by Owner to Tenant of such security, or the unapplied
     portion  thereof,   Tenant  shall  deposit  with   Owner  an
     irrevocable,  unconditional letter of credit issued by Chase
     Manhattan  Bank N.A. or any  other bank having  assets of at
     least ONE BILLION ($1,000,000,000.00) DOLLARS and which is a
     member  of the  New York  Clearing House  Association (Chase
     Manhattan  Bank  N.A. or  any  such other  bank  meeting the
     foregoing  requirements  and  issuing  the  initial  or  any
     replacement letter of  credit is referred to as  the "Bank")
     in favor of Owner  in a sum equal  to FOUR HUNDRED  THOUSAND
     ($400,000.00)   DOLLARS,  as   security  for   the  faithful
     observance and performance by Tenant of the terms, covenants
     and conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed
     and performed. From and  after the receipt by Owner  of such
     letter  of credit and the receipt by Tenant of such security
     or the unapplied portion  thereof, the provisions of Article
     35 shall be of no further  force and effect.  Such letter of
     credit shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Owner.
     Owner agrees that a  letter of credit  which is in the  form
     annexed hereto as Exhibit 1  shall be deemed satisfactory to
     Owner.  Tenant agrees to cause the Bank to renew such letter
     of  credit, from time to  time, during the  Demised Term, at
     least  ninety (90)  days  prior to  the  expiration of  said
     letter of  credit or  any renewal  or replacement,  upon the
     same  terms and conditions.  In the event of any transfer of
     said letter of credit pursuant to Section 51.05,  and notice
     of  such transfer to Tenant, Tenant, within twenty (20) days
     thereafter,  shall cause a new letter of credit to be issued
     by  said Bank  to the  transferee, upon  the same  terms and
     conditions,  in  replacement  of  the letter  of  credit  so
     transferred and Owner  agrees that, simultaneously  with the
     delivery of such  new letter  of credit, it  will return  to
     said Bank the letter  of Credit being replaced.   The letter
     of   credit  deposited  hereunder,   and  all  renewals  and
     replacements, are referred to,  collectively, as the "Letter
     of Credit".   The Letter of Credit shall be held in trust by
     Owner for the purposes  set forth in this Article  and shall

     not be transferred except  for transfer (a) to an  agent for
     collection,  or (b)  pursuant to  the provisions  of Section
     51.05. In  the event  Tenant defaults beyond  any applicable
     grace period hereunder in the performance of its obligations
     to  issue  a   replacement  Letter  of  Credit,  or  in  the
     observance or performance of Tenant's agreement to cause the
     Bank  to renew the Letter  of Credit, Owner,  in addition to
     all rights  and remedies  which  Owner may  have under  this
     Lease or at law, shall have the right to require the Bank to
     make  payment to  Owner of  the entire  sum of  FOUR HUNDRED
     THOUSAND   ($400,000.00)  DOLLARS  or  the  undrawn  portion
     thereof,  as the case may  be, represented by  the Letter of
     Credit, which sum shall be held by Owner as Cash Security in
     the same manner as if said sum had been deposited with Owner
     pursuant to the provisions of  subsection B of this Section.
     If said payment of  the entire sum of FOUR  HUNDRED THOUSAND
     ($400,000.00) DOLLARS is made to Owner by reason of Tenant's
     failure  to  renew  or  replace  the  Letter  of  Credit  in
     accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection,
     such  default  by  Tenant  shall  be deemed  cured  by  such
     payment, with the effect that Owner shall not have the right
     to terminate this Lease or the term hereof by reason of such
     default, but the  foregoing provision shall not apply to any
     other  default  under this  Lease.    The Letter  of  Credit
     provides for partial drawings.  In the event Tenant defaults
     in the  payment when due of an  installment of Fixed Rent or
     in  the payment  when due  of any  additional rent  and such
     default shall continue for  a period of ten (10)  days after
     notice by Owner  to Tenant of such default or  if this Lease
     and the Demised  Term shall  expire and  come to  an end  as
     provided in Article 16 or by or under any summary proceeding
     or  any  other action  or  proceeding,  or  if  Owner  shall
     re-enter the Demised Premises as  provided in Article 17, or
     by  or under any summary  proceeding or any  other action or
     proceeding,  then  Owner,  in  addition to  all  rights  and
     remedies  which Owner may  have under this Lease or at  law,
     may from time to time,  draw on the Letter of Credit  in one
     or  more  drawings  for the  amount  of  any  Fixed Rent  or
     additional rent then  due and  for any amount  then due  and
     payable to  Owner under Article  18 or  Article 19.   In the
     event  of a partial drawing,  as provided in the immediately
     preceding sentence, Tenant shall, within five (5) days after
     demand, cause the Bank  to issue an amendment to  the Letter
     of Credit restoring the  amount available thereunder to FOUR
     HUNDRED THOUSAND ($400,000.00) DOLLARS.

          B.   At any time during the term of  this Lease, Tenant
     may require  that  Owner  return  the Letter  of  Credit  by
     depositing  with Owner, in lieu thereof, as security for the
     faithful observance and performance  by Tenant of the terms,

     security  shall   be  returned  to  Tenant   after  (i)  the
     Expiration Date  and (ii) delivery of  the entire possession
     of the Demised Premises to Owner and (iii) payment by Tenant
     for  any costs of repairs or restoration required to be paid
     by  Tenant pursuant to this Lease and (iv) payment by Tenant
     of  any other  sum or  charge required to  be paid  to fully
     discharge  Tenant's  obligations  under  this Lease  to  and
     including the Expiration Date.

     Section  51.05. In the event of  a sale or other transfer of
     the Land and/or Building, or Owner's interest in this Lease,
     Owner  shall  transfer  the  Letter  of  Credit  and/or  any
     remaining portion of any Cash Security then held by Owner as
     security for the  performance of  Tenants obligations  under
     this Lease to the transferee,  and Owner shall thereupon  be
     released from all liability for the return of such security;
     Tenant  agrees to  look  solely to  the  transferee for  the
     return  of any  such  security and  it  is agreed  that  the
     provisions of this  sentence shall  apply to  every sale  or
     transfer  of the Land and/or Building  by Owner named herein
     or  its successors, and to every transfer or assignment made
     of any such  security.   Any transferee shall  be deemed  to
     have  agreed that  any  Letter of  Credit  or Cash  Security
     transferred  to such  transferee  pursuant  to this  Section
     shall be held in trust for the purposes of this  Article.  A
     lease of  the entire Building  pursuant to which  the lessee
     shall be  entitled to collect  the rents hereunder  shall be
     deemed a transfer within the meaning of this Section.

     Section 51.06. Owner  agrees that, if not prohibited  by law
     or the general  policies of lending institutions in New York
     City, Owner shall deposit any Cash Security held by Owner in
     a  money  market  account   selected  by  Owner  with  Chase
     Manhattan  Bank N.A. in New York, New York, and all interest
     accruing  thereon  shall  be  remitted to  Tenant  annually,
     provided Tenant is not then in default beyond the applicable
     grace  periods provided in this Lease for the curing of such
     default.   Section  51.07.  Tenant agrees  that it  will not
     assign, mortgage or encumber, or attempt to assign, mortgage
     or  encumber, the Letter of Credit or any Cash Security held

                                  82

     <PAGE>

     by  Owner under this Lease,  and that neither  Owner nor its
     successors or assigns shall be bound by any such assignment,
     mortgage,   encumbrance,  attempted   assignment,  attempted
     mortgage  or  attempted encumbrance.    Owner  shall not  be
     required  to  exhaust  its  remedies  against Tenant  before
     having recourse to  the Letter of Credit,  the Cash Security
     or any other  security held by Owner.  Recourse  by Owner to
     the  Letter  of  Credit,  the  Cash  Security  or  any other
     security held  by Owner  shall not  affect  any remedies  of
     Owner  which  are  provided  in  this  Lease  or  which  are
     available in law or equity.

     Section 51.08.   A. Owner has agreed that Owner shall return
     to Tenant the sum of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THREE
     HUNDRED THIRTY THREE ($133,333.00)  DOLLARS of such security
     on the  date  (referred to  as the  "Initial Partial  Return
     Date") two  (2) years  next following the  Commencement Date
     provided  Tenant is  not then  in default  under any  of the
     terms,  covenants or  conditions of  this Lease  on Tenant's
     part  to be  observed  and performed  beyond the  applicable
     grace  period for the curing of  such default.  Accordingly,
     if on the Initial Partial Return Date Tenant shall not so be
     in  default Tenant may replace  the Letter of  Credit with a
     Letter  of Credit  in a  sum reduced  by ONE  HUNDRED THIRTY
     THREE  THOUSAND  THREE  HUNDRED  THIRTY  THREE ($133,333.00)
     DOLLARS.   In  the event that  at any  time Tenant  shall be
     entitled to reduce such Letter of Credit  as provided in the
     foregoing provisions  of this Article the  security shall be
     held  as Cash Security then, in lieu of Tenant replacing any
     such Letter  of Credit, Owner  shall return  sums to  Tenant
     equal to the amount by which the Letter of Credit would have
     been reduced if it  were in existence; however, in  no event
     shall  the Letter of Credit or Cash Security ever be reduced
     below  the sum of TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED
     SIXTY SEVEN ($266,667.00) DOLLARS, subject to the provisions
     of  subsection B hereof.   The sum of  FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND
     ($400,000.00) DOLLARS referred  to in the  previous Sections
     of this Article shall be deemed reduced as the provisions of
     this  subsection B of this Section 51.08 shall operate to so
     reduce the  Letter of  Credit and/or Cash  Security, as  the
     case may be.

          B.   Owner has agreed that Owner shall return to Tenant
     the sum  of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE  THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED
     THIRTY THREE  ($133,333.00) DOLLARS of such  security on the
     date (referred  to as  the "Partial  Return Date")  four (4)
     years next following the Commencement Date,  provided Tenant
     is not then in default under any of the terms,  covenants or
     conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and
     performed beyond the applicable  grace period for the curing

                                  83
<PAGE>






     <PAGE>

     of such default.  Accordingly, if on the Partial Return Date
     Tenant  shall not so be  in default, Tenant  may replace the
     Letter of Credit with a letter of credit in a sum reduced by
     ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE
     ($133,333.00) DOLLARS.  In the event that at any time Tenant
     shall  be  entitled  to  reduce such  Letter  of  Credit  as
     provided  in the  foregoing provisions  of this  Article the
     security shall be  held as  Cash Security then,  in lieu  of
     Tenant  replacing any  such  Letter of  Credit, Owner  shall
     return  sums  to Tenant  equal to  the  amount by  which the
     Letter  of  Credit would  have been  reduced  if it  were in
     existence;  however, in no event shall  the Letter of Credit
     or  Cash Security  ever  be reduced  below  the sum  of  ONE
     HUNDRED  THIRTY  THREE THOUSAND  DOLLARS.   The  sum  of TWO
     HUNDRED  SIXTY   SIX  THOUSAND   SIX  HUNDRED   SIXTY  SEVEN
     ($266,667.00) DOLLARS referred  to in the  previous Sections
     of this Article shall be deemed reduced as the provisions of
     this  subsection B of this Section 51.08 shall operate to so
     reduce the  Letter of  Credit and/or  Cash Security,  as the
     case may be.

          C.    Owner and Tenant acknowledge that  the provisions
     of Sections 35.02 and 35.03 are intended to be comparable to
     the  provisions of subsections A and B of this Section 51.08
     and are designed to apply in the event that Tenant initially
     deposits Cash Security in  accordance with the provisions of
     Article  35.    Accordingly, in  the  event  that  Owner has
     returned to Tenant   any portions of  the security deposited
     by Tenant with Owner  pursuant to the provisions  of Article
     35  in accordance with the provisions  of Sections 35.02 and
     35.03 of said Article 35, then the initial sum of the Letter
     of Credit referred to in Section 51.01.A shall be reduced to
     the  amount of security then  permitted to be  held by Owner
     pursuant to the provisions of Article 35  and the applicable
     provisions of  subsections A and/or B of  this Section 51.08
     which correspond with the  applicable provisions of Sections
     35.02 and 35.03, as the case may be, shall be deemed deleted
     from this Lease and of no further force and effect.



                              ARTICLE 52
                         ADDENDUM TO ARTICLE 6


     Section  52.01.    Notwithstanding  anything   contained  in
     Section  6.02 to the contrary, Tenant shall not be deemed to
     have  caused  any  increase  in  the  fire  insurance  rates
     applicable to  the Building  or property located  therein at
     the beginning of the Demised Term or at any time thereafter,

                                  84

     nor  shall Tenant  be required  to make  any Alterations  in
     order  to  comply with  any  rules,  orders, regulations  or
     requirements of the New York Board of Fire  Underwriters and
     the  New  York Fire  Insurance  Rating  Organization or  any
     similar  body,  unless such  rates  are  increased, or  such
     Alterations shall be necessitated or occasioned, in whole or
     in part, by the  acts, omissions or negligence of  Tenant or
     any person claiming through or under Tenant, or any of their
     servants,  employees,  contractors,   agents,  visitors   or
     licensees,  or  by the  manner of  use  or occupancy  of the
     Demised  Premises   by  Tenant  or  any   such  persons  (in
     contradistinction  to  the  mere  use or  occupancy  of  the
     Demised  Premises  for the  purposes  set  forth in  Section
     2.01).

 interest on the unamortized balance as is then reasonable in the judgment of
 Lessor's accountants).

          (e) Operating Expenses shall not include any expenses paid by any 
 lessee directly to third parties, or as to which Lessor is otherwise
 reimbursed by any third party, other tenant, or by insurance proceeds, or any
 casualty losses, whether or not covered by any insurance proceeds (except to
 the extent of any commercially reasonable deductible).


  
 6.  USE

     6.1  USE. The Premises shall be used and occupied only for the purpose set 
 forth in paragraph 1.4 of the Basic Lease Provisions or any other use which is 
 reasonably comparable to that use and for no other purpose.

     6.2  COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.  

          (a) Lessor warrants to Lessee that, to Lessor's actual knowledge, the 
 Premises, in the state existing on the date that the Lease term commences, but 
 without regard to alterations or improvements made by Lessee or the use for 
 which Lessee will occupy the Premises, does not violate any covenants or 
 restrictions of record or any applicable building code, regulation or
 ordinance in effect on such Lease term Commencement Date.  In the event it is
 determined that such a violation exists on the Commencement Date, then it
 shall be the obligation of the Lessor, after written notice from Lessee, to
 promptly, at Lessor's sole cost and expense, rectify any such violation.

          (b) Except as provided in paragraph 6.2(a) Lessee shall, at Lessee's
 expense, promptly comply with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules,
 regulations, orders, covenants and restrictions of record, and requirements of
 any fire insurance underwriters or rating bureaus, now in effect or which may
 hereafter come into effect, whether or not they reflect a change in policy
 from that now existing, during the term or any part of the term hereof,
 relating to Lessee's particular use of the Premises. Lessee shall conduct its
 business in a lawful manner and shall not use or permit the use of the
 Premises or the Common Areas in any manner that will tend to create waste or a
 nuisance or shall tend to disturb other occupants of the Office Building
 Project.

     6.3  CONDITION OF PREMISES.

          (a) Lessor shall deliver the Premises to Lessee in a clean condition
 on the Lease Commencement Date (unless Lessee is already in possession) and
 Lessor warrants to Lessee that the plumbing, lighting, air conditioning, and

                                            6

 <PAGE>

 heating system in the Premises shall be in good operating condition.  In the
 event that it is determined that this warranty has been violated, then it
 shall be the obligation of Lessor, after receipt of written notice from Lessee
 setting forth with specificity the nature of the violation, to promptly, at
 Lessor's sole cost, rectify such violation.  

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, Lessee hereby accepts 
 the Premises and the Office Building Project in their condition existing as of 
 the Lease Commencement Date, subject to all applicable zoning, municipal,
 county and state laws, ordinances and regulations governing and regulating the
 use of the Premises, and any easements, covenants or restrictions of record,
 and accepts this Lease subject thereto and to all matters disclosed thereby
 and by any exhibits attached hereto Lessor represents that to the best of its
 knowledge, none of the foregoing prohibit Lessee's use and occupancy of the
 Premises in accordance with the terms of this Lease. Lessee acknowledges that
 it has satisfied itself by its own independent investigation that the Premises
 are suitable for its intended use, and that neither Lessor nor Lessor's agent
 or agents has made any representation or warranty as to the present or future
 suitability of the Premises, Common Areas, or Office Building Project for the
 conduct of Lessee's business, except as set forth herein.

 7.  MAINTENANCE, REPAIRS, ALTERATIONS AND COMMON AREA SERVICES.

     7.1  LESSOR'S OBLIGATIONS. Lessor shall keep the Office Building Project, 
 including the Premises, interior and exterior walls, roof, and common areas,
 and the equipment and all utility and other Building systems (except as
 expressly set forth to the contrary herein) whether used exclusively for the
 Premises or in common with other premises, in good condition and repair;
 provided, however, Lessor shall not be obligated to paint, repair or replace
 the floor coverings, wall coverings, or to repair or replace any improvements
 that are not ordinarily a part of the Building or are above then Building
 standards unless they were part of the Lessee Improvements or as otherwise
 expressly set forth herein.  Except as expressly set forth herein, there shall
 be no abatement of rent or liability of Lessee on account of any injury or
 interference with Lessee's business with respect to any improvements,
 alterations or repairs made by Lessor to the Office Building Project or any
 part thereof. Lessee expressly waives the benefits of any statute now or
 hereafter in effect which would otherwise afford Lessee the right to make
 repairs at Lessor's expense or to terminate this lease because of Lessor's
 failure to keep the Premises in good order, condition and repair.

     7.2  LESSEE'S OBLIGATIONS.

          (a) Notwithstanding Lessor's obligation to keep the Premises in good
 condition and repair, Lessee shall be responsible for payment of the cost
 thereof to Lessor as additional rent for that portion of the cost of any
 maintenance and repair of the Premises, or any equipment (wherever located)
 that serves only Lessee or the Premises, to the extent such cost is
 attributable to Lessee's negligence. Except as set forth herein, Lessee shall
 be responsible for the cost of painting, repairing or replacing wall

                                            7
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 coverings, and to repair or replace any Premises improvements that are not
 ordinarily a part of the Building or that are above then Building standards.
 Lessor may, at its option, upon reasonable notice, elect to have Lessee
 perform any particular such maintenance or repairs, the cost of which is
 otherwise Lessee's responsibility hereunder.

          (b) On the last day of the term hereof, or on any sooner termination, 
 Lessee shall surrender the Premises to Lessor in the same condition as
 received, ordinary wear and tear excepted, clean and free of debris. Any
 damage or deterioration of the Premises shall not be deemed ordinary wear and
 tear if the same could have been prevented by good maintenance practices by
 Lessee. Lessee shall repair any damage to the Premises occasioned by the
 installation or removal of Lessee's trade fixtures, alterations, furnishings
 and equipment.  Except as otherwise stated in this Lease. Lessee shall leave
 the air lines, power panels, electrical distribution systems, lighting
 fixtures, air conditioning, window coverings, wall coverings, carpets, wall
 panelling, ceilings and plumbing on the Premises and in good operating
 condition.

     7.3  ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS

          (a) Lessee shall not, without Lessor's prior written consent make
 alterations, improvements, additions, Utility Installations or repairs in, on
 or about the Premises, or the Office Building Project. As used in this
 paragraph 7.3 the term "Utility Installation" shall mean carpeting, window and
 wall coverings, power panels, electrical distribution systems, lighting
 fixtures, air conditioning, plumbing, and telephone and telecommunication
 wiring and equipment. At the expiration of the term by providing notice to
 Lessee at the time of its consent to such item(s), Lessor may require the
 removal of any or all of said alterations, improvements, additions or Utility
 Installations, (but not the Lessee Improvements), and the restoration of the
 Premises and the Office Building Project to their prior condition, at Lessee's
 expense. When making its own alterations, improvements, additions or Utility
 Installations, Lessee shall use only such contractor as has been expressly
 approved by Lessor. Should Lessee make any alterations, improvements,
 additions or Utility Installations without the prior approval of Lessor, or
 use a contractor not expressly approved by Lessor, Lessor may, at any time
 during the term of this Lease, require that Lessee remove any part or all of
 the same.

          (b) Any alterations, improvements, additions or Utility Installations 
 in or about the Premises or the Office Building Project that Lessee shall
 desire to make shall be presented to Lessor in written form, with proposed
 detailed plans. If Lessor shall give its consent to Lessee's making such
 alteration, improvement, addition or Utility Installation, the consent shall
 be deemed conditioned upon Lessee acquiring a permit to do so from the
 applicable governmental agencies, furnishing a copy thereof to Lessor prior to
 the commencement of the work, and compliance by Lessee with all conditions of
 said permit in a prompt and expeditious manner.


                                            8

 <PAGE>

          (c) Lessee shall pay, when due, all claims for labor or materials 
 furnished or alleged to have been furnished to or for Lessee at or for use in 
 the Premises, which claims are or may be secured by any mechanic's or 
 materialmen's lien against the Premises, the Building or the Office Building 
 Project or any interest therein.

          (d) Lessee shall give Lessor not less than ten (10) days notice prior
 to the commencement of any work in the Premises by Lessee and Lessor shall
 have the right to post notices of non-responsibility in or on the Premises or
 the Building as provided by law. If Lessee shall in good faith contest the
 validity of any such lien claim or demand, then Lessee shall at its sole
 expense defend itself and Lessor against the same and shall pay and satisfy


  
 any such adverse judgment that may be rendered thereon before the enforcement 
 thereof against the Lessor or the Premises, the Building or the Office
 Building Project, upon the condition that if Lessor shall require, Lessee
 shall furnish to Lessor a surety bond satisfactory to Lessor in an amount
 equal to such contested lien claim or demand indemnifying Lessor against
 liability for the same and holding the Premises, the Building and the Office
 Building Project free from the effect of such lien or claim. In addition,
 Lessor may require Lessee to pay Lessor's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
 in participating in such action if Lessor shall decide it is to Lessor's best
 interest so to do.

          (e) All alterations, improvements, additions and Utility
 Installations (whether or not such Utility Installations constitute trade
 fixtures of Lessee), which may be made to the Premises by Lessee, including
 but not limited to, floor coverings, panelings, doors, drapes, built-ins,
 moldings, sound attenuation and lighting and telephone or communications
 systems, conduit, wiring and outlets, shall be made and done in a good and
 workmanlike manner and of good and sufficient quality and materials and shall
 be the property of Lessor and remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises
 at the expiration of the Lease term, unless Lessor requires their removal
 pursuant to paragraph 7.3(a). Provided Lessee is not in default,
 notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 7.3(e), Lessee's personal
 property, trade fixtures and equipment, other than Utility Installations,
 shall remain the property of Lessee and may be removed by Lessee subject to
 the provisions of paragraph 7.2, and provided that Lessee repairs all damage
 caused by such removal.

          (f) Lessee shall provide Lessor with as-built plans and
 specifications for any alterations, improvements, additions or Utility
 Installations.

     7.4  UTILITY ADDITIONS. Lessor reserves the right to install new or
 additional utility facilities throughout the Office Building Project for the
 benefit of Lessor or Lessee, or any other lessee of the Office Building
 Project, including, but not by way of limitation, such utilities as plumbing,

                                            9

 <PAGE>

 electrical systems, communication systems, and fire protection and detection
 systems, so long as such installations do not unreasonably interfere with
 Lessee's use of the Premises or reduce the size of the Premises.

 8.  INSURANCE: INDEMNITY.

     8.1  LIABILITY INSURANCE-LESSEE. Lessee shall, at Lessee's expense, obtain 
 and keep in force during the term of this Lease a policy of Comprehensive 
 General Liability insurance utilizing an Insurance Services Office standard
 form with Broad Form General Liability Endorsement (GL0404), or equivalent, in
 an amount of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence of bodily injury and 
 property damage combined and shall insure Lessee with Lessor as an additional 
 insured against liability arising out of the use, occupancy or maintenance of 
 the Premises. Compliance with the above requirement shall not, however, limit 
 the liability of Lessee hereunder.

     8.2  LIABILITY INSURANCE-LESSOR. Lessor shall obtain and keep in force 
 during the term of this Lease a policy of Combined Single Limit Bodily Injury 
 and Broad Form Property Damage Insurance, plus coverage against such other
 risks Lessor deems advisable from time to time, insuring Lessor and Lessee,
 against liability arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance
 of the Office Building Project in an amount not less than $2,000,000 per
 occurrence with a commercially reasonable umbrella. 

     8.3  PROPERTY INSURANCE-LESSEE. Lessee shall, at Lessee's expense, obtain 
 and keep in force during the term of this Lease for the benefit of Lessee, 
 replacement cost fire and extended coverage insurance, with vandalism and
 malicious mischief, earthquake sprinkler leakage and earthquake sprinkler
 leakage endorsements, in an amount sufficient to cover not less than 100% of
 the full replacement cost, as the same may exist from time to time, of all of
 Lessee's personal property, fixtures, equipment and tenant improvements.

     8.4 PROPERTY INSURANCE-LESSOR. Lessor shall obtain and keep in force
 during the term of this Lease a policy or policies of insurance covering loss
 or damage to the Office Building Project improvements, but not Lessee's
 personal property, fixtures, equipment or tenant improvements, in the amount
 of the full replacement cost thereof, as the same may exist from time to time,
 utilizing Insurance Services Office standard form, or equivalent, providing
 protection against all perils included within the classification of fire,
 extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, plate glass, and such other
 perils as Lessor deems advisable or may be required by a lender having a lien
 on the Office Building Project. In addition, Lessor shall obtain and keep in
 force, during the term of this Lease, a policy of rental value insurance
 covering a period of one year, with loss payable to Lessor, which insurance
 shall also cover all Operating Expenses for said period. Lessee will not be
 named in any such policies carried by Lessor and shall have no right to any
 proceeds therefrom. The policies required by these paragraphs 8.2 and 8.4
 shall contain such reasonable deductibles as Lessor or the aforesaid lender
 may determine. In the event that the Premises shall suffer an insured loss as
 defined in paragraph 9.1(f) hereof, the deductible amounts under the

                                           10
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 applicable insurance policies shall be deemed an Operating Expense. Lessee
 shall not do or permit to be done anything which shall invalidate the
 insurance policies carried by Lessor. Lessee shall pay the entirety of any
 increase in the property insurance premium for the Office Building Project
 over what it was immediately prior to the commencement of the term of this
 Lease if the increase is specified by Lessor's insurance carrier as being
 caused by the nature of Lessee's occupancy or any act or omission of Lessee.

     8.5  INSURANCE POLICIES. Lessor and Lessee shall deliver to the other
 copies of liability insurance policies required under paragraph 8.1 and 8.2 or
 certificates evidencing the existence and amounts of such insurance within
 seven (7) days after the Commencement Date of this Lease. No such policy shall
 be cancellable or subject to reduction of coverage or other modification
 except after thirty (30) days prior written notice to each party. Lessor and
 Lessee shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of such
 policies, furnish the other with renewals thereof.

     8.6  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION. Lessee and Lessor each hereby release and 
 relieve the other, and waive their entire right of recovery against the other,
 for direct or consequential loss or damage arising out of or incident to any
 insurable perils whether or not covered by property insurance carried by such 
 party or required to be carried hereunder, whether due to the negligence of 
 Lessor or Lessee or their agents, employees, contractors and/or invitees. If 
 necessary all property insurance policies required under this Lease shall be 
 endorsed to so provide.

     8.7  INDEMNITY. Lessee shall indemnify and hold harmless Lessor and its 
 agents, Lessor's master or ground lessor, partners and lenders, from and
 against any and all claims for damage to the person or property of anyone or
 any entity arising from Lessee's use of the Office Building Project, or from
 the conduct of Lessee's business or from any activity, work or things done,
 permitted or suffered by Lessee in or about the Premises or elsewhere and
 shall further indemnify and hold harmless Lessor from and against any and all
 claims, costs and expenses arising from any breach or default in the
 performance of any obligation on Lessee's part to be performed under the terms
 of this Lease, or arising from any act or omission of Lessee, or any of
 Lessee's agents, contractors, employees, or invitees, and from and against all
 costs, attorneys' fees, expenses and liabilities incurred by Lessor as the
 result of any such use, conduct, activity, work, things done, permitted or
 suffered, breach, default or negligence, and in dealing reasonably therewith,
 including but not limited to the defense or pursuit of any claim or any action
 or proceeding involved therein; and in case any action or proceeding be
 brought against Lessor by reason of any such matter, Lessee upon notice from
 Lessor shall defend the same at Lessee's expense by counsel reasonably
 satisfactory to Lessor (unless required by Lessee's insurer) and Lessor shall
 cooperate with Lessee in such defense. Lessor need not have first paid any
 such claim in order to be so indemnified. Lessee, as a material part of the
 consideration to Lessor, hereby assumes all risk of damage to property of
 Lessee or injury to persons, in, upon or about the Office Building Project
 arising from any cause and Lessee hereby waives all claims in respect thereof

                                           11

 <PAGE>

 against Lessor.

     8.8  EXEMPTION OF LESSOR FROM LIABILITY. Subject to Paragraph 70 of the
 Addendum, Lessee hereby agrees that Lessor shall not be liable for injury to
 Lessee's business or any loss of income therefrom or for loss of or damage to
 the goods, wares, merchandise or other property of Lessee. Lessee's employees,
 invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Premises or the
 Office Building Project, nor shall Lessor be liable for injury to the person
 of Lessee, Lessee's employees, agents or contractors, whether such damage or
 injury is caused by or results from theft, fire, steam, electricity, gas,
 water or rain, or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of
 pipes, sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, air conditioning or lighting 
 fixtures, or from any other cause, whether said damage or injury results from 
 conditions arising upon the Premises or upon other portions of the Office 
 Building Project, or from other sources or places, or from new construction or 
 the repair, alteration or improvement of any part of the Office Building 
 Project, or of the equipment, fixtures or appurtenances applicable thereto, 
 and regardless of whether the cause of such damage or injury or the means of 
 repairing the same is inaccessible. Lessor shall not be liable for any damages 
 arising from any act or neglect of any other lessee, occupant or user of the 
 Office Building Project, nor from the failure of Lessor to enforce the 
 provisions of any other lease of any other lessee of the Office Building 
 Project.

     8.9  NO REPRESENTATION OF ADEQUATE COVERAGE. Lessor makes no
 representation that the limits or forms of coverage of insurance specified in
 this paragraph 8 are adequate to cover Lessee's property or obligations under
 this Lease.

          (f) "Insured Loss" shall mean damage or destruction which was caused

 or Premises Building Partial Damage, then Lessor shall, as soon as reasonably
 possible and to the extent the required materials and labor are readily
 available through usual commercial channels, at Lessor's expense (if Lessor

 continue in full force and effect.

          (b) Uninsured Loss: Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 9.4 and
 9.5, if at any time during the term of this Lease there is damage which is not
 an Insured Loss and which falls within the classification of Premises Damage

 (in which event Lessee shall make the repairs at Lessee's expense), which
 damage prevents Lessee from making any substantial use of the Premises, Lessor
 may at Lessor's option either (i) repair such damage as soon as reasonably
 possible at Lessor's expense, in which event this Lease shall continue in full
 force and effect, or (ii) give written notice to Lessee within thirty (30)

   9.4  DAMAGE NEAR END OF TERM. 

          (a) Subject to paragraph 9.4(b), if at any time during the last
 twelve (12) months of the term of this Lease there is substantial damage to
 the Premises, Lessor or Lessee may cancel and terminate this Lease as of the
 date of occurrence of such damage by giving written notice to the other of its
 election to do so within 30 days after the date of occurrence of such damage.

          (b) Notwithstanding paragraph 9.4(a), in the event that Lessee has an 
 option to extend or renew this Lease, and the time within which said option

          (a) In the event Lessor repairs or restores the Building or Premises 
 pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 9, and any part of the Premises
 are not usable (including loss of use due to loss of access or essential
 services), the rent payable hereunder (including Lessee's Share of Operating
 Expense Increase) for the period during which such damage, repair or
 restoration continues shall be abated, provided the damage was not the result
 of the willful act of Lessee. Except for said abatement of rent, if any,
 Lessee shall have no claim against Lessor for any damage suffered by reason of
 any such damage, destruction, repair or restoration.

          (b) If Lessor shall be obligated to repair or restore the Premises or

 <PAGE>

 Lease by giving Lessor written notice of Lessee's election to do so at any
 time prior to the commencement or completion, respectively, of such repair or
 restoration. In such event this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such

 any increase in real property tax specified in the tax assessor's records and
 work sheets as being caused by additional improvements placed upon the Office
 Building Project by other lessees or by Lessor for the exclusive enjoyment of
 any other lessee. Lessee shall, however, pay to Lessor at the time that
 Operating Expenses are payable under paragraph 4.2(c) the entirety of any
 increase in real property tax if assessed solely by reason of additional
 improvements placed upon the Premises by Lessee or at Lessee's request.

     10.3 DEFINITION OF "REAL PROPERTY TAX." As used herein, the term "real
 property tax" shall include any form of real estate tax or assessment,

 any tax, fee, levy, assessment or charge hereinabove included within the

                                           15

 <PAGE>

 definition of "real property tax", or (ii) the nature of which was

 which is imposed for a service or right not charged prior to June 1, 1978, or,
 if previously charged, has been increased since June 1, 1978, or (iv) subject
 to Paragraph 54(b) of the Addendum, which is imposed as a result of a change

     10.4 JOINT ASSESSMENT. If the improvements or property, the taxes for
 which are to be paid separately by Lessee under paragraph 10.2 or 10.5 are not 
 separately assessed, Lessee's portion of that tax shall be equitably
 determined by Lessor from the respective valuations assigned in the assessor's
 work sheets or such other information (which may include the cost of
 construction) as may be reasonably available. Lessor's reasonable
 determination thereof, in good faith, shall be conclusive.

     10.5 PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES.

          (a) Lessee shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against
 and levied upon trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal
 property of Lessee contained in the Premises or elsewhere.

          (b) If any of Lessee's said personal property shall be assessed with
 Lessor's real property, Lessee shall pay to Lessor the taxes attributable to
 Lessee within ten (10) days after receipt of a written statement setting forth
 the taxes applicable to Lessee's property.

     11.  UTILITIES.

     11.1 SERVICES PROVIDED BY LESSOR. Subject to Lessee's obligations as set

 water, gas, heat, light, power, telephone and other utilities and services 
 specially or exclusively supplied and/or metered exclusively to the Premises
 or to Lessee, together with any taxes thereon, to the extent (i) such services
 are used after normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through

     11.3 HOURS OF SERVICE. Said services and utilities shall be provided 24
 hours per day, 7 days per week, except that air conditioning shall be provided
 during generally accepted business days and hours or such other days or hours
 as may hereafter be set forth. Air conditioning required at other times shall
 be subject to advance request and reimbursement by Lessee to Lessor of the
 cost thereof. Lessee shall have access to the Premises 24 hours per day, 7
 days per week.

    

  
     11.4 EXCESS USAGE BY LESSEE. Lessee shall not, without Lessor's consent 
 which shall not be unreasonably withheld, make connection to the utilities
 except by or through existing outlets and except for normal office use and
 Lessee's production and broadcasting use and shall not install or use
 machinery or equipment in or about the Premises that uses excess water,
 lighting or power or suffer or permit any act that causes extra burden upon
 the utilities or services, including but not limited to security services,
 over standard office usage for the Office Building Project. Lessor shall
 require Lessee to reimburse Lessor for any excess expenses or costs that may
 arise out of breach of this subparagraph by Lessee. Lessor may in its sole
 discretion install at Lessee's expense supplemental equipment and/or separate
 metering applicable to Lessee's excess usage or loading.

     11.5 INTERRUPTIONS. Subject to Addendum Paragraph 73, there shall be no
 abatement of rent and Lessor shall not be liable in any respect whatsoever for
 the inadequacy, stoppage, interruption or discontinuance of any utility or
 service due to riot, strike, labor dispute, breakdown, accident, repair or
 other cause beyond Lessor's reasonable control or on in cooperation with
 governmental request or directions.

 12. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.
     
     12.1 LESSOR'S CONSENT REQUIRED. Lessee shall not voluntarily or by
 operation of law assign, transfer, mortgage, sublet, or otherwise transfer or
 encumber all or any part of Lessee's interest in the Lease or in the Premises,
 without Lessor's prior written consent, which Lessor shall not unreasonably
 withhold. Lessor shall respond to Lessee's request for consent hereunder in a
 timely manner and any attempted assignment, transfer, mortgage, encumbrance or
 subletting without such consent shall be void, and shall constitute a material
 default and breach of this Lease without the need for notice to Lessee under
 paragraph 13.1. "Transfer" within the meaning of this paragraph 12 shall
 include the transfer or transfers aggregating (a) if Lessee is a corporation,
 more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting stock of such corporation,
 except if the stock is transferred to a purchaser of all or substantially all
 of the stock or pursuant to a registered offering, or (b) if Lessee is a
 partnership, more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the profit and loss
 participation in such partnership.

     12.2 LESSEE AFFILIATE. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 12.1 

                                           17
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 hereof, Lessee may assign or sublet the Premises, or any portion thereof
 without Lessor's consent, to any corporation which controls, is controlled by
 or is under common control with Lessee, or to any corporation resulting from
 the merger or consolidation with Lessee, or to any person or entity which
 acquires all the assets of Lessee as a going concern of the business that is
 being conducted on the Premises, all of which are referred to as "Lessee
 Affiliate," provided that before such assignment shall be effective, (a) said
 assignee shall assume, in full, the obligations of Lessee under this Lease and
 (b) Lessor shall be given written notice of such assignment and assumption.
 Any such assignment shall not, in any way, affect or limit the liability of
 Lessee under the terms of this Lease even if after such assignment or
 subletting the terms of this Lease are materially changed or altered without
 the consent of Lessee, the consent of whom shall not be necessary.

     12.3 TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

          (a) Regardless of Lessor's consent, no assignment or subletting shall 
 release Lessee of Lessee's obligations hereunder or alter the primary
 liability of Lessee to pay the rent and other sums due Lessor hereunder
 including Lessee's Share of Operating Expense increase, and to perform all
 other obligations to be performed by Lessee hereunder.

          (b) Lessor may accept rent from any person other than Lessee pending 
 approval or disapproval of such assignment.

          (c) Neither a delay in the approval or disapproval of such assignment 
 or subletting, nor the acceptance of rent, shall constitute a waiver or
 estoppel of Lessor's right to exercise its remedies for the breach of any of
 the terms or conditions of this paragraph 12 or this Lease.

          (d) If Lessee's obligations under this Lease have been guaranteed by 
 third parties, then an assignment or sublease, and Lessor's consent thereto, 
 shall not be effective unless said guarantors give their written consent to
 such sublease and the terms thereof.

          (e) The consent by Lessor to any assignment or subletting shall not 
 constitute a consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting by Lessee or
 to any subsequent or successive assignment or subletting by the sublessee. 
 However, Lessor may consent to subsequent sublettings and assignments of the 
 sublease or any amendments or modifications thereto without notifying Lessee
 or anyone else liable on the Lease or sublease and without obtaining their
 consent and such action shall not relieve such persons from liability under
 this Lease or said sublease; however, such persons shall not be responsible to
 the extent any such amendment or modification enlarges or increases the
 obligations of the Lessee or sublessee under this Lease or such sublease.

          (f) In the event of any default under this Lease, Lessor may proceed 
 directly against Lessee, any guarantors or any one else responsible for the 
 performance of this Lease, including the sublessee, without first exhausting 
 Lessor's remedies against any other person or entity responsible therefor to 

                                           18
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 Lessor, or any security held by Lessor or Lessee.

          (g) Lessor's written consent to any assignment or subletting of the 
 Premises by Lessee shall not constitute an acknowledgement that no default
 then exists under this Lease of the obligations to be performed by Lessee nor
 shall such consent be deemed a waiver if any then existing default, except as
 may be otherwise stated by Lessor at the time.

          (h) The discovery of the fact that any financial statement relied
 upon by Lessor in giving its consent to an assignment or subletting was
 materially false shall, at Lessor's election, render Lessor's said consent
 null and void.

     12.4 ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO SUBLETTING. Regardless 
 of Lessor's consent, the following terms and conditions shall apply to any
 subletting by Lessee of all or any part of the Premises and shall be deemed
 included in all subleases under this Lease whether or not expressly
 incorporated therein:

          (a) Lessor shall not, by reason of this or any other assignment of
 such sublease to Lessor nor by reason of the collection of the rents from a
 sublessee, be deemed liable to the sublessee for any failure of Lessee to
 perform and comply with any of Lessee's obligations to such sublessee under
 such sublease. Lessee hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any such
 sublessee, upon receipt of a written notice from Lessor (a copy of which shall
 be sent to Lessee) stating that a default exists in the performance of
 Lessee's obligations under this Lease, to pay to Lessor the rents due and to
 become due under the sublease. Lessee agrees that such sublessee shall have
 the right to rely upon any such statement and request from Lessor, and that
 such sublessee shall pay such rents to Lessor without any obligation or right
 to inquire as to whether such default exists and notwithstanding any notice
 from or claim from Lessee to the contrary. Lessee shall have no right or claim
 against said sublessee or Lessor for any such rents so paid by said sublessee
 to Lessor.

          (b) No sublease entered into by Lessee shall be effective unless and
 until it has been approved in writing by Lessor. In entering into any
 sublease, Lessee shall use only such form of sublessee as is satisfactory to
 Lessor, and once approved by Lessor, such sublease shall not be changed or
 modified in any material manner without Lessor's prior written consent. Any
 sublease shall, by reason of entering into a sublease under this Lease, be
 deemed, for the benefit of Lessor, to have assumed and agreed to conform and
 comply with each and every obligation herein to be performed by Lessee other
 than such obligations as are contrary to or inconsistent with provisions
 contained in a sublease to which Lessor has expressly consented in writing.

          (c) In the event Lessee shall default in the performance of its
 obligations under this lease, Lessor at its option and without any obligation
 to do so, may require any sublessee to attorn to Lessor, in which event Lessor
 shall undertake the obligations of Lessee under such sublease from the time of

                                           19
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 the exercise of said option to the termination of such sublease; provided,
 however, Lessor shall not be liable for any prepaid rents or security deposit
 paid by such sublessee to Lessee or for other prior defaults of Lessee under
 such sublease.

          (d) No sublessee shall further assign or sublet all or any part of
 the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent or as otherwise provided
 herein.

          (e) With respect to any subletting to which Lessor has consented, 
 Lessor agrees to deliver a copy of any notice of default by Lessee to the 
 sublessee. Such sublessee shall have the right to cure a default of Lessee 
 within three (3) days after service of said notice of default upon such 
 sublessee, and the sublessee shall have a right of reimbursement and offset 
 from and against Lessee for any such defaults cured by the sublessee.

     12.5 LESSOR'S EXPENSES. In the event Lessee shall request the consent of
 Lessor to any assignment or subletting or if Lessee shall request the consent
 of Lessor for any act Lessee proposes to do, then Lessee shall pay Lessor's
 reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including
 attorneys', architects', engineers', or other consultants' fees.

     12.6  CONDITIONS TO CONSENT. Lessor reserves the right to condition any 
 approval to assign or sublet upon Lessor's determination that (a) the proposed 
 assignee or sublessee shall conduct a business on the Premises of a quality 
 substantially equal to that of Lessee and consistent with the general
 character of the other occupants of the Office Building Project and not in
 violation of any exclusives or rights then held by other tenants, and (b) the
 proposed assignee or sublessee be at least as financially responsible as
 Lessee was expected to be at the time of the execution of this Lease or of
 such assignment or subletting, whichever is greater.

 13. DEFAULT: REMEDIES.

     13.1 DEFAULT. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events
 shall constitute a material default of this Lease by Lessee:

    (a) The abandonment of the Premises by Lessee. 

    (c) The failure by Lessee to make any payment of rent or any other payment
 required to be made by Lessee hereunder, as and when due where such failure
 shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof from
 Lessor to Lessee. In the event that Lessor serves Lessee with a Notice to Pay
 Rent or Quit pursuant to applicable Unlawful Detainer statutes. such Notice to
 Pay Rent or Quit shall also constitute the notice required by this
 subparagraph.



  

                                           20
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

          (d) The failure by Lessee to observe or perform any of the covenants,
 conditions or provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Lessee 
 other than those referenced in subparagraphs (b) and (c), above, where such 
 failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice 
 thereof from Lessor to Lessee; provided, however, that if the nature of
 Lessee's noncompliance is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably
 required for its cure, then Lessee shall not be deemed to be in default if
 Lessee commenced such cure within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter 
 diligently pursues such cure to completion. To the extent permitted by law, 
 such thirty (30) day notice shall constitute the sole and exclusive notice 
 required to be given to Lessee under applicable Unlawful Detainer statutes.

          (e) (i) The making by Lessee of any general arrangement or general 
 assignment for the benefit of creditors: (ii) Lessee becoming a "debtor" as 
 defined in 11 U.S.C. (S)101 or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the 
 case of a petition filed against Lessee, the same is dismissed within sixty 
 (60) days;(iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of 
 substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's 
 interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Lessee within 
 thirty (30) days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure 
 of substantially all of the Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of 
 Lesses's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within 
 thirty (30) days. In the event that any provision of this paragraph 13.1(e) is 
 contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no force or effect.

          (f) The discovery by Lessor that any financial statement given to
 Lessor by Lessee, or its successor in interest or by any guarantor of Lessee's 
 obligation hereunder, was materially false.

     13.2 REMEDIES. In the event of any material default or breach of this
 Lease by Lessee, Lessor may at any time thereafter, with or without notice or
 demand and without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any right or remedy
 which Lessor may have by reason of such default:

          (a) Terminate Lessee's right to possession of the Premises by any 
 lawful means, in which case this Lease and the term hereof shall terminate and 
 Lessee shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Lessor.  In 
 such event Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee all damages
 incurred by Lessor by reason of Lessee's default including, but not limited
 to, the cost of recovering possession of the Premises: expenses of reletting,
 including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable
 attorneys' fees, and any real estate commission actually paid; the worth at
 the time of award by the court having jurisdiction thereof of the amount by
 which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of such award
 exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same period that Lessee proves
 could be reasonably avoided: that portion of the leasing commission paid by
 Lessor pursuant to paragraph 15 applicable to the unexpired term of this
 Lease.

          (b)  Exercise the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 

                                           21
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 1951.4 or any successor section.

          (c) Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available to Lessor
 under the laws or judicial decisions of the state wherein the Premises are
 located.  Unpaid installments of rent and other unpaid monetary obligations of
 Lessee under the terms of this Lease shall bear interest from the date five
 (5) days after such payment is due at the lesser of 2% over the prime rate of
 Citibank, N.A. or the maximum rate then allowable by law.

     13.3 DEFAULT BY LESSOR. Lessor shall not be in default unless Lessor fails 
 to perform obligations required of Lessor within a reasonable time, but in no 
 event later than thirty (30) days after written notice by Lessee to Lessor and 
 to the holder of any first mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises
 whose name and address shall have theretofore been furnished to Lessee in
 writing, specifying wherein Lessor has failed to perform such obligation;
 provided, however, that if the nature of Lessor's obligation is such that more
 than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Lessor shall not be
 in default if Lessor commences performance within such 30-day period and
 thereafter diligently pursues the same to completion. (See Addendum Paragraph
 72.)

     13.4 LATE CHARGES. Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee 
 to Lessor of Base Rent, Lessee's Share of Operating Expense increase or other 
 sums due hereunder will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this 
 Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. 
 Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, 
 late charges which may be imposed on Lessor by the terms of any mortgage or 
 trust deed covering the Office Building Project. Accordingly, if any 
 installment of Base Rent, Operating Expense Increase, or any other sum due
 from Lessee shall not be received by Lessor or Lessor's designee within ten
 (10) days after notice that such amount shall be due, then Lessee shall pay to
 Lessor a late charge equal to 6% of such overdue amount. The parties hereby
 agree that such late charges represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the
 costs Lessor will incur by reason of late payment by Lessee.  Acceptance of
 such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's
 default with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent Lessor from
 exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.

     14. CONDEMNATION. If the Premises or any portion thereof or the Office 
 Building Project are taken under the power of eminent domain, or sold under 
 the threat of the exercise of said power (all of which are herein called 
 "condemnation"), this Lease shall terminate as to the part so taken as of the 
 date the condemning authority takes title or possession, whichever first 
 occurs; provided that if the Premises or any portion thereof are taken such 
 that Lessee is unable to continue to operate Lessee's business in the Premises 
 (which shall be defined as a "material" portion of the Premises), Lessee shall 
 the option, to be exercised only in writing within thirty (30) days after 
 Lessor shall have given Lessee written notice of such taking (or in the
 absence of such notice, within thirty (30) days after the condemning authority
 shall have taken possession), to terminate this Lease as of the date

                                           22
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 condemning authority takes such possession. If Lessee does not terminate this
 Lease in accordance with the foregoing, this Lease shall remain in full force
 and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining, except that the rent
 and Lessee's Share of Operating Expense Increase shall be reduced in the
 proportion that the floor area of the Premises taken bears to the total floor
 area of the Premises. Common Areas taken shall be excluded from the Common
 Areas usable by Lessee and no reduction of rent shall occur with respect
 thereto or by reason thereof. If the portion of the Project taken is so much
 as to render the Project a not viable office project then Lessor shall have
 the option in its sole discretion to terminate this Lease as of the taking of
 possession by the condemning authority, by giving written notice to Lessee of
 such election with thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of a taking by
 condemnation of any part of the Premises or the Office Building Project. Any
 award for the taking of all or any part of the Premises or the Office Building
 Project under the power of eminent domain or any payment made under threat of
 the exercise of such power shall be the property of Lessor, whether such award
 shall be made as compensation for diminution in value of the leasehold or for
 the taking of the fee, or as severance damages; provided, however, that Lessee
 shall be entitled to any separate award for loss of or damage to Lessee's
 trade fixtures, removable personal property and unamortized tenant
 improvements that have been paid for by Lessee. For that purpose the cost of
 such improvements shall be amortized over the original term of this Lease
 excluding any options. In the event that this Lease is not terminated by
 reason of such condemnation. Lessor shall to the extent of severance damages
 received by Lessor in connection with such condemnation, repair any damage to
 the Premises caused by such condemnation except to the extent that Lessee has
 been reimbursed thereof by the condemning authority.

     15. BROKER'S FEE.

    (a) The brokers involved in this transaction are CB Commercial as "listing
 broker" licensed real estate broker(s). A "cooperating broker" is defined as
 any broker other than the listing broker entitled to a share of any commission
 arising under this Lease. Upon execution of this Lease by both parties, Lessor
 shall pay to said brokers jointly, or in such separate shares as they may
 mutually designate in writing, a fee as set forth in a separate agreement
 between Lessor and said broker(s).

 16. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE.

     (a) Each party (as "responding party") shall at any time upon not less
 than ten (10) business days' prior written notice from the other party
 ("requesting party") execute, acknowledge and deliver to the requesting party
 a statement in writing (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in
 full force and effect (or if modified, stating the nature of such modification
 and certifying that this Lease, as so modified, is in full force and effect)
 and the date  


  

                                           23
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 to which the rent and other charges are paid in advance, if any, and (ii) 
 acknowledging that there are not, to the responding party's knowledge any 
 uncured defaults on the part of the requesting party, or specifying such 
 defaults if any are claimed. Any such statement may be conclusively relied
 upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of the Office Building
 Project or of the business of Lessee.

     (b) At the requesting party's option, the failure to deliver such
 statement within such time shall be a material default of this Lease by the
 party who is to respond, without any further notice to such party, or it shall
 be conclusive upon such party that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect,
 without modification except as may be represented by the requesting party,
 (ii) there are no uncured defaults in the requesting party's performance, and
 (iii) if Lessor is the requesting party, not more than one month's rent has
 been paid in advance.

     (c) If Lessor desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Office Building
 Project, or any part thereof, Lessee hereby agrees to deliver to any lender or
 purchaser designated by Lessor such financial statements of Lessee as may be
 reasonably required by such lender or purchaser; provided, however, that prior
 to such delivery Lessee shall have received from Lessor, and such lender or
 buyer, as applicable, a commercially reasonable confidential agreement
 executed by such party or parties. Such statements shall include the past
 three (3) years financial statements of Lessee. All such financial statements
 shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and
 shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and
 shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth.

 17. LESSOR'S LIABILITY. The term "Lessor" as used herein shall mean only the
 owner or owners at the time in question of the fee title or a lessee's
 interest in a ground lease of the Office Building Project, and except as
 expressly provided in paragraph 15, in the event of any transfer of such title
 or interest. Lessor herein named (and in case of any subsequent transfers then
 the grantor) shall be relieved from and after the date of such transfer of all
 liability as respects Lessor's obligations thereafter to be performed,
 provided that any funds in the hands of Lessor or the then grantor at the time
 of such transfer, in which Lessee has an interest, shall be delivered to the
 grantee.  The obligations contained in this Lease to be performed by Lessor
 shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on Lessor's successors and assigns,
 only during their respective periods of ownership.

 18. SEVERABILITY. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease as determined
 by a court of competent jurisdiction shall in no way affect the validity of
 any other provision hereof.

 20. TIME OF ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to the obligations to
 be performed under this Lease.

 21. ADDITIONAL RENT. All monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the
 terms of this Lease, including but not limited to Lessee's Share of Operating

                                           24
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 Expense increase and any other expenses payable by Lessee hereunder shall be
 deemed to be rent.

 22. INCORPORATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS: AMENDMENTS. This Lease contains all
 agreements of the parties with respect to any matter mentioned herein. No
 prior or contemporaneous agreement or understanding pertaining to any such
 matter shall be effective. This Lease may be modified in writing only, signed
 by the parties in interest at the time of the modification. Except as
 otherwise stated in this Lease, Lessee hereby acknowledges that neither the
 real estate broker listed in paragraph 15 hereof nor any cooperating broker on
 this transaction nor the Lessor or any employee or agents or any of said
 persons has made any oral or written warranties or representations to Lessee
 relative to the condition or use by Lessee of the Premises or the Office
 Building Project and Lessee acknowledges that Lessee assumes all
 responsibility regarding the Occupational Safety Health Act, the legal use and
 adaptability of the Premises and the compliance thereof with all applicable
 laws and regulations in effect during the term of this Lease.

 23. NOTICES. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be
 in writing and may be given by personal delivery or by certified or registered
 mail. Mailed notices shall be deemed given upon actual receipt at the address
 required, or forty-eight hours following deposit in the mail, postage prepaid,
 whichever first occurs. Either party may by notice to the other specify a
 different address. A copy of all notices required or permitted to be given to
 Lessor hereunder shall be concurrently transmitted to such party or parties at
 such addresses as Lessor may from time to time hereafter designate by notice
 to Lessee.

 24. WAIVERS. No waiver by Lessor of any provision hereof shall be deemed a
 waiver of any other provision hereof of any subsequent breach by Lessee of the
 same or any other provision. Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any act
 shall not be deemed to rendered necessary the obtaining of Lessor's consent to
 or approval of any subsequent act by Lessee. The acceptance of rent hereunder
 by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any preceding breach by Lessee of any
 provision hereof, other than the failure of Lessee to pay the particular rent
 so accepted regardless of Lessor's knowledge of such preceding breach at the
 time of acceptance of such rent.

 25. RECORDING. Either Lessor or Lessee shall, upon request of the other,
 execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other a "short form" memorandum of
 this Lease for recording purposes.

 27. CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No remedy or election hereunder shall be deemed
 exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies
 at law or in equity.

 28. COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS. Each provision of this Lease performable by
 Lessee shall be deemed both a covenant and a condition.

 29. BINDING EFFECT: CHOICE OF LAW. Subject to any provisions hereof

                                           25

 <PAGE>

 restricting assignment or subletting by Lessee and subject to the provisions
 of paragraph 17, this Lease shall bind the parties, their personal
 representatives, successors and assigns. This Lease shall be governed by the
 laws of the State where the Office Building Project is located and any
 litigation concerning this Lease between the parties hereto shall be initiated
 in the county in which the Office Building Project is located.

 30. SUBORDINATION.

     (a) This Lease, and any Option or right of first refusal granted hereby,
 at Lessor's option, shall be subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage, deed
 of trust, or any other hypothecation or security now or hereafter placed upon
 the Office Building Project and to any and all advances made on the security
 thereof and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
 extensions thereof. Notwithstanding such subordination, Lessee's right to
 quiet possession of the Premises in accordance with this Lease shall not be
 disturbed if Lessee is not in default and so long as Lessee shall pay the rent
 and observe and perform all of the provisions of this Lease, unless this Lease
 is otherwise terminated pursuant to its terms. If any mortgagee, trustee or
 ground lessor shall elect to have this Lease and any Options granted hereby
 prior to the lien of its mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease, and shall
 give written notice thereof to Lessee, this Lease and such Options shall be
 deemed prior to such mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease, whether this
 Lease or such Options are dated prior or subsequent to the date of said
 mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease or the date of recording thereof.

     (b) Lessee agrees to execute any documents required to effectuate an
 attornment, a subordination, or to make this Lease or any Option granted
 herein prior to the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease, as
 the case may be. Lessee's failure to execute such documents within ten (10)
 business days after written demand shall constitute a material default by
 Lessee hereunder without further notice to Lessee or, at Lessor's option.
 Lessor shall execute such documents on behalf of Lessee as Lessee's
 attorney-in-fact. Lessee does hereby make, constitute and irrevocably appoint
 Lessor as Lessee's attorney-in-fact and in Lessee's name, place and stead, to
 execute such documents in accordance with this paragraph 30(b).

 31. ATTORNEYS' FEES.

     31.1 If either party or the broker(s) named herein bring an action to
 enforce the terms hereof or declare rights hereunder, the prevailing party in
 any such action, trial or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to his reasonable
 attorneys' fees to be paid by the losing party as fixed by the court in the
 same or a separate suit, and whether or not such action is pursued to decision
 or judgment. The provisions of this paragraph shall inure to the benefit of
 the broker named herein who seeks to enforce a right hereunder.

     31.2 The attorneys' fee award shall not be computed in accordance with any
 court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys'
 fees reasonably incurred in good faith.

 32. LESSOR'S ACCESS.

     32.1 Lessor and Lessor's agents shall have the right to enter the Premises
 at reasonable times on reasonable notice for the purpose of inspecting the
 same, performing any service required of Lessor, showing the same to
 prospective purchasers, lenders, or lessees, taking such safety measures,
 erecting such scaffolding or other necessary structures, making such
 alterations, repairs, improvements or additions to the Premises or to the
 Office Building Project as Lessor may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
 and the erecting, using and maintaining of utilities, services, pipes and
 conduits through the Premises and/or other premises as long as there is no 
 unreasonable adverse effect to Lessee's use of or any decrease in the size of,
 the Premises. Lessor may at any time place on or about the Building any
 ordinary "For Sale" signs and Lessor may at any time during the last 120 days
 of the term hereof place on or about the Building any ordinary "For Lease"
 signs. Lessors shall minimize interfering with Lessee's use of the Premises in
 the exercise of its rights under this Paragraph.

     32.2 All activities of Lessor pursuant to this paragraph shall be without
 abatement of rent, nor shall Lessor have any liability to Lessee for the same.



  
    32.3 Lessor shall have the right to retain keys to the Premises and to
 unlock all doors in or upon the Premises other than to files, vaults and
 sales, and in the case of emergency to enter the Premises by any reasonably
 appropriate means, and any such entry shall not be deemed a forceable or
 unlawful entry or detainer of the Premises or an eviction. Lessee waives any
 charges for damages or injuries or interference with Lessee's property or
 business in connection therewith.

 33.AUCTIONS. Lessee shall not conduct, nor permit to be conducted, either
 voluntarily or involuntarily any auction upon the Premises or the Common Areas
 without first having obtained Lessor's prior written consent. Notwithstanding
 anything to the contrary in this Lease, Lessor shall not be obligated to
 exercise any standard of reasonableness in determining whether to grant such
 consent. The holding of any auction on the Premises or Common Areas in
 violation of this paragraph shall constitute a material default of this Lease.

 34.SIGNS. Subject to Paragraph 63 of the Addendum, Lessee shall not place any 
 sign upon the Premises or the Office Building Project without Lessor's prior 
 written consent.  Under no circumstances shall Lessee place a sign on any roof 
 of the Office Building Project.

 35.MERGER. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Lessee, or a
 mutual cancellation thereof, or a termination by Lessor, shall not work a
 merger, and shall, at the option of Lessor, terminate all or any existing
 subtenancies or may, at the option of Lessor, operate as an assignment to
 Lessor of any or all of such subtenancies.

 observing and performing all of the covenants, conditions and provisions on
 Lessee's part to be observed and performed hereunder. Lessee shall have quiet
 possession of the Premises for the entire term hereof subject to all of the
 provisions of this Lease. The individuals executing this Lease on behalf of
 Lessor represent and warrant to Lessee that they are fully authorized and
 legally capable of executing this Lease on behalf of Lessor and that such
 execution is binding upon all parties holding an ownership interest in the
 Office Building Project.

 40.SECURITY MEASURES--LESSOR'S RESERVATIONS.

    40.1 Lessee hereby acknowledges that Lessor shall have no obligation
 whatsoever to provide guard service or other security measures for the benefit
 of the Premises or the Office Building Project. Lessee assumes all 
 responsibility for the protection of Lessee, its agents, and invitees and the 
 property of Lessee and of Lessee's agents and invitees from acts of third 
 parties. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Lessor, at Lessor's sole 
 option, from providing security protection for the Office Building Project or 
 any part thereof, in which event the cost thereof shall be included within the 
 definition of Operating Expenses, as set forth in paragraph 4.2(b).

    40.2 Lessor shall have the following rights:

 herein;

         (d) To place such signs, notices or displays as Lessor reasonably
 deems necessary or advisable upon the roof, exterior of the buildings or the
 Office Building Project or on pole signs in the Common Areas;

         (b) Suffer or permit anyone, except in emergency, to go upon the roof
 of the Building except as permitted by this Lease.

 41. EASEMENTS.

   41.1 Lessor reserves to itself the right, from time to time, to grant such
 easements, rights and dedications that Lessor deems necessary or desirable,
 and to cause the recordation of Parcel Maps and restrictions, so long as such
 easements, rights, dedications, Maps and restrictions do not unreasonably
 interfere with the use of the Premises or the Common Areas by Lessee. Lessee
 shall sign any of the aforementioned documents (provided same shall create no
 obligations or liability of Lessee) upon request of Lessor and failure to do
 so shall constitute a material default of this Lease by Lessee without the
 need for further notice to Lessee.

 41.2 The temporary obstruction of Lessee's view, air, or light by any
 structure erected in the vicinity of the Building by third parties, shall in
 no way affect this Lease or impose any liability upon Lessor.

 42.PERFORMANCE UNDER PROTEST. If at any time a dispute shall arise as to any
 amount or sum of money to be paid by one party to the other under the
 provisions hereof, the party against whom the obligation to pay the money is
 asserted shall have the right to make payment "under protest" and such payment
 shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment, and there shall survive the
 right on the part of said party to institute suit for recovery of such sum if
 it shall be adjudged that there was no legal obligation on the part of said
 party to pay such sum or any part thereof said party shall be entitled to
 recover such sum or so much thereof as it was not legally required to pay
 under the provisions of this Lease.

                           ADDENDUM TO STANDARD OFFICE LEASE -
                                GROSS


 THIS ADDENDUM TO STANDARD OFFICE LEASE - GROSS ("Addendum") is made and
 entered into by and between VALENCIA PARAGON ASSOCIATES, LTD., a California
 Limited Partnership ("Lessor"), and UNISTAR COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC., a
 Delaware corporation ("Lessee"), as of the date set forth on the first page of
 that certain Standard Office Lease - Gross (the "Lease") between Lessor and
 Lessee to which this Addendum is attached and incorporated.  The terms,
 covenants and conditions set forth herein are intended to and shall have the
 same force and effect as if set forth at length in the body of the Lease.  To
 the extent that the provisions of this Addendum are inconsistent with any
 provisions of the Lease, the provisions of this Addendum shall supersede and
 control.

 50.  Improvements by Lessor.

 (a)  Scope of Improvements.  Lessor and Lessee hereby acknowledge and agree
 that the Premises shall be constructed by Lessor on a "turn-key" basis, at
 Lessor's expense (the "Lessee Improvements"), in accordance with the
 procedures set forth herein.

 (b)  Space Plans and Final Plans.  If the plans and specifications attached
 hereto, if any, are the final plans for the Lessee Improvements, as approved
 by Lessor in writing, such final plans and specifications shall be hereinafter
 referred to as the "Final Plans" and the remainder of this Paragraph shall be
 inoperative.  Otherwise, Lessee shall cause Lessee's architect to prepare, at
 Lessee's cost (which cost shall be reimbursed by Lessor up to a total of Three
 Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty-Three and 48/100 Dollars ($3,783.48), a detailed
 space plan sufficient to convey the architectural design of the Premises,
 including without limitation, the location of doors, partitions, electrical
 and telephone outlets, plumbing fixtures, heavy floor loads and other special
 requirements, together with reflective ceiling plans ("Lessee's Space Plans"). 
 If Lessor shall disapprove of any portion of Lessee's Space Plans, Lessor
 shall advise Lessee of those revisions, and the reasons therefor, reasonably
 required by Lessor.  Lessee shall then submit to Lessor, for Lessor's
 approval, a redesign of Lessee's Space Plans, incorporating the revisions
 required by Lessor, as modified by Lessee, which modifications must be
 approved by Lessor.  Based upon such approved Lessee's Space Plans, Lessor at
 its cost shall prepare specifications and working drawings for the
 construction of any Lessee Improvements (the "Final Plans"). Thereafter,
 Lessor shall deliver the Final Plans to Lessee, and within six (6) business
 days after Lessee's receipt thereof, Lessee shall notify Lessor in writing of
 either Lessee's approval or disapproval thereof, including any corrections or
 changes required by Lessee to the Final Plans.  Lessor shall cause Lessor's
 architect to prepare and deliver to Lessee, at Lessor's cost, revised Final
 Plans which incorporate Lessee's proposed changes, provided such proposed
 changes (i) are reasonable, and (ii) are made in good-faith and with

                                           33
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 particularity and precision.  In the event Lessor does not receive written
 notice from Lessee for any requested changes to the Final Plans within the
 time period specified herein, the Final Plans shall be conclusively deemed
 approved by Lessee.

 (c)  Procedure for Construction of Lessee Improvements.
 Following final approval of the Final Plans, Lesser shall rely upon the Final
 Plans and use Lessor's commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Lessee
 Improvements described in the Final Plans prior to March 15, 1992.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, the
 "Commencement Date" shall be the later of March 15, 1992 or the date which is
 three (3) days following Lessor's notice to Lessee that the Lessee
 Improvements have been "substantially completed" (as defined below) and Lessor
 tenders possession of the Premises to Lessee.  The Term of this Lease shall
 expire on the last day of the month in which occurs the tenth (10th)
 anniversary of the Commencement Date (the "Expiration Date").  For the
 purposes of this Paragraph only, the Lessee Improvements shall be conclusively
 deemed "substantially completed" when all Lessee Improvements described in the
 Final Plans are completed as certified by Lessor's architect, except for minor
 items (e.g., "punch-list" items) which can be completed by Lessor after the
 Commencement Date of the Term with only minor interference with the conduct of
 Lessee's business in the Premises.  In the event that Lessor has not
 substantially completed the Lessee Improvements by the "Outside Date", which
 shall br March 15, 1992, as such date may be extended by the number of days of
 Force Majeure delays (as defined below) (up to a maximum of sixty (60) days of
 Force Majeure Delays) or Lessee Delays, which number(s) shall be disclosed to
 Lessee in a written notice from Lessor's contractor promptly upon learning of
 the delay, then Lessee shall be entitled to receive one additonal day of free
 Base Rent for every day that the Lessee Improvements are not substantially
 completed thereafter, and furthur, if the Lessee Improvements are not
 substantially completed by the "Outside Date", as such date is extended by the
 number of days of Force Majeure Delays and/or Lessee Delays, then the sole
 remedy of Lessee shall be the right to deliver a notice to the Lessor (the
 "Termination Notice") electing to terminate this Lease effective upon receipt
 of the Termination Notice by Lessor (the "Effective Date").  Except as
 provided herein below, the Termination Notice must be delivered by Lessee to
 Lessor, if at all, not earlier than the Outside Date , as extended, and not
 later than ten (10) business days after the Outside Date, as extended, and
 upon the effective termination of this Lease any money paid by Lessee to
 Lessor with respect to this Lease shall be refunded to Lessee.  If Lessee
 elects not to terminate this Lease, as set forth above (i) Lessor shall
 continue to construct the Lessee Improvements to completion, (ii) Lessee shall
 be entitled to receive the Base Rent abatement set forth above in this
 Paragraph 50(c) and (iii) if the Lessee Improvements are not substantially
 completed by the forty-fifth (45th) day following the Outside Date as
 extended, Lessee shall again have the right to terminate this Lease within ten
 (10) business days following that forty-fifth (45th) day.
 "Force Majeure Delays" shall mean and refer to a period of delay or delays
 encountered by Lessor affecting the work of construction of the Lessee
 Improvements because of delays due to excess time in obtaining governmental

                                           34
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 permits or approvals beyond the time period normally required to obtain such
 permits or approvals for similar space similarly improved in comparable
 buildings (if not caused by Lessor's act or failure to act); fire, earthquake
 or other acts of God; acts of public enemy; riot; insurrection; governmental
 regulations of the sales of materials and supplies or the transportation
 therof; strikes or boycotts; shortages of material or labor or any other cause
 beyond a reasonable control of Lessor. 

 (d)  Changes.  If Lessee requests any change, addition or alteration to the
 Final Plans or in Lessor's construction and completion of the Lessee
 Improvements ("Changes"), Lessor shall promptly give Lessee an estimate of the
 cost of such Changes and the resulting delay (if any) in the delivery of the
 Premises to Lessee.  Within three (3) business days after Lessee's receipt of
 such written estimate from Lessor, Lessee shall give Lessor written notice
 indicating whether or not Lessee elects to proceed with any such Changes.  If
 Lessee elects to proceed with such Changes Lessor shall, at Lessee's sole cost
 and expense, promptly make such Changes.  If Lessee elects not to proceed with
 such Changes or fails to timely notify Lessor of Lessee's election within such
 three (3) business day period, Lessor shall complete the Lessee Improvements
 in the Premises without making such Changes.  Any delay caused by Lessee's
 request for such Changes or the construction of such Changes, shall not, in
 any event, delay the Commencement Date, which shall occur on the date it would
 have occurred but for such Changes.

 (e)  Unavoidable Delays.  If the performance by Lessor of any act required
 herein or elsewhere in the Lease is prevented or delayed by reason of strikes,
 lockouts, labor disputes, governmental delays, acts of God, fire, floods,
 earthquake, epidemics, freight embargoes; unavailability of materials and
 supplies, development moratoriums imposed by any governmental authority, or
 any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Lessor (including any "Lessee
 Delay" (as hereinafter defined)), Lessor shall be excused from performance for
 the time period equal to the time period of the prevention or delay.

 (f)  Lessee Delays.  To the extent that the Commencement Date has not occurred
 because Lessor was delayed in substantially completing the Lessee Improvements
 as a result of the following (collectively, "Lessee Delays"):

       (i)    Lessee's failure to complete any action item on or before the
 due date which is the responsibility of Lessee to complete, or

      (ii)    Lessee's request for Changes or the construction of such Changes
 by Lessor, or

      (iii)    Lessee's untimely request for materials, finishes, or
 installations requiring long lead times, or

      (iv)    Any delay by Lessee in making any payment(s) to Lessor, or

      (v)    Any act or failure to act by Lessee, Lessee's employees, agents,
 architects, independent contractors, consultants and/or any other person

                                           35
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 performing or required to perform services on behalf of Lessee, then as soon
 as reasonably possible following the Commencement Date, Lessor shall deliver
 to Lessee a reasonably detailed statement of the net number of days of Lessee
 Delays, determined on a critical path basis, and Lessee shall pay to Lessor,
 as additional rent under the Lease, the product of the per diem monthly rent
 payable by Lessee for the Premises multiplied by the number of days that such
 Lessee Delays caused the Commencement Date to be delayed, such payment to be
 made to Lessor within thirty (30) days after Lessee's receipt of Lessor's

 <PAGE>

 access or work shall or may interfere with construction of the Lessee
 Improvements, detrimentally affect Lessor's ability to comply with its
 commitments for substantially completing the Lessee Improvements, or cause
 labor difficulties, Lessor and/or Lessor's general contractor shall have the
 right to order any or all Lessee's Fixturizing Work to cease upon twenty-four
 (24) hours notice, and Lessee shall immediately comply with such order, and if
 necessary, remove from the Premises all of its tools, equipment and materials.

      (ii)    Lessee shall:  (A) furnish Lessor with sufficient evidence that

 fees and court costs) by reason of damage to the Project, Building, Premises
 or the property of others Indoor personal injury, including death, which may
 arise from Lessee's access and Lessee's fixturizing Work pursuant to this
 Subparagraph 50(h), whether caused by Lessee, Lessee's contractor or any
 subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them.   The
 provisions of Paragraphs 8.7 of the Lease and Addendum Paragraph 70 regarding
 indemnification are expressly incorporated herein by this reference.
      
 (i)   Cleaning.  Lessor agrees to thoroughly clean, as necessary, the Premises

 (j)  Notice of Lease Term Dates.   Once the actual Commencement Date is

 (k)   Deposit for Tennant Improvements.   Notwithstanding anything to the
 contrary set forth in this Lease, upon execution hereof, Lessee shall deposit
 Two Hundred Twenty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($220,000.00) ("Initial Tenant
 Improvement Deposit") in cash into an escrow account ("Escrow Account") with
 an escrow agent ("Escrow Agent") and pursuant to an escrow agreement mutually
 acceptable to Lessor and Lessee, which Initial Tenant Improvement Deposit
 amount is an estimate of the cost to be incurred by Lessor for construction of
 the Tenant Improvements, and related occupancy costs, through and including
 January 31, 1992.  If, and only if, Lessee and that certain banking group
 headed by Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. ("Bank Group"), with which Lessee is
 currently negotiating a restructuring of Lessee's debt, have not executed an
 agreement evidencing such restructuring (the "Restructuring Agreement") on or

                                           37
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 before February 1, 1992, Lessee shall deposit in the Escrow Account commencing
 February 1, 1992, and every fourteen (14) days thereafter, an amount equal to
 one-half (1/2) of the estimated costs to be incurred by Lessor in construction
 of the Tenant Improvements, as reasonably determined by Lessor and
 communicated to Lessee in writing, for the fourteen (14) day period
 immediately following the applicable deposit date (collectively, "Secondary
 Tenant Improvement Deposit"); provided that in no event shall the Secondary
 Tenant Deposit exceed the aggregate amount of $259,205.00.  The Initial Tenant
 Improvement Deposit and the Secondary Tenant Improvement Deposit shall
 hereinafter be referred to as the "Total Tenant Improvement Deposit".  In the
 event Lessee and the Bank Group execute the Restructuring Agreement on or
 before March 31, 1992, then, in such event, Lessor and Lessee shall each
 deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
 release the Total Tenant Improvement Deposit to Lessee.  In the event,
 however, that the Restructuring Agreement is not mutually executed on or
 before March 31, 1992, Lessor and Lessee shall deliver written instructions to
 the Escrow Holder directing the Escrow Holder to release the Total Tenant
 Improvement Deposit to Lessor, and Lessor shall thereafter hold the Total
 Tenant Improvement Deposit as security for Lessee's timely performance of its
 obligations under this Lease until such time as Lessor receives written notice
 from Lessee and confirmation from the Bank Group that the Restructuring
 Agreement has been executed by Lessee and the Bank Group.  Within three (3)
 business days following receipt of such notice, Lessor shall deliver to Lessee
 the Total Tenant Improvement Deposit, including any interest accrued thereon,
 to Lessee; provided, however, if at any time during the then remaining Term
 Lessee defaults under the Restructuring Agreement, whether material or
 otherwise, Lessee shall deliver to Lessor written notice of such default
 within three (3) business days of the date of the default, and shall deliver
 to Lessor within seven (7) additional business days an amount equal to six (6)
 times the then current monthly Base Rent due under this Lease, which amount
 shall be held by Lessor as security for Lessee's timely performance of its
 obligations under this Lease until such time as Lessor receives written notice
 from the Bank Group (or an agent of the Bank Group) that said default has been
 cured or waived, at which time Lessor shall, within ten (10) business days of
 such notice, return such amount to Lessee.  The failure of Lessee to perform
 any of its obligations under this Paragraph 50(k) shall constitute a material
 default under this Lease.

 51.  Abatement of Base Rent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
 forth in Paragraph 1 of this Lease, and provided that Lessee has performed all
 of the terms and conditions of this Lease, following the giving of any
 required notice and the expiration of the applicable cure period, Lessor
 hereby agrees to abate Lessee's obligation to pay Base Rent for months two
 (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), six (6), seven (7), eight (8), and nine
 (9) of the Term.  Lessee shall still be responsible for the payment of all
 other amounts payable by Lessee under this Lease.  In the event of a default
 by Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and Landlord's subsequent
 termination of this Lease, as part of the recovery permitted by Lessee, Lessor
 shall be entitled to recover the Base Rent which is abated hereunder.


                                           38

 52.   Parking.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
 Paragraph 2.2 of the Lease, in addition to the space allocated to Lessee,
 Lessee may be entitled to use, during the Term, the parking areas associated
 with the Premises for parking by Lessee, and Lessee's employees, visitors and
 customers, subject to any rules and regulations promulgated by or parking fees
 charged by Lessor (which fees for Lessee shall be free during the initial term
 of this Lease), as the same may be established from time to time.  All
 responsibility for damage and theft to vehicles is assumed by Lessee and
 Lessee's employees, visitors and customers. Lessee shall repair or cause to be
 repaired, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, any and all damage to the
 Building and the Office Building Project caused by Lessee's, or Lessee's
 employees', visitors', or customers' use of such parking areas therein.

 53.  Base Rent Increase.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
 in Paragraphs 1.6 and 1.7 of the Lease and commencing and effective upon the
 first day of the sixtieth (60th) month after the Commencement Date (the "Rent
 Adjustment Date") the Base Rent payable by Lessee to Lessor (in accordance
 with Paragraph 4.1 of the Lease) shall be adjusted to $52,294.00 per month
 (i.e.,$1.6586 per rentable square foot on the Premises).


 54.   Operating Expenses.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
 in the Lease:

 (a)  Lessee shall pay Lessee's Share of the Operating Expense Increase for
 each calendar year of the Term (as estimated by Lessor); provided, however,
 that Lessee's Share of Operating Expense Increase shall not increase by more
 than thirteen percent (13%), cumulative and compounded, from year to year.
 Lessor shall notify Lessee of such estimate at the outset of each calendar
 year of the Term, and such estimate shall be payable by Lessee in monthly
 installments concurrently with Lessee's monthly payments of Base Rent (in
 accordance with the Lease).  Lessor may increase such estimate (not more often
 than once in any given year of the Term), in good-faith, and Lessee shall pay
 the difference between what Lessee would have paid had such estimate been in
 effect from the outset of such calendar year and what Lessee actually paid,
 and Lessee's subsequent monthly installments of such payments shall likewise
 be adjusted to reflect such increase.  Following the end of each calendar year
 of the Term, Lessor shall determine and notify Lessee in writing of the actual
 Operating Expenses incurred by Lessor for the Building and for the Office
 Building Project.  If the actual Operating Expenses exceed the estimated
 expenses, Lessee shall pay the difference to Lessor concurrent with Lessee's
 next monthly installment of Base Rent.  If the estimated expenses exceed the
 actual Operating Expenses, Lessor shall credit the difference against Lessee's
 next monthly installment of Rent.  Lessor's failure to notify Lessee of
 Lessee's estimate of the Operating Expenses prior to the Commencement Date of
 the Term or prior to the commencement of any calendar year of the Term, shall
 not foreclose Lessor from collecting, following such notification, those
 estimated Operating Expenses, which expenses (or balance) shall be due
 concurrently with Lessee's next monthly installment of rent; provided,
 however, that if Lessor fails to notify Lessee of Lessee's estimated Operating

                                           39
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 Expenses for the upcoming calendar year, Lessee shall continue to pay such
 Operating Expenses in effect for the prior calendar year until such time as
 Lessee is notified in writing of Lessor's estimate for the then-current
 calendar year.  Operating Expenses for a partial month shall be prorated based
 on a three hundred sixty (360) day calendar year.

 (b)  "Operating Expenses" shall be defined to include all expenses set forth
 in Paragraph 4.2(d) of the Lease and all reasonable expenses incurred by
 Lessor in operating, maintaining and repairing the Building and the Office
 Building Project, as determined by standard accounting practices, including,
 but not limited to:  rent taxes, gross receipts taxes (whether assessed
 against Lessor or assessed against Lessee and paid by Lessor, or both); water
 and sewer charges; the cost of janitorial services, security and labor;
 surcharges or any other costs levied, assessed or imposed by, or at the
 direction of, or resulting from statutes or regulations promulgated by any
 federal, state or local governmental authority in connection with the use or
 occupancy of the Building or the Office Building Project; the cost (amortized
 over the reasonably anticipated useful life of the asset, together with
 interest at the prevailing prime rate plus two percent (2%) on the unamortized
 balance) of (i) any capital improvements made to the Building or the Office
 Building Project by Lessor to the extent such capital improvements reduce
 Operating Expenses or which are made to the Building or the Office Building
 Project by Lessor after the commencement date of the Term as required pursuant
 to any law or regulation that was not applicable at the time they were
 constructed, or (ii) replacement of any equipment needed to operate the
 Building at a consistent level or quality, but only in the event that such
 equipment (A) is malfunctioning or non-functioning and the repair of such
 equipment would not be economically feasible when compared to the cost of
 replacement, or (B) is otherwise due for replacement in the ordinary course of
 its reasonably anticipated useful life; costs incurred in the management of
 the Building or the Office Building Project, if any, including a fair market
 management fee, supplies, wages and salaries of employees used in the
 management, operation and maintenance of the Building and the Office Building
 Project, and payroll taxes and similar governmental charges with respect
 thereto; the cost of air-conditioning, waste disposal, heating and
 ventilating; the cost of elevator maintenance, supplies, materials, equipment
 and tools; the reasonable costs of repair and maintenance of the Building and
 the Office Building Project, including payroll expenses and rental of personal
 property used in connection therewith; reasonable costs of gardening and
 landscaping; reasonable costs of maintaining signs; personal property taxes
 levied on or attributable to personal property used in connection with the
 operation, maintenance and repair of the Building or the Office Building
 Project; reasonable audit or verification fees; and the costs of lighting,
 cleaning, refuse removal and similar items, including appropriate reserves, of
 the Building and the Office Building Project.  Operating Expenses shall not
 include depreciation on the Building or the Office Building Project or any
 equipment therein, Lessor's executives' salaries or any real estate brokers
 commissions, legal fees, judgments, financing expenses, debt service or ground
 rent.  Furthermore, real property taxes shall not include increases in real

 It is understood that Operating Costs shall be adjusted for 95% occupancy in
 the Base Year and each Comparison Year, and shall be reduced by all cash
 discounts, trade discounts or quantity discounts received by Lessor or
 Lessor's managing agent in the purchase of any goods, utilities or services in
 connection with the operation of the Office Building Project.  Lessor shall
 make payments for goods, utilities or services in connection with the
 operation of the Office Building Project.  Lessor shall make payments for
 goods, utilities and services in a timely manner to obtain the maximum
 possible discount.  If Capital items which are customarily purchased by Lessee
 of first class office buildings in Los Angeles County are leased, rather than
 purchased by Lessor the decision by Lessor to lease the item in question shall
 not serve to increase Lessee's proportionate share of Operating costs beyond
 that which would have applied had the item in question been purchased. In the
 calculation of any expense hereunder it is understood that no expense shall be
 charged more than once.  Lessor shall use its best efforts to effect an
 equitable proration of bills for services rendered to the Office Building
 Project and to any other property owned by Lessor.  Lessor agrees to keep
 books and records showing the Operating Costs in accordance with a systems of
 accounts and accounting practices consistently maintained on a year to year
 basis.

 (d)  In the event Lessee shall dispute the amount set forth on any statement,
 Lessee shall have the right, by providing notice not later than ninety (90)
 days following receipt of such statement and commencing such audit within 180
 days after receipt of such statement, to cause Lessor's books and records with
 respect to the preceding calendar year to be audited by a certified public
 accountant mutually acceptable to Lessor and Lessee.

 (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Lease, because
 of Lessee's seven days per week, twenty-four hours per day operations in the
 Premises, the amount payable by Lessee for utilities and other services
 pursuant to Paragraph ll of the Lease shall be determined as follows:

      (i)    Since (A) the Tenant on the second (2nd) floor of the Building
 has a normal business installation and uses its premises only during normal
 business hours (8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday) and (B) the
 Building will, other than for that Tenant, be vacant during the period of
 January l, 1992 through March 1, 1992, the utility usage during that period,
 as measured by the utility meters for the Building, shall be determined and
 divided by the rentable square feet occupied by such second (2nd) floor tenant
 to determine normal hours utility usage per square foot (Per Foot Rate").

      





      (ii)    For each month of the Term, Lessee shall pay to Lessor, pursuant
 to Paragraph 11 of the Lease, the costs of all such utilities and services

                                           43
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 attributable to the Building which are in excess of the product of the total
 square footage of the Building multiplied by the Per Foot Rate.  Lessor
 acknowledges and agrees that any utility or service charges paid for by Lessee
 pursuant to the terms of this Paragraph 54(e) shall be excluded from the
 definition of Operating Expenses payable by Lessee pursuant to Paragraph 54(a)
 of this Addendum.

      (iii)    If in any year during the Term, the nature of other occupants
 of the Building changes so that the utilities or services included within the
 Per Foot Rate concept described above are used beyond normal business hours or
 for other than a normal office installation by any other occupant of the
 Building, or the rates charged for such utilities or services change from the
 rates reflected in the Per Foot Rate, then prior to Lessee's continuation of
 its payment for utilities and services in accordance with this Paragraph 54,
 Lessor and Lessee shall agree on a reasonable adjustment to the procedure for
 calculating Lessee's obligations with respect to such utility and service
 charges in order to take into account such extra usage or rate changes.  Such
 adjustment shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles.

 (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, Lessor
 shall use its good faith efforts, in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles, to allocate the costs of over-standard Operating
 Expenses directly to third-party tenants of the Office Building Project, when
 such over-standard usage, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, is attributable to
 such third-party tenants.

 55.  Lessee's Environmental Compliance.  Notwithstanding anything to the
 contrary set forth in Paragraph 6.1 of the Lease, Lessee hereby agrees to use
 the Premises in accordance with the following:

 (a)  "Hazardous Materials" shall mean any substance, material, waste, gas or
 particulate matter which is regulated by any local, state or federal
 authority, including, but not limited to, petroleum; radioactive material; any
 material or substance designated or defined as a 'Hazardous Substance", "Toxic
 Substance" or "Hazardous Waste" in Section 25117 of the Health and Safety Code
 of the State of California, or under any successor or other provision of
 California law, Section 311 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C., Section 1251 et
 seq.), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
 Act of 1980, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Hazardous
 Materials Transportation Act, and all other laws and ordinances governing
 similar matters now or hereinafter enacted, or any regulations adopted or
 publications promulgated pursuant thereto (hereinafter collectively referred
 to as the "Regulations")."Hazardous Materials Activities" shall mean the use,
 generation, storage, disposal and/or transportation of Hazardous Materials by
 Lessee, or Lessee's employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees.

 (b)  Lessee shall not conduct or cause to be conducted any Hazardous Materials
 Activities on, under or about the Premises without receiving Lessor's prior
 written consent, which consent Lessor may withhold in Lessor's sole and

                                           44
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 absolute discretion or revoke at any time.  If Lessor consents to any such
 Hazardous Materials Activities, Lessee shall conduct such Hazardous Materials
 Activities in strict compliance (at Lessee's sole cost and expense) with all
 applicable Regulations, using all necessary and appropriate precautions.

 (c)  Lessee shall indemnify, protect and defend Lessor, with counsel
 acceptable to Lessor, against and hold Lessor harmless from any claims,
 damages, costs and liability (including actual attorneys' fees and costs, and
 court costs) arising out of any Hazardous Materials Activities.  Lessor and
 Lessor's representatives and employees may enter the Premises, at any time,
 during the Term in order to inspect Lessee's compliance herewith.  The
 foregoing indemnification of Lessor shall survive the expiration or any
 earlier termination of the Lease.

 (d)  Lessor hereby represents that Lessor does not know of, nor does Lessor
 have reasonable cause to believe, that any release of Hazardous Materials has
 come to be located on or beneath the Premises, Building, or Office building
 Project.

  56.  Maintenance. Repair and Alterations.

 (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Paragraph 7.2 of
 the Lease, all repair and maintenance of the Premises required by Lessee under
 the Lease shall be paid for solely by Lessee and shall be performed by
 contractors and other personnel approved by Lessor, and all costs and expenses
 incurred by Lessor for Lessor's performance of any of Lessee's obligations
 hereunder shall constitute "additional rent" under the Lease, payable by
 Lessee in accordance with Paragraph 7.2(b) of the Lease.

 (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Paragraph 7.1 of
 the Lease, Lessor shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
 foundation, exterior walls, roof structure and other structural portions of
 the Building.  The costs of such maintenance and repair by Lessor (except as
 the result of any negligence or willful misconduct of Lessee, for which Lessee
 shall assume all costs) shall be included within the definition of Operating
 Expenses.  Lessee shall not be entitled to any abatement of rent (except as
 otherwise provided herein) as the result of Lessor's performance of such
 maintenance and repair, and Lessee hereby waives any right to make repairs at
 Lessor's expense under any law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in
 effect.

 (c)  In the event that Lessee fails to obtain and maintain any insurance
 required under the Lease for any reason whatsoever, Lessee shall be
 conclusively deemed to have self-insured such insurance obligations with the
 full waiver of subrogation set forth in the Lease.

 57.  Damage and Destruction.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
 forth in Paragraph 9 of the Lease, Lessee hereby waives the provisions of
 California Civil Code Sections 1932 and 1933, and any successor sections and
 any other statutes which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Lease and

                                           45
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 which relate to the termination of leases when leased property is destroyed,
 and agree that such event shall be governed by the terms of the Lease.

  58.  Assignment and Subletting

 (a)  In connection with any proposed assignment of the Lease or sublease of
 all or any portion of the Premises Lessee shall deliver to Lessor, for
 Lessor's review and written approval, all such information concerning the
 proposed assignee or sublessee as Lessor may reasonably require or request,
 including, but not limited to, any financial statements or other financial
 information and all terms of the proposed assignment or sublease.

 (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Paragraph 12.4 of
 the Lease, Lessor may collect any rent and other consideration received from
 an assignee or sublessee and apply same toward Lessee's obligations under the
 Lease; provided, however, that until a default shall occur in the performance
 of Lessee's obligations under the Lease, Lessee may receive and collect such
 rent and other consideration accruing under any assignment or sublease. Lessee
 hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any assignee or sublessee, upon
 receipt of written notice from Lessor stating that a default exists in the
 performance of Lessee's obligations under the Lease, to pay to Lessor the rent
 due and to become due under the assignment or sublease.  Lessee agrees that
 any assignee or sublessee shall have the right to rely upon any such written
 notice from Lessor, and that such assignee or sublessee shall pay such rent to
 Lessor without any obligation or right to inquire as to whether a default
 exists, and notwithstanding any notice from or claim from Lessee to the
 contrary, Lessee shall have no right or claim against such assignee or
 sublessee or Lessor for any rent and other consideration so paid by such
 assignee or sublessee to Lessor.

 59.  Brokers.  Lessee warrants and represents that Lessee has not dealt with
 any real estate broker or agent in connection with the Lease or its
 negotiation, except for the brokers identified in Paragraph 15 of the Lease
 (if any).  Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor and the Premises harmless
 from and against any and all costs, expenses and liability (including actual
 attorneys' fees and court costs) for any compensation, commission or fees
 claimed by any other real estate broker or agent in  annection with the Lease
 or its negotiation based upon any act    Lessee.  Lessor warrants and
 represents to Lessee that Lessor has not dealt with any real estate broker or
 agent in connection with the Lease or its negotiation, except for the brokers
 identified in Paragraph 15 of the Lease (if any).  Lessor shall indemnify and
 hold Lessee harmless from and against any and all costs, expenses and
 liability (including actual attorneys' fees and court costs) for any
 compensation, commission or fees claimed by any other real estate broker or
 agent in connection with the Lease or its negotiation based upon any act of
 Lessor.

 60.  Limitation on Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
 forth in the Lease, the obligations of Lessor, and Lessor's partners (either
 general or limited), directors, officers and shareholders, under the Lease do

                                           46

 <PAGE>

 not constitute personal obligations.  Lessee, and Lessee's successors and
 assigns, hereby agree not to seek recourse against the personal assets of
 Lessor, or Lessor's partners (either general or limited), directors, officers
 and shareholders, for satisfaction of any actual or alleged liability of
 Lessor to Lessee under the Lease, but Lessee shall look only to Lessor's
 interest in the Building for the satisfaction of any liability of Lessor to
 Lessee hereunder.

 61.  Notices.  Copies of all notices or any other documents required to be
 delivered to either Lessor or Lessee, or both, pursuant to the terms of the
 Lease (including any changes to the addresses of either Lessor or Lessee),
 shall be delivered to the parties, in accordance with Paragraph 23 of the
 Lease,  at the following addresses:

                Los Angeles, California 90071
                Attn: Matthew W. Koart, Esq.

 62.  Holding Over.  If Lessee fails to surrender the Premises upon the
 expiration or earlier termination of the Term without the express written
 consent of Lessor, Lessee shall become a tenant-at-sufferance at a rental rate
 equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly Rent payable by
 Lessee for the month immediately preceding such expiration or earlier
 termination, and Lessee shall remain responsible for the payment of all other
 monetary obligations due and payable by Lessee under the Lease.  Acceptance by
 Lessor of Rent after such expiration or earlier termination of the Term shall
 not result in any renewal of the Term.  The foregoing provisions are in
 addition to and do not affect Lessor's right of re-entry or any other rights
 or remedies of Lessor hereunder or as otherwise provided at law or in equity,
 or both.  If Lessee fails to surrender the Premises upon the expiration or
 earlier termination of the Term despite Lessor's demand to do so, Lessee shall
 indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and against any and all losses, costs,

                                           47
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 damages and liability (including actual attorneys' fees and costs, and court
 costs), direct or indirect, which Lessor may suffer as a result of Lessee's
 failure to surrender the Premises.

 63.  Signage.

 (a)  Lessee shall have the right to install identification signage on the
 parapet near the front of the Building, the exact location of which shall be
 mutually agreed upon by Lessor and Lessee, which signage shall comply with all
 applicable recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions, and all federal,
 state and local laws, zoning regulations, permits, approvals and other
 limitations affecting the Building and/or the Office Building Project.  All of
 Lessee's signage shall be installed and maintained, at Lessee's sole cost and
 expense, pursuant to an installation and maintenance program approved and
 supervised by Lessor. At the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease,
 Lessee shall, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, cause such signage to be
 removed from the Premises and/or the Building, and the Premises and/or the
 Building to be restored to the condition existing prior to Lessee's placement
 of such signage.  If Lessee fails to remove such signage and restore the
 Premises and/or the Building within thirty (30) days after Lessor's written
 request therefor, then Lessor may perform such work, and all costs and
 expenses incurred by Lessor shall be reimbursed by Lessee within ten (10) days
 after Lessee's receipt of Lessor's written demand therefor.  The signage
 rights of Lessee hereunder shall be personal to the original Lessee and may
 not be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity.  Lessor shall
 not authorize or permit any third-party tenant in the Building to construct a
 sign on the front doors of the Building.

 (b)  Lessee, at Lessor's expense, shall also be entitled to one-half of the
 space on the directory board in the lobby of the Building.

 64.  Modification for Lender.  Lessee hereby consents to any changes or
 amendments to the Lease requested by any lender of Lessor having a security
 interest in the Lease or the Premises or the Building, so long as such changes
 do not materially alter the terms of the Lease or otherwise materially
 diminish any rights or materially increase any obligations of Lessee therein.

 65.  Options to Extend.

 (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Lease, Lessor
 hereby grants to Lessee two options (the "Options") to extend the Term of the
 Lease for periods of five  (5) years each (the "Option Terms").  The Options
 must be exercised, if at all, by written notice (the "Option Notice")
 delivered by Lessee to Lessor not later than nine (9) months prior to the end
 of the then-current Term. Further, the Option shall not be deemed to be
 properly exercised if, as of the date of the Option Notice, Lessee is in
 default under the Lease.  Provided Lessee has properly and timely exercised
 the Option, the initial Term shall be extended by the Option Term, and all
 terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease shall remain unmodified and in
 full force and effect, except that the Rent shall be modified as set forth

                                           48
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 below.

 (b)  If Lessee timely and properly exercises the Option(s), all of the terms
 and conditions of the Lease shall apply during the Option Term(s), except that
 the Base Year shall be the first twelve (12) months of each respective Option
 Term, and the Base Monthly Rent for each respective Option Term shall be
 ninety-five percent (95%) of the "fair market" rental rate (as defined in
 Addendum Paragraph 65(c) below) for the Premises at the time of the
 commencement of the applicable Option Term.  Furthermore, Lessor agrees to
 provide new carpet to the Premises and to repaint the Premises at the
 beginning of each Option Term.

 (c)  For the purposes of this Addendum 65 only, "fair-market" rental rate
 shall mean the projected prevailing rental rate as of the commencement date of
 the then applicable Option Term, for similar rentable space situated in
 similar buildings located in the Valencia, California area.  Lessor shall use
 its commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice ("Rent Notice")
 of such fair-market rental rate not later than one (1) month after receipt of
 Option Notice from Lessee.  In the event Lessee objects to the "fair-market"
 rental rate submitted by Lessor, Lessor and Lessee shall attempt in good-faith
 to agree upon such "fair-market" rental rate, using good-faith efforts.  If
 Lessor and Lessee fail to reach agreement on such "fair-market" rental rate
 within thirty (30) days following Lessee's receipt of the Rent Notice (the
 "Outside Agreement Date"), then each party's determination shall be submitted
 to appraisal in accordance with the following:

      (i)    Lessor and Lessee shall each appoint one (1) independent
 appraiser who shall by profession be a real estate broker active over the
 previous five (5) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the
 leasing of commercial properties in the Valencia, California area.  The
 determination of the appraiser shall be limited solely to the issue of whether
 Lessor's or Lessee's submitted "fair-market" rental rate for the Premises is
 closest to the actual "fair-market" rental rate for the Premises as determined
 by the appraisers, taking into account the requirements set forth above. Such
 decision shall be based upon the projected prevailing fair-market rental rate
 as of the commencement date of the applicable Option Term.  Each such
 appraiser shall be appointed within fifteen (15) days after the Outside
 Agreement Date.

      (ii)    The two (2) appraisers so appointed shall within fifteen (15)
 days after the date of the appointment of the last appointed appraiser agree
 upon and appoint a third appraiser who shall be qualified under the same
 criteria set forth above for the initial two (2) appraisers.

      (iii)    The three (3) appraisers shall, within thirty (30) days after
 the appointment of the third appraiser, reach a decision as to whether the
 parties shall use Lessor's or Lessee's submitted "fair-market" rental rate,
 and shall notify Lessor and Lessee in writing thereof.

      (iv)    The decision of a majority of the three (3) appraisers shall be

                                           49
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 binding upon Lessor and Lessee. If either Lessor or Lessee fails to appoint an
 appraiser within the time period specified hereinabove, the appraiser
 appointed by one of them shall reach a decision based upon the same procedure
 set forth above (i.e., by selecting either Lessor's or Lessee's submitted
 "fair-market" rental rate), and shall notify Lessor and Lessee thereof, and
 such appraiser's decision shall be binding upon Lessor and Lessee.

      (v)    If the two (2) appraisers fail to agree upon and appoint a third
 appraiser, both appraisers shall be dismissed and the matter to be decided
 shall be submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the American
 Arbitration Association based upon the same procedures set forth above (i.e.,
 by selecting only Lessor's or Lessee's submitted "fair-market" rental rate).

      (vi)    The costs of appraisal hereunder, and arbitration if necessary,
 shall be paid by the party whose rental rate is not selected.



 (d)  In no event shall the Base Monthly Rent during any Option Term fall below
 the Base Monthly Rent in effect for the month immediately preceding the
 commencement of such Option Term.

 (e)  Lessor and Lessee hereby agree to execute an amendment to the Lease
 promptly after Lessee's exercise of the Option in order to incorporate the
 extension of the initial Term and the lease terms thereof into the Lease.

  66.  Right of First Offer.

 (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Lease and
 provided that there is then no default by Lessee under this Lease, Lessor
 hereby grants to Lessee the right of first offer to lease any additional,
 available space located in the Building (the "First Offer Space") as and when
 such First Offer Space becomes available for lease to third parties and so
 long as any existing lessee of such First Offer Space elects to vacate same. 
 Lessor shall notify Lessee of (a) the availability of the First Offer Space,
 (b) the anticipated date on which the First Offer Space shall be available to
 Lessee, and (c) the then-current economic terms, including, but not limited
 to, Lessor's determination of the Rent, for the First Offer Space (except that
 for any First Offer Space leased during the first five (5) years following the
 Commencement Dates the rent shall be the same as under this Lease).  For a
 period of ten (10) days following Lessee's receipt of Lessor's written notice
 containing such information, Lessee shall have the right of first offer to
 lease the First Offer Space (i) upon the same economic terms and conditions
 set forth in Lessor's written notice, and (ii) provided such election is made
 four (4) years or more from the end of the Term, including the option terms,
 if then exercised, upon the same non-economic terms of the Lease (including
 the Expiration Date).  If Lessee fails to elect to lease the First Offer Space
 upon Lessor's terms and conditions within such thirty (30) day period, Lessor
 shall be entitled to lease the First Offer Space to any third party upon any
 terms, and this right of first offer with respect to that space only shall

                                           50
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 terminate and be of no further force and effect.  Lessor and Lessee hereby
 agree to execute an amendment to the Lease promptly after Lessee s exercise of
 the Right of First Offer in order to incorporate the First Offer Space and the
 leased terms thereof into the Lease.

 (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may, from time to time, request
 notice from Lessor of all additional available space in the project, and
 within five (5) days thereafter Lessor shall provide to Lessee a list of such
 available space.  Lessee may then elect to lease such space at the prevailing
 rates and terms then being offered by Lessor for such space to third parties
 and, provided such election is made four (4) years or more from the end of the
 Term, including the option terms, if then exercised, such lease shall be on
 the same non-economic terms as the Lease and the term of such lease shall
 terminate on the Expiration Date of this Lease, as extended.  If this election
 is not made within four (4) years or more from the end of the Term, as
 extended, the term of such lease, and the non-economic terms of such lease,
 shall be subject to mutual negotiation.

 (c)  Nothing contained in this paragraph 66 shall prevent Lessee from at any
 time leasing available space in the Building or granting any other rights with
 respect thereto.

 67.  Default.  The term "default" whenever used in this Lease shall mean a
 default after the giving of the required notice by Lessor to Lessee, and the
 expiration of the cure period.

 68.  Consent.  In each instance where Lessor's consent or approval is
 required, it shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed
 given if Lessor shall not respond to Lessee's written request within seven (7)
 days following Lessee's written request.  All matters which must be to
 Lessor's satisfaction, or performed in Lessor's judgment, shall be to Lessor's
 reasonable satisfaction or in Lessor's reasonable judgment.  All sums incurred
 by Lessor on Lessee's behalf, for which reimbursement is required, shall only
 be reimbursed if those sums are reasonable.

 69.  Alterations.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, Lessee shall
 have the right, without Lessor's consent, to make interior, nonstructural
 alterations to the Premises, provided same do not adversely affect the
 Building's systems and do not affect the exterior of the Building.

 70.  Reciprocal Indemnity.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs 8.7
 and 8.8 of the Lease, Lessee shall not be required to indemnify and hold
 Lessor harmless from any such loss, costs, liability, damage and expense to
 any person or property (including but not limited to penalties, fines and
 actual attorneys' fees and costs) resulting from the negligent acts or
 omissions or the willful misconduct of Lessor or those of its agents,
 contractors, servants or employees, in connection with Lessor's activities on
 the Premises or the Building to the extent not covered by insurance required
 to be maintained by Lessee hereunder, and Lessor hereby so indemnifies,
 defends and saves Lessee harmless from any such loss, costs, liability, damage

                                           51
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 and expense (including but not limited to penalties, fines and actual
 attorneys' fees and costs).  In the case of any action or proceeding brought
 against Lessor by reason of any such claim, Lessor upon notice from Lessee
 hereby agrees to defend the same at Lessor's expense with counsel to which
 Lessee does not reasonably reject.  Further, Lessee's agreement to indemnify
 and hold Lessor harmless pursuant to Paragraphs 8.7 and 8.8 and the exclusion
 from Lessee's indemnity and the agreement by Lessor to indemnify and hold
 Lessee harmless pursuant to this Subparagraph (b) are not intended to and
 shall not relieve any insurance carrier of its obligations under policies
 required to be carried by Lessor or Lessee, respectively, pursuant to the
 provisions of this Lease to the extent that such policies cover the results of
 such negligence or omissions or such willful misconduct.  If either party
 breaches this agreement by its failure to carry required insurance, such
 failure shall automatically be deemed to be the covenant and agreement by
 Lessor or Lessee, respectively, to self-insure such required coverage, with
 full waiver of subrogation.  Each party's indemnification obligations under
 this Lease shall not be limited to the amount of insurance coverage carried by
 such party hereunder.

 71.  Lessee's Continuous Operation.  Lessor acknowledges that Lessee's
 intended use of the Premises requires uninterrupted twenty-four (24) hours a
 day, seven (7) days a week utility service throughout the term of this Lease. 
 As such, Lessor agrees that Lessee shall be entitled to establish the
 requisite electrical connections to a backup electrical generator located
 adjacent to the Building (the "Backup Generator") to be installed pursuant to
 the Final Plans and as part of the Lessee Improvements, which shall be for
 Lessee's exclusive use. Furthermore, Lessor agrees to provide Lessee with
 reasonable advance notice of the times during which Lessor knows that the flow
 of electricity or air conditioning to the Premises will be interrupted so that
 Lessee may plan accordingly.  Subject to the foregoing, however, Lessee's
 twenty-four (24) hour use of the Premises shall be subject to all of the other
 provisions of this Lease, and Lessor shall not be liable for the failure of
 Lessee to receive uninterrupted flow of electricity or air conditioning to the
 Premises except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease.

 72.  Lessee's Right to Make Repairs.  If Lessee provides notice to Lessor of
 an event or circumstance which requires the action of Lessor with respect to
 repair, providing of services, and/or utilities and/or maintenance as set
 forth in this Lease, and Lessor fails to provide such action within a
 reasonable period of time, given the circumstances, after the receipt of such
 notice, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such
 notice, then Lessee may proceed to take the required action upon delivery of
 an additional ten (10) business days notice to Lessor specifying that Lessee
 is taking such required action, and if such action was required under the
 terms of this Lease to be taken by Lessor, then Lessee shall be entitled to
 prompt reimbursement by Lessor of Lessee's reasonable costs and expenses in
 taking such action.  In the case of an emergency Lessee shall be entitled to
 take whatever minimum steps as are commercially reasonable under the
 circumstances until Lessor can address such emergency.  In the event Lessee
 takes such action, and such work will affect the Building's systems and

                                           52
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 equipment, the structural integrity of the Building and/or the exterior
 appearance of the Building or Project, Lessee shall use only those contractors
 used by Lessor for work on the Building's systems and equipment or structure
 and/or the exterior appearance of the Building or Project, unless such
 contractors are unwilling or unable to perform such work, in which event
 Lessee may utilize the services of any other qualified contractor which
 normally and regularly performs similar work in Comparable Buildings. Further,
 if Lessor does not deliver a detailed written objection to Lessee, within
 thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice by Lessee of its costs of taking
 action which Lessee claims should have been taken by Lessor, and if such
 invoice from Lessee sets forth a reasonably particularized breakdown of its
 costs and expenses in connection with taking such action on behalf of Lessor,
 then Lessee shall be entitled to deduct from Rent payable by Lessee under this
 Lease, the amount set forth in such invoice.  If, however, Lessor delivers to
 Lessee within thirty (30) days after receipt of Lessee's invoice, a written
 objection to the payment of such invoice, setting forth with reasonable
 particularity Lessor's reasons for its claim that such action did not have to
 be taken by Lessor pursuant to the terms of this Lease or that the charges are
 excessive (in which case Lessor shall pay the amount it contends would not
 have been excessive), then Lessee shall not be entitled to such deduction from
 Rent, but as Lessee's sole remedy, Lessee may proceed to institute legal
 proceedings against Lessor to collect such amount.

 73.  Interruption of Services.  Notwithstanding anything contained in the
 Lease to the contrary, in the event that Lessee is prevented from using, and
 does not use, the Premises or any portion thereof for five (5) consecutive
 days, or any ten (10) days in any calendar year ("Eligibility Period") as a
 result of any failure of Lessor to provide services, repairs or access to the
 Premises, then Lessee's rent shall be abated or reduced, as the case may be,
 during the period after the Eligibility Period for such time that Lessee
 continues to be so prevented from using the Premises or a portion thereof, in
 the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that
 Lessee is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable
 area of the Premises.  However, in the event that Lessee is prevented from
 conducting, and does not conduct, its business in any portion of the Premises
 for a period in excess of the Eligibility Period, and the remaining portion of
 the Premises is not sufficient to allow Lessee to effectively conduct its
 business therein, and if Lessee does not conduct it business from such
 remaining portion, then for such time after the Eligibility Period during
 which Lessee is so prevented from effectively conducting its business therein,
 the rent for the entire Premises shall be abated; provided, however, if Lessee
 reoccupies and conducts its business from any portion of the Premises during
 such period, the rent allocable to such reoccupied portion, based on the
 proportion that the rentable area of such reoccupied portion of the Premises
 bears to the total rentable area of the Premises, shall be payable by Lessee
 from the date such business operations commence.

 74.  Satellite Antenna.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
 Lease, Lessee shall have the right to install, operate and maintain up to six
 (6) microwave and earth station dishes or similar antennae ("Antenna") on a

                                           53
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 location on the roof of the Building to be mutually determined by Lessor and
 Lessee and shall have access to the roof for purposes related to the Antenna. 
 Lessee's installation and operation of the antenna shall be governed by the
 following terms and conditions:

 (a)  Lessee's right to install, operate and maintain the Antenna shall be
 subject to all governmental laws, rules and regulations and Lessor makes no
 representation that such laws, rules and regulations permit such installation
 and operation; Lessee, in conjunction with Lessor, shall obtain all necessary
 governmental approvals and permits prior to installation;

 (b)  all costs of installation, operation and maintenance of the antenna and
 the connecting cable (including, without limitation, costs of obtaining any
 necessary permits) shall be borne by Lessee;

 (c)  it is expressly understood that Lessor retains the right to use the roof
 of the Building for any purpose whatsoever provided that Lessor shall not
 interfere with the use of the Antenna;

 (d)  Lessee shall use the Antenna so as not to cause any interference to other
 tenants in the Building or with any other tenant's communication equipment and
 not to damage or interfere with the normal operation of the Building,
 including any mechanical system thereof, and Lessor shall not permit any
 tenant to interfere with the Antenna;

 (e)  Lessor shall not have any obligations with respect to the Antenna nor
 shall Lessor be responsible for any damage that may be caused to Lessee or the
 Antenna by any other tenant in the Building.  Lessor makes no representation
 that the Antenna will be able to receive or transmit communication signals
 without interference or disturbance (whether or not by reason of the
 installation or use of similar equipment by others on the roof) and Lessee
 agrees that Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee therefor;

 (f)  Lessee shall (i) be solely responsible for any damage caused by the
 Antenna, including, but not limited to, any damage caused to the roof of the
 Building during the installation or maintenance of the Antenna, or caused by
 the Antenna itself, (ii) promptly pay any tax, license or permit fees charged
 pursuant to any laws or regulations in Connection with the installation,
 maintenance or use of the Antenna and comply with all precautions and
 safeguards recommended by all governmental authorities, (iii) pay for all
 necessary repairs, replacements to or maintenance of the Antenna, and (iv) not
 bore into any structural elements of the Building in connection with the
 installation of the antenna;

 (g)  Lessee shall remove the Antenna and connecting cable at Lessee's expense
 upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease or upon the imposition
 of any governmental law or regulation which may require removal, and shall
 repair the roof of the building upon such removal to the extent required by
 such work of removal; and


                                           54
<PAGE>






 <PAGE>

 (h)  the size of each of the Antenna shall not exceed thirty (30) inches in
 diameter and the appearance of the antenna shall be subject to all
 governmental rules and regulations.

 75.  Cancellation Option.  Lessee shall have the one time right to terminate
 this Lease ("Option to Terminate") at the end of the sixtieth (60th) month
 following the Commencement Date by providing to Lessor at least six (6)
 months' prior written notice of Lessee's election to terminate this Lease and
 by paying to Lessor Nine Hundred Sixty-Four Thousand One Hundred Fifty-Three
 and 31/100 Dollars ($964,153.31) (the "Termination Consideration") as
 consideration for terminating this Lease. Lessee shall pay to Lessor the
 Termination Consideration on the first (1st) day of the fifty-ninth (59th)
 month of the Term of this Lease and if Lessee has timely provided the
 Termination Notice and timely paid the Termination Consideration within ten
 (10) days following notice that the same is due, then this Lease shall
 terminate and be of no further force and effect on the last day of the
 sixtieth (60th) month of the Term of this Lease.  If Lessee notifies Lessor of
 its exercise of the Option to Terminate but fails to pay the Termination
 Consideration within ten (10) days following notice that the same is due, then
 at Lessor's election Lessor may either terminate the Lease or keep the Lease
 in full force and effect (in which case Lessee's exercise of the Option to
 Terminate shall be null and void).

 76.  Refurbishment.  Provided that Tenant does not exercise the Option to
 Terminate set forth in paragraph 75 above, and provided further that Tenant
 utilizes at least 50% of the carpeting currently existing in the Premises for
 Lessee's initial occupancy of the Premises, then Lessor agrees to recarpet and
 repaint the Premises within two (2) months after the 60th month following the
 Sublease Commencement Date.

 77.  Moving Allowance.  Lessor agrees to provide to Lessee a moving allowance
 in the amount of $31,529.00 to be payable to Lessee within one month following
 Lessee's move in to the Premises.

 78.  Non-Disturbance Agreement.  Lessor hereby agrees that concurrently with
 its execution and delivery of this Lease, Lessor will provide Lessee with
 commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreements from any ground lessors,
 mortgage holders or lien holders of Lessor now in existence.  In addition,
 Lessor will provide Lessee with such agreements as soon as reasonably possible
 from ground lessors, mortgage holders or lien holders of Lessor who later come
 into existence during the term of the Lease.  Lessor's covenant contained
 herein shall be in consideration of and as a condition precedent to Lessee's
 agreement to be bound by Paragraph 28 of the Lease.  Lessee further waives the
 provisions of any current or future statute, rule or law which may give or
 purport to give Lessee any right or election to terminate or otherwise
 adversely affect this Lease and the obligations of the Lessee hereunder in the
 event of any foreclosure proceeding or sale, and agrees that this Lease shall
 not be affected in any way whatsoever by any such proceeding or sale, except
 that this sentence shall not affect Lessor's obligation to provide
 commercially reasonable nondisturbance agreements to Lessee.

                                           55

 <PAGE>

 79.  Security.  Lessor agrees that Lessee shall be permitted to install its
 own security system in the Premises which security system shall be subject to
 Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
 withheld

 80.  Actual Costs.  If Lessee is required to pay any amounts pursuant to this
 Lease other than Basic Rent, any parking fee and Operating Expenses,
 including, but not limited to after hours utility service, such amount shall
 be the actual cost incurred by Lessor (including a ten percent (10%) overhead
 and profit element for the property) as such amount is reasonably determined
 by Lessor.  In the event that more than one lessee of the Building orders such
 item, or if any cost item is applicable to more than one lessee, such costs
 shall be apportioned among all lessees in accordance with the ratios that such
 utility is used, and if that is not able to be determined, then it shall be
 apportioned in accordance with the ratio of the rentable square footage of
 each lessee's respective premises.

 81.  Storage Space.  Lessor shall make available to Lessee at such times as
 any space becomes available (and after considering the needs of other tenants
 in the Project), storage space throughout portions of the project as required
 by Lessee at the prevailing rate for such storage space then being offered by
 Lessor to other tenants of the project.

 82.  Lease Assumption.  Lessee is the present tenant under a lease with
 Copperfield Investment & Development Company dated December 1, 1983, and the
 user under a License Agreement dated June 7, 1984, amended by agreements dated
 October 16, 1989, March 13, 1987 and March 10, 1988 (the "Existing Lease"),
 covering premises outside the Office Building Project.  Lessee shall remain in
 possession and pay rent under the Existing Lease until May 31, 1992.  Lessee
 represents and warrants that the rent obligation (including additional rent)
 for the period June 1, 1992 through the expiration of the term of the Existing
 Lease is $305,248.66 and that the Existing Lease is scheduled to expire on May
 31, 1993.  Lessor shall use its good faith efforts to arrange for a
 cancellation of the Existing Lease, and the release of Lessee from all
 liability under the Existing Lease from and after May 31, 1992, and Lessee
 hereby appoints Lessor as its limited agent for the sole purpose of arranging
 such cancellation.  The cost of obtaining that cancellation shall be paid as
 follows: (i) the first $190,780.43 shall be paid by Lessor ("Lessor's Maximum
 Obligation"), (ii) any payment in excess of the above amount up to $114,468.23
 ("Lessee's Maximum Obligation") shall be paid by Lessee, and (iii) any
 Security Deposit held by the Landlord under the Existing Lease shall be
 payable to Lessee.  In no event shall either party be obligated to pay an
 amount in excess of the applicable limit set forth above, and in no event
 shall Lessor enter into an agreement with the landlord under the Existing
 Lease obligating Lessee to pay a lease cancellation fee in excess of Lessee's
 Maximum Obligation or creating any other obligation or liability of Lessee
 without Lessee's prior written consent.  In the event Lessor is able to cancel
 the Existing
 Lease and release Lessee from liability thereunder without expending all of
 Lessor's Maximum Obligation, Lessee acknowledges and agrees that Lessee shall

                                           56

 <PAGE>

 have no right to receive any portion of such savings in the form of cash, rent
 credit or otherwise. If Lessor is unable to obtain that cancellation and
 release upon terms which are within the parties' maximum commitments described
 above using Lessor's good faith efforts on or before March 1, 1992, Lessee
 shall, at its option, either attempt to arrange for same (and the payments
 therefore shall be made as provided in this paragraph) or continue to pay rent
 under the Existing Lease, in which case the first $190,780.43 of rent and
 additional rent from and after May 1, 1992 shall be paid by Lessor, (and if
 Lessee fails to make such payment within ten (10) days after notice from
 Lessee that such amount is due, Lessee shall be entitled to pay same and
 deduct it from the rent due under this Lease).

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lessor and Lessee have executed this Addendum concurrently
 with the Lease of even date herewith.

    i)     Payment of 1/120th of the total value of the contract
  each month until such time Customer or IDB finds a replacement
  customer(s) for the space segment in Paragraphs 1 (a) or 1 (b)
  and 1 (c) and Paragraphs 1 (h) or 1 (i) and 1 (j), and the
  hardware specified in Paragraphs 1 (d) and 1 (k).  At that time
  and on a monthly basis the payment of 1/120th owed to IDB by
  Customer will be reduced by the monies collected by resale of
  such space segment and receive hardware.
                  or 
    ii)    When both parties agree to a liquidated settlement.
                  or
    iii)   When IDB or Customer find a customer(s) to fully
  replace revenue previously generated to IDB by Customer.

  c)       Not withstanding Customer's obligations set forth in
  Paragraph 6 (b), should Customer cancel this agreement, IDB shall
  use its best efforts to find a replacement Customer and mitigate
  its damages hereunder as a result of such cancellation.

  d)       If IDB cancels this Agreement, because of non-payment or
  a material breach by the Customer, IDB shall be entitled to all
  monies referred to in Paragraph 6 (b).  If IDB cancels this
  Agreement, it shall, nonetheless, be subject to the limitations
  set forth in Paragraph 6 (c).  

  7.       Programming

  IDB shall have no responsibility to monitor the transmission of
  Customer's programming signals for content or compliance with FCC
  rules and regulations or for any other purpose other than
  transmission integrity assurance.


  8.       Ownership of Receive Equipment

  a) At all times during this contract, IDB shall maintain
  ownership of the receive equipment provided by IDB.  At the end
  of the contract term, Customer has the right to purchase all of
  the receive equipment provided by IDB in Paragraphs 1 (d) and 1
  (k) for a price of $ 1.00.    

  b)       Within the time frame of the contract term, IDB shall be
  responsible for all maintenance and repair of receive equipment
  specifically provided by IDB in this contract.  Procedures and
  standards for this maintenance and repair are included in
  Attachment K.   

  c) Customer is responsible for determining the allocation of the
  receive equipment to the affiliated radio stations.  IDB will be
  responsible for delivery and installation of this hardware as
  specified in Paragraphs 1 (e) and 1 (l) for all equipment shipped
  prior to and within thirty (30) days of the Sedat conversion
  dates.  After that point, Customer will be responsible for the
  cost of shipment and installation.  

  d) Customer will be responsible for notifying IDB of any changes
  in the location of the equipment.
           


  9. Maintenance of Customer Equipment

  Except for negligence (which for purposes of this Agreement shall
  include mutually agreed upon practices and procedures on the part
  of IDB or its employees), IDB shall not be liable for any failure
  of the Customer Equipment, nor the cost of Customer's parts or
  Customer's third party service, Customer's freight or any other
  Customer costs as may be incurred in maintaining such equipment. 
  At the request of Customer, IDB will obtain maintenance service

                                    10
<PAGE>
 <PAGE>

  for the Customer Equipment and will invoice Customer directly for
  all direct costs incurred thereby.  Customer may add, remove or
  change its equipment as Customer deems necessary.  All such
  changes at IDB facilities must be made while accompanied by IDB
  personnel so as not to cause service outages or other
  interference with IDB operations.  IDB will provide Customer and
  its representatives and contractors with access to the Customer
  Equipment on reasonable notice and as may be required in
  emergencies.


  10. Technical Specifications re: Uplink and Space Segment


  a)       Technical specifications of the satellite uplink
  transmission system will be those specifications given to IDB by
  GE Americom which will be referred to as "Attachment L" to this
  Agreement.

  b)       IDB will continue to be a party to the existing
  Agreement (A copy of said agreement is attached hereto as
  Attachment M"), among GE, ABC, CBS, NBC, Unistar, and the
  Associated Press that provides for reciprocal voice and news wire
  announcements should any party thereto suffer a catastrophe.

  c)       IDB will provide Customer with a schedule, as prepared
  and provided by GE Americom, of predicted sun outages for the
  satellite in use at least four (4) weeks prior to the beginning
  of those outages for the 50 locations designated by Customer that
  are provided to IDB by the satellite carrier.

  d) The uplink multiplex and transmission equipment shall be fully
  redundant with one set of equipment maintained in a "hot standby"
  condition.  It shall be monitored and switched as required.  A
  redundant antenna need not be maintained, but, in case of failure
  of the uplink antenna or its transmission lines, IDB will arrange
  to re-route, pre-empt or make provisions for another antenna to
  be brought into service as soon as possible.  

  e) Restoration provisions are attached as "Attachment N" and
  incorporated into this Agreement.  These restoration procedures
  are those currently being provided by GE Americom.  

  f) IDB will not schedule outages for maintenance or other
  purposes, including equipment reconfiguration on any equipment or
  transmission service which could cause a service outage to the
  satellite or otherwise materially impair Customer's operations
  without prior authorization of Customer's personnel.  Customer
  will not unnecessarily withhold testing permissions if the
  Customer's channels are not in use.

                                    11
<PAGE>






  <PAGE>

  g) IDB agrees not to change or modify the satellite system
  without the prior written approval, which shall not unreasonably
  withheld, by Customer.

  h) All IDB's satellite, transponder, and channel assignments are
  subject to the "restoral" provisions designated by the satellite
  carrier.


  11. Service Availability and Liability.

  a)       IDB guarantees to Customer service availability of 99.8%
  for the services described in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
  Agreement, with the exception of those items specified in
  Paragraphs 1 (a), 1 (b), 1 (c), 1 (h), 1 (i), 1 (j), 1 (m), 1(p)
  and 1 (s), and those services as detailed below.  IDB guarantees
  to Customer service availability as described in Attachment I for
  all items specified in Paragraphs 1 (a), 1 (b), 1 (c), 1 (h), 1
  (i) and 1 (j).  IDB guarantees to Customer service availability
  of 99.95% error-free seconds measured over 24 consecutive hours
  and 99.96% availability measured over 12 consecutive months for
  items specified in Paragraphs 1 (m) and 1 (p) and 1 (s). 
  Exceptions also apply for interruptions or other problems in such
  services due in whole or in part to any of the following:

            (i)   Customer failing to provide program material
    and/or schedules;

           (ii)   Any downtime or other interruption of facilities
    or services not provided by IDB in this contract;

           (iii)  The Customer Equipment, and acts or failures to
    act on the part of Customer and its employees, agents and   
  contractors other than IDB; and 
    
           (iv)   Acts of God or third parties, other than those
  for which IDB is responsible per this contract, or other causes
  beyond the reasonable control of IDB.


  b)       If, for reasons other than those described in Paragraph
  11 (a), IDB fails to transmit Customer's programming for the
  amounts specified in Paragraph 11 (a), IDB's sole and total
  liability and Customer's exclusive remedy shall be limited to
  Customer receiving, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
  the prorated amount of actual charges for each hour or portion
  thereof that Customer's programming is not transmitted.  IDB
  shall not be liable for any and all claims, losses, liabilities,
  direct or consequential damages, costs and expenses, including
  attorneys` fees, arising out of IDB's failure to transmit

                                    12
<PAGE>






  <PAGE>

  customer's programming, except when such failure is the result of
  negligence on the part of IDB, it agents or employees.

  c)       Customer shall have the right to terminate this
  agreement for non performance if IDB's performance falls below
  the amounts specified above for a period of three (3) consecutive
  months or if IDB's performance falls below the amounts specified
  above during any five (5) months in a calendar year,
  notwithstanding anything contrary set forth in this Agreement. 
  Customer shall not have any payment obligation or other
  obligation or liability to IDB hereunder and upon such
  termination, IDB shall, at Customer's request and with GE
  Americom's approval, reassign free and clear of any encumbrances
  all of IDB's rights and privileges to the channels specified in
  Paragraphs 1 (a) or 1 (b) and 1 (c), and 1 (h) or 1 (i) and 1 (j)
  under the agreement with GE Americom or any successor agreement. 


  12. Sales of Excess Capacity

  a) Customer may sell the excess channel capacity only as
  specifically stated herein Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 12 of this
  contract.

  b) Except as specified in Paragraph 6 and Paragraph 12 (c),
  Customer may not sell excess capacity on the "New York Dats" or
  "New York Sedat" through June 30, 2001.

  c) If at anytime, Customer has a decrease in the need for the
  quantity of full time channels provided for under this contract,
  and IDB and Customer do not wish to renegotiate the channel
  quantity and pricing, then Customer has the right to sell these
  channels specifically for the purpose of covering the cost of
  those channels.  The "right to sell" only applies to the quantity
  of channels which Customer currently has as specified in
  Attachments A & D.  Those channels referred to in Paragraph 2 (a)
  of this contract are not included.

  d) If Customer wishes to resell occasional channels, it may be
  done by reselling to IDB at a rate to be negotiated in good faith
  by both parties.  IDB has the right to resell those channels at a
  rate which provides IDB with its standard markup.

  e) Unless specifically agreed to otherwise in writing by IDB, any
  channels which are sold by Customer to a client other than IDB
  must be routed through Customer controlled facilities to IDB
  and/or IDB's uplink location.  




                                    13

  <PAGE>

  13. Changes in Channels

  In the event that new technologies become available and
  competitive, neither IDB nor Customer will deny the other the
  opportunity to evaluate conversion of the satellite channel
  capacity to the new technology.  In the event that IDB is
  unwilling to convert the "headend", and with the addition of
  Customer's affiliates over 2/3rds of the existing US commercial
  radio stations would be able to receive the new technology, then
  IDB will release Customer from the commitment to this contract
  for the capacity which IDB will not convert, with nine (9) months
  written notice. 


  14. Third Party Requirements.

  a)       The parties acknowledge and agree that, in providing
  satellite transmission services, IDB will be required to operate
  in accordance with the practices and procedures of the carrier
  from whom satellite transponder space or other transmission
  facilities are utilized, and to the extent carrier practices and
  procedures are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
  such practices and procedures will control IDB's performance
  hereunder.

  b)       The satellite uplink transmission services to be
  provided by IDB under this Agreement are subject to regulation by
  the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC").  Throughout
  the term of this Agreement, IDB will obtain and keep current all
  licenses, permits and other approvals of the FCC or other
  governmental bodies required to perform such services.  IDB's
  performance under this Agreement will at all times comply with
  the rules and regulations of the FCC, and to the extent they are
  inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, such rules and
  regulations will control IDB's performance hereunder.

  15.      Miscellaneous.

  a)       Payment of the charges set forth in this Agreement
  entitles Customer to receive only the services expressly
  described in this Agreement as being covered by such charges, and
  all other extra or additional services which Customer may wish to
  obtain from IDB shall only be supplied to Customer at prices and
  on such other terms as may be agreed to between the parties.

  b)       Except for negligence on the part of IDB or its
  Employees, Customer will indemnify and hold IDB harmless from and
  against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, direct or
  consequential damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable
  attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to the content of

                                    14
<PAGE>






  <PAGE>

  Customer's programming or other material furnished by Customer
  hereunder, including without limitation any claim for libel,
  slander or infringement of copyright.  This indemnification shall
  survive any termination of this Agreement.

  c)       Insofar as not inconsistent with paragraph 15 (b) above,
  IDB will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against
  any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and
  expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or
  relating to the negligence or willful actions of IDB or its
  agents and employees in transmitting Customer's programming,
  including but not limited to failure to maintain necessary
  licenses or interference with a third party's transmissions. 
  This indemnification extends only to IDB's actions in
  transmitting Customer's programming, and does not in any way
  affect the limitation on IDB's liability for failure to transmit
  Customer's programming set forth in paragraph 11 (b).  This
  indemnification shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  d)       Neither party has any authority to make any statement,
  representation, warranty or other commitment on behalf of the
  other party, and this Agreement does not create any agency,
  employment, partnership, joint venture or similar relationship
  between the parties.

  e)       Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under
  this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
  party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided,
  however, that either party may assign its rights hereunder
  without the consent of the other party to any entity with which
  it may be merged or consolidated or which acquires all or
  substantially all of its assets, provided that such entity agrees
  to writing to assume all of the obligations of Customer or IDB,
  as the case may be, under this Agreement.

  f)       All notices which either party may be required or desire
  to give to the other party under this Agreement shall be given by
  personal service or by registered or certified mail, return
  receipt requested, addressed to such party at its respective
  address as set forth at the beginning of this Agreement, or to
  such other address as a party may hereafter designate by proper
  written notice to the other party.

  g)       No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall
  constitute a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other
  provision of this Agreement, and no waiver shall be effective
  unless made in writing.  In the event that any provisions of this
  Agreement shall be judged illegal or unenforceable by a court of
  competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed and the
  entire Agreement shall not fail but the balance of this Agreement
  shall continue in full force and effect.

  h)       It is mutually acknowledged and agreed that this
  Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
  State of California. 

  i)       Customer and IDB acknowledge that they have read this
  entire Agreement and that this Agreement constitutes the entire
  understanding and contract between the parties hereto, and
  supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
  communications with respect to the subject matter hereof, all of
  which are merged herein.  This Agreement shall not be modified,
  amended or any way altered except by an instrument in writing
  signed by both of the parties hereto.

     WHEREFORE, this Agreement shall take effect as of the date
  first written above when it has been executed below on each of
  two copies of duly authorized representatives of each party
  hereto.
