ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
  UMB Financial Corporation (the "Company") was organized in 1967 under
Missouri law for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company registered
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company owns substantially all
of the outstanding stock of 18 commercial banks, a consumer credit bank, a bank
real estate corporation, a reinsurance company, a community development
corporation and a discount brokerage company.
 
  The Company's 18 commercial banks are engaged in general commercial banking
business entirely in domestic markets. The banks, 14 located in Missouri, 2 in
Kansas, one in Illinois and one in Colorado, offer a full range of banking
services to commercial, retail, government and correspondent bank customers. In
addition to standard banking functions, the principal affiliate bank, UMB Bank,
n.a., provides international banking services, investment and cash management
services, data processing services for correspondent banks and a full range of
trust activities for individuals, estates, business corporations, governmental
bodies and public authorities. A table setting forth the names and locations of
the Company's affiliate banks as well as their total assets, loans, deposits
and shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1994, is included on page A-46 of
the attached Appendix, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
  United Missouri Bank, U.S.A. is a consumer credit bank chartered in Delaware.
United Missouri Bank, U.S.A. services all incoming credit card requests,
performs data entry services on new card requests and evaluates new and
existing credit lines.
 
  Other subsidiaries of the Company are UMB Properties, Inc., United Missouri
Insurance Company, Scout Brokerage Services, Inc., and UMB Community
Development Corporation. UMB Properties, Inc. is a real estate company that
leases facilities to certain subsidiaries and acquires and holds land and
buildings for anticipated future facilities. United Missouri Insurance Company,
an Arizona corporation, is a reinsurance company that reinsures credit life and
disability insurance originated by affiliate banks. Scout Brokerage Services,
Inc. provides transaction services in a variety of investment securities for
the general public. This subsidiary offers brokerage and custodial services to
its customers (including affiliate and correspondent banks) through the
facilities of National Financial Services Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Fidelity Brokerage Services, Inc. UMB Community Development
Corporation provides low-cost mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income
families for acquiring or rehabing owner-occupied housing in Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Colorado.
 
  On a full-time equivalent basis at December 31, 1994, UMB Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries employed 4,006 persons.
 
COMPETITION
 
  The commercial banking business is highly competitive. Affiliate banks
compete with other commercial banks and with other financial institutions,
including savings and loan associations, finance companies, money market mutual
funds, mortgage banking companies and credit unions. In recent years,
competition has also increased from institutions not subject to the same
geographical and other regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.
 
MONETARY POLICY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
 
  The operations of the Company's affiliate banks are affected by general
economic conditions as well as the monetary policy of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") which affects the
supply of money available to commercial banks. Monetary policy measures by the
Federal
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
 
Reserve Board are effected through open market operations in U.S. Government
securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in
reserve requirements.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") and to regulation by the Federal Reserve
Board.
 
  The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve Board before it may (i) acquire substantially all the
assets of any bank, (ii) acquire more than 5% of the voting stock of a bank or
bank holding company which is not already majority owned, or (iii) merge or
consolidate with another bank holding company.
 
  Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is prohibited, with certain
exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than
5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in
business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or
performing services for its banking subsidiaries. However, the BHCA authorizes
the Federal Reserve Board to permit bank holding companies to engage in
activities which are so closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks as to be a proper incident thereto.
 
  The BHCA prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from approving an application by
a registered bank holding company to acquire shares of a bank located outside
the state in which the operations of the holding company's banking subsidiaries
are principally conducted unless the acquisition is specifically authorized by
the laws of the state in which the bank to be acquired is located. In 1986,
Missouri authorized bank holding companies domiciled in contiguous states to
acquire Missouri banks and bank holding companies, provided their home states
have similar laws. Colorado and all of the eight states contiguous to Missouri
have passed similar legislation.
 
  There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding
company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain
credit from its bank subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries are also
subject to certain restrictions on issuance, underwriting and distribution of
securities.
 
  Three of the affiliate banks are national banks and are subject to
supervision and examination by the Comptroller of the Currency. United Missouri
Bank, U.S.A. is chartered under the state banking laws of Delaware and is
subject to supervision and regular examination by the Office of the State Bank
Commissioner of Delaware. One of the affiliate banks is chartered under the
state banking laws of Illinois and is subject to supervision and regular
examination by the Office of the Commissioner of Banks and Trust Companies of
Illinois. One of the affiliate banks is chartered under the state banking laws
of Colorado and is subject to supervision and regular examination by the Office
of the State Bank Commissioner of Colorado. One of the affiliate banks is
chartered under the state banking laws of Kansas and is subject to supervision
and regular examination by the Kansas Banking Department. The remaining 12
banks are chartered under the state banking laws of Missouri and are subject to
supervision and regular examination by the Office of the Commissioner of
Finance of Missouri. In addition, the national banks and the one state bank
that are members of the Federal Reserve System are subject to examination by
that agency. All affiliate banks are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and as such, are subject to examination thereby.
 
  Scout Brokerage Services, Inc. is subject to supervision and regulation by
the National Association of Securities Dealers. This subsidiary is also a
member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

regulators is included on pages A-15, A-39 and A-40 of the attached Appendix,
and is incorporated herein by reference.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  The accounting policies of UMB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries
conform to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the banking
industry. Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies to
assist the reader in understanding the financial presentation.
 
  CONSOLIDATION -- All subsidiaries are included in the financial statements.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated where significant.
 
  ACQUISITIONS -- Banks acquired and recorded under the purchase method are
recorded at the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date,
and results of operations are included from that date. Excess of purchase price
over the value of net assets acquired is recorded as premiums on purchased
banks. Premiums on purchases prior to 1982 are being amortized ratably over 40
years. Premiums on purchases in 1982 and after are being amortized ratably over
15 years. Core deposit intangible assets are being amortized ratably over 10
years.
 
  LOANS -- Interest on discount loans is recorded on a method that approximates
income at a level rate of return on the principal amount outstanding over the
term of the loan. Interest on all other loans is recognized based on the rate
times the principal amount outstanding. Interest accrual is discontinued when,
in the opinion of management, the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful.
 
  Affiliate banks enter into lease financing transactions that are generally
recorded under the financing method of accounting. Income is recognized on a
basis that results in an approximately level rate of return over the life of
the lease.
 
  Annual bankcard fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period
that cardholders may use the card.
 
  The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management's
continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the
loan portfolio, including actual loan loss experience, current and anticipated
economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full
collectibility may not be assured and determination of the existence and
realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing such loans. The
actual losses, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ
significantly from the amounts estimated by management.
 
  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE -- Effective December 31, 1992, the company
classified certain debt securities as securities available for sale. These
securities are considered part of the company's asset/liability management
program that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayments,
or capital or liquidity needs.
 
  Debt securities available for sale include principally U.S. Treasury and
agency securities and certain mortgage-backed securities. Until December 31,
1993, securities available for sale were carried at the lower of aggregate
amortized cost or market value.
 
  Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." Accordingly, equity securities and debt securities
available for sale are measured at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and
losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales are
computed by the specific identification method at the time of disposition and
are shown separately as a component of noninterest income.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 115, marketable equity securities, owned
primarily by the parent company, were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value.
 
  INVESTMENT SECURITIES -- Investment securities are carried at amortized
historical cost based on management's intention, and the Company's ability, to
hold them to maturity. The Company classifies securities of state and political
subdivisions and a portion of its mortgage-backed securities portfolio as
investment securities. Certain significant unforeseeable changes in
circumstances may cause a change in the intent to hold these securities to
maturity. For example, such changes may include a deterioration in the issuer's
creditworthiness that is expected to continue or a change in tax law that
eliminates the tax-exempt status of interest on the security.
 
  TRADING SECURITIES -- Trading securities, generally acquired for subsequent
sale to customers, are carried at market value. Market adjustments, fees and
gains or losses on the sale of trading securities are considered to be a normal
part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking income.
Interest income on trading securities is included in income from earning
assets.
 
  TAXES -- The Company recognizes certain income and expenses in different time
periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The provision for
deferred income taxes is based on the liability method and represents the
change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year, including the
effect of enacted tax rate changes.
 
  PER SHARE DATA -- Earnings per share are computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. All
per share presentations have been restated to give effect to the 10% stock
dividend paid July 1, 1994, to the shareholders of record June 14, 1994. The
dilutive effect of shares issuable under stock options granted by the Company
is immaterial.
 
  RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications were made to the 1993 and 1992
financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
 
  INDUSTRY SEGMENT REPORTING -- The Company operates principally in a single
business segment offering general commercial banking services.
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
  EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS -- The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." This Statement, effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1993, establishes accounting standards for employers who provide certain
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. The Company does not provide any such postemployment benefits and,
consequently, adoption of this Statement did not affect its financial position
or results of operations.
 
  ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN -- The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of
a Loan." This Statement, which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994, will require that impaired loans be measured based on
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, at the loan's observable market price or the fair
value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. In October 1994, SFAS
No. 118 was issued as an amendment to SFAS No. 114 to allow a creditor to use
existing methods for recognizing interest income on an impaired loan. The
impact of the Statements on the Company has not yet been fully determined; the
effects are not expected to be significant to the consolidated financial
statements.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
  REPORTING ON DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 119, which requires disclosures concerning
derivative financial instruments--futures, forward, swap, and option contracts,
and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. This statement
requires disclosures of amounts, nature, and terms of derivative financial
instruments that do not result in off-balance sheet risk of accounting loss. It
requires that a distinction be made between financial instruments held or
issued for trading purposes and financial instruments held or issued for
purposes other than trading. It also amends SFAS Nos. 105 and 107 requiring
distinctions in certain disclosures required by those statements. This
statement has been adopted for the year ending December 31, 1994.
 
  ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS -- The Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." This Statement, effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992, requires accrual of
postretirement benefits (such as health care benefits) during the years an
employee provides services. The Company does not provide any such
postretirement benefits and, consequently, adoption of this Statement did not
affect its financial position or results of operations.
 
  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 109, "Accounting For Income Taxes." This Statement superseded
SFAS No. 96, by the same title, which the Company had adopted in 1989. SFAS No.
109 reduces the complexity of SFAS No. 96 and changes the criteria for
recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109 was adopted by
the Company in 1993 and did not have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.
 
ACQUISITIONS
 
  On January 23, 1992, the Company acquired Columbine National Bank, Denver,
Colorado (renamed UMB Columbine National Bank). The Company paid $9.1 million
in cash for all the shares of the bank's holding company, The Village
Corporation, as well as the minority holdings of bank stock. The acquisition of
this $62 million bank was recorded as a purchase, with $2.0 million recorded as
premium on purchased bank. On October 19, 1994, UMB Columbine National Bank was
merged into UMB Bank Colorado.

  As of June 25, 1993, the Company had consummated the acquisitions of eight
Kansas bank holding companies (the "Kansas banks"). During 1994, these Kansas
banks were merged to form two banks, UMB National Bank of America and UMB Bank
Kansas. The eight companies and their subsidiary banks are presented below:

  The cash portion of the purchase prices was obtained principally through the
issuance of debt by the Company. On February 24, 1993, the Company issued
$10,000,000 in medium-term notes due 2000 at 6.81% and $15,000,000 in medium-
term notes due 2003 at 7.30%.
 
  The acquisitions of the Kansas banks have been accounted for by the Company
under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations," as amended. Under
this method of accounting, the purchase prices have been allocated to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,
including applicable income tax effects, at the effective dates of the
acquisitions. Income of the combined company does not include income of the
acquired companies prior to the effective dates of the acquisitions.

  Long-term debt represents direct, unsecured obligations of the parent
company. The senior notes due 2000 and 2003 cannot be redeemed prior to stated
maturity. The senior notes due 1996 require annual redemptions of $3,572,000.
Optional prepayments without premiums were made on the senior notes due 1996 of
$2,678,000 in 1993 and $3,572,000 in 1992. The senior notes due 1999 require
annual redemptions of $3,000,000 beginning in 1995. The 7.50% notes that mature
in 1997 require annual principal payments of $1,546,000. The senior notes
contain financial covenants relating to the issuance of additional debt,
payment of dividends, reacquisition of common stock and maintenance of minimum
tangible capital. Under the most restrictive covenant, approximately
$90,226,000 was available for the payment of dividends at December 31, 1994.
 
  The Company enters into sales of securities with simultaneous agreements to
repurchase ("repurchase agreements"). The amounts received under these
agreements represent short-term borrowings and are reflected as a separate item
in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount outstanding at December 31, 1994,
was $661,203,000 (with accrued interest payable of $1,591,000). Of that amount,
$140,341,000 represented sales of securities in which the securities were
obtained under reverse repurchase agreements ("resell agreements"). The
remainder of $520,862,000 represented sales of U.S. Treasury securities
obtained from the Company's securities portfolio. The carrying amounts and
market values of the securities and the related repurchase liabilities and
weighted average interest rates of the repurchase liabilities (grouped by
maturity of the repurchase agreements) were as follows (amounts in thousands):

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 
  Payment of dividends by the affiliate banks to the parent company is subject
to various regulatory restrictions. For national banks, state banks that are
Federal Reserve members and state banks in Colorado, the governing regulatory
agency must approve the declaration of any dividends generally in excess of the
sum of net income for that year and retained net income for the preceding two
years. The state banks in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois are subject to state
laws permitting dividends to be declared from retained earnings, provided
certain specified capital requirements are met. At December 31, 1994,
approximately $38,629,000 of the equity of the affiliate banks was available
for distribution as dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory
approval or without reducing the capital of the respective affiliate banks
below prudent levels.
 
  The Company is required to maintain minimum amounts of capital to total "risk
weighted" assets, as defined by the banking regulators. At December 31, 1994,
the Company is required to have minimum Tier 1 and Total capital ratios of
4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. The Company's actual ratios at that date were
16.76% and 17.85%, respectively. The Company's leverage ratio at December 31,
1994, was 7.89%.
 
  Certain affiliate banks maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve
Bank as required by law. During 1994, this amount averaged $125,294,000.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
  The Company has a noncontributory profit sharing plan, which features an
employee stock ownership plan. These plans are for the benefit of substantially
all officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Contributions
to these plans for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $3,983,000, $3,542,000
and $3,317,000, respectively.
 
  The Company has a qualified 401(k) profit sharing plan that permits
participants to make contributions by salary reduction. The Company does not
make contributions to this plan.
 
  Substantially all officers and employees are covered by a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan. Under the plan, retirement benefits are based on
years of service and the average of the employee's highest 120 consecutive
months of compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually
the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. To the
extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the plan, a
contribution may not be made in a particular year.
 
  The pension plan was amended in January 1995 whereby the plan would not
accept any new participants. This change was made with consideration given to
discontinuing the current plan at a future date. New employees of the Company
that are not eligible to participate in the pension plan will receive a partial
matching contribution to the qualified 401(k) plan, as amended.
 
  The following items are components of the net periodic pension expense
(income) for the three years ended December 31, 1994 (in thousands):

  On April 16, 1992, the shareholders of the Company approved the 1992
Incentive Stock Option Plan ("the 1992 Plan"), which provides incentive options
to certain key employees for up to 500,000 common shares of the Company. The
options are not exercisable for two years from the date of the grant and are
thereafter exercisable for such periods as the Board of Directors, or a
committee thereof, specify (which may not exceed 10 years), provided that the
optionee has remained in the employment of the Company or its subsidiaries. The
Board or the committee may accelerate the exercise period for an option upon
the optionee's disability, retirement or death. All options expire at the end
of the exercise period. The Company makes no recognition in the balance sheet
of the options until such options are exercised and no amounts applicable
thereto are reflected in net income. Options are granted at not less than 100%
of fair market value at date of grant.
 
  Activity in the 1992 Plan for the three years ended December 31, 1994, is

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of
its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial
letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and futures contracts. Those
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The
contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of
involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.
 
  The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit,
commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by
the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same
credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does
for on-balance-sheet instruments. For futures contracts, the contract or
notional amounts do not represent exposure to credit loss. The Company controls
the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit approvals, limits and
monitoring procedures.
 
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. These
conditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being
current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the
customer's financial condition. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The
interest rate is generally a variable, or floating, interest rate. If the
commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such
time as credit is extended. For its credit card customers, the Company has the
right to change or terminate any terms or conditions of the credit card account
at any time. Since a large portion of the commitments and unused credit card
lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on an individual basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, upon extension of credit is based
on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include
accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and equipment, stock,
securities and certificates of deposit.
 
  Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or
commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule,
drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as
intended. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
 
  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same
as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds
collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary. Collateral
varies but may include such items as those described for commitments to extend
credit.
 
  Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money
market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified
future date of a specified instrument at a specified yield. Risks arise from
the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts
and from movements in securities values and interest rates. Instruments used in
trading activities are carried at market value and gains and losses on futures
contracts are settled in cash daily. Any changes in the market value are
recognized in trading and investment banking income.
 
  The Company's use of futures contracts is very limited. The Company uses
contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the
trading portfolio. The contract amount of open positions in financial futures
contracts at year end 1994 was $36 million. Open futures contract positions
averaged $44.5 million

during the year ended December 31, 1994. Net futures activity resulted in gains
of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.
 
  The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis.
For operating purposes the Company maintains certain balances in foreign banks.
Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly basis to avoid foreign
exchange risk on these foreign balances. The Company will also enter into
foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange needs of customers.
The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a foreign currency at a
future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy the foreign currency at
the same future date to a customer. The Company had no open foreign exchange
contracts at December 31, 1994. During 1994 contracts to purchase and to sell
foreign currency averaged approximately $1.2 million. The gain or loss on these
foreign exchange contracts for 1994 was not significant.
 
  With respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company's
business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado
and Illinois. At December 31, 1994, the Company did not have any significant
credit concentrations in any particular industry.
 
  In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in various lawsuits and counterclaims. In the opinion of management,
after consultation with legal counsel, none of these lawsuits will have a
materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
  SFAS No. 107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether
or not recognized in the balance sheet. The following methods and assumptions
were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for
which it is practicable to estimate that value:
 
  CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS -- The carrying amounts of cash and due from
banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of
their fair values.
 
  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES -- Fair values are
based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted
market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market
prices for similar securities.
 
  TRADING SECURITIES -- Fair values for trading securities (including financial
futures), which also are the amounts recognized in the balance sheet, are based
on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar
securities.
 
  LOANS -- Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real estate,
consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed
and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar
loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same
remaining maturities.
 
  DEPOSIT LIABILITIES -- The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts
is the amount payable on demand at December 31, 1994 and 1993. The fair value
of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the
future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar
remaining maturities.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
  SHORT-TERM DEBT -- The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased,
repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of
their fair values.
 
  LONG-TERM DEBT -- Rates currently available to the Company for debt with
similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of
existing debt.
 
  OTHER OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS -- The fair value of a loan commitment
and a letter of credit is determined based on the fees currently charged to
enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the
fees earned during the year or these instruments or their fair value at year-
end are significant to the Company's consolidated financial position.
 
  The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December
31, 1994, 1993, and 1992 are as follows (in millions):

revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and,
therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
  To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of UMB Financial Corporation:
 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UMB Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of UMB Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
 
  As discussed in the Accounting Policies note to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities effective December 31, 1993, to
conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115.

  The following financial review presents management's discussion and analysis
of UMB Financial Corporation's consolidated financial condition and results of
operations. This review highlights the major factors affecting results of
operations and any significant changes in financial condition for the three-
year period ending December 31, 1994. It should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, notes to financial statements
and other financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report.
 
OVERVIEW
 
  During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company earned $47.8 million,
compared to $41.1 million and $39.4 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Earnings for 1994 represent a 16.3% increase over the prior year. On a per
share basis, 1994 earnings were $2.49, compared to $2.34 and $2.59,
respectively, for the prior two years. Earnings per share for 1994 increased
6.4% from 1993 earnings per share. Per share amounts for prior periods have
been restated for a ten percent stock dividend distributed to shareholders on
July 1, 1994.
 
  During 1993, the Company completed the acquisition of twelve banks in the
state of Kansas (the Acquired Banks). The last of these acquisitions was
completed in the second quarter. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for as
a purchase, therefore, the results of operations of the Acquired Banks are
included in consolidated operating results from the respective date of
acquisition. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations will attempt to distinguish changes and variances caused
by the acquisition of the Acquired Banks from other changes.
 
  As noted above, the acquisitions of the Acquired Banks were accounted for as
purchases whereby the purchase price of the acquisitions was allocated to the
fair market value of the Acquired Banks with any remaining amount recorded as
goodwill. As a result of these acquisitions the Company recorded additional
intangible assets of $64.7 million. The amortization expense of these
intangible assets along with the amortization of the premium allocated to other
assets, primarily investment securities and fixed assets, amounted to $6.3
million and $4.7 million, on an after-tax basis, for the years ended December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. On a per share basis this expense totaled
$0.33 and $0.27 for 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
  During 1994, the Company consolidated its Kansas banking operations and
merged the Acquired Banks into two bank charters, which are two of the largest
banks in the state. The Company also merged its two Colorado banks into the
largest state-chartered bank in Colorado. In addition, the Company completed an
interstate merger through the merger of its St. Louis bank and its bank in
Collinsville, Illinois. Application has been filed to merge our four banking
companies in Monett, Joplin, Carthage and Springfield, Missouri, into one
entity. The goal of these reorganizations is to increase customer convenience
and service and improve consolidated efficiency.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
NET INTEREST INCOME
 
  Net interest income, the Company's principal source of earnings, is the
amount of interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense
paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 1 summarizes the changes in net
interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for the past two
years. Net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE), average
balance sheet amounts, and the corresponding yields and rates for the years
1990 through 1994 are shown on pages A-44 and A-45. Net interest income is
presented on a "tax-equivalent" basis to adjust for the tax-exempt status of
earnings from certain loans and investments, primarily the obligations of
states and local governments.
 
  On a tax-equivalent basis net interest income increased $24.0 million or
14.1%, to $194.3 million, compared to $170.3 million in 1993 and $136.5 in
1992. The contribution of the Acquired Banks to this increase was $3 million as
they added $28 million, and $25 million to the tax equivalent net interest
income for 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
                                      A-26
<PAGE>
 
TABLE 1: TAX-EQUIVALENT RATE-VOLUME ANALYSIS
 
  This analysis attributes changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent
basis either to changes in average balances or to changes in average rates for
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The change in interest due
jointly to volume and rate has been allocated to volume and rate in proportion
to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of change in each. All
information is presented on a tax-equivalent basis and gives effect to the
disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes, related to
certain tax-free assets.

  Average earning assets were $5.4 billion in 1994, compared to $4.9 billion in
1993 and $3.9 billion in 1992. The Acquired Banks' contribution to consolidated
average earning assets was $1.1 billion in 1994 and $743 million in 1993.
 
  Net interest margin measures the Company's ability to generate net interest
income. It is defined as net interest income (FTE) as a percent of earning
assets. The behavior of the margin depends on the interaction of three factors:
1) net interest spread (defined as the difference between the yield on earning
assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities); 2) yield earned on
assets funded by interest-free funding sources (primarily noninterest-bearing
demand deposits and equity capital); and 3) percentage of earning assets funded
by interest-free funding sources.

  The Company's net interest margin was 3.61% in 1994, compared to 3.48% in
1993 and 1992. A primary factor in the 1994 increase in net interest margin was
a change in asset mix with loans increasing to 40% of average earning assets,
compared to 37% in 1993 and 34% in 1992. Average loans increased by $362
million, or 20% in 1994 and $449 million in 1993. The average loans of the
Acquired Banks were $456 million in 1994 and $321 million in 1993. The
remaining increases resulted from increased marketing efforts to promote this
line of business and higher customer demand.
 
  The Company's yield on earning assets was 6.13% in 1994, compared to 5.92% in
1993 and 6.63% in 1992. The 1994 increase resulted from an increase in loan
volume and an increase in the rate earned on securities and loans. As interest
rates increased during the year, security maturities and short term investments
were reinvested at higher rates. In addition 56% of the Company's loan
portfolio has floating interest rates, therefore the effect of rate changes is
recognized immediately. The decrease in the yield on earning assets for 1993,
as compared to 1992, resulted from a general decrease in short-term interest
rates.
 
  The Company's cost of funds also increased during the year as a result of
rising interest rates. Cost of funds increased 12 basis points to 3.17%,
compared to 3.05% in 1993. Cost of funds in 1992 was 3.82%. The increase in
cost of funds in 1994 did not keep pace with the increasing yield on earning
assets, and as a result, the Company's net interest spread increased to 2.96%,
compared to 2.87% in 1993 and 2.81% in 1992. During 1994, noninterest-bearing
demand deposits represented 25.2% of funding sources, compared to 24.5% in 1993
and 22.5% in 1992. The Company expects its interest spread and margin to
improve in 1995 regardless of additional increases in interest rates.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS
 
  The allowance for loan losses (ALL) represents management's judgement of the
losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses
is the amount necessary to adjust the ALL to the level considered appropriate
by management. The adequacy of the ALL is reviewed quarterly considering such
items as historical loss trends, a review of individual loans, current and
projected economic conditions, loan growth and characteristics and other
factors. Bank regulatory agencies require that the adequacy of the ALL be
maintained on a bank-by-bank basis for each of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
  The Company's ALL was $32.5 million, $35.6 million and $24.5 million, as of
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The ALL as a percentage of
loans was 1.4% for 1994 and 1.7% for both 1993 and 1992. At December 31, 1994,
the ALL exceeded the level of nonperforming loans by $27.2 million. Included in
the consolidated ALL was $11.1 million and $11.4 million for 1994 and 1993,
respectively, attributable to the Acquired Banks. As shown in Table 3, the ALL
has been allocated to various portfolio segments. The Company manages the ALL
against the entire loan portfolio and therefore the allocation of the ALL to a
particular loan segment may change in the future.
 
  The provision for loan losses was $2.6 million in 1994, $3.3 million in 1993
and $3.0 million in 1992. Net charge-offs in 1994 were $5.7 million, compared
to $4.3 million in 1993 and $5.0 million in 1992. The overall quality of the
Company's loan portfolio has allowed management to record a loss provision that
was less than the amount of net charge-offs during each of the last three
years. Based on a current assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio, and
absent any unforeseen deterioration in the loan portfolio, management does not
anticipate a material increase in the loss provision for 1995.
 
  As noted in Table 4, over one half of the Company's net charge-offs were
related to bankcard loans, which, compared to the remainder of the portfolio,
earn an increased yield to reflect higher anticipated losses. The level of net
losses and past due loans in the Company's bankcard portfolio as a percentage
of total is well below industry averages. At December 31, 1994, past due loans
totaled 2.22% of this portfolio. Excluding net losses related to bankcard
loans, 81% of the remaining net losses of the Company in 1994 was attributable
to the charge-off of one commercial loan.
 
NONINTEREST INCOME
 
  Management has stressed growth of noninterest income to enhance the Company's
profitability since fee-based services are non-credit related, provide steady
income and are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates. These activities
are also relatively low-risk and do not impact the Company's regulatory capital
needs.
 
                                      A-29
<PAGE>
 
Fee-based services that have been emphasized include trust and securities
processing, securities trading, cash management and merchant processing. Fee
income (exclusive of net security gains) as a percent of adjusted operating
revenues has increased from 38.4% in 1989 to 41.8% in 1994. Adjusted operating
revenues is defined as tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest
income, excluding net security gains.
 
  Noninterest income, exclusive of net securities gains, was $139.8 million in
1994, compared to $130.5 million in 1993 and $108.2 million in 1992. The
contribution of the Acquired Banks to the above noninterest income was $13.3
million in 1994 and $9.0 million in 1993.
 
  Trust fees continue to be the largest component of noninterest income as they
totaled $35.0 million in 1994, $32.0 million in 1993 and $27.3 million in 1992.
Trust fees related to the Acquired Banks were $4.6 million in 1994 and $2.5
million in 1993. The Company has long been identified as a leader in the trust
area and management will continue to market and grow this recognized strength
of the Company. The aggregate value of managed trust assets at December 31,
1994 was $8.1 billion, compared to $8.7 billion and $7.5 billion at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  Income from the Company's custodial trust business, principally from the
mutual fund industry, declined 6.6% in 1994 to $12.5 million, compared to $13.3
million in 1993 and $13.7 million in 1992. The decrease in 1994 fee income was
the result of negotiated price adjustments and a decrease in activity
reflective of the decreased performance of the mutual fund industry. A large
customer of the Company was sold in 1994, which will cause a loss of custodial
processing business. This potential loss of business is not expected to
significantly affect the Company due to previous pricing concessions, new
business opportunities and expected reductions in variable costs. Total trust
assets under custody were $189.8 billion at December 31, 1994, compared to
$187.1 billion at year end 1993 and $150.6 billion at year end 1992.
 
  Service charge income on deposit accounts increased to $32.9 million in 1994,
compared to $30.2 million in 1993 and $24.1 million in 1992. The Acquired Banks
contributed service charge income of $4.7 million in 1994 and $3.2 million in
1993. The remaining increases for 1994 and 1993 resulted primarily from higher
transaction volumes. Increased interest rates applied to compensating balances
caused a comparative decrease in fees received. Other service charge income was
$15.6 million in 1994, compared to $14.1 million in 1993 and $9.7 million in
1992. The increase in 1994 income was primarily the result of the addition of
the Acquired Banks for a full year. The 1993 increase was affected by both the
acquisition and a 45% increase in fees related to cash management services.
 
  Bankcard fees increased by 22% to $27.4 million in 1994, compared to $22.4
million in 1993 and $18.3 million in 1992. The increase in fee income for both
1994 and 1993 was the result of a higher volume of credit card transactions
processed for merchants.
 
  Trading and investment banking income decreased by 27% in 1994 to $9.9
million, compared to $13.6 million in 1993 and $12.5 million in 1992. The sharp
1994 decrease was consistent with industry experience for the year as
transaction volumes decreased significantly, particularly sales of higher
margin mortgage-backed securities. An increased volume of sales of mortgaged-
backed securities and tax-exempt securities accounted for the increase in
income in 1993 as compared to 1992.
 
  Other fee income increased to $6.5 million in 1994 from $4.7 million in 1993
and $2.5 million in 1992. The increase for both 1994 and 1993 was primarily
attributable to the acquisition of the Acquired Banks. Net security gains
totaled $3.6 million in 1994, $1.6 million in 1993 and $5.3 million in 1992.
During the first quarter of 1994 the Company repositioned a portion of its
available for sale portfolio which resulted in over 80% of net security gains
for the year. A similar repositioning of the portfolio in 1992 resulted in 80%
of that year's net security gains.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE
 
  Noninterest expense increased by $26.6 million in 1994 to $257.6 million from
$231.0 million in 1993 and $184.9 million in 1992. As shown in Table 5, 46% of
the increase in 1994 and 63% of the increase in 1993 resulted from the
acquisition of the Acquired Banks. The impact of the acquisitions on 1994
noninterest expense is even greater than indicated above, as a number of
backroom and operating functions of the Acquired Banks have been consolidated
or merged with the Company's lead bank. These consolidation efforts will
continue in order to increase the efficiency of the Company.
 
  Personnel costs are the largest component of noninterest expense and totaled
$120.1 million in 1994, $106.3 million in 1993 and $87.9 million in 1992. The
addition of the Acquired Banks added $17.7 million and $13.1 million to these
cost in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The remaining increase resulted from merit
pay increases, additional staffing, higher health insurance costs and increased
contributions to employee benefit plans.
 
  Occupancy costs increased only marginally in 1994 after a $2.6 million
increase in 1993. The 1993 increase was primarily the result of the Acquired
Banks. Equipment expense also increased slightly in 1994, compared to a 29.0%
increase in 1993. Approximately 60% of the 1993 increase was due to the
Acquired Banks. The remaining increase resulted from depreciation on new data
processing, check imaging and bond trading system equipment. Supplies and
services expense increased by $1.7 million in 1994 and $3.0 million in 1993.
These increases resulted primarily from inclusion of the Acquired Banks.
 
  Bankcard processing expense increased to $22.7 million in 1994 compared to
$18.7 million in 1993 and $16.0 million in 1992. These increases were primarily
due to a higher volume of merchant processing transactions. Expenses in 1994
also include cost associated with a planned conversion of the bankcard
processing system, scheduled for first quarter of 1995.
 
  Marketing and business development expense increased by $2.0 million in 1994
and by $3.0 million in 1993. During both 1994 and 1993 the Company continued a
campaign to promote new loan business. The 1993 increase exceeds the 1994
increase as a result of the Acquired Banks.
 
  The increases in both FDIC and regulatory fees and amortization of
intangibles of purchased banks for 1994 and 1993 were due primarily to the
acquisition of the Acquired Banks.
 
  Other noninterest expense totaled $24.9 million in 1994, $23.7 million in
1993 and $17.3 million in 1992. The increase in 1994 was due solely to the
Acquired Banks while the 1993 increase also included higher fees paid for
various processing services.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
  The Company income tax expense for 1994 was $22.6 million, compared to $20.1
million in 1993 and $15.7 million in 1992. The effective tax rate for each year
was 32.08%, 32.87% and 28.57%, respectively. For 1993 and 1994, the federal
statutory tax rate was 35%, compared to 34% in 1992. The primary differences
between the Company effective tax rate and statutory rate for all three years
relates principally to non-taxable interest income and an increase in
nondeductible goodwill amortization in 1994 and 1993.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
LOANS
 
  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company's average loans were $2.1
billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 1993 and $1.3 billion in 1992. This
represents a 20% increase in average loans for 1994 over 1993 and a 34%
increase for 1993 over 1992. Year end loan totals were $2.3 billion, $2.2
billion and $1.5 billion for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Average loans
of the Acquired Banks were $456 million in 1994 and $321 million in 1993. Year
end loans for the Acquired Banks were $434 million in 1994 and $489 million
 
                                      A-32
<PAGE>
 
in 1993. Exclusive of the impact of the Acquired Banks, year end 1994 loans
increased 10% over the level at year end 1993. This increase was the result of
increased customer demand, fueled by an improved economy, and continued
emphasis on business development efforts.
 
  Table 6 presents an analysis of loans by type which shows there has been no
significant increases in any specific loan category for year end 1994, except
consumer loans. The majority of the growth in this loan segment has been the
result of increases in indirect loans from automobile dealers at two of the
Company's affiliates. Credit reviews of these portfolios indicate no excessive
risk has been taken to achieve this growth.
 
  At December 31, 1994, commercial real estate loans comprised 12.4% of total
loans, compared to 12.9% at year end 1993. The largest component of this
segment is loans secured by commercial property which totaled $218.9 million
and $211.3 million at year end 1994 and 1993, respectively. The geographic mix
of these loans is well diversified to the markets served by the Company's
affiliate banks. Approximately 46% of this segment is secured by commercial
property in the metropolitan Kansas City area. The Company's commercial real
estate loans generally do not exceed a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% and
for the most part the properties are owner-occupied. The Company keeps regular
contact with these customers in order to monitor changes in the financial
condition of the customer and the market. Generally these borrowers have an
established relationship with the Company that includes credit and noncredit
products.

LOAN QUALITY
 
  The quality of the loan portfolio has always been an underlying strength of
the Company. A measure of the effectiveness of credit risk management is the
percentage of the loan portfolio that is classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans. The
Company's nonperforming loans totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 1994,
representing only 0.2% of the loan portfolio, compared to $7.2 million and 0.3%
one year earlier. The Company's nonperforming loans have not exceeded 0.5% of
total loans in any of the last five years.
 
  Nonperforming assets include foreclosed real estate with the nonaccrual and
restructured loans. The Company's nonperforming asset ratio (nonperforming
assets divided by loans plus foreclosed real estate) was 0.5% at December 31,
1994 and 0.7% at December 31, 1993.
 
  Key factors of the Company's loan quality program are a sound credit policy
combined with periodic and independent credit reviews. All affiliate banks
operate under written loan policies. Credit decisions continue to be based on
the borrower's cash flow position and the value of underlying collateral, as
well as other relevant factors. Each bank is responsible for evaluating its
loans by using a ranking system. In addition, the Company has an internal loan
review staff that operates independent of the affiliate banks. This review team
performs periodic examinations of each bank's loans for credit quality,
documentation and loan administration.
 
  Another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification. By keeping its
loan portfolio diversified, the Company has avoided problems associated with
undue concentrations of loans within particular industries. Commercial real
estate loans comprise 12.4% of total loans, with a history of no significant
losses. The Company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged
transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio.
 
  A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due 90
days or more and when management has considerable doubt about the borrower's
ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of interest is
discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash. At
year end 1994, $215,000 of interest due was not recorded as earned, compared to
$210,000 for the prior year.
 
  Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest
or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the
respective borrowers. Management estimates that approximately $30,000 of
additional interest would have been earned in 1994 if the terms of these loans
were similar to other comparable loans. In certain instances, the Company
continues to accrue interest on loans past due 90 days or more. Though the loan
payments are delinquent, collection of interest and principal is expected to
resume and sufficient collateral is believed to exist to protect the Company
from significant loss. Consequently, management considers the ultimate
collection of these loans to be reasonable and has recorded $54,000 of interest
due as earned for 1994. The comparative figure for 1993 was $214,000.
 
  In addition to the loans discussed above, management has identified through
its loan ranking system $920,000 of potential problem loans. Though the loan
payments are current, the borrowers' abilities to comply with the stated terms
are questioned. Each of these loans is subject to ongoing management review,
including current classification.
 
  Other real estate that has been acquired through foreclosures has a carrying
value of $5.4 million, which approximates market value. The largest portion of
this is a property located in Kansas City. The remaining other real estate
parcels are primarily located in Kansas.

SECURITIES
 
  Effective for year end 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities."
 
  At December 31, 1994, the Company had total securities of $2.7 billion,
compared to $3.0 billion at year end 1993. Securities, which include available
for sale and held to maturity securities, represented 48.4% of total earning
assets at year end 1994, compared to 53.6% for 1993. The percentage breakdown
of securities by classification for year end 1994 and 1993 was as follows:
available for sale, 86% and 91%, respectively, and held to maturity, 14% and
9%, respectively.
 
  The percentage increase in securities held to maturity was due to the
purchase of high quality mortgage backed securities during the first quarter of
1994. The Company has the positive ability and intent to hold these securities
until maturity. The remaining items in this classification are securities of
state and political subdivisions.
 
  The average life of the Company's securities portfolio was approximately 17
months at December 31, 1994, compared to 24 months at year end 1993. Included
in Table 8 and on Table 9 is an analysis of the cost, fair value and average
yield of the Company's securities available for sale and securities held to
maturity.

OTHER EARNING ASSETS
 
  Federal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial
institutions. The net sold position at year end 1994 was $149.6 million,
compared to $49.8 million for year end 1993. During 1994, the Company was a net
purchaser of federal funds and this funding source averaged $60.1 million.
During 1993, the Company was a net seller of federal funds, which averaged
$36.3 million.
 
                                      A-36
<PAGE>
 
  The Investment Banking Division of the Company's principal affiliate bank
buys and sells federal funds as agent for nonaffiliated banks. Due to the
agency arrangement, these transactions do not appear on the balance sheet and
averaged $568.6 million in 1994 and $776.8 million in 1993.
 
  The Investment Banking Division also maintains an active securities trading
inventory. The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 1994
were $56.5 million, compared to $58.1 million in 1993, and were recorded at
market value.

DEPOSITS AND BORROWED FUNDS
 
  Interest-bearing liabilities averaged $4.3 billion in 1994, compared to $3.9
billion in 1993. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of
the Acquired Banks which had average interest-bearing liabilities of $880
million and $594 million for 1994 and 1993, respectively. Interest-bearing
liabilities were $4.4 billion at both year end 1994 and 1993.
 
  Interest-bearing deposits averaged $3.6 billion in 1994, compared to $3.3
billion in 1993. Year end totals were $3.6 billion for 1994 and $3.7 billion
for 1993. Interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, the largest portion of
the Company's deposit base, represented 47.1% of total average deposits in
1994, compared to 45.9% for 1993. Time deposits have decreased as a percentage
of total deposits in each of the last four years. Interest rate uncertainties
have caused some customers to avoid investing in products with longer-term
maturities.
 
  Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits represented 28.8% of total
average deposits for 1994, compared to 27.9% for 1993. This change resulted
from increased balances from custody processing, corporate and trust customers.
 
  Repurchase agreements averaged $498.4 million in 1994, compared to $515.9
million in 1993. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving investment
funds that are exchanged for securities to repurchase the same or similar
issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The Investment Banking Division buys
and sells repurchase agreements as principal for nonaffiliated banks. These
agreements are reflected on the balance sheet as both an asset ("resell
agreement") and a corresponding liability ("repurchase agreement"), since such
funds are purchased and then sold to approved dealer banks and primary dealers.
The amount of repurchase agreements handled in this manner was $244.7 million
at December 31, 1994, compared to $263.2 million one year earlier.
 
  At year-end 1994, the Company had repurchase agreements of $416.5 million for
its own funding needs, compared to $335.7 million at December 31, 1993.
 
  The Company's other short-term borrowings consist primarily of U.S. Treasury
demand notes. These demand notes represent treasury tax deposits remitted to
the Federal Reserve Bank other than daily. The rate paid on these funds is
0.25% below the weekly average federal funds rate.
 
                                      A-37
<PAGE>
 
  The Company's long-term borrowings consist of four senior note issues and
some installment notes. The Company's ratio of long-term debt to total capital,
a measure of debt capacity, was 8.31% at December 31, 1994, which compares very
favorably with its peer group. The Company borrowed $25.0 million in 1993 under
a medium-term note program to fund the cash portions of the Kansas bank
acquisitions. Of the total, $10.0 million of notes were issued with a seven-
year maturity at 6.81% and $15.0 million of notes were issued with a 10-year
maturity at 7.30%.

CAPITAL
 
  The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong
capital which helps safeguard our customers' funds, promotes investor
confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and
enhances the ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition
opportunities. Capital is managed for each subsidiary based upon their
respective risks and growth opportunities, as well as regulatory requirements.
 
  At December 31, 1994, shareholders' equity was $557.3 million, compared to
$586.6 million one year earlier. This 5.0% decrease was the result of recording
an unrealized loss on securities available for sale of $35.2 million, compared
to an unrealized gain on these securities of $14.3 million at year end 1993.
Excluding the effect of the mark to market adjustment on securities available
for sale, shareholders' equity at December 31, 1994, increased by 3.5% from the
previous year. Also contributing to the decrease in shareholders' equity for
1994 was the purchase of 396,984 shares of Company stock for treasury purposes.
During the year, management had the opportunity to repurchase shares of the
Company's stock at a price which, in management's opinion, would enhance
overall shareholder value. Depending on availability, price and cash flow
requirements, management will continue to consider treasury stock purchases
from time to time.
 
  In April, 1994, in order to reduce regulatory expenses, shareholders approved
a reduction in the par value of the Company's common stock from $12.50 per
share to $1.00 per share.
 
  Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum
capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial
institution's assets. A financial institution's total capital is required to
equal 8% of risk-weighted assets. At least half of that 8% must consist of Tier
1 core capital, and the remainder may be Tier 2 supplementary capital. The
risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of
asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of credit and
binding loan commitments) are multiplied by "credit conversion factors" to
translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific
risk weightings. Due to the Company's high level of core capital and
substantial portion of earning assets invested in riskless government
securities, the Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.76% and Total capital ratio of
17.85% substantially exceed the regulatory minimums.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
  The Company's dividend payout ratio was 30.52% in 1994, compared to 31.20% in
1993 and 28.19% in 1992. On July 1, 1994, the Company distributed a 10% stock
dividend to shareholders. All per share data has been restated to give effect
to this stock dividend for all periods presented.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
 
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
 
  Due to the nature of the Company's business, some degree of interest rate
risk is inherent and appropriate. Management's objective in this area is to
limit the level of earnings exposure arising from interest rate movements. This
analysis is related to liquidity due to the impact of maturing assets and
liabilities. Many of the Company's financial instruments reprice prior to
maturity.
 
  Interest rate sensitivity is measured by "gaps", which is the difference
between interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which reprice
or mature within a specific time interval. A positive gap indicates that
interest earning assets exceed interest-bearing liabilities within a given
interval. A positive gap position results in increased net interest income when
rates increase and the opposite when rates decline.
 
  Management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the
repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within
specific time intervals. Table 15 is a static gap analysis which presents the
Company's assets and liabilities based on their repricing or maturity
characteristics. This analysis shows that for the 180 day interval beginning
January 1, 1995, the Company is in a negative gap position as liabilities
maturing or repricing during this time exceed assets. At the one-year period
the Company has a positive cumulative gap as the ratio of earning assets to
paying liabilities is 1.12%, compared to 1.02% at December 31, 1993.
 
  In management's opinion the static gap report tends to overstate the interest
rate risk of the Company due to certain factors which are not measured on a
static or snapshot analysis. A static gap analysis assumes that all liabilities
reprice based on their contractual term. However, the effect of rate increases
on core retail deposits, approximately 53% of total deposits, tends to lag the
change in market rates. This lag generally lessens the negative impact of
rising interest rates when the Company has more liabilities repricing than
assets. In addition, a static analysis ignores the impact of changes in the mix
and volume of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. During 1994, the
Company's loans increased as a percentage of total earning assets and
noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts represented a larger component of
total funding sources.
 
  The Company will continue to manage its interest rate risk using static gap
analysis along with other tools which help measure the impact of various
interest rate scenarios. The Company does not use off-balance-sheet hedges or
swaps to manage this risk.
 
TABLE 14: RATE SENSITIVITY AND MATURITY OF LOANS
 
  The following table presents the rate sensitivity of certain loans maturing
after 1995, compared with the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 1994. Of
the $1,205,622,000 of loans due after 1995, $702,841,000 are to individuals for
the purchase of residential dwellings and other consumer goods. The remaining
$502,781,000 is for all other purposes and reflects maturities of $376,170,000
in 1996 through 1999 and $126,611,000 after 1999.

LIQUIDITY
 
  Liquidity represents the Company's ability to meet financial commitments
through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional
funds. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled
maturities of assets along with$2.3 billion of high-quality securities
available for sale. The liquidity of the Company and its affiliate banks is
also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core
deposits.
 
  The parent company's cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to
shareholders, debt service and treasury stock purchases. Management fees and
dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been sufficient to
satisfy these requirements and are expected to be in the future.

(1) Interest income and yields are stated on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE)
    basis, using a rate of 34% for 1990 through 1992 and 35% for 1993 and 1994.
    The tax-equivalent interest income and yields give effect to the
    disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes, related
    to certain tax-free assets. Rates earned/paid may not compute to the rates
    shown due to presentation in millions.
(2) Loan fees and income from loans on nonaccrual status are included in loan
    income.
