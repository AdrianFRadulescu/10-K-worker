ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
  UMB Financial Corporation (the "Company") was organized in 1967 under
Missouri law for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company registered
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company owns substantially all
of the outstanding stock of 16 commercial banks, a consumer credit bank, a
bank real estate corporation, a reinsurance company, a community development
corporation and a discount brokerage company.
 
  The Company's 16 commercial banks are engaged in general commercial banking
business entirely in domestic markets. The banks, 11 located in Missouri, 2 in
Kansas, one each in Illinois, Colorado and Oklahoma, offer a full range of
banking services to commercial, retail, government and correspondent bank
customers. In addition to standard banking functions, the principal affiliate
bank, UMB Bank, n.a., provides international banking services, investment and
cash management services, data processing services for correspondent banks and
a full range of trust activities for individuals, estates, business
corporations, governmental bodies and public authorities. A table setting
forth the names and locations of the Company's affiliate banks as well as
their total assets, loans, deposits and shareholders' equity as of December
31, 1995, is included on page A-46 of the attached Appendix, and is
incorporated herein by reference.
 
  United Missouri Bank, U.S.A. is a consumer credit bank chartered in
Delaware. United Missouri Bank, U.S.A. services all incoming credit card
requests, performs data entry services on new card requests and evaluates new
and existing credit lines.
 
  Other subsidiaries of the Company are UMB Properties, Inc., United Missouri
Insurance Company, Scout Brokerage Services, Inc., UMB Community Development
Corporation, UMB Consulting Services, Inc. and UMB Data Corporation. UMB
Properties, Inc. is a real estate company that leases facilities to certain
subsidiaries and acquires and holds land and buildings for anticipated future
facilities. United Missouri Insurance Company, an Arizona corporation, is a
reinsurance company that reinsures credit life and disability insurance
originated by affiliate banks. Scout Brokerage Services, Inc. provides
transaction services in a variety of investment securities for the general
public. This subsidiary offers brokerage and custodial services to its
customers (including affiliate and correspondent banks) through the facilities
of National Financial Services Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Fidelity Brokerage Services, Inc. UMB Community Development Corporation
provides low-cost mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income families for
acquiring or rehabing owner-occupied housing in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois and
Colorado. UMB Consulting Services, Inc. offers regulatory and compliance
assistance to regional banks. UMB Data Corporation provides complete
correspondent services to banks throughout the region.
 
  On a full-time equivalent basis at December 31, 1995, UMB Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries employed 3,937 persons.
 
COMPETITION
 
  The commercial banking business is highly competitive. Affiliate banks
compete with other commercial banks and with other financial institutions,
including savings and loan associations, finance companies, money market
mutual funds, mortgage banking companies and credit unions. In recent years,
competition has also increased from institutions not subject to the same
geographical and other regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.
 
MONETARY POLICY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
 
  The operations of the Company's affiliate banks are affected by general
economic conditions as well as the monetary policy of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") which affects the
supply of money available to commercial banks. Monetary policy measures by the
Federal
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
 
Reserve Board are effected through open market operations in U.S. Government
securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in
reserve requirements.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") and to regulation by the Federal
Reserve Board.
 
  The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve Board before it may (i) acquire substantially all the
assets of any bank, (ii) acquire more than 5% of any class of voting stock of
a bank or bank holding company which is not already majority owned, or (iii)
merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.
 
  Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is prohibited, with certain
exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from
engaging in business other than that of banking, managing and controlling
banks or performing services for its banking subsidiaries. However, the BHCA
authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to permit bank holding companies to
engage in activities which are so closely related to banking or managing or
controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Federal Reserve
Board possesses cease and desist powers over bank holding companies if their
actions represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law.
 
  As a result of the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994,
beginning in September, 1995, bank holding companies may acquire banks in any
state, subject to state deposit caps and a 10% nationwide cap. Interstate
branching by bank merger will be permitted beginning June 1, 1997. States may
"opt out" of interstate branching prior to June 1, 1997, and may "opt in"
prior to that date.
 
  A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in
certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit, with
limited exceptions. There are also various legal restrictions on the extent to
which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can
borrow or otherwise obtain credit from its bank subsidiaries. The Company and
its subsidiaries are also subject to certain restrictions on issuance,
underwriting and distribution of securities.
 
  Three of the banks owned by the Company are national banks and are subject
to supervision and examination by the Comptroller of the Currency. United
Missouri Bank, U.S.A., a credit card bank, is chartered under the state
banking laws of Delaware and is subject to supervision and regular examination
by the Office of the State Bank Commissioner of Delaware. This Bank should
cease operations in 1996. A new national bank located in Omaha, Nebraska to be
known as UMB U.S.A. National Association will open in the first quarter of
1996 to engage in the credit card business. It will be subject to supervision
and examination by the Comptroller of the Currency. One of the affiliate banks
is chartered under the state banking laws of Colorado and is subject to
supervision and regular examination by the Office of the State Bank
Commissioner of Colorado. One of the affiliate banks is chartered under the
state banking laws of Kansas and is subject to supervision and regular
examination by the Kansas Banking Department. One is chartered under the state
banking laws of Oklahoma and is subject to supervision and regular examination
by the Oklahoma State Banking Department. The remaining 9 banks are chartered
under the state banking laws of Missouri and are subject to supervision and
regular examination by the Office of the Commissioner of Finance of Missouri.
In addition, the national banks and the one state bank that are members of the
Federal Reserve System are subject to examination by that agency. All
affiliate banks are members of and subject to examination by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
  Scout Brokerage Services, Inc. is subject to supervision and regulation by
the National Association of Securities Dealers. This subsidiary is also a
member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

regulators is included on pages A-14, A-39 and A-40 of the attached Appendix,

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  UMB Financial Corporation is a multi-bank holding company which offers a
wide range of banking services to its customers through its branches and
offices in the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Illinois, Oklahoma, Iowa
and Nebraska. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. These estimates and assumptions also impact reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Following is a summary of the more significant
accounting policies to assist the reader in understanding the financial
presentation.
 
  CONSOLIDATION -- All subsidiaries are included in the financial statements.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated where significant.
 
  ACQUISITIONS -- Banks acquired and recorded under the purchase method are
recorded at the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date,
and results of operations are included from that date. Excess of purchase
price over the value of net assets acquired is recorded as premiums on
purchased banks. Premiums on purchases prior to 1982 are being amortized
ratably over 40 years. Premiums on purchases in 1982 and after are being
amortized ratably over 15 years. Core deposit intangible assets are being
amortized ratably over 10 years.
 
  LOANS -- Interest on discount loans is recorded on a method that
approximates income at a level rate of return on the principal amount
outstanding over the term of the loan. Interest on all other loans is
recognized based on the rate times the principal amount outstanding. Interest
accrual is discontinued when, in the opinion of management, the likelihood of
collection becomes doubtful.
 
  Affiliate banks enter into lease financing transactions that are generally
recorded under the financing method of accounting. Income is recognized on a
basis that results in an approximately level rate of return over the life of
the lease.
 
  Annual bankcard fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period
that cardholders may use the card.
 
  The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management's
continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the
loan portfolio, including actual loan loss experience, current and anticipated
economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full
collectibility may not be assured and determination of the existence and
realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing such loans. The
actual losses, notwithstanding such considerations, however, could differ
significantly from the amounts estimated by management.
 
  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE -- Debt securities available for sale include
principally U.S. Treasury and agency securities and mortgage-backed
securities. Securities classified as available for sale are measured at fair
value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and
reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.
Realized gains and losses on sales are computed by the specific identification
method at the time of disposition and are shown separately as a component on
noninterest income.
 
  In conjunction with the adoption of the Implementation Guide for SFAS No.
115 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Company reassessed
its intent to hold some of its mortgage-backed securities to maturity.
Accordingly, on December 22, 1995, the Company reclassified its mortgage-
backed securities portfolio, with a book value of $86.2 million and a market
value of $85.2 million, to available for sale.
 
  INVESTMENT SECURITIES -- Investment securities are carried at amortized
historical cost based on management's intention, and the Company's ability, to
hold them to maturity. The Company classifies securities of state and
political subdivisions as investment securities. Certain significant
unforeseeable changes in circumstances may cause a change in the intent to
hold these securities to maturity. For example, such changes

may include a deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness that is expected
to continue or a change in tax law that eliminates the tax-exempt status of
interest on the security.
 
  TRADING SECURITIES -- Trading securities, generally acquired for subsequent
sale to customers, are carried at market value. Market adjustments, fees and
gains or losses on the sale of trading securities are considered to be a
normal part of operations and are included in trading and investment banking
income. Interest income on trading securities is included in income from
earning assets.
 
  TAXES -- The Company recognizes certain income and expenses in different
time periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The provision
for deferred income taxes is based on the liability method and represents the
change in the deferred income tax accounts during the year, including the
effect of enacted tax rate changes.
 
  PER SHARE DATA -- Earnings per share are computed based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. All
per share presentations have been restated to give effect to the 10% stock
dividend paid January 2, 1996, to the shareholders of record December 12,
1995. The dilutive effect of shares issuable under stock options granted by
the Company is immaterial.
 
  RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications were made to the 1994 and
1993 financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
 
  INDUSTRY SEGMENT REPORTING -- The Company operates principally in a single
business segment offering general commercial banking services.
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
  ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN -- On January 1, 1995, the
Company implemented SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan." This Statement requires that impaired loans be measured based on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
interest rate, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of
collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. In October 1994, SFAS No. 118
was issued as an amendment to SFAS No. 114 to allow a creditor to use existing
methods for recognizing interest income on an impaired loan. The
implementation of these Statements did not have a significant effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operation.
 
  ACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS -- The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets." This Statement, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995, establishes accounting standards for the impairment of
long-lived assets, certain intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets.
The Company does not expect this Statement to have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.
 
  ACCOUNTING FOR MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS -- The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing
Rights," which is an amendment to SFAS No. 65, "Accounting for Certain
Mortgage Banking Activities." This Statement establishes accounting standards
for originated mortgage servicing rights. Under the new Statement, all
capitalized mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on
the excess of the mortgage servicing rights over their fair value. SFAS No.
122 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 1995 and did not have a
significant effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operation.
 
  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION -- Effective as of January 1, 1996,
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," will require
increased disclosure of compensation expense arising

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
from both fixed and performance stock compensation plans. Compensation will be
measured as the fair value of the award at the date it is granted using an
option-pricing model that takes into account the exercise price and expected
term of the option, the current price of the underlying stock, its expected
volatility, expected dividends on the stock and the expected risk-free rate of
return during the term of the option. The compensation cost would be
recognized over the service period, usually the period from the grant date to
the vesting date. SFAS No. 123 encourages rather than requires companies to
adopt a new method that accounts for stock compensation awards based on their
estimated fair value at the date they are granted. Companies would be
permitted, however, to continue accounting under APB Opinion No. 25 which
requires compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans be
recognized based on the difference, if any, between the quoted market price of
the stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The
Company will continue to apply APB Opinion No. 25 in its financial statements
and will disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share in a footnote to
future financial statements, determined as if the Company applied the new
method.
 
ACQUISITIONS
 
  On December 13, 1995, the Company acquired First Sooner Bancshares, the one-
bank holding company of The Oklahoma Bank, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (now UMB
Oklahoma Bank), for $12.7 million. The acquisition was funded with existing
working capital. The acquisition of this $139 million bank was recorded as a
purchase, with $3.3 million recorded as premium on purchased bank. This
acquisition is not deemed to be material in relation to the consolidated
results of the Company.
 
  As of June 25, 1993, the Company had consummated the acquisitions of eight
Kansas bank holding companies (the "Kansas banks"). During 1994, these Kansas
banks were merged to form two banks, UMB National Bank of America and UMB Bank
Kansas. The eight companies and their subsidiary banks are presented below:

  The cash portion of the purchase prices was obtained principally through the
issuance of debt by the Company. On February 24, 1993, the Company issued $10
million in medium-term notes due 2000 at 6.81% and $15 million in medium-term
notes due 2003 at 7.30%.
 
  The acquisitions of the Kansas banks have been accounted for by the Company
under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations," as amended. Under
this method of accounting, the purchase prices have been allocated to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,
including applicable income tax effects, at the effective dates of the
acquisitions. Income of the combined company does not include income of the
acquired companies prior to the effective dates of the acquisitions.

  Long-term debt represents direct, unsecured obligations of the parent
company. The senior notes due in 2000 and 2003 cannot be redeemed prior to
stated maturity. The senior notes due in 1996 required annual redemptions of
$3,572,000. Optional prepayments without premiums were made on the senior
notes due in 1996 of $2,678,000 in 1993 and $3,572,000 in 1992. The senior
notes due in 1999 require annual redemptions of $3,000,000 beginning in 1995.
The 7.50% notes that mature in 1997 require annual principal payments of
$1,546,000. The senior notes contain financial covenants relating to the
issuance of additional debt, payment of dividends, reacquisition of common
stock and maintenance of minimum tangible capital. Under the most restrictive
covenant, approximately $102,848,000 was available for the payment of
dividends at December 31, 1995.
 
  The Company enters into sales of securities with simultaneous agreements to
repurchase ("repurchase agreements"). The amounts received under these
agreements represent short-term borrowings and are reflected as a separate
item in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount outstanding at December 31,
1995, was $672,940,000 (with accrued interest payable of $926,000). Of that
amount, $1,970,000 represented sales of securities in which the securities
were obtained under reverse repurchase agreements ("resell agreements"). The
remainder of $670,970,000 represented sales of U.S. Treasury and agency
securities obtained from the Company's securities portfolio. The carrying
amounts and market values of the securities and the related repurchase
liabilities and weighted average interest rates of the repurchase liabilities
(grouped by maturity of the repurchase agreements) were as follows (in
thousands):

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 
  Payment of dividends by the affiliate banks to the parent company is subject
to various regulatory restrictions. For national banks, state banks that are
Federal Reserve members and state banks in Colorado and Oklahoma, the
governing regulatory agency must approve the declaration of any dividends
generally in excess of the sum of net income for that year and retained net
income for the preceding two years. The state banks in Missouri, Kansas and
Illinois are subject to state laws permitting dividends to be declared from
retained earnings, provided certain specified capital requirements are met. At
December 31, 1995 approximately $25,384,000 of the equity of the affiliate
banks was available for distribution as dividends to the parent company
without prior regulatory approval or without reducing the capital of the
respective affiliate banks below prudent levels.
 
  The Company is required to maintain minimum amounts of capital to total
"risk weighted" assets, as defined by the banking regulators. At December 31,
1995, the Company is required to have minimum Tier 1 and Total capital ratios
of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. The Company's actual ratios at that date
were 15.17% and 16.16%, respectively. The Company's leverage ratio at December
31, 1995, was 8.02%.
 
  Certain affiliate banks maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve
Bank as required by law. During 1995, this amount averaged $137,259,000.
 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
 
  The Company has a noncontributory profit sharing plan, which features an
employee stock ownership plan. These plans are for the benefit of
substantially all officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Contributions to these plans for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993 were
$5,000,000, $3,983,000, and $3,542,00, respectively.
 
  The Company has a qualified 401(k) profit sharing plan that permits
participants to make contributions by salary reduction. The Company made a
matching contribution to this plan of $144,000 for 1995.
 
  Substantially all officers and employees are covered by a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan. Under the plan, retirement benefits are based on
years of service and the average of the employee's highest 120 consecutive
months of compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually
the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. To the
extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the plan, a
contribution may not be made in a particular year.
 
  The pension plan was amended in January 1995 whereby the plan would not
accept any new participants. This change was made with consideration given to
discontinuing the current plan at a future date. New employees of the Company
that are not eligible to participate in the pension plan will receive a
partial matching contribution to the qualified 401(k) plan, as amended.
 
  The following items are components of the net periodic pension expense
(income) for the three years ended December 31, 1995 (in thousands):

  On April 16, 1992, the shareholders of the Company approved the 1992
Incentive Stock Option Plan ("the 1992 Plan"), which provides incentive
options to certain key employees for up to 500,000 common shares of the
Company. The options are not exercisable for two years from the date of the
grant and are thereafter exercisable for such periods as the Board of
Directors, or a committee thereof, specify (which may not exceed 10 years),
provided that the optionee has remained in the employment of the Company or
its subsidiaries. The Board or the committee may accelerate the exercise
period for an option upon the optionee's disability, retirement or death. All
options expire at the end of the exercise period. The Company makes no
recognition in the balance sheet of the options until such options are
exercised and no amounts applicable thereto are reflected in net income.
Options are granted at not less than 100% of fair market value at date of
grant.
 
  Activity in the 1992 Plan for the three years ended December 31, 1995, is

rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit,
commercial letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and futures
contracts. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit
and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated
balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect
the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial
instruments.
 
  The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit,
commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by
the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the
same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it
does for on-balance-sheet instruments. For futures contracts, the contract or
notional amounts do not represent exposure to credit loss. The Company
controls the credit risk of its futures contracts through credit approvals,
limits and monitoring procedures.
 
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. These
conditions generally include, but are not limited to, each customer being
current as to repayment terms of existing loans and no deterioration in the
customer's financial condition. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The
interest rate is generally a variable, or floating, interest rate. If the
commitment has a fixed interest rate, the rate is generally not set until such
time as credit is extended. For credit card customers, the Company has the
right to change or terminate any terms or conditions of the credit card
account at any time. Since a large portion of the commitments and unused
credit card lines are never actually drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates
each customer's creditworthiness on an individual basis. The amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of
credit, is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but
may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate, plant and equipment,
stock, securities and certificates of deposit.
 
  Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate trade or
commerce. Under the terms of a commercial letter of credit, as a general rule,
drafts will be drawn when the underlying transaction is consummated as
intended. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
 
  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company
holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary.
Collateral varies but may include such items as those described for
commitments to extend credit.
 
  Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money
market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified
future date of a specified instrument at a specified yield. Risks arise from
the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts
and from movements in securities values and interest rates. Instruments used
in trading activities are carried at market value and gains and losses on
futures contracts are settled in cash daily. Any changes in the market value
are recognized in trading and investment banking income.
 
  The Company's use of futures contracts is very limited. The Company uses
contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in the
trading portfolio. The contract amount of open positions in financial futures
contracts at December 31, 1995 was $59.1 milion and $36.0 million at December
31, 1994. Open futures contract positions averaged $42.6 million and $44.5
million during the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Net
futures activity resulted in losses of $3.4 million for 1995 and gains of $2.7
million for 1994.
 
  The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts on a limited basis.
For operating purposes the Company maintains certain balances in foreign
banks. Foreign exchange contracts are purchased on a monthly

basis to avoid foreign exchange risk on these foreign balances. The Company
will also enter into foreign exchange contracts to facilitate foreign exchange
needs of customers. The Company will enter into a contract to buy or sell a
foreign currency at a future date only as part of a contract to sell or buy
the foreign currency at the same future date to a customer. The Company had
foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 1995 of $4.5 million and no foreign
exchange contracts at December 31, 1994. During 1995 contracts to purchase and
to sell foreign currency averaged approximately $1.7 million, compared to $1.2
million during 1994. The gain or loss on these foreign exchange contracts for
1995 and 1994 was not significant.
 
  With respect to group concentrations of credit risk, most of the Company's
business activity is with customers in the states of Missouri, Kansas,
Colorado and Illinois. At December 31, 1995, the Company did not have any
significant credit concentrations in any particular industry.
 
  In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named
defendants in various lawsuits and counterclaims. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel, none of these lawsuits will
have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE COMMITMENT
 
  On December 14, 1995, the Company and its Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) entered into a commitment to repurchase 1,581,133 shares of common
stock of the Company at a price of $43.50 per share. On January 2, 1996, a
total of 1,068,533 of those shares were acquired from the Seller. The Company
acquired 688,533 of such shares for treasury stock purposes using existing
working capital. The remaining 380,000 shares were purchased by the ESOP and
funded by a seven-year, 6.1% fixed rate loan, which is guaranteed by the
Company. The accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 1995 reflects the
shares acquired in January as temporary equity with a corresponding reduction
of shareholders' equity.
 
  The remaining 512,600 common shares to be purchased are not presently owned
by the Seller, but are subject to an option agreement with a third-party
financial institution. Due to uncertainties surrounding the transfer of such
options to the Company and continued regulatory approval, the remaining
shares, which will be purchased in equal installments in March and June of
1996, have not been recorded as temporary equity.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
  SFAS No. 107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheet. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
 
  CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS -- The carrying amounts of cash and due from
banks, federal funds sold and resell agreements are reasonable estimates of
their fair values.
 
  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES -- Fair values are
based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted
market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market
prices for similar securities.
 
  TRADING SECURITIES -- Fair values for trading securities (including
financial futures), which also are the amounts recognized in the balance
sheet, are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for
similar securities.
 
  LOANS -- Fair values are estimated for portfolios with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial, real
estate, consumer, and credit card. Each loan category is further segmented
into fixed and variable interest rate categories. The fair value of loans is
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at
which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and
for the same remaining maturities.
 
  DEPOSIT LIABILITIES -- The fair value of demand deposits and savings
accounts is the amount payable on demand at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.
The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
  SHORT-TERM DEBT -- The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased,
repurchase agreements and other short-term debt are reasonable estimates of
their fair values.
 
  LONG-TERM DEBT -- Rates currently available to the Company for debt with
similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of
existing debt.
 
  OTHER OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS -- The fair value of a loan commitment
and a letter of credit is determined based on the fees currently charged to
enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. Neither the
fees earned during the year on these instruments or their fair value at year-
end are significant to the Company's consolidated financial position.
 
  The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are as follows (in millions):

  The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information
available to management as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993. Although
management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and,
therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the
amounts presented herein.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of UMB Financial Corporation:
 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UMB
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UMB Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
 
  As discussed in the Accounting Policies note to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain
investments in debt and equity securities effective December 31, 1993, to
conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115.

                           UMB FINANCIAL CORPORATION
 
                               FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
  The following financial review presents management's discussion and analysis
of UMB Financial Corporation's consolidated financial condition and results of
operations. This review highlights the major factors affecting results of
operations and any significant changes in financial condition for the three-
year period ending December 31, 1995. It should be read in conjunction with
the accompanying consolidated financial statements, notes to financial
statements and other financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report.
 
OVERVIEW
 
  The Company recorded consolidated net income of $52.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1995, compared to $47.8 million and $41.1 million for 1994
and 1993, respectively. These operating results represent a 9.1% increase in
net income for 1995 as compared to 1994 and a 16.3% increase for 1994 as
compared to 1993. Per share earnings for 1995 were $2.52, an 11.5% increase
over 1994 per share earnings of $2.26. Per share results for 1994 represented
a 6.1% increase over 1993 results of $2.13. All share and per share data have
been restated to give effect to a 10 percent stock dividend distributed to
shareholders on January 2, 1996.
 
  The Company's improved earnings during 1995 over 1994 were primarily driven
by an increase in net interest income, along with a slight increase in
noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by an increased
provision for loan losses and marginally higher noninterest expenses.
 
  A significant factor in the increase in the Company's earnings in 1994 as
compared to 1993 was the acquisition of 12 banks in the State of Kansas (the
Acquired Banks) during 1993. These acquisitions were completed by the second
quarter of 1993. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase
transaction, therefore the results of operations of the Acquired Banks are
included in consolidated earnings from the respective date of acquisition.
 
  Per share earnings for both 1995 and 1994 also benefited from a reduction in
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock resulting from ongoing share
repurchases. The Company continues to consider purchases based on
availability, price and alternative use of funds.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
NET INTEREST INCOME
 
  Net interest income, the Company's principal source of earnings, is the
amount of interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense
paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Table 1 summarizes the changes in net
interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for the past two
years. Net interest income on a fully tax-equivalent basis (FTE), average
balance sheet amounts, and the corresponding yields and rates for the years
1991 through 1995 are shown on pages A-44 and A-45. Net interest income is
presented on a "tax-equivalent" basis to adjust for the tax-exempt status of
earnings from certain loans and investments, primarily the obligations of
states and local governments.
 
  For the year ended December 31, 1995, interest income, on a tax-equivalent
basis, increased by $34.7 million to $365.1 million, compared to $330.4
million in 1994 and $290.0 million in 1993. For 1995, interest expense
increased by $21.7 million to $157.8 million, compared to $136.1 million in
1994 and $119.7 million in 1993. These changes resulted in an increase in the
Company's net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, of $13.0 million to
$207.3 million during 1995 compared to $194.3 million in 1994 and $170.3
million in 1993.

TABLE 1: TAX-EQUIVALENT RATE-VOLUME ANALYSIS (IN THOUSANDS)
 
  This analysis attributes changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent
basis either to changes in average balances or to changes in average rates for
earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The change in interest due
jointly to volume and rate has been allocated to volume and rate in proportion
to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of change in each. All
information is presented on a tax-equivalent basis and gives effect to the
disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes, related to
certain tax-free assets.

  Net interest margin measures the Company's ability to generate net interest
income. It is defined as net interest income (FTE) as a percent of average
earning assets. The behavior of the margin depends on the interaction of three
factors: 1) net interest spread (defined as the difference between the yield
on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities); 2) yield
earned on assets funded by interest-free funding sources (primarily
noninterest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital); and 3) percentage of
earning assets funded by interest-free funding sources.

  Earning assets averaged $5.0 billion during 1995 compared to $5.4 billion in
1994 and $4.9 billion in 1993. The decrease in average earnings assets during
1995 was primarily the result of a reduction in investment securities which
were used to fund a decrease in deposits. The decrease in deposits was
primarily related to deposits associated with the Company's mutual fund
processing. The increase in average earning assets in 1994 as compared to 1993
was primarily the result of Acquired Banks.
 
  The net interest margin earned by the Company during 1995 was 4.17%,
compared to 3.61% in 1994 and 3.48% in 1993. The primary factors in the
improvement in the Company's net interest margin in 1995 as compared to 1994
were an overall increase in interest rates and a change in the balance sheet
mix of the Company. Average loans increased by $198 million in 1995 and
comprised 47% of total earning assets as compared to 40% in 1994 and 37% in
1993. The increase in loans, which occurred during a period of increasing
interest rates, has benefited the Company because loans generally reprice
faster than investment securities. The increase in the Company's net interest
income in 1994 as compared to 1993 was primarily driven by an increase in
lending activity.
 
  The yield on the Company's earning assets during 1995 was 7.34% compared to
6.13% for 1994 and 5.92% for 1993. During 1995, the Company was in a position
to benefit from increasing interest rates due to its floating rate loans,
which comprise 55.4% of the loan portfolio and the reinvestment of security
maturities and short-term investments.
 
  The general increase in interest rates in 1995 as compared to 1994 also
resulted in an increase in the Company's cost of funds. Cost of funds
increased to 4.04% in 1995 from 3.17% in 1994 and 3.05% in 1993. The 87-basis-
point increase in cost of funds for 1995 compares to a 121-basis-point
increase in the yield on earning assets for 1995. As a result of these
changes, the Company's net interest spread increased to 3.30% for 1995 from
2.96% in 1994 and 2.87% in 1993. This represents the largest net interest
spread the Company has earned in eight years. This 1995 increase allowed the
Company to increase its net interest income even though average earning assets
decreased by 7.6% during 1995. As interest rates increase, the impact on the
Company's cost of funds has traditionally been delayed or diluted due to the
flexibility the Company has in pricing its core deposits, which comprised
87.6% of average funding sources for 1995.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSS
 
  The allowance for loan losses (ALL) represents management's judgment of the
losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses
is the amount necessary to adjust the ALL to the level considered appropriate
by management. The adequacy of the ALL is reviewed quarterly considering such
items as historical loss trends, a review of individual loans, current and
projected economic conditions, loan growth and characteristics and other
factors. Bank regulatory agencies require that the adequacy of the ALL be
maintained on a bank-by-bank basis for each of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
  At December 31, 1995, the Company's ALL was $32.7 million, compared to $32.5
million and $35.6 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. At
December 31, 1995, the ALL as a percentage of total loans was 1.3% compared to
1.4% and 1.7% at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. At December 31,
1995, the ALL exceeded total nonperforming loans by $29.0 million compared to
an excess of $27.2 million at year-end 1994.
 
  As shown in Table 3, the ALL has been allocated to various loan portfolio
segments. The Company manages the ALL against the risk in the entire loan
portfolio and therefore the allocation of the ALL to a particular loan segment
may change in the future. In the opinion of management, the ALL is adequate
based on the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at December 31, 1995.
 
  The company's provision for loan losses was $5.1 million in 1995, $2.6
million in 1994 and $3.3 million in 1993. The increase in the provision for
loan losses in 1995, compared to the prior two years, is primarily a factor of
the increase in the Company's average loans and not indicative of a change in
the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs in 1995 were
$5.4 million compared to $5.7 million and $4.3 million in 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Charge-offs of bankcard and other consumer loans have increased
for the last two years. The overall increase in consumer indebtedness on a
national basis has fueled predictions that the quality of consumer debt will
deteriorate and therefore increase losses in the industry. The Company has
experienced only a marginal increase in bankcard delinquencies over 30 days,
which totaled 3.03% of total bankcard loans at December 31, 1995. There has
been no change in the Company's underwriting policies and practices in this
area. The delinquency rate and loss rate on the bankcard loan portfolio is and
should remain well below industry averages. The Company will continue to
closely monitor this area and take appropriate actions, including increasing
collection efforts, in order to minimize credit losses.
 
  Based on a current assessment of the risk in the total loan portfolio and
current economic conditions, and absent any unforeseen circumstances,
management does not anticipate a material increase in the Company's loan
 
                                     A-28

loss provision for 1996. Any significant increase in the loan loss provision
for 1996 would likely be a result of continued increases in the loan
portfolio.
 
  Table 4 presents a five-year summary of the Company's allowance for loan
losses. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans for 1995 were 0.23%,
which is the lowest level of charge-offs the Company has experienced in over
10 years.

NONINTEREST INCOME
 
  Management has stressed growth of noninterest income to enhance the
Company's profitability since fee-based services are non credit related,
provide steady income and are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates.
These activities are also relatively low-risk and do not impact the Company's
regulatory capital needs. Fee-based services that have been emphasized include
trust and securities processing, securities trading, cash management and
merchant processing. Fee income (exclusive of net security gains) as a percent
of adjusted operating revenues was 40.8% in 1995. Adjusted operating revenues
is defined as tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income,
excluding net security gains.
 
                                     A-29
<PAGE>
 
  Noninterest income, exclusive of net securities gains, was $142.6 million in
1995, compared to $138.1 million in 1994 and $129.9 million in 1993. This
represents a 3.2% increase for 1995, compared to 1994. This increase, which is
less than the traditional growth rate for the Company, was affected by a
reduction in income from mutual fund securities processing and only slight
growth in trust fees. Approximately 50% of the increase in noninterest income
in 1994 over 1993 was the result of including the Acquired Banks on
consolidated results of operation for an entire year in 1994.
 
  Trust fees represent the largest component of noninterest income and totaled
$35.9 million in 1995, $35.0 million in 1994 and $32.0 million in 1993. The
Company has long been identified as a leader in the trust area. Management will
continue to aggressively market these services in order to grow and benefit
from this recognized strength of the Company. The Company offers a full range
of trust services including personal and custody services, investment
management and employee benefits. During 1995 the Company began a comprehensive
review of the pricing and structure of trust services in order to increase
efficiencies. The Company also plans to increase its marketing efforts at the
retail level in order to take better advantage of its existing branch network.
The aggregate value of managed trust assets at December 31, 1995, was $10.0
billion, compared to $8.7 billion and $9.3 billion at December 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively.
 
  The Company's revenue from custodial trust services is primarily related to
the mutual fund industry. Revenue from securities processing services decreased
to $10.5 million in 1995 from $12.5 million in 1994 and $13.3 million in 1993.
The declines in the past two years are primarily the result of changes with
what was the Company's largest custody processing customer. During 1993, the
customer was given significant price concessions because of competitive
pressures. The Company reduced its related operating costs where possible, in
order to minimize the effect of the pricing change. In 1994 this same customer
was acquired by a competitor of the Company, which resulted in the loss of this
custody processing business. The transition period prior to the loss of this
business was sufficient to allow for an orderly reduction in operating costs to
help offset the effect of this change. The Company is aggressively pursuing new
business to replace the above loss. During the last year the Company has
established relationships with 10 additional mutual funds companies. The
magnitude of the services provided to these new customers varies. This
diversification should allow the Company the opportunity to regain its lost
market share with reduced concentration risks. Total trust assets under custody
were $102.9 billion at December 31, 1995, $189.8 billion at year-end 1994 and
$187.1 billion at year-end 1993.
 
  Fee income from service charges on deposit accounts was $33.2 million in
1995, compared to $32.9 million in 1994 and $30.2 million in 1993. Other
service charge income was $11.3 million in 1995, $11.7 million in 1994 and
$11.2 million in 1993. The increase in interest rates in 1995 allowed
commercial customers a higher level of earnings credits on demand deposit
balances to offset service charges for account activity and other services
provided. During 1995, the Company completed a review of all service charge
fees and as a result increased fee levels in many areas. These increases did
not have a significant impact in 1995, but an entire year's benefit will be
realized in 1996. Bankcard fees increased 9.4% in 1995 to $33.7 million from
$30.8 million in 1994 and $24.9 million in 1993. The increase in 1995 was
primarily the result of a higher volume of merchant transactions. When
possible, the fees charged to merchants were adjusted during 1995 in response
to an increase in the Company's cost structure resulting from a conversion to a
new bankcard merchant processor. The increase in 1994 over 1993 was the result
of an increase in merchant transaction volume and the activity related to the
Acquired Banks.
 
  Trading and investment banking income increased 12.5% during 1995 to $11.2
million compared to $9.9 million in 1994 and $13.6 million in 1993. Transaction
volumes increased during 1995 as a result of increased demand for municipal and
government-backed securities. The Company's correspondent bank customers
experienced an increase in liquidity during 1995 which resulted in higher
transaction volumes. The decrease in income during 1994 as compared to 1993 was
consistent with the industry norm as demand for mortgage-backed securities
decreased significantly and a lack of liquidity by correspondent banks
decreased overall volume.
 
                                      A-30
<PAGE>
 
  Other income increased to $6.8 million in 1995 from $5.3 million in 1994 and
$4.6 million in 1993. Included in other income for 1995 is an approximate $2.5
million gain on the sale of the Company's minority ownership in an
unconsolidated subsidiary. The increase in other income in 1994 over 1993 was
primarily the result of the Acquired Banks. Net security gains in 1995 were
$1.4 million, compared to $3.6 million in 1994 and $1.6 million in 1993. During
1995, the Company generally matched gains with losses when repositioning
portions of the available for sale portfolio. Over 80% of the net security
gains in 1994 and 1993 was the result of repositioning the investment
portfolio.
 
NONINTEREST EXPENSE
 
  Noninterest expense increased by less than 2.0% in 1995 to $260.5 million,
from $255.9 million in 1994 and $230.4 million in 1993. The most significant
items affecting 1995 results were tighter control of staffing costs, a
reduction in premiums for deposit insurance and an increase in bankcard
processing expense. The majority of the increase in noninterest expense in 1994
over 1993 was the result of the Acquired Banks.
 
  Personnel cost is the largest component of noninterest expense as it
represents approximately 47% of total operating costs. Salary and employee
benefit expense totaled $122.6 million in 1995, compared to $121.3 million in
1994 and $107.2 million in 1993. The minimal increase in staffing costs during
1995 was the result of a reduction in staffing levels which, prior to the
December 1995 acquisition of a bank in Oklahoma, were 3,785 at year-end 1995
compared to 4,006 at year-end 1994. This reduction was partially offset by
merit salary increases and increased costs associated with the Company's profit
sharing and pension plans. The Company intends to continue reviewing its
staffing levels and further reductions, net of expansion, will be considered. A
primary factor in these considerations will be ensuring that changes do not
adversely affect the level of customer service offered by the Company.
 
  Premiums paid for deposit insurance and regulatory fees totaled $7.6 million
in 1995, $12.2 million in 1994 and $11.0 million in 1993. The decrease in 1995
expense was the result of a mid-year reduction in the assessment rate for
deposit insurance. This assessment rate was further reduced for 1996, which
should benefit the Company in future years. Deposit insurance expense was also
affected by a reduction in average deposits which totaled $4.6 billion in 1995
and $5.0 billion in 1994.
 
  Bankcard processing costs increased 27.1% in 1995 to $32.8 million from $25.8
million in 1994 and $20.8 million in 1993. The 1995 change is a result of
higher merchant transaction volumes and an increase in costs resulting from a
conversion to a new bankcard processor. Prior to 1995 the Company's bankcard
processing was performed by a joint venture between the Company, as a minority
owner, and two other banking companies. Based on the requests of the majority
owners, the operations of this joint venture were sold to the Company's current
processor during 1995. The costs associated with converting to the new
processing system were greater than expected as were the new ongoing processing
costs. Much effort has gone toward better control of the new processing system
in order to increase its efficiency. The Company will continue to review its
options related to merchant bankcard processing costs and the profitability of
the business line.
 
  Occupancy costs increased by 5.7% in 1995 to $16.0 million from $15.1 million
in 1994 and $14.8 million in 1993. The 1995 increase was the result of costs
related to new facilities opened during the year and the outsourcing of certain
functions previously performed in-house. The Company's 1995 expansion also
impacted equipment costs which increased 7.5% to $22.3 million in 1995 from
$20.7 million in 1994 and $20.3 million in 1993. The Company also has higher
equipment costs from increased investments in new technology including
information and data processing equipment and software.
 
  Supplies and services expense was $19.2 million in both 1995 and 1994,
compared to $17.4 million in 1993. The increase in 1994 over 1993 was primarily
the result of the Acquired Banks. Marketing and business development expense
was $13.1 million in 1995, compared to $12.5 million in 1994 and $11.4 million
in 1993.
 
                                      A-31
<PAGE>
 
During 1995 the Company continued its practice of identifying selected products
or services for special promotional campaigns. Other expenses totaled $20.0
million in 1995, compared to $22.0 million in 1994 and $22.2 million in 1993.
The decrease in other expenses during 1995 was the result of a reduction in
legal and professional services and overall efforts to reduce operating costs.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
  Income tax expense totaled $25.4 million in 1995, compared to $22.6 million
in 1994 and $20.1 million in 1993. The effective tax rates were 32.78%, 32.08%
and 32.87% for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The primary reason for the
difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the statutory rate is
the effect of nontaxable interest income, partially offset by nondeductible
goodwill amortization.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
LOANS
 
  As of December 31, 1995, total loans were $2.5 billion, compared to $2.3
billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. These
loan totals represent an 8.1% increase for 1995 and a 5.1% increase in 1994.
Average loans were $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion for 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively. The increase in loans for 1995 was prudently
diversified between business and consumer loans. The increase in consumer
installment loans during 1995 was primarily the result of a targeted loan
campaign offered by all of the Company's subsidiary banks. Traditionally, the
largest portion of the Company's consumer installment loan portfolio has been
indirect automobile loans purchased from automobile dealers. During 1995 the
Company aggressively marketed a direct automobile loan program for the dual
purpose of making high quality loans and establishing a direct relationship
with the borrower. Other retail products were then sold to these new loan
customers. There were no changes or compromises to the Company's underwriting
standards for purposes of the direct automobile campaign.
 
  As noted in Table 5, business-related loans have consistently been the
largest segment of the loan portfolio. The Company's subsidiary banks are
structured as business banks that target small- to medium-size commercial and
manufacturing companies within the trade territory of the bank. The Company's
targeted customer base is often a second or third generation, family-owned
company that utilizes several credit and noncredit products of the Company.
Recent expansion plans for the Company have included loan production offices in
cities in which the Company previously had no office or branch. The primary
goal of the loan production offices is to market business-related loans and
other commercial products to potential customers who may feel displaced or
unsatisfied by their current lender. The Company will continue its efforts to
increase market share by opportunities brought on by the ongoing consolidation
in the banking industry and the competition's increased emphasis on retail
business versus commercial.
 
                                      A-32
<PAGE>
 
  Commercial real estate loans, which comprise 12.3% of total loans, generally
are traditional business loans made for working capital or expansion purposes
that are primarily secured by real estate. These loans generally do not exceed
a maximum loan-to-value of 80% and often have other collateral or guarantees
as security. Many of these properties are owned-occupied, allowing the Company
to regularly monitor the condition and market of the real estate. Real estate
construction loans made up less than 1% of total loans at year-end 1995.

LOAN QUALITY
 
  The quality of the loan portfolio has always been an underlying strength of
the Company. A measure of the effectiveness of credit risk management is the
percentage of the loan portfolio that is classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans. The
Company's nonperforming loans totaled $3.6 million at December 31, 1995,
representing only 0.1% of the loan portfolio, compared to $5.3 million and
0.2% one year earlier. The Company's nonperforming loans have not exceeded
0.5% of total loans in any of the last five years.
 
  Nonperforming assets include foreclosed real estate along with the
nonaccrual and restructured loans. The Company's nonperforming asset ratio
(nonperforming assets divided by loans plus foreclosed real estate) was 0.2%
at December 31, 1995, and 0.5% at December 31, 1994. At December 31, 1995, the
Company had foreclosed real estate of only $0.6 million compared to $5.4
million at December 31, 1994.
 
                                     A-33
<PAGE>
 
  At December 31, 1995, loans over 90 days past due totaled $5.3 million, or
0.2% of total loans, compared to 0.2% of total loans at year-end 1994.
Approximately 25% of the year-end 1995 past due amounts were bankcard loans.
 
  Key factors of the Company's loan quality program are a sound credit policy
combined with periodic and independent credit reviews. All affiliate banks
operate under written loan policies. Credit decisions continue to be based on
the borrower's cash flow position and the value of underlying collateral, as
well as other relevant factors. Each bank is responsible for evaluating its
loans by using a ranking system. In addition, the Company has an internal loan
review staff that operates independently of the affiliate banks. This review
team performs periodic examinations of each bank's loans for credit quality,
documentation and loan administration.
 
  Another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification. By keeping its
loan portfolio diversified, the Company has avoided problems associated with
undue concentrations of loans within particular industries. Commercial real
estate loans comprise 12.3% of total loans, with a history of no significant
losses. The Company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged
transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio.
 
  A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due
90 days or more and when management has considerable doubt about the
borrower's ability to repay on the terms originally contracted. The accrual of
interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received
in cash. At year-end 1995, $227,000 of interest due was not recorded as
earned, compared to $215,000 for the prior year.
 
  Certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of
interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of
the respective borrowers. Management estimates that approximately $25,000 of
additional interest would have been earned in 1995 if the terms of these loans
were similar to other comparable loans. In certain instances, the Company
continues to accrue interest on loans past due 90 days or more. Though the
loan payments are delinquent, collection of interest and principal is expected
to resume and sufficient collateral is believed to exist to protect the
Company from significant loss. Consequently, management considers the ultimate
collection of these loans to be reasonable and has recorded $217,000 of
interest due as earned for 1995. The comparative figure for 1994 was $54,000.

  In December 1995, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board's
"A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The implementation guide allows
for, among other things, the one-time reclassification of securities from the
held to
 
                                     A-34
<PAGE>
 
maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio, without affecting the
classification or accounting treatment for the remainder of the investment
portfolio.
 
  As a result, the Company reclassified the mortgage-backed securities that
had previously been included in the held to maturity portfolio to available
for sale. The securities included in this reclassification had a book value of
$86.2 million and a market value of $85.2 million. At December 31, 1995, only
securities of state and political subdivisions were classified as held to
maturity.
 
  At December 31, 1995, the Company had total securities of $2.6 billion,
compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 1994. Average securities for 1995 were
$2.4 billion, compared to $2.8 billion for 1994. The decrease in securities
for the year was the result of loan growth and a reduction in deposit totals,
primarily those related to the mutual fund processing business. During 1995
securities represented 47.9% of total average earning assets, compared to
52.8% during 1994.
 
  At December 31, 1995, 88% of the Company's securities were classified as
available for sale, compared to 86% at year-end 1994. At December 31, 1995,
U.S. Treasury obligations represented 72.2% of the available for sale
portfolio. U.S. Agency obligations represented an additional 21.3% of this
classification. At December 31, 1995, securities available for sale had a net
unrealized gain of $5.8 million compared to a net unrealized loss of $57.0
million at year-end 1994. These differences between cost and fair value were
reflected, on an after-tax basis, in the Company's shareholders' equity as a
gain of $3.6 million at December 31, 1995, and a loss of $35.2 million at
year-end 1994. This change is primarily a factor of higher interest rates and
average life of the security portfolio which allows for the regular
reinvestment of maturities at current interest rates.
 
  The average yield on a tax-equivalent basis for the entire security
portfolio was 5.52% during 1995 compared to 4.94% in 1994 and 4.88% in 1993.
The increase in yield during 1995 was the result of higher interest rates
which allowed the Company to reinvest maturities into higher yielding
securities. The average life of the security portfolio was 18 months at
December 31, 1995, and 17 months at year-end 1994. Included in Tables 7 and 8
is an analysis of the cost, fair value and average yield of the Company's
securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

OTHER EARNING ASSETS
 
  Federal funds transactions essentially are overnight loans between financial
institutions which allow for either the daily investment of excess funds or
borrowing another institution's funds in order to meet short-term liquidity
needs. The net sold position at year-end 1995 was $6.9 million, compared to
$149.6 million for year-end 1994. During 1995 and 1994, the Company was a net
purchaser of federal funds, and this funding source averaged $55.1 million in
1995, compared to $60.1 million during 1994.
 
  The Investment Banking Division of the Company's principal affiliate bank
buys and sells federal funds as agent for nonaffiliated banks. Due to the
agency arrangement, these transactions do not appear on the balance sheet and
averaged $744.9 million in 1995 and $568.6 million in 1994.
 
  The Investment Banking Division also maintains an active securities trading
inventory. The average holdings in the securities trading inventory in 1995
were $60.1 million, compared to $56.5 million in 1994, and were recorded at
market value.

DEPOSITS AND BORROWED FUNDS
 
  Interest-bearing liabilities totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 1995,
compared to $4.4 billion at year-end 1994 and 1993. Average interest-bearing
liabilities were $3.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion during 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.
 
  Year-end and average interest-bearing deposits for 1995 were $3.2 billion
compared to year-end and average totals for 1994 of $3.6 billion. Interest-
bearing deposits at year-end 1993 were $3.7 billion and averaged $3.3 billion
for the year. The most significant cause of the decrease during 1995 was a
reduction in deposits related to a large mutual fund processing customer. As
noted previously, the Company's largest processing customer was sold to a
bank, which resulted in the processing business and related balances leaving
the Company. The balances associated with this business varied between $200
and $300 million. Historically, the interest rate paid on these balances was
significantly higher than the Company's average cost of funds. Deposit totals
have also been affected by the flow of funds from the banking system into
mutual funds, including the Company's Scout Funds, which increased by
approximately $200 million during 1995. The primary reason for the increase in
average interest-bearing deposits in 1994 over 1993 was the inclusion of the
Acquired Banks.
 
  Noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $1.6 billion at December 31, 1995
and 1994, compared to $1.5 billion at year-end 1993. Average noninterest-
bearing liabilities for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion
and $1.3 billion, respectively. On average, noninterest-bearing deposits
comprised 29.2% of total deposits for 1995, compared to 28.8% during 1994.
 
  Repurchase agreements averaged $485.9 million in 1995, compared to $498.4
million in 1994. Repurchase agreements are transactions involving investment
funds that are exchanged for securities under an agreement to repurchase the
same or similar issues at an agreed-upon price and date. The Investment
Banking Division buys and sells repurchase agreements as a principal for
nonaffiliated banks. These agreements are reflected on the balance sheet as
both an asset ("resell agreement") and a corresponding liability ("repurchase
agreement"), since such funds are purchased and then sold to approved dealer
banks and primary dealers. The amount of repurchase agreements handled in this
manner averaged $115.0 million in 1995, compared to $232.0 million in 1994. At
December 31, 1995, these totals were $33.9 million, compared to $244.7 million
one year earlier.
 
  At year-end 1995, the Company had repurchase agreements of $639.1 million
for its own funding needs, compared to $416.5 million at December 31, 1994.
 
  The Company's other short-term borrowings consist primarily of U.S. Treasury
demand notes. These demand notes represent treasury tax deposits remitted to
the Federal Reserve Bank other than daily. The rate paid on these funds is
0.25% below the weekly average federal funds rate.
 
                                     A-37

  The Company's long-term borrowings consist of three senior note issues and
some installment notes. The Company's ratio of long-term debt to total
capital, a measure of debt capacity, was 6.54% at December 31, 1995, which
compares very favorably with its peer group. The Company borrowed $25.0
million in 1993 under a medium-term note program to fund the cash portions of
the Kansas bank acquisitions. Of the total, $10.0 million of notes were issued
with a seven-year maturity at 6.81% and $15.0 million of notes were issued
with a 10-year maturity at 7.30%.

CAPITAL
 
  The Company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong
capital which helps safeguard our customers' funds, promotes investor
confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms, and
enhances the ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition
opportunities. Capital is managed for each subsidiary based upon their
respective risks and growth opportunities, as well as regulatory requirements.
 
  At December 31, 1995, shareholders' equity was $576.0 million, compared to
$557.3 million one year earlier. Contributing to this increase was a net
unrealized gain on securities available for sale of $3.6 million, compared to
a net unrealized loss on these securities of $35.2 million at year-end 1994.
In addition, shareholders' equity at December 31, 1995 includes an adjustment
to give effect to the January 2, 1996 purchase of 1,068,533 shares of the
Company's common stock by the Company and its Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
See Common Stock Repurchase Commitment on page A-18 for further details. Also
impacting total shareholders' equity for 1995 was the repurchase of 312,517
shares of Company stock for treasury purposes. This compares to repurchases of
396,984 shares in 1994. During the year, management had the opportunity to
repurchase shares of the Company's stock at a price which, in management's
opinion, would enhance overall shareholder value. Depending on availability,
price and cash flow requirements, management will continue to consider
treasury stock purchases from time to time.
 
  In April, 1994, in order to reduce regulatory expenses, shareholders
approved a reduction in the par value of the Company's common stock from
$12.50 per share to $1.00 per share.
 
  Risk-based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies set minimum
capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial
institution's assets. A financial institution's total capital is required to
equal 8% of risk-weighted assets. At least half of that 8% must consist of
Tier 1 core capital, and the remainder may be Tier 2 supplementary capital.
The risk-based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by
type of asset. Certain off-balance sheet items (such as standby letters of
credit and binding loan commitments) are multiplied by "credit conversion
factors" to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning
them specific risk weightings. Due to the Company's high level of core capital
and substantial portion of earning assets invested in riskless government
securities, the Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.17% and Total capital ratio of
16.16% substantially exceed the regulatory minimums.
 
DIVIDENDS
 
  The Company's dividend payout ratio was 29.0% in 1995, compared to 30.5% in
1994 and 31.0% in 1993. On January 2, 1996, the Company distributed a 10%
stock dividend to shareholders. All per share data has been restated to give
effect to this stock dividend for all periods presented.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
 
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
 
  Due to the nature of the Company's business, some degree of interest rate
risk is inherent and appropriate. Management's objective in this area is to
limit the level of earnings exposure arising from interest rate movements.
This analysis is related to liquidity due to the impact of maturing assets and
liabilities. Many of the Company's financial instruments reprice prior to
maturity.
 
  Interest rate sensitivity is measured by "gaps," which is the difference
between interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which reprice
or mature within a specific time interval. A positive gap indicates that
interest earning assets exceed interest-bearing liabilities within a given
interval. A positive gap position results in increased net interest income
when rates increase and the opposite when rates decline.
 
  Management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the
repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within
specific time intervals. Table 15 is a static gap analysis which presents the
Company's assets and liabilities based on their repricing or maturity
characteristics. This analysis shows that for the 180-day interval beginning
January 1, 1996, the Company is in a positive gap position because assets
maturing or repricing during this time exceed liabilities. This compares to a
negative cumulative gap at this interval one year earlier. At the one-year
period the Company has a positive cumulative gap as the ratio of earning
assets to paying liabilities is 1.20%, compared to 1.12% at December 31, 1994.
 
  In management's opinion the static gap report tends to overstate the
interest rate risk of the Company due to certain factors which are not
measured on a static or snapshot analysis. A static gap analysis assumes that
all liabilities reprice based on their contractual term. However, the effect
of rate increases on core retail deposits, approximately 95.2% of total
deposits, tends to lag the change in market rates. This lag generally lessens
the negative impact of rising interest rates when the Company has more
liabilities repricing than assets. In addition, a static analysis ignores the
impact of changes in the mix and volume of interest-bearing assets and
liabilities. During 1995, the Company's loans increased as a percentage of
total earning assets and noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts
represented a larger component of total funding sources.
 
  The Company will continue to manage its interest rate risk using static gap
analysis along with other tools which help measure the impact of various
interest rate scenarios. The Company does not use off-balance-sheet hedges or
swaps to manage this risk.
 
TABLE 13: RATE SENSITIVITY AND MATURITY OF LOANS
 
  The following table presents the rate sensitivity of certain loans maturing
after 1996, compared with the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 1995. Of
the $1,396,342,000 of loans due after 1996, $825,036,000 are to individuals
for the purchase of residential dwellings and other consumer goods. The
remaining $571,306,000 is for all other purposes and reflects maturities of
$492,527,000 in 1997 through 2000 and $78,779,000 after 2000.

LIQUIDITY
 
  Liquidity represents the Company's ability to meet financial commitments
through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional
funds. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is regularly scheduled
maturities of assets along with $2.3 billion of high-quality securities
available for sale. The liquidity of the Company and its affiliate banks is
also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core
deposits.
 
  The parent company's cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to
shareholders, debt service and treasury stock purchases. Management fees and
dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been sufficient to
satisfy these requirements and are expected to be in the future. On January 2,
1996, the Company acquired 688,533 shares of its common stock at a price of
$43.50 per share. The purchase was funded with existing working capital. Also
on January 2, 1996, the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan acquired
380,000 shares of the Company's common stock. This purchase was funded by a
seven-year, fixed rate loan, which is guaranteed by the Company. The Company
also has agreed to acquire an additional 256,300 shares in both March and June
of 1996 at a price of $43.50 per share. The Company intends to fund these
purchases with working capital.

(1) Interest income and yields are stated on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE)
    basis, using a rate of 34% for 1991 through 1992 and 35% for 1993 through
    1995. The tax-equivalent interest income and yields give effect to the
    disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes, related
    to certain tax-free assets. Rates earned/paid may not compute to the rates
    shown due to presentation in millions.
(2) Loan fees and income from loans on nonaccrual status are included in loan
    income.
