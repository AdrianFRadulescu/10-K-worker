DEFINITION OF TERMS
See the inside back cover page of the annual report to stockholders.  Terms 
defined there are used herein.



                                          Part I

Item 1. Business

General-See inside front cover and pages 8 and 9 of the 1994 annual report to 
stockholders for information about Union Carbide's business. 

On April 27, 1994, stockholders voted to approve the merger of Union Carbide 
Corporation (UCC) into Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Company Inc. 
(UCC&P). The merger was effective May 1, 1994. Immediately after the merger, 
UCC&P had the same consolidated assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity 
as UCC. UCC&P has changed its name to Union Carbide Corporation. All 
references to Union Carbide Corporation, the corporation or UCC after the 
periods starting May 1, 1994, are a reference to the merged company.

Union Carbide is engaged in the chemicals and plastics business. The chemicals 
and plastics industry, especially the commodity sector, is highly cyclical. 
Union Carbide is a major producer of certain commodity chemicals, principally 
ethylene glycol and polyethylene. Consequently, Union Carbide's results are 
subject to the swings of the cycle in those basic chemicals. See pages 4 
through 7 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders for a further discussion.

Union Carbide does not produce against a backlog of firm orders; production is 
geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and to projections of future 
demand. Inventories of finished products, work in process and raw materials 
are maintained to meet delivery requirements of customers and Union Carbide's 
production schedules.

At year-end 1994, 12,004 people were employed worldwide in approximately 40 
plants, factories and laboratories around the world.

Raw Materials, Products and Markets-See information herein and in the 1994 
annual report to stockholders on pages 8 and 9. Unless otherwise indicated, 
the products of Union Carbide are sold principally by its own sales force, 
directly to customers.

Union Carbide believes it has contracts or commitments for, or readily 
available sources of, hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuel supplies to meet its 
anticipated needs in all major product areas. The corporation's operations are 
dependent upon the availability of hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuels which are 
purchased from diverse domestic and international sources, including 
independent oil and gas producers as well as integrated oil companies.

The availability and price of hydrocarbon feedstocks, energy and finished 
products are subject to plant interruptions and outages and to market and 
political conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere. Operations and products at 
times may be adversely affected by legislation, government regulations, 
shortages, or international or domestic events.

Union Carbide is not dependent to a significant extent upon a single customer 
or a few customers.

Patents; Trademarks; Research and Development-Union Carbide owns a large 
number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide variety of 
products and processes, has pending a substantial number of patent 
applications throughout the world, and is licensed under a number of patents. 
These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. Such patents and 
patent applications in the aggregate are material to Union Carbide's 
competitive position. No one patent is considered to be material; however, the 
patent portfolio relating to the UNIPOL polyethylene process technology is, in 
the aggregate, considered to be material. Union Carbide also has a large 
number of trademarks. The UNION CARBIDE, UCAR and UNIPOL trademarks are 
material; no other single trademark is material.

Essentially all of Union Carbide's research and development activities are 
company-sponsored. The principal research and development facilities of Union 
Carbide are indicated in the discussion of Properties (Item 2) of this Form 
10-K report. In addition to the facilities specifically indicated there, 
product development and process technology laboratories are maintained at some 
plants. Union Carbide spent $136 million in 1994, $139 million in 1993 and 
$155 million in 1992 on company-sponsored research activities to develop new 
products, processes, or services, or to improve existing ones.

Environment-See Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment on pages 14 
and 15 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders and Note 16 on pages 35 and 
36 thereof.

Insurance-Union Carbide's policy is to obtain public liability insurance 
coverage at terms and conditions and a price that management considers fair 
and reasonable. Union Carbide's management believes Union Carbide has public 
liability insurance in an amount sufficient to meet its current needs in light 
of pending, threatened, and future litigation and claims. There is no 
assurance, however, that Union Carbide will not incur losses beyond the 
limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance. Such insurance is subject 
to substantial deductibles.

Competition-Each of the major products and services areas in which Union 
Carbide participates is highly competitive. In some instances competition 
comes from manufacturers of the same products as those produced by Union 
Carbide and in other cases from manufacturers of different products which may 
serve the same markets as those served by Union Carbide's products. Some of 
Union Carbide's competitors, such as companies principally engaged in 
petroleum operations, have more direct access to hydrocarbon feedstocks, and 
some have greater financial resources than Union Carbide.

There are a number of competitors in each of the products and services areas 
in which Union Carbide is active. In some of the individual areas in which 
Union Carbide participates there are many competitors; in others there are 
few. Competition is primarily on price, on product performance and on service 
to customers.

- -  Many producers have important industry positions in polyethylene, and Union 
   Carbide is one of the world's largest producers. Other significant 
   producers are Dow Chemical Company, Chevron Corporation, Exxon Corporation, 
   Mobil Corporation, Novacor Chemicals Ltd, Quantum Chemicals Corporation, 
   Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Phillips Petroleum Company, Saudi Basic 
   Industries Corporation and The British Petroleum Company p.l.c.

- -  Union Carbide is the world's largest producer of ethylene oxide/glycol and 
   derivatives. Other significant producers include Shell Oil Company, Dow 
   Chemical Company, BASF Aktiengesellschaft, The British Petroleum Company 
   p.l.c., Huntsman Corporation, ICI p.l.c., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, 
   Hoechst Celanese Corporation, and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation.

- -  In solvents and intermediates and emulsion systems, Union Carbide has a 
   significant position in many product areas. Other significant producers 
   include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Hoechst Celanese Corporation, 
   Rohm & Haas Company, Eastman Chemical Company, Shell Oil Company, Exxon 
   Corporation, BASF Aktiengesellschaft and Quantum Chemicals Corporation.

- -  Union Carbide participates in a wide range of specialty chemical 
   product/market areas. The competitive position varies widely from one 
   product/market area to another. Competitors include a number of domestic 
   and foreign companies, both diversified and specialized.

Union Carbide is a major marketer of petrochemical products throughout the 
world. Products that the corporation markets are largely produced in the 
United States, while competitive products are produced throughout the world. 
In addition, the corporation plans to make significant investments in joint 
ventures in 1995. See pages 4 through 7 of the 1994 annual report to 
stockholders for a further discussion.

Union Carbide's international operations face competition from local producers 
and global competitors and a number of other risks inherent in carrying on 
business outside the United States, including risks of nationalization, 
expropriation, restrictive action by local governments and changes in currency 
exchange rates.


Item 2. Properties

In management's opinion, current facilities, together with planned expansions, 
will provide adequate production capacity to meet Union Carbide's planned 
business activities. Capital expenditures are discussed on pages 17 and 19 of 
the 1994 annual report to stockholders.

Listed below are the principal manufacturing facilities operated by Union 
Carbide worldwide. Research and engineering facilities are noted. Most of the 
domestic properties are owned in fee. Union Carbide maintains numerous 
domestic sales offices and warehouses, substantially all of which are leased 
premises under relatively short-term leases. All principal international 
operations manufacturing properties are owned or held under long-term leases. 
International operations administrative offices, technical service 
laboratories, sales offices and warehouses are owned in some instances and 
held under relatively short-term leases in other instances. The corporation's 
headquarters are located in Danbury, Connecticut, and are leased.

Principal domestic operations manufacturing facilities and the principal 
products manufactured there are as follows:

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

See Note 16 of Notes to Financial Statements on pages 35 and 36 of the 1994 
annual report to stockholders.

On September 28, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
announced the service of an administrative complaint on Rhone-Poulenc Ag 
Company (R-P) alleging violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act with respect to operation of the hazardous waste boiler at Institute, West 
Virginia. The complaint seeks to assess a civil penalty of $915,125 against R-
P. If the complaint is sustained, under an agreement between R-P and the 
corporation, the corporation may be required to indemnify R-P for a portion of 
any penalty ultimately paid by R-P.

On February 23, 1994, the EPA issued a complaint and compliance order to the 
corporation alleging violations of Federal Hazardous Waste Regulations at the 
South Charleston, West Virginia, plant. The complaint seeks a civil penalty of 
$320,300. The corporation is contesting the alleged violations and proposed 
penalty.

On March 31, 1994, the EPA issued an administrative Complaint, Compliance 
Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing to the corporation alleging 
violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and the 
Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act at the corporation's Texas City, Texas, plant. 
EPA proposes to assess a civil penalty of $139,000. The corporation has 
requested a hearing and is contesting the alleged violations and proposed 
penalty.

On February 14, 1995, the EPA issued a complaint to the corporation alleging 
violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act with a 
proposed civil penalty of $400,000. This matter concerns a discontinued 
medical instrument sterilant. The corporation voluntarily requested 
cancellation of its pesticide registration.

As reported in the corporation's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 
1993, the EPA issued an administrative complaint to the corporation on 
November 19, 1993, alleging violations of the Federal Clean Air Act at the 
Texas City, Texas, plant. The complaint sought a civil penalty of $194,550. On 
October 13, 1994, the corporation and EPA reached a settlement of this matter 
pursuant to which the corporation agreed to pay a penalty of $57,500.

Report of Independent Auditors


The Board of Directors
Union Carbide Corporation

Under date of January 19, 1995, we reported on the consolidated balance 
sheets of Union Carbide Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 1994, as contained on pages 20 through 36 
in the 1994 annual report to stockholders. These consolidated financial 
statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year 1994. In connection with our 
audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also 
have audited the related financial statement schedule as listed in Item 
14(a)3. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the 
company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this 
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in 
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, 
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth 
therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 
the company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits 
and in 1992 its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other 
than pensions and income taxes.

time, or any rights issued to holders of Common Stock in addition thereto or 
in replacement therefor.

      "Special Redemption Price" means, in connection with a redemption 
pursuant to Subsection 7.01, a redemption price equal to the higher of (a) the


Liquidation Price per share of ESOP Preferred Stock on the date fixed for 
redemption and (b) the Fair Market Value (as defined in Subsection 9.01) of 
the number of shares of Common Stock into which each ESOP Share is convertible 
at the time the notice of such redemption is given, plus in either case an 
amount equal to accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends 
thereon to the date fixed for redemption.

      "Transfer" means any sale, transfer or other disposition of ESOP Shares 
other than to the Corporation.

      "Trustee" means a trustee or trustees acting on behalf of the trust 
established in connection with the Plan.

      1.02  Designation.  Of the 25,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred 
Stock, par value $1.00 each, 16,668,893 shares shall be designated ESOP 
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK.  The Board may from time to time, by resolution, 
fix such number of shares to an increased or decreased number.  However, no 
such decrease shall reduce the number of ESOP Shares to a number less than 
that number of ESOP Shares then outstanding.  If the Corporation redeems or 
purchases any ESOP Shares, such ESOP Shares (a) shall remain issued and 
outstanding for all purposes (except that as long as such shares are held by 
the Corporation, no dividends shall be paid on such shares and they shall 
neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes) and (b) may 
thereafter be transferred by the Corporation from time to time to the Trustee, 
and upon such transfer the voting and dividend rights of such shares shall be 
restored.  However, the Corporation may, at the time of or at any time after 
such redemption or purchase, retire any such shares then held by the 
Corporation, and such shares shall then be restored to the status of 
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation.
 
      1.03  Issuance.  ESOP Shares shall be issued only to the Trustee.  In 
the event of any Transfer to any person (including, without limitation, any 
participant in the Plan) other than (a) any Trustee or (b) any pledgee (other 
than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) of such ESOP Shares 
acquiring such ESOP Shares as security for any loan or loans made to the Plan 
or to any Trustee, the ESOP Shares so Transferred shall, upon such Transfer 
and without any further action by the Corporation or the Holder, be 
automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price 
and on the terms otherwise provided for conversions pursuant to Section 5.  No 
such transferee shall have any of the voting powers, preferences and relative, 
participating, optional or special rights ascribed to the ESOP Shares 
hereunder, but, shall have only the powers and rights pertaining to the Common 
Stock into which such ESOP Shares shall be so converted.  However, in the 
event of a foreclosure or other realization upon the ESOP Shares pledged as 
security for any loan or loans made to the Plan or to the Trustee (other than 
by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation), the pledged ESOP 
Shares so foreclosed or otherwise realized upon shall be converted 
automatically into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price and on the 
terms otherwise provided for conversions pursuant to Section 5.  In the event 
of such a conversion, the transferee shall be treated for all purposes as the 
record holder of the shares of Common Stock into which the ESOP Shares shall 
have been converted as of the date of such conversion.  Certificates 
representing ESOP Shares shall be legended to reflect the restrictions on 
transfer set forth above.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this 
Subsection 1.03, ESOP Shares (x) may be converted into shares of Common Stock 
as provided by Section 5 and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such 
conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and 
(y) shall be redeemable by the Corporation upon the terms and conditions 
provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8.




Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

      2.01  Dividends.  The Holder shall, subject to the provisions for 
adjustment hereinafter set forth, be entitled to receive Preferred Dividends 
payable in an amount initially equal to $0.794 per share per year, and no 
more, on a quarterly basis, on the last business day of each calendar quarter 
(or such later date not more than five business days thereafter as the Board 
may from time to time elect in its absolute discretion), beginning on the 
second Quarterly Payment Date occurring in 1994.  However, the Board may in 
its absolute discretion elect to cause Preferred Dividends to become payable 
on an annual or semi-annual basis if such election is made effective during 
the period beginning on January 5 and ending on March 30 in each year.  The 
Corporation shall give prompt notice to the Holder of (a) any election to 
cause Preferred Dividends to become payable on an annual or semi-annual basis 
and (b) the Dividend Payment Date from time to time determined by the Board.  
Preferred Dividends shall be made to the Holder at the opening of business on 
each applicable Dividend Payment Date.

      2.02  Cumulation.  Dividends in respect of ESOP Shares shall begin to 
accrue from April 1, 1994, except that with respect to any ESOP Shares 
redeemed or purchased by the Corporation and then reissued, dividends shall 
accrue on such shares from their date of reissuance.  Dividends shall accrue 
on a daily basis, whether or not the Corporation shall then have earnings or 
surplus (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months in case of 
any period less than one year), based on the Preferred Dividend Rate then in 
effect.  However, if the Board elects to cause Preferred Dividends to be 
payable on an annual or semi-annual basis, payments in respect of dividends on 
ESOP Preferred Stock made after the effective date of such election shall be 
computed using the Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on the Dividend Payment 
Date as determined by the Board.  Accrued but unpaid Preferred Dividends shall 
cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable.  
No interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends.

      2.03  Distributions.  So long as any ESOP Preferred Stock shall be 
outstanding, no dividend shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on 
any Parity Stock unless there shall also be or have been declared and paid or 
set apart for payment on the ESOP Preferred Stock, like dividends for all 
dividend payment periods of the ESOP Preferred Stock ending on or before the 
dividend payment date of the Parity Stock, ratably in proportion to the 
respective amounts of dividends (a) accumulated and unpaid or payable on the 
Parity Stock, and (b) accumulated and unpaid through the dividend payment 
period or periods of the ESOP Preferred Stock next preceding such dividend 
payment date.  The Corporation shall not declare or pay or set apart for 
payment any dividends or make any other distributions on, or make any payment 
on account of the purchase, redemption or other retirement of any Junior Stock 
until full cumulative dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock shall have been 
declared and paid or set apart for payment when due.  However, the foregoing 
sentence shall not apply to (x) any dividend or distribution payable solely in 
any shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase 
shares of, any Junior Stock or (y) the acquisition of shares of any Junior 
Stock in exchange solely for or by conversion solely into shares of any other 
Junior Stock or (z) any payment on account of the redemption of the Rights.  
Any Preferred Dividend shall first be credited against the earliest 
accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to ESOP Preferred Stock.




Section 3.  Liquidation Preference.

      3.01  Liquidation Price.  In the event of any dissolution or liquidation 
of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or 
distribution of the assets of the Corporation (whether capital or surplus) 
shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any series or class or 
classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to ESOP Preferred Stock 
upon dissolution or liquidation, the Holder shall be entitled to receive the 
Liquidation Price per share in effect at the time of dissolution or 
liquidation plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued (whether or not 
accumulated) and unpaid to the date of final distribution to such Holder, and 
such Holder shall not be entitled to receive any further payments.  If, upon 
any dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, the assets of the 
Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable to the Holder shall be 
insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating 
payments on any other series ranking, as to dissolution or liquidation, on a 
parity with ESOP Preferred Stock, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, 
shall be distributed to the Holder and any other such shares ratably in 
accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on the ESOP 
Preferred Stock and any other such shares if all amounts payable thereon were 
paid in full.  For the purposes of this Section 3, neither (a) the 
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more 
corporations, (b) the sale, transfer, lease or exchange (for cash, shares of 
equity stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all 
of the assets of the Corporation, nor (c) the distribution to the shareholders 
of the Corporation of all or substantially all of the consideration for such 
sale shall be deemed to be a dissolution or liquidation (voluntarily or 
involuntarily), unless such consideration (apart from assumption of 
liabilities) or the net proceeds thereof consists substantially entirely of 
cash.  After payment shall have been made in full to the Holder as provided in 
this Subsection 3.01 the Holder shall not be entitled to share in the 
remaining assets of the Corporation.


Section 4.  Ranking and Voting of Shares.

      4.01  Ranking.  Unless otherwise provided in this Certificate of 
Incorporation, as the same may be amended, relating to any subsequent series 
of Preferred Stock, the ESOP Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with all 
series of Preferred Stock as to dividends and as to the distribution of assets 
upon dissolution or liquidation.

      4.02  Voting Rights.  The Holder shall have the following voting rights:

               (i)   The Holder shall be entitled to vote on all matters 
      submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation, voting 
      together with the holders of Common Stock as one class.  The 
      Holder shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number 
      of shares of Common Stock into which the ESOP Shares could be 
      converted on the record date for determining the shareholders 
      entitled to vote.  Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as 
      provided in Section 9, the number of votes of the ESOP Shares 
      shall also be correspondingly adjusted.

              (ii)   Except as otherwise required by law or set forth 
      herein, the Holder shall have no special voting rights and the 
      consent of the Holder shall not be required (except to the extent 
      the Holder is entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set 
      forth herein) for the taking of any corporate action, including 


      the issuance of any Preferred Stock now or hereafter authorized; 
      provided, however, that the vote of at least a majority of the 
      outstanding ESOP Shares, voting separately as a series, shall be 
      necessary to authorize the amendment of the Certificate of 
      Incorporation if the proposed amendment relates to any of the 
      matters enumerated in Section 804 of the BCL.


Section 5.  Conversion into Common Stock.

      5.01  Conversion Price.  The Holder shall be entitled to cause any or 
all of the ESOP Shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock at any time 
prior to the close of business on the date fixed for redemption of such shares 
pursuant to Sections 6, 7 or 8.  The number of shares of Common Stock into 
which each ESOP Share may be converted shall be determined by dividing the 
Liquidation Price in effect at the time of conversion by the Conversion Price 
in effect at the time of conversion.  The initial conversion rate is 
equivalent to one share of Common Stock for each ESOP Share, and is subject to 
adjustment as hereinafter provided.

      5.02  Surrender of Certificates.  The Holder shall convert ESOP Shares 
into shares of Common Stock by surrender, if certificated, of the certificate 
or certificates representing the ESOP Shares being converted, duly assigned or 
endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed 
stock powers relating thereto), or if uncertificated, a duly executed stock 
power relating thereto.  Such conversion shall be effected at the principal 
executive office of the Corporation.  The certificate or certificates shall be 
accompanied by a notice of conversion which shall specify (a) the number of 
ESOP Shares to be converted, (b) the name or names in which the Common Stock 
and any ESOP Shares not to be so converted are to be issued, and (c) the 
address to which delivery is to be made of a confirmation of such conversion, 
if uncertificated, or any new certificates which may be issued upon such 
conversion, if certificated.

      5.03  Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion.  The Corporation shall, 
upon receipt of a certificate representing the ESOP Shares for conversion, or 
if uncertificated, of a duly executed stock power relating thereto, issue and 
send by hand delivery (with receipt to be acknowledged) or by first class 
mail, to the Holder, at the address designated by the Holder, a certificate or 
certificates for, or if uncertificated, confirmation of, the number of shares 
of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled upon conversion.  If 
only part of the ESOP Shares surrendered are to be converted, the Corporation 
shall issue and deliver to the Holder a new certificate or certificates 
representing the number of ESOP Shares that shall not have been converted, or 
if uncertificated, confirmation of the number of ESOP Shares that shall not 
have been converted.

      5.04  Effective Date of Issuance of Common Stock.  The issuance of 
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of ESOP Shares shall be effective as of 
the earlier of (a) the delivery to the Holder of the certificates representing 
the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof, if certificated, or 
confirmation, if uncertificated, and (b) the commencement of business on the 
second business day after the surrender of the certificate or certificates, if 
certificated, or a duly executed stock power, if uncertificated, for the ESOP 
Shares to be converted.  The person or persons entitled to receive Common 
Stock issuable upon such conversion shall, on and after the effective date of 
conversion, be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of 
such shares of Common Stock, and no allowance or adjustment shall be made in 
respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record on any date


prior to such effective date.  The Corporation shall not be obligated to pay 
to the Holder any dividend that may have accrued or that may have been 
declared if the Dividend Payment Date for such dividend is on or subsequent to 
the effective date of conversion.

      5.05  No Fractional Shares.  The Corporation shall not be obligated to 
deliver any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon any conversion of 
ESOP Shares, but in lieu thereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in 
any manner permitted by law.

      5.06  Common Stock Reserved.  The Corporation shall at all times reserve 
and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or treasury 
Common Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of ESOP Shares as herein 
provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be 
issuable upon the conversion of all of the ESOP Shares then outstanding.

      5.07  Issuance of Rights.  Whenever the Corporation shall issue shares 
of Common Stock upon conversion of ESOP Shares as contemplated by this Section 
5, the Corporation shall issue together with each such share of Common Stock 
one Right, whether or not the Rights shall be exercisable at such time, but 
only if the Rights are issued and outstanding and held by other holders of 
Common Stock at such time and have not expired.


Section 6.  Redemption at the Option of the Corporation.

      6.01  Redemption After December 31, 1998.  At the option of the 
Corporation, ESOP Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at 
any time after December 3l, 1998, out of funds legally available therefor, at 
a redemption price per share equal to the following percentages of the 
Liquidation Price in effect on the date fixed for redemption:

               During the Twelve-
               Month Period                  Percentage of
               Beginning January 1,          Liquidation Price

                     1999                        101.7750
                     2000                        100.8875

and thereafter at l00%, plus, in each case, an amount equal to all accrued 
(whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed 
for redemption. 

      6.02  Notice of Redemption.  The Corporation shall deliver a notice of 
redemption to the Holder, by first class mail, mailed not less than 20 days 
nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date.  Each notice shall state: 
(a) the redemption date; (b) the total number of ESOP Shares to be redeemed; 
(c) the redemption price; (d) that the shares are to be surrendered at the 
principal office of the Corporation for payment of the redemption price; (e) 
that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such 
redemption date; (f) whether such redemption price will be paid in cash or in 
shares of Common Stock; and (g) the conversion rights of the shares to be 
redeemed, the period within which conversion rights may be exercised, and the 
Conversion Price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion 
of an ESOP Share at such time.

      6.03  Redemption if Change in Tax Law or Plan Does Not Qualify.  In the 
event that:



               (i)   there shall be a change in the federal tax law or 
      regulations of the United States of America or of an 
      interpretation or application of such law or regulations or of a 
      determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that in any 
      case has the effect of precluding the Corporation from claiming 
      (other than for purposes of calculating any alternative minimum 
      tax) any of the tax deductions for dividends paid on the ESOP 
      Preferred Stock when such dividends are used as provided under 
      Section 404(k)(2) of the Code, as in effect on the date the ESOP 
      Preferred Stock is initially issued, or

              (ii)   the Corporation shall certify to the Holder that the 
      Corporation has determined in good faith that the Plan either is 
      not qualified as a "stock bonus plan" within the meaning of 
      Section 401(a) of the Code or is not an "employee stock ownership 
      plan" within the meaning of 4975(e)(7) of the Code,

then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Subsection 6.01, the 
Corporation may, in its sole discretion, at any time within one year after 
either of the foregoing events, elect either to:

           (a)   redeem, out of funds legally available therefor, any or all 
      of the ESOP Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the 
      Liquidation Price per share on the date fixed for redemption, plus an 
      amount equal to accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid 
      dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption, or

           (b)   exchange for any or all of such ESOP Shares, securities of at 
      least equal value (as determined by an independent appraiser) that 
      constitute "qualifying employer securities" with respect to the Holder 
      within the meaning of Section 409(1) of the Code and Section 407(d)(5) 
      of ERISA, or any successor provisions of law.

If the Corporation elects to redeem any or all of the ESOP Preferred Stock 
pursuant to clause (a) above, a notice of redemption shall be given as 
required in Subsection 6.02.  If the Corporation elects to exchange securities 
for ESOP Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (b) above, it shall cause notice 
of such election to be sent to the Holder by first class mail, mailed not less 
than 20 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date of exchange.  Each notice 
of election shall state: (i) the exchange date; (ii) the total number of ESOP 
Shares to be exchanged; (iii) the exchange rate; (iv) that the shares are to 
be surrendered for exchange at the principal office of the Corporation; and 
(v) that dividends on the shares to be exchanged will cease to accrue on such 
exchange date.

      6.04  Redemption upon Termination of Plan.  The Corporation may, in its 
sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Subsection 
6.01, call for redemption any or all of the then outstanding ESOP Preferred 
Stock in the event that the Plan is, or contributions thereto are, terminated.  
Any such redemption shall be effected upon notice as required in Subsection 
6.02.  The redemption shall be made out of funds legally available therefor at 
a redemption price per share equal to the following percentages of the 
Liquidation Price in effect on the date fixed for redemption:



               During the Twelve-
               Month Period                Percentage of
               Beginning January 1,        Liquidation Price

                     1994                      106.2125
                     1995                      105.3250
                     1996                      104.4375
                     1997                      103.5500
                     1998                      102.6625
                     1999                      101.7750
                     2000                      100.8875

and thereafter at l00%, plus, in each case, an amount equal to all accrued 
(whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed 
for redemption.

      6.05  Payment of Redemption Price.  The Corporation, at its option, may 
make payment of the redemption price required upon redemption of ESOP Shares 
pursuant to this Section 6 in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a 
combination of such shares and cash.  Any shares of Common Stock shall be 
valued for such purpose at their Fair Market Value (as defined in Subsection 
9.01); provided, however, that in calculating their Fair Market Value, the 
Adjustment Period (as defined in Subsection 9.01) shall be deemed to be the 
five consecutive trading days preceding the date of redemption.

      6.06  Effect of Redemption.  Upon surrender of the certificates, if 
certificated, for any shares called for redemption, or upon the date fixed for 
redemption, if uncertificated, the Corporation shall, unless such shares have 
previously been converted, redeem such shares as of the close of business on 
the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price set forth in 
Subsection 6.01, 6.03 or 6.04 as the case may be.  From and after the date 
fixed for redemption, dividends on ESOP Shares called for redemption will 
cease to accrue and all rights of the Holder in respect of such shares shall 
cease, except the right to receive the redemption price.  Upon payment of the 
redemption price, such shares shall be deemed to have been transferred to the 
Corporation, to be held as provided in Subsection 1.02.


Section 7.  Redemption at the Option of the Holder.

      7.01  Redemption to Provide for Plan Distributions.  The Corporation 
shall, unless otherwise provided by law, redeem ESOP Shares at the option of 
the Holder when and to the extent necessary for the Holder to provide for 
distributions required to be made under, or to satisfy an investment election 
provided to participants in accordance with, the Plan or any successor plan or 
in connection with a Dividend Redemption.  The Holder may exercise such 
option, at any time and from time to time, by delivering notice to the 
Corporation not less than five business days prior to the date fixed for 
redemption by the Holder in such notice.  The redemption shall be made at a 
redemption price equal to the Special Redemption Price, in shares of Common 
Stock legally available therefor or, at the election of the Corporation, may 
be made out of funds legally available therefor in cash or a combination of 
Common Stock and cash.  Shares of Common Stock shall be valued for purposes of 
redemption pursuant to this Subsection 7.01 as provided by Subsection 6.05.  
In the case of any Dividend Redemption, the Holder shall give the notice 
specified above on the tenth business day after the related Dividend Payment 
Date and such redemption shall be effective as to such number of ESOP Shares 
as shall equal (a) the aggregate amount of such Preferred Dividends paid with 
respect to ESOP Shares allocated or credited to the accounts of participants


in the Plan or any successor plan that are used to repay any loan associated 
with such allocated or credited shares divided by (b) the Special Redemption 
Price specified above in this Subsection 7.01.

      7.02  Redemption to Satisfy Plan Obligations or if Plan Does Not Qualify 
Under Certain Circumstances.  The Corporation shall, unless otherwise provided 
by law, redeem ESOP Shares upon certification by the Holder to the Corporation 
of the following events:

              (i)   when and to the extent necessary for the Holder to make 
      any payments of principal, interest or premium due and payable 
      (whether voluntary, scheduled, upon acceleration or otherwise) 
      upon any obligations of the trust established under the Plan in 
      connection with the acquisition of ESOP Preferred Stock or any 
      indebtedness, expenses or costs incurred by the Holder for the 
      benefit of the Plan, or

             (ii)   when and if it shall be established to the satisfaction 
      of the Holder that the Plan has not initially been determined by 
      the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified as a "stock bonus 
      plan" and an "employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of 
      Section 401(a) or 4975(e) (7) of the Code, respectively.

The Holder may exercise such option at any time and from time to time upon 
notice to the Corporation given not less than five business days prior to the 
date fixed for redemption by the Holder in such notice.  A redemption pursuant 
to Subsection 7.02 shall be made in shares of Common Stock legally available 
therefor, at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Price plus an amount 
equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for 
redemption.  At the election of the Corporation, such redemption may instead 
be made out of funds legally available therefor in cash or a combination of 
Common Stock and cash.  Any shares of Common Stock shall be valued for the 
purposes of redemption pursuant to this Subsection 7.02 as provided by 
Subsection 6.05.


Section 8.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.

      8.01  Exchange for Qualifying Employer Securities.  If the Corporation 
shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however 
named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by 
operation of law exchanged solely for, or changed, reclassified or converted 
solely into, securities of any successor or resulting company (including the 
Corporation) that constitute "qualifying employer securities" with respect to 
the Holder within the meanings of Section 409(l) of the Code and Section 
407(d) (5) of ERISA, or any successor provision of law, and, if applicable, 
for a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, then, in such event,

             (i)   the terms of such consolidation or merger or similar 
      transaction shall provide that the ESOP Shares shall be converted 
      into or exchanged for and shall become preferred securities of 
      such successor or resulting company, having in respect of such 
      company insofar as possible (taking into account, without 
      limitation, any requirements relating to the listing of such 
      preferred securities on any national securities exchange or the 
      qualification of such preferred securities for trading in any 
      over-the-counter market) the same powers, preferences and 
      relative, participating, optional or other special rights 
      (including the redemption rights provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8), 


      and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that 
      the ESOP Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such 
      transaction,

            (ii)   after such transaction each security into which the ESOP 
       Shares are so converted or for which they are exchanged shall be 
       convertible, pursuant to the terms and conditions provided by 
       Subsection 5.01, into the number and kind of qualifying employer 
       securities receivable by the Holder equivalent to the number of 
       shares of Common Stock into which the ESOP Shares could have been 
       converted pursuant to Subsection 5.01 immediately prior to such 
       transaction,

           (iii)   if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a 
       holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with 
       respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in 
       such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the 
       Holder, then such election shall be deemed to be solely for 
       "qualifying employer securities" (together, if applicable, with a 
       cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) with the effect 
       provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above on the basis of the number 
       and kind of qualifying employer securities receivable by the 
       Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which the ESOP 
       Shares could have been converted pursuant to Subsection 5.01 
       immediately prior to such transaction (it being understood that if 
       the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable in 
       respect of each share of Common Stock upon such transaction is not 
       the same for each such share, then the kind and amount of 
       qualifying employer securities deemed to be receivable in respect 
       of each share of Common Stock for purposes of this clause (iii) 
       shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share of Common 
       Stock by a plurality of such shares), and

           (iv)   the rights of the ESOP Preferred Stock as preferred 
       equity of such successor or resulting company shall successively 
       be subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 after any such 
       transaction as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments 
       provided for by Section 9 prior to such transaction.

      The Corporation shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or 
similar transaction unless all the terms of this Subsection 8.01 are complied 
with.

      8.02.  Exchange for Non-Qualifying Employer Securities.  If the 
Corporation shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar 
transaction, however named, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common 
Stock are by operation of law exchanged for, or changed, reclassified or 
converted into, other shares or securities or cash or any other property, or 
any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is 
constituted solely of qualifying employer securities that are common stock or 
common equity (as referred to in Subsection 8.01) and cash payments, if 
applicable, in lieu of fractional shares or other interests, the outstanding 
ESOP Shares shall, without any action on the part of the Corporation or the 
Holder thereof (but subject to Subsection 8.03), be automatically converted 
immediately prior to the consummation of such merger, consolidation or similar 
transaction into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price then in 
effect.



      8.03.  Redemption Alternative.  If the Corporation shall enter into any 
agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar transaction 
described in Subsection 8.02, then the Corporation shall as soon as 
practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten business days before 
consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the 
material terms thereof to the Holder.  The Holder may elect, by notice of 
redemption to the Corporation, to receive, upon consummation of such 
transaction, in lieu of any cash or other securities which such holder would 
otherwise be entitled to receive under Subsection 8.02, a cash payment equal 
to a redemption price per share determined pursuant to Subsection 6.04, plus 
an amount equal to accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid dividends 
thereon to the date fixed for such transaction.  The cash payment shall be 
paid out of funds legally available therefor, by the Corporation or the 
successor of the Corporation, in redemption of the ESOP Preferred Stock.  No 
such notice of redemption shall be effective unless delivered to the 
Corporation prior to the close of business of the fifth business day prior to 
consummation of such transaction, unless the Corporation or the successor of 
the Corporation shall waive such prior notice.  The Holder may withdraw the 
notice of redemption by delivery of a notice of withdrawal to the Corporation 
at any time prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to 
consummation of such transaction.


Section 9.  Anti-dilution Adjustments.

      9.01  Definitions.  For purposes of this Section 9, the following 
definitions shall apply:

      "Adjustment Period" means the period of five consecutive trading days, 
selected by the Corporation, during the 20 trading days preceding, and 
including, the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be 
determined.

      "Current Market Price" means with respect to publicly traded shares of 
Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security of the 
Corporation or any other issuer, for a day, the last reported sales price, 
regular way, or, in case no sale takes place on such day, the average of the 
reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported 
on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if such security is not 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities 
exchange on which such security is listed, if not listed on any national 
securities exchange, on the National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ") National Market System or, if such 
security is not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the 
closing bid and asked prices on such day in the over-the-counter market as 
reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on such day 
shall not have been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked 
prices for such day as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm 
regularly making a market in such security selected for such purpose by the 
Corporation.

      "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 
from time to time.

      "Extraordinary Distribution" means any dividend or other distribution to 
holders of Common Stock (effected while any of the ESOP Shares are 
outstanding) of (i) any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than 
shares of Common Stock), other securities of the Corporation (other than 
securities of the type referred to in Subsection 9.03), evidences of


indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other property 
(including shares of any subsidiary of the Corporation), or (ii) cash, or any 
combination of the foregoing, where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend 
or other distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and other 
distributions made during the preceding period of twelve months, when combined 
with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases (for this purpose, 
including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro Rata 
Repurchase that is in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
repurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all 
extensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange offer that is a Pro Rata 
Repurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata 
Repurchase that is not a tender offer or exchange offer) made during such 
period, exceeds 12.5% of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of 
Common Stock outstanding on the day before the ex-dividend date with respect 
to such Extraordinary Distribution that is paid in cash and on the 
distribution date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution that is paid 
other than in cash.

      The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary Distribution for purposes of 
Subsection 9.05 shall be the sum of the Fair Market Value of such 
Extraordinary Distribution plus the aggregate amount of any cash dividends or 
other distributions that are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such 
twelve month period and not previously included in the calculation of an 
adjustment pursuant to Subsection 9.05, but shall exclude the aggregate amount 
of regular quarterly dividends declared by the Board and paid by the 
Corporation in such twelve month period. 

      "Fair Market Value" means,

              (i)   as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of 
      capital stock or securities of the Corporation or any other issuer 
      that are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Price 
      of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment 
      Period, and

             (ii)   as to any security that is not publicly traded or of any 
      other property means the fair value thereof as determined by an 
      independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in 
      the valuation of such securities or property selected in good 
      faith by the Corporation, or, if no such investment banking or 
      appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the Corporation 
      available to make such determination, as determined in good faith 
      by the Corporation.

      "Non-Dilutive Amount" means, in respect of an issuance, sale or exchange 
by the Corporation of any right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of 
Common Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for 
shares of Common Stock), the difference between (a) the product of the Fair 
Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day preceding the first public 
announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange multiplied by the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock that could be acquired on such date upon the 
exercise in full of such rights or warrants (including upon the conversion or 
exchange of all such convertible or exchangeable securities), whether or not 
exercisable (or convertible or exchangeable) at such date, and (b) the 
aggregate amount payable pursuant to such right or warrant to purchase or 
acquire such maximum number of shares of Common Stock including the amount 
paid to acquire such right or warrant: provided, however, that in no event 
shall the Non-Dilutive Amount be less than zero.  For purposes of the 
foregoing, in the case of a security convertible into or exchangeable for


shares of Common Stock, the amount payable pursuant to a right or warrant to 
purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock shall be the Fair Market Value of 
such security on the date of the issuance, sale or exchange of such security 
by the Corporation.

      "Pro Rata Repurchase" means any purchase of shares of Common Stock by 
the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, whether for cash, shares of capital 
stock or other securities of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness of the 
Corporation or any other person or any other property (including shares of a 
subsidiary of the Corporation), or any combination thereof, effected while any 
of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange 
offer subject to Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision 
of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to substantially all holders 
of Common Stock.  However, no purchase of shares by the Corporation or any 
subsidiary thereof made in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata 
Repurchase.  For purposes of this Subsection 9.01, shares shall be deemed to 
have been purchased by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof "in open 
market transactions" if they have been purchased (a) substantially in 
accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the 
Exchange Act on the date the ESOP Shares are initially issued by the 
Corporation or (b) on such other terms and conditions as the Corporation shall 
have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such purchases from having 
a material effect on the trading market for the Common Stock.

      "Special Dividend" means a dividend in respect of ESOP Preferred Stock 
in shares of ESOP Preferred Stock.

      9.02  Stock Dividend/Stock Split/Recapitalization.

              (i)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, (a) pay a 
      dividend or make a distribution in respect of the Common Stock in 
      shares of Common Stock or (b) subdivide the outstanding shares of 
      Common Stock into a greater number of shares, in each case whether 
      by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of the Corporation 
      (excluding a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a 
      merger or consolidation to which Section 8 applies) or otherwise, 
      then, in such event, the Board shall, to the extent legally 
      permissible, declare a Special Dividend in such a manner that the 
      Holder will become a holder of that number of ESOP Shares equal to 
      the product of the number of shares held prior to such event 
      multiplied by a fraction (the "Section 9.02 Fraction") as follows:

                                      NA 
                                     ____

                                      NB

           Where:

           NA =  Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately

           NB =  Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately 
                 before such event.

A Special Dividend declared pursuant to this Subsection 9.02 shall be 
effective, upon payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the 
Common Stock, as of the record date for the determination of shareholders 
entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis),


and in the case of a subdivision shall become effective immediately as of the 
effective date thereof.  Concurrently with the declaration of the Special 
Dividend pursuant to this Subsection 9.02, the Conversion Price, the 
Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all ESOP Shares shall be 
adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the 
Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such event 
by the Section 9.02 Fraction.

              (ii)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, combine the 
      outstanding shares of Common Stock into a lesser number of shares,
      whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of the 
      Corporation (excluding a recapitalization or reclassification 
      effected by a merger, consolidation or other transaction to which 
      Section 8 applies) or otherwise, then, in such event and effective 
      immediately as of the effective date of such combination, the 
      Holder will become a holder of that number of ESOP Shares equal to 
      the number of ESOP Shares held prior to such event multiplied by 
      the Section 9.02 Fraction.  Concurrently, the Conversion Price, the 
      Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all ESOP 
      Shares shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion 
      Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, 
      respectively, in effect immediately before such event by the 
      Section 9.02 Fraction.

      9.03  Rights or Warrants to Purchase Common Stock.  Subject to the 
provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, in the event the Corporation shall, 
at any time or from time to time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, 
issue to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution, 
including by way of a reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the 
Corporation, any right or warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (but not 
including as a right or warrant for this purpose any security convertible into 
or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) for a consideration having a Fair 
Market Value per share less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common 
Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant (other than pursuant to 
any employee or director incentive, compensation or benefit plan of the 
Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or hereafter 
adopted), then, in such event, the Board shall, to the extent legally 
permissible, declare a Special Dividend in such a manner that the Holder will 
become a holder of that number of ESOP Shares equal to the product of the 
number of shares held prior to such event multiplied by a fraction (the 
"Section 9.03 Fraction") as follows:

                                NB + M
                                ______

                                NB + F

            Where:

            NB =  Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately 
                  before such issuance of rights or warrants.

             M =  Maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could be 
                  acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and

             F =  Number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased at 
                  the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time 
                  of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration 
                  payable upon exercise in full of all rights and warrants.

A Special Dividend declared pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall be effective 
upon such issuance of rights or warrants.  Concurrently with the declaration 
of the Special Dividend pursuant to this Section 9.03, the Conversion Price, 
the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all ESOP Shares shall 
be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and the 
Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such event 
by the Section 9.03 Fraction.

      9.04  Sale of Common Stock for less than Fair Market Value.

             (i)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, issue, sell or 
      exchange shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to (a) any 
      right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock 
      (including as such a right or warrant any security convertible 
      into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) or (b) any 
      employee or director incentive, compensation or benefit plan or 
      arrangement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the 
      Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted) for a consideration 
      per share less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common 
      Stock on the date of such issuance, sale or exchange, then, in 
      such event, the Board shall, to the extent legally permissible, 
      declare a Special Dividend in such a manner that the Holder will 
      become a holder of that number of ESOP Shares equal to the product 
      of the number of shares held prior to such event multiplied by a 
      fraction (the "Section 9.04(i) Fraction") as follows:

                                     NB + I
                                     ______

                                     NB + F

                  Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of 
                  such issuance, sale or exchange for the maximum aggregate 
                  consideration paid therefor.

            (ii)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, issue, sell or 
      exchange any right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of 
      Common Stock (including as such a right or warrant any security 
      convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) other 
      than pursuant to (a) any employee or director incentive, 
      compensation or benefit plan or arrangement of the Corporation or 
      any subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted 
      or (b) any dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock 


      contemplated in Subsection 9.02 for a consideration having a Fair 
      Market Value, on the date of such issuance, sale or exchange, less 
      than the Non-Dilutive Amount, then, in such event, the Board 
      shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a Special 
      Dividend in such manner that the Holder will become a holder of 
      that number of ESOP Shares equal to the product of the number of 
      shares held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Section 
      9.04 (ii) Fraction") as follows:

                                    NB + M

            Where:

            NB =  Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately 
                  before such issuance of rights or warrants.

                  acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and 
                  warrants.

             N =  Number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased at 
                  the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time

                  consideration payable at the time of the issuance, sale or 
                  exchange of such right or warrant and (y) the maximum 
                  aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of all 
                  such rights or warrants.

effective upon the effective date of such issuance, sale or exchange.  
Concurrently with the declaration of the Special Dividend pursuant to this

Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in 
effect immediately before such event by the Section 9.04(i) Fraction or 
Section 9.04(ii) Fraction, as the case may be.

             (i)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, make an 
      Extraordinary Distribution in respect of the Common Stocks, 
      whether by dividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or 
      recapitalization of the Corporation (including capitalization or 
      reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to which 
      Section 8 does not apply), then, in such event, the Board shall, 
      to the extent legally permissible, declare a Special Dividend in 
      such a manner that the Holder will become a holder of that number 
      of ESOP Shares equal to the product of the number of such shares 
      held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Section 9.05(i) 
      Fraction") as follows:

                                    NB x F

                  before the ex-dividend date with respect to an Extraordinary

                  date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution that is 
                  paid in other than cash.

             D =  The Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution.

            (ii)   Subject to the provisions of Subsections 9.06 and 9.07, 
      in the event the Corporation shall, at a any time or from time to 
      time while any of the ESOP Shares are outstanding, effect a Pro 
      Rata Repurchase of Common Stock, then in such event, the Board 
      shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a Special 
      Dividend in such a manner that the Holder will become the holder

                  or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata 
                  Repurchase that is not a tender offer.

             A =  The Fair Market Value of the aggregate purchase price of 
                  the Pro Rata Repurchase.

The Corporation shall deliver to the Holder (a) notice of its intent to make 
any Extraordinary Distribution and (b) notice of any offer by the Corporation 
to make a Pro Rata Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as 
practicable after, such offer is first communicated to holders of Common Stock 
or, in the case of an Extraordinary Distribution, the announcement of a record 
date in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common 
Stock is listed or admitted to trading.  Such notice shall set forth the 
intended record date and the amount and nature of such dividend or 
distribution, or, if a Pro Rata Repurchase, (x) the number of shares subject 
to such offer, (y) the purchase price payable by the Corporation pursuant to 
such offer, and (z) the Conversion Price and the number of shares of Common 
Stock into which an ESOP Share may be converted at such time.  Concurrently 
with a Special Dividend paid pursuant to this Subsection 9.05, the Conversion 
Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all ESOP 
Shares shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation 
Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately


before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Section 
9.05(i) Fraction or Section 9.05(ii) Fraction, as the case may be.

      9.06  Adjustment Alternatives.  Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this Section 9, the Corporation shall not be required to make (a) any Special 
Dividend, combination of shares or any adjustment of the Conversion Price, the 
Liquidation Price or the Preferred Dividend Rate unless such Special Dividend, 
combination of shares or adjustment would require an increase or decrease of 
at least one percent in the number of ESOP Shares outstanding, or, (b) if no 
additional ESOP Shares are issued, any adjustment of the Conversion Price 
unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one 
percent in the Conversion Price.  Any lesser Special Dividend, combination of 
shares or adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made no later than 
the time of, and together with, the next subsequent Special Dividend, 
combination of shares or adjustment which, together with any Special Dividend 
or Dividends, adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an 
increase or decrease of at least one percent of the number of ESOP Shares 
outstanding or, if no additional ESOP Shares are being issued, an increase or 
decrease of at least one percent of the Conversion Price, whichever the case 
may be.

      9.07  Alternative to Special Dividend.  The Corporation and the Board 
shall each use their best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all 
actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate for declaration of any 
Special Dividend or combination of shares provided in this Section 9, but 
shall not be required to call a special meeting of shareholders in order to 
implement the provisions thereof.  If for any reason the Board is precluded 
from giving full effect to the Special Dividend provided in this Section 9, 
then no such Special Dividend shall be declared, but instead the Conversion 
Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in 
effect immediately before the relevant event by the applicable Section 9.02, 
Section 9.03, Section 9.04(i), Section 9.04(ii), Section 9.05(i) or Section 
9.05(ii) Fraction, and the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate 
will not be adjusted.  An adjustment to the Conversion Price made pursuant to 
this Subsection 9.07 shall be given effect, (a) in the case of a payment of a 
dividend or distribution under Subsection 9.02(i), upon payment thereof as of 
the record date for the determination of holders entitled to receive such 
dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis), and, in the case of a 
subdivision under Subsection 9.02(ii), immediately as of the effective date 
thereof, (b) in the case of Subsection 9.03, upon such issuance of rights or 
warrants,(c) in the case of Subsection 9.04, upon the effective date of a such 
issuance, sale or exchange, (d) in the case of an Extraordinary Distribution 
under Subsection 9.05(i), as of the record date for the determination of 
holders entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution (on a retroactive 
basis) and (e) in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase under Subsection 9.05(ii), 
upon the expiration date thereof (if such Pro Rata Repurchase is a tender 
offer) or the effective date thereof (if such Pro Rata Repurchase is not a 
tender offer).  If subsequently the Board is able to give full effect to the 
Special Dividend as provided in Subsections 9.02, 9.03, 9.04 or 9.05, then 
such Special Dividend will be declared and other adjustments will be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Subsection and the adjustment 
in the Conversion Price as provided in this Subsection 9.07 will automatically 
be reversed and nullified prospectively.

      9.08  Equitable Adjustments.  If (a) the Corporation shall make any 
dividend or distribution on the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other 
capital stock or other security of the Corporation or any rights or warrants 
to purchase or acquire any such security or effect any other similar corporate 
change, or (b) the Corporation shall otherwise be recapitalized, reorganized


or restructured, and in either case the transaction (x) does not result in an 
adjustment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9 or (y) does 
result in an adjustment pursuant to such provisions but the Board, in its sole 
discretion, determines that under the circumstances the adjustment is 
inadequate, then in either case the Board may, in its sole discretion, 
determine whether an equitable adjustment should be made or an additional 
equitable adjustment should be made in respect of such transaction.  If in 
such case the Board determines that some type of adjustment should be made, an 
adjustment shall be made effective as of such date as determined by the Board.

      The Corporation shall be entitled, but not required, to make such 
additional adjustments, in addition to the foregoing provisions of this 
Section 9, as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in 
shares of capital stock of the Corporation, subdivision, reclassification or 
combination of shares of the Corporation or any recapitalization of the 
Corporation shall not be taxable to the holders of the Common Stock.

      A determination of the Board made pursuant to this Subsection 9.08 shall 
be final and binding on the Corporation and all shareholders of the 
Corporation.

      If the Corporation shall be required to (a) declare a Special Dividend 
or combination of shares and effect concurrent adjustments or (b) effect any 
adjustments in lieu of a Special Dividend, in each case pursuant to this 
Section 9, the Board may, in its sole discretion, modify the amount of the 
Special Dividend or combination of shares or any required adjustment for the 
benefit of the Holder to such extent as the Board deems equitable.

      9.09  Documentation of Adjustments.  Whenever an adjustment increasing 
the number of ESOP Shares outstanding is required pursuant hereto, the Board 
shall take action as is necessary so that a sufficient number of ESOP Shares 
are designated with respect to such increase resulting from such adjustment.  
Whenever an adjustment to the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the 
Preferred Dividend Rate of the ESOP Preferred Stock is required pursuant 
hereto, the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with the transfer agent 
for the Common Stock and with the Treasurer of the Corporation a statement 
signed by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation stating 
the adjusted Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate 
determined as provided herein.  Such statement shall set forth in reasonable 
detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of 
computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market Value 
involved in such computation.  Promptly after each adjustment to the number of 
ESOP Shares outstanding, the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price or the 
Preferred Dividend Rate, the Corporation shall mail a notice to the Holder 
stating the then prevailing number of ESOP Shares outstanding, the Conversion 
Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate. 


Section 10.  Miscellaneous.

      10.01  Notices.  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing.  
All notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of 
receipt thereof or three business days after the mailing thereof.  Notices 
shall be addressed: (a) if to the Corporation, to its office at 39 Old 
Ridgebury Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06817-0001 (Attention:  Secretary), (b)

books of the Corporation (which may include the records of any transfer agent 
for Common Stock) or (c) to such other address as the Corporation or the 
Holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice similarly given.



      10.02  Stamp Taxes.  The Corporation shall pay any and all stock 
transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any 
issuance or delivery of ESOP Shares or shares of Common Stock or other 
securities issued on account of ESOP Shares pursuant thereto or certificates 
representing such shares or securities.  The Corporation shall not, however, 
be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any 
transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of ESOP Shares or Common Stock 
or other securities in a name other than that in which the ESOP Shares with 
respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were 
registered, or in respect of any payment to any person with respect to any 
such shares or securities other than a payment to the registered holder 
thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or 
payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, 
delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or 
has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has 
been paid or is not payable.

      10.03  Failure to Designate Recipient.  In the event that the Holder 
shall not, by notice, designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be 
issued upon conversion or exchange should be registered, or to whom payment 
upon redemption of ESOP Shares should be made or the address to which the 
certificate or certificates representing such shares, or such payment, should 
be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make 
such payment, in the name of the Holder and to send the certificate or 
certificates or other documentation representing such shares, or such payment, 
to the address of the Holder.


      4.    The holders of shares of stock of the Corporation shall have no 
preemptive rights to purchase any shares of stock or any other securities of 
the Corporation.

      5.    The number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed and may 
from time to time be increased or decreased by resolution or other action of 
the Board of Directors, but in no event shall the number of directors be less 
than three or more than 19.

      6.    The office of the Corporation is to be located in the City of New 
York, County of New York.  The Secretary of State of the State of New York is 
designated as the agent of the Corporation upon whom process in any action or 
proceeding against it may be served, and the address without the State to


which the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of process in any action or 
proceeding against the Corporation which may be served upon him is:

                        Secretary
                        Union Carbide Corporation
                        39 Old Ridgebury Road
                        Danbury, Connecticut 06817-0001

      7.    The By-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the 
stockholders, or by the Board of Directors by a vote of a majority of the 
entire Board.

      8.    A person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall not be 
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for damages for any breach of 
duty in such capacity, except to the extent such liability may not be 
eliminated or limited by applicable law from time to time in effect.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed this Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation this 2nd day of May, 1994 and affirm the 
statements contained herein as true under the penalties of perjury.

     certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(h) or 
     (b) in accordance with Section 5.03, unless and until 
     such designated Consolidated Subsidiary becomes an 
     Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to Section 5.03.

At the Effective Date, the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be 
those set forth in such certificate. 

          "Restructuring Charges" means all nonrecurring 
after-tax charges taken after June 30, 1994 by the Borrower 
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, to

writing off or writing down impaired assets.

          "SEC" means the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

          "Subsidiary" with respect to any Person means any 
corporation or other entity of which such Person directly or 
indirectly owns the securities or other ownership interests

of directors or other persons performing similar functions.  
Unless otherwise specified, "Subsidiary" means a Subsidiary of 
the Borrower.

          "Termination Date" means November 3, 1999, or, if

Business Day.

          "Unfunded Liabilities" means, with respect to any 
Plan at any time, the amount (if any) by which (i) the present 
value of all benefits under such Plan exceeds (ii) the fair 
market value of all Plan assets allocable to such benefits 
(excluding any accrued but unpaid contributions), all

          SECTION 1.02.  Accounting Terms and Determina-
tions.  Unless otherwise specified herein, all accounting 
terms used herein shall be interpreted, all accounting 
determinations hereunder shall be made, and all financial 
statements required to be delivered hereunder shall be 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles as in effect from time to time, applied on a basis 
consistent (except for changes concurred in by the Borrower's 
independent public accountants) with the most recent audited 
consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its 
Consolidated Subsidiaries delivered to the Banks; provided 
that, if the Borrower notifies the Agent that the Borrower 
wishes to amend any covenant in Article V to eliminate the 
effect of any change in generally accepted accounting 
principles on the operation of such covenant (or if the Agent 
notifies the Borrower that the Required Banks wish to amend 
Article V for such purpose), then the Borrower's compliance 
with such covenant shall be determined on the basis of 
generally accepted accounting principles in effect immediately 
before the relevant change in generally accepted accounting 
principles became effective, until either such notice is 
withdrawn or such covenant is amended in a manner satisfactory 
to the Borrower and the Required Banks.



          SECTION 1.03.  Types of Borrowings.  The term 
"Borrowing" denotes the aggregation of Loans of one or more 
Banks to be made to the Borrower pursuant to Article II on a 
single date and for a single Interest Period.  Borrowings are 
classified for purposes of this Agreement either by reference 
to the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a 
"Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of 
Euro-Dollar Loans) or by reference to the provisions of 
Article II under which participation therein is determined 
(i.e., a "Committed  Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 
2.01 in which all Banks participate in proportion to their 
Commitments, while a "Money Market Borrowing" is a Borrowing 
under Section 2.03 in which the Bank participants are 
determined on the basis of their bids in accordance 
therewith).


                            ARTICLE II

                            THE CREDITS

          SECTION 2.01.  Commitments to Lend.  Each Bank 
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in 
this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.02), 
to make Domestic Loans and Euro-Dollar Loans to the Borrower 
pursuant to this Section from time to time in amounts such 
that the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans by such 
Bank at any one time outstanding hereunder shall not exceed 
the amount of its Commitment. Each Borrowing under this 
Section 2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of 
$25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000 (except that 
any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available in 
accordance with Section 3.02(b) and, if less than $5,000,000, 
must be a Base Rate Borrowing) and shall be made from the 
several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective 
Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may 
borrow under this Section 2.01, repay, or to the extent 
permitted by Section 2.10 or 8.03(d)(ii), prepay Loans and 
reborrow at any time under this Section 2.01.

          SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Committed Borrowings. The 
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice (a "Notice 
of Committed Borrowing") not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York 
City time) on:

          (x)  the date of each Base Rate Borrowing,

          (y)  the Domestic Business Day next preceding the 
     date of each CD Borrowing and



          (z)  the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before 
     each Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

     specifying:

          (a)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a 
     Domestic Business Day in the case of a Domestic 
     Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of 
     a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

          (b)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,

          (c)  whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing 
     are to be CD Loans, Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar 
     Loans, and

          (d)  in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the 
     duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, 
     subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest 
     Period.

          SECTION 2.03.  Money Market Borrowings.

          (a)  The Money Market Option.  In addition to 
Committed Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.01, the Borrower 
may, as set forth in this Section, request the Banks to make 
offers to make Money Market Loans to the Borrower.  The Banks 
may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the 
Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such 
offers in the manner set forth in this Section.

          (b)  Money Market Quote Request.  When the Borrower 
wishes to request offers to make Money Market Loans under this 
Section, it shall transmit to the Auction Agent by telex or 
facsimile transmission a Money Market Quote Request 
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto so as to be 
received no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on:

          (x)  the fourth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to 
     the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of 
     a LIBOR Auction or

          (y)  the Domestic Business Day next preceding the 
     date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of an 
     Absolute Rate Auction

(or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower 
and the Auction Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall


have notified the Banks not later than the date of the Money 
Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute 
Rate Auction for which such change is to be effective) 
specifying:

          (i)  the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall 
     be a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a LIBOR 
     Auction or a Domestic Business Day in the case of an 
     Absolute Rate Auction,

         (ii)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which 
     shall be $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of 
     $5,000,000,

        (iii)  the duration of the Interest Period 
     applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the 
     definition of Interest Period, and

         (iv)  whether the Money Market Quotes requested are 
     to set forth a Money Market LIBOR Margin or a Money 
     Market Absolute Rate.

The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for 
more than one Interest Period in a single Money Market Quote 
Request.  No Money Market Quote Request shall be given within 
four Euro-Dollar Business Days (or such other number of days 
as the Borrower and the Auction Agent may agree and the 
Auction Agent shall have promptly notified to the Banks) of 
any other Money Market Quote Request.

          (c)  Invitation for Money Market Quotes.  Promptly 
upon receipt of a Money Market Quote Request, the Auction 
Agent shall send to the Banks by telex or facsimile 
transmission an Invitation for Money Market Quotes 
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto with respect to 
such Money Market Quote Request.

          (d)  Submission and Contents of Money Market Quotes.  
(i)  Each Bank may submit a Money Market Quote containing an 
offer or offers to make Money Market Loans in response to any 
Invitation for Money Market Quotes.  Each Money Market Quote 
must comply with the requirements of this subsection (d) and 
must be submitted to the Auction Agent by telex or facsimile 
transmission at its offices specified in or pursuant to 
Section 9.01 not later than:

          (x)  12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the third 
     Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of 
     Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or



          (y)  9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the 
     proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute 
     Rate Auction

(or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower 
and the Auction Agent shall have mutually agreed, and the 
Auction Agent shall have notified the Banks not later than the 
date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR 
Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to 
be effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by 
the Auction Agent in the capacity of a Bank may be submitted, 
and may only be submitted, if the Auction Agent notifies the 
Borrower of the terms of the offer or offers contained therein 
not later than:

          (x)  one hour prior to the deadline for the other 
     Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or

          (y)  15 minutes prior to the deadline for the 
     other Banks, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction.

Subject to Articles III and VI, any Money Market Quote so made 
shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the 
Auction Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower.

         (ii)  Each Money Market Quote shall be in 
substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto and shall in any 
case specify:

          (A)  the proposed date of Borrowing,

          (B)  the principal amount of the Money Market Loan 
     for which each such offer is being made, which 
     principal amount:

               (w)  may be greater than or less than the 
          Commitment of the quoting Bank,

               (x)  must be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple 
          of $1,000,000,

               (y)  may not exceed the principal amount of 
          Money Market Loans for which offers were requested 
          and

               (z)  may be subject to an aggregate 
          limitation as to the principal amount of Money 
          Market Loans for which offers being made by such 
          quoting Bank may be accepted,



          (C)  in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin 
     above or below the applicable London Interbank Offered 
     Rate (the "Money Market LIBOR Margin") offered for each 
     such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage 
     (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added 
     to or subtracted from such base rate,

          (D)  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the 
     rate of interest per annum (rounded to the nearest 
     1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market Absolute Rate") 
     offered for each such Money Market Loan, and

          (E)  the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers 
by the quoting Bank with respect to each Interest Period 
specified in the related Invitation for Money Market Quotes.

        (iii)  Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded 
if it:

          (A)  is not substantially in conformity with 
     Exhibit D hereto or does not specify all of the 
     information required by subsection (d)(ii);

          (B)  contains qualifying, conditional or similar 
     language;

          (C)  proposes terms other than or in addition to 
     those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Money 
     Market Quotes; or

          (D)  arrives after the time set forth in 
     subsection (d)(i).

          (e)  Notice to Borrower.  The Auction Agent shall 
promptly notify the Borrower of the terms:

          (x)  of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank 
     that is in accordance with subsection (d) and

          (y)  of any Money Market Quote that amends, 
     modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous 
     Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect 
     to the same Money Market Quote Request.  Any such 
     subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by 
     the Auction Agent unless such subsequent Money Market 
     Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error 
     in such former Money Market Quote.



The Auction Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify:

          (A)  the aggregate principal amount of Money 
     Market Loans for which offers have been received for 
     each Interest Period specified in the related Money 
     Market Quote Request,

          (B)  the respective principal amounts and Money 
     Market LIBOR Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as 
     the case may be, so offered and

          (C)  if applicable, limitations on the aggregate 
     principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers 
     in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted.

          (f)  Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later 
than:

          (x)  1:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the third 
     Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of 
     Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or

          (y)  10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the 
     proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute 
     Rate Auction

(or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower 
and the Auction Agent shall have mutually agreed and the 
Auction Agent shall have notified the Banks not later than the 
date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR 
Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to 
be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Auction Agent of 
its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to 
it pursuant to subsection (e) and the Auction Agent shall so 
notify the Administrative Agent.  In the case of acceptance, 
such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall 
specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each 
Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept 
any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

          (i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Money 
     Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount 
     set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request,

         (ii)  the principal amount of each Money Market 
     Borrowing must be $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of 
     $5,000,000 and the principal amount of each Money 
     Market Loan with respect to such Money Market Borrowing 


     must be in an amount of $5,000,000 or a larger multiple 
     of $1,000,000,

        (iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the 
     basis of ascending Money Market LIBOR Margins or Money 
     Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be,

         (iv)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is 
     described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise 
     fails to comply with the requirements of this 
     Agreement, and

          (v)  failure by the Borrower to notify the Auction 
     Agent by the time specified above shall be deemed a 
     rejection of all offers.

          (g)  Allocation by Borrower.  If offers are made by 
two or more Banks with the same Money Market LIBOR Margins or 
Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater 
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which 
such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the 
principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which 
such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower 
among such Banks as nearly as possible in proportion to the 
aggregate principal amounts of such offers (or as nearly in 
proportion as shall be practicable after giving effect to the 
requirement that Money Market Loans for each relevant maturity 
date shall each be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a 
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof).

          SECTION 2.04.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

          (a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the 
contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such 
Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be 
revocable by the Borrower.

          (b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) 
on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein 
shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section) 
make the amount of its share of such Borrowing available to 
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at 
the office of the Administrative Agent specified in or 
pursuant to Section 9.01 in funds immediately available to the 
Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent 
determines (or, in the case of the first Borrowing, the 
Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent determine)


that any applicable condition specified in Article III has not 
been satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall make such 
aggregate funds available to the Borrower by depositing as 
promptly as practicable the proceeds thereof, in like funds as 
received by the Administrative Agent, in the account of the 
Borrower with the Administrative Agent on the date of such 
Borrowing.

          (c)  If any Bank makes a new Committed Loan 
hereunder to the Borrower on a day on which the Borrower is to 
repay all or any part of an outstanding Committed Loan from 
such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new 
Committed Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal 
to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed 
and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such 
Bank to the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection 
(b), or remitted by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent 
as provided in Section 2.11, as the case may be.

          (d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing 
that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative 
Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available 
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in 
accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04 
and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such 
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a 
corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent does, in 
such circumstances, make available to the Borrower such 
amount, such Bank shall within three Domestic Business Days 
following such Borrowing make such share available to the 
Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for each 
day from and including the date of such Borrowing that such 
share was not made available, at the Effective Federal Funds 
Rate.  If such amount is so made available, such payment to 
the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Bank's share of 
such Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.  If such 
amount is not so made available to the Administrative Agent, 
then the Administrative Agent shall on the third Domestic 
Business Day following such Borrowing notify the Borrower of 
such failure and on the fourth Domestic Business Day following 
the date of such Borrowing, the Borrower shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent such share, together with interest 
thereon for each day that the Borrower had the use of such 
share, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate.  Nothing contained 
in this subsection (d) shall relieve any Bank which has failed


to make available its share of any Borrowing hereunder from 
its obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (e)  The failure of any Bank to make available to 
the Administrative Agent its share of any Borrowing on the 
date of such Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its 
obligation, if any, hereunder to make available to the 
Administrative Agent its share of such Borrowing, but no Bank 
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make 
available the share of any Borrowing to be made available by 
such other Bank on such date of Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.05.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank 
shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of 
such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in 
an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of 
such Bank's Loans.

          (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent (to be given not later than two 
Domestic Business Days prior to the first Borrowing), request 
that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate 
Note in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal 
amount of such Loans.  Each such Note shall be in 
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate 
modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely 
Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference in this Agreement 
to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and 
include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require.

          (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to 
Section 3.01(b), the Documentation Agent shall mail such Note 
to such Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date, amount and 
maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of 
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect 
thereto, and prior to any transfer of its Note may endorse on 
the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to 
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such 
Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank 
to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect 
the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes.  
Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so 
to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its 
Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

          SECTION 2.06.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan 
included in any Borrowing shall mature, and the principal


amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of 
the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07.  Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base Rate 
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made to but 
excluding the date it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal 
to the Base Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable 
for each Interest Period on the last day thereof.  Any overdue 
principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear 
interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including 
the date payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of 
actual payment at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus 
the Base Rate for such day.

          (b)  Subject to Section 8.01, each CD Loan shall 
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for 
each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a 
rate per annum equal to the sum of the CD Margin for such day 
plus the applicable Adjusted CD Rate.  Such interest shall be 
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, 
if such Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals 
of 90 days after the first day thereof.  Any overdue principal 
of or interest on any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable on 
demand, for each day from and including the date payment 
thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at 
a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for 
such day.

          "CD Margin" means a rate per annum determined in 
accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

          The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest 
Period means a rate per annum determined pursuant to the 
following formula:

                   [ CDBR       ]*
          ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                   [ 1.00 - DRP ]

          ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
          CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
           DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
            AR  =  Assessment Rate

     __________
     *  The amount in brackets being rounded upwards, if
     necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%



          The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period 
is the rate of interest determined by the Administrative Agent 
to be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next 
higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid at 
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as 
practicable) on the first day of such Interest Period by two 
or more New York certificate of deposit dealers of recognized 
standing for the purchase at face value from each CD Reference 
Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount comparable to 
the principal amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank 
to which such Interest Period applies and having a maturity 
comparable to such Interest Period.

          "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that 
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such 
day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum 
reserve requirement (including without limitation any basic, 
supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the 
Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits 
exceeding $5,000,000,000 in respect of new non-personal time 
deposits in Dollars in New York City having a maturity 
comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount of 
$100,000 or more.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted 
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in 
the Domestic Reserve Percentage.

          "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual 
assessment rate in effect on such day which is payable by a 
member of the Bank Insurance Fund classified as adequately 
capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a 
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within 
the meaning of 12 C.F.R. Section 327.3(e) (or any successor 
provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or 
any successor) for such Corporation's (or such successor's) 
insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the 
United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted 
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in 
the Assessment Rate.

          (c)  Subject to Section 8.01, each Euro-Dollar Loan 
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable 
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the 
Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the applicable London 
Interbank Offered Rate.  Such interest shall be payable for 
each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such 
Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of 
three months after the first day thereof.



          "Euro-Dollar Margin" means a rate per annum 
determined in accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

          The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to 
any Interest Period means the average (rounded upward, if 
necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective 
rates per annum at which deposits in Dollars are offered to 
each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London 
interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) 
two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such 
Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the 
principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar 
Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and 
for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period.

          (d)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any 
Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for 
each day from and including the date payment thereof was due 
to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate per 
annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

          (e)  Subject to Section 8.01, each Money Market 
LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal 
amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at 
a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank 
Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in 
accordance with Section 2.07(c) as if the related Money Market 
LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus 
(or minus) the Money Market LIBOR Margin quoted by the Bank 
making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.  Each Money 
Market Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the 
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period 
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money 
Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in 
accordance with Section 2.03. Interest on each Money Market 
Loan shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day 
thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three 
months, at intervals of three months after the first day 
thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Money 
Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each 
day from and including the date payment thereof was due to but 
excluding the date of actual payment at a rate per annum equal 
to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

          (f)  The Administrative Agent shall determine each 
interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The 
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower 
and the Banks making such Loans by telex, facsimile


transmission or cable of each rate of interest so determined, 
and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the 
absence of manifest error.

          (g)  Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best 
efforts to furnish quotations to the Administrative Agent as 
contemplated by this Section.  If any Reference Bank does not 
furnish a timely quotation, the Administrative Agent shall 
determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the 
quotation or quotations furnished by the remaining Reference 
Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on a 
timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

          SECTION 2.08.  Fees.

          (a)  Commitment Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks ratably in 
proportion to their Commitments a commitment fee at the 
Commitment Fee Rate (determined for each day in accordance 
with the Pricing Schedule).  Such commitment fee shall be 
payable for each day on the amount by which the aggregate 
amount of the Commitments exceeds the sum of:

          (i)  the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 
     the Loans plus

         (ii)  the Applicable Alternative Currency 
     Outstandings.

Such commitment fee shall accrue from and including the 
Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date (or 
earlier date of termination of the Commitments in their 
entirety).

          (b)  Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks ratably in 
proportion to their Commitments a facility fee at the Facility 
Fee Rate (determined for each day in accordance with the 
Pricing Schedule).  Such facility fee shall accrue:

          (i)  from and including the Effective Date to but 
     excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date of 
     termination of the Commitments in their entirety), on 
     the daily aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether 
     used or unused) and

         (ii)  from and including the Termination Date (or 
     such earlier date of termination) to but excluding the 
     date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on 


     the daily aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 
     Loans.

          (c)  Payments.  Accrued fees under this Section 
shall be payable quarterly on each March 31, June 30, 
September 30 and December 31 (in arrears) commencing on 
December 31, 1994 and upon the date of termination of the 
Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, in the case of 
the facility fee, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their 
entirety).

          SECTION 2.09.  Optional Termination or Reduction of 
Commitments.  The Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic 
Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent,

          (i)  terminate the Commitments at any time, if no 
     Loans are outstanding at such time, or

         (ii)  ratably reduce from time to time, by an 
     aggregate amount of at least $25,000,000, the aggregate 
     amount of the Commitments, provided that the aggregate 
     amount of Commitments may not be reduced below the sum 
     of (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 
     the Loans plus (y) the Applicable Alternative Currency 
     Outstandings (after giving effect to such reduction).

          SECTION 2.10.  Prepayments.  (a)  The Borrower may, 
upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of prepayment, 
prepay any Base Rate Borrowing (or any Money Market Borrowing 
bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01) in 
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts 
aggregating $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, 
by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with 
accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.  Subject 
to Section 8.03(d)(ii), each such optional prepayment shall be 
applied to prepay ratably the Base Rate Loans of the several 
Banks included in such Borrowing.

          (b)  Subject to Section 2.12, upon giving notice to 
the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York 
City time) on the Domestic Business Day next preceding the 
date of prepayment (in the case of a CD Borrowing) or the 
third Euro-Dollar Business Day before the date of prepayment 
(in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing), the Borrower may 
prepay any CD Borrowing or Euro-Dollar Borrowing in whole at 
any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating 
$25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, by paying


the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued 
interest thereon to the date of prepayment.  Subject to 
Section 8.03(d)(ii), each such optional prepayment shall be 
applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks 
included in such Borrowing.

          (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant 
to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly 
notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's 
ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice 
shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

          (d)  The Borrower may not prepay the Money Market 
Loans at any time (other than Money Market Loans bearing 
interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01).

          (e)  On any day upon which, as a result of any 
reduction of Commitments under this Agreement, the sum of (i) 
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans plus 
(ii) the Applicable Alternative Currency Outstandings exceeds 
the aggregate amount of the Commitments, the Borrower shall 
prepay such principal amount (together with accrued interest 
thereon) of outstanding Loans hereunder as may be necessary so 
that after such repayment such sum does not exceed such 
aggregate amount of Commitments.  Any such prepayment shall be 
made in accordance with all applicable provisions of this 
Agreement (including without limitation subsections (a), (b), 
(c) and (d) of this Section 2.10).

          SECTION 2.11.  General Provisions as to Payments.  
(a)  The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and 
interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date when due, in 
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, 
to the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or 
pursuant to Section 9.01.  The Administrative Agent will 
promptly distribute to each Bank its share of each such 
payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account 
of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or 
interest on, the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a 
day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment 
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic 
Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or 
interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which 
is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment 
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar 
Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in 
another calendar month, in which case the date for payment 
thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the


Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not a 
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall 
be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  
If the date for any payment of principal is extended by 
operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be 
payable for such extended time.

          (b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which 
any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower 
will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent 
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to 
the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative 
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be 
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to 
the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that the 
Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall 
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such 
amount distributed to such Bank together with interest 
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed 
to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to 
the Administrative Agent, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate.

          SECTION 2.12.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower 
makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate 
Loan (pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.18, Article VI, 
Article VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day 
of the Interest Period applicable thereto or if the Borrower 
fails to borrow or prepay any Fixed Rate Loans after notice of 
such borrowing or prepayment has been given to any Bank in 
accordance with Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.10(c), the 
Borrower shall reimburse each Bank on demand for any resulting 
loss or expense actually incurred by it (or a Participant 
which has purchased or agreed to purchase a participation in 
the relevant Loan), including (without limitation) any loss 
incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from 
third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period 
after any such payment or failure to borrow or prepay, 
provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a 
certificate containing a computation in reasonable detail of 
the amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall be 
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

          SECTION 2.13.  Computation of Interest and Fees. 
Interest based on the Reference Rate hereunder shall be 
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a 
leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed 
(including the first day but excluding the last day).  All


other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a 
year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days 
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day), 
except for interest on Alternative Currency Advances, which 
shall be computed according to prevailing market practices.

          SECTION 2.14.  Withholding Tax Exemption.  At least 
five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which 
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any 
Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the 
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it 
will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal 
Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case 
that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this 
Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of 
any United States federal income taxes.  Each Bank which so 
delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to 
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two 
additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or 
before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or 
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the 
most recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments 
thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably 
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, in each 
case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments 
under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or 
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless 
an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, 
law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any 
such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all 
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from 
duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to 
it and such Bank promptly advises the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving 
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States 
federal income tax.

          SECTION 2.15.  Regulation D Compensation.  (a)  So 
long as Regulation D shall require reserves to be maintained 
against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or against any other 
category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference 
to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined 
or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which 
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to 
United States residents), each Bank subject to and actually 
incurring such reserve requirement may require the Borrower to 
pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the


Euro-Dollar Loans additional interest on the related 
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum (the 
"Regulation D Rate") determined pursuant to the following 
formula:

                    [  LIBOR   ]
          RDR  =    [ -------- ]  -  LIBOR
                    [ 1 - ERR  ]

          RDR  =    Regulation D Rate
        LIBOR  =    The applicable London Interbank
                      Offered Rate
          ERR  =    Eurocurrency Reserve Ratio

          "Eurocurrency Reserve Ratio" means the applicable 
reserve ratio prescribed by Regulation D (as such Regulation 
shall have been amended to the first day of the related 
Interest Period) for such reserve requirements (expressed as a 
decimal).

          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the 
contrary, the Regulation D Rate shall be adjusted 
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in 
such reserve ratio.

          (b)  Any Bank wishing to require payment of such 
additional interest:

          (i)  shall so notify the Borrower, in which case 
     such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of 
     such Bank shall be payable on any date interest is 
     payable with respect to each Euro-Dollar Loan 
     commencing after the giving of such notice and

         (ii)  shall notify the Borrower from time to time 
     of the amount due it under this Section;

provided that the Borrower shall not be required to make any 
payment of an amount due hereunder earlier than the fifth 
Euro-Dollar Business Day after receipt of the notice referred 
to in clause (ii) of this Section.

          SECTION 2.16.  Alternative Currency Advances.

          (a)  Requests for Offers.  From time to time the 
Borrower may request any or all of the Banks to make offers 
to make Alternative Currency Advances, each in a minimum 
principal amount in the currency of such Alternative Currency 
Advance equivalent to $1,000,000, to the Borrower; provided 
that the aggregate Dollar Equivalents of all Alternative


Currency Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed 
$300,000,000; provided further that immediately after the 
making of an Alternative Currency Advance, the sum of (i) the 
aggregate principal amount of the Loans plus (ii) the 
Applicable Alternative Currency Outstandings will not exceed 
the aggregate amount of the Commitments.  Any such request 
shall be transmitted directly to any such Bank at the 
Euro-Dollar Lending Office of such Bank or at any other 
address that the Borrower and such Bank may agree from time to 
time.  Each Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, make 
such offers on terms and conditions as are satisfactory to 
such Bank, and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation 
to, accept any such offers.

          (b)  Reports to Agent.  (i)  The Borrower shall 
deliver to the Administrative Agent a report in respect of 
each Alternative Currency Advance (an "Alternative Currency 
Advance Report") by 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on (x) the 
date on which the Borrower accepts such Alternative Currency 
Advance (such report to constitute the designation of such 
advance as an Alternative Currency Advance for purposes of 
this Agreement), (y) the date on which any principal amount 
thereof is repaid prior to the scheduled maturity date and (z) 
the scheduled maturity date if payment thereof is not made on 
such scheduled maturity date, specifying for such Alternative 
Currency Advance:

          (w)  the date such advance was or will be made, on 
     which such amount of principal is prepaid or will be 
     repaid or on which payment was not made, as the case 
     may be;

          (x)  the Alternative Currency of such advance; and

          (y)  the principal amount of such advance or 
     principal prepayment or repayment or the amount not 
     paid (in such Alternative Currency).

On the basis of each such Alternative Currency Advance Report, 
the Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent 
of the advance then made or remaining after such principal 
repayment and the Applicable Alternative Currency Outstandings 
on such date after giving effect to such advance or principal 
repayment and shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks 
of such Dollar Equivalent and such Applicable Alternative 
Currency Outstandings.

         (ii)  If the aggregate amount of Loans and 
Alternative Currency Advances outstanding under this Agreement 
equals or exceeds $850,000,000, at the time of each Borrowing


hereunder that is not a Refunding Borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of 
each Alternative Currency Advance then outstanding and the 
Applicable Alternative Currency Outstandings on such date, 
based on such Dollar Equivalents, and shall promptly notify 
the Borrower and the Banks of such Dollar Equivalents, and 
such Applicable Alternative Currency Outstandings.

          (c)  Other Alternative Currency Borrowings. Nothing 
in this Section shall restrict the Borrower's ability to 
borrow in Alternative Currencies from one or more Banks or 
other lenders without reporting such borrowings as Alternative 
Currency Advances for purposes of this Agreement.  If and to 
the extent that any report designating such a borrowing as an 
Alternative Currency Advance would cause the Borrower to 
exceed any applicable limit set forth in Section 2.16(a) or 
3.02(b) on the day such report is received by the 
Administrative Agent, such designation shall be ineffective.  
Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, a 
report delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16(b) 
designating a borrowing as an Alternative Currency Advance for 
purposes of this Agreement shall be effective upon receipt by 
the Administrative Agent and may not thereafter be revoked by 
the Borrower.

          SECTION 2.17.  Judgment Currency.  If for the 
purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to 
convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder or under any of 
the Notes in the currency expressed to be payable herein or 
under the Notes (the "specified currency") into another 
currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that 
they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used 
shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking 
procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the 
specified currency with such other currency at the 
Administrative Agent's New York office on the Domestic 
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  
The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to 
any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any 
Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other 
than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent 
that on the Domestic Business Day following receipt by such 
Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any 
sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Bank or 
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in 
accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the 
specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of 
the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum 
originally due to such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as


the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower 
agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, 
as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such 
judgment, to indemnify such Bank or the Administrative Agent, 
as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of 
the specified currency so purchased exceeds:

          (a)  the sum originally due to such Bank or the
     Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and

          (b)  any amounts shared with other Banks as a 
     result of allocations of such excess as a 
     disproportionate payment to such Bank under Section 
     9.04,

such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, 
agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

          SECTION 2.18.  Replacement of this Credit 
Facility.  If the Borrower wishes at any time to replace the 
credit facility provided under this Agreement with another 
credit facility, the Borrower may give prior notice of the 
termination of the Commitments hereunder as required by 
Section 2.09 and prior notice of the prepayment of any 
Committed Loans outstanding hereunder as required by Section 
2.10, in each case on a conditional basis (i.e., conditioned 
upon such other credit facility becoming available to the 
Borrower), provided that the Borrower gives definitive notice 
of such termination of the Commitments and prepayment of 
outstanding Committed Loans (if any) to the Administrative 
Agent before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of 
such termination and prepayment (if any) and complies with the 
applicable requirements of Sections 2.09 and 2.10 in all other 
respects.

          (c)  immediately after such Borrowing, no Default 
     shall have occurred and be continuing; 

          (d)  none of the principal financial officer, the 
     principal accounting officer or the Treasurer of the 
     Borrower shall be aware of any Potential Cross-Default

                          ARTICLE IV

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Borrower represents and warrants that:

          SECTION 4.01.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The 
Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing 
and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, 
and has all corporate powers and all material governmental


licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to 
carry on its business as now conducted. 

          SECTION 4.02.  Corporate and Governmental 
Authorization; No Contravention.  The execution, delivery and 
performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the Notes 
are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly 
authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no 
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental 
body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute 
a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation 
or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the 
Borrower or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, 
decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of 
its Subsidiaries or result in or permit the termination or 
modification of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, 
decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of 
its Subsidiaries or result in the creation or imposition of 
any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its 
Subsidiaries. 

          SECTION 4.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement 
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and 
the Notes, when executed and delivered in accordance with this 
Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of 
the Borrower. 

          SECTION 4.04.  Financial Information. 

          (a)  The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower 
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 
the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by KPMG Peat 
Marwick, set forth in the Borrower's 1993 annual report to 
stockholders, copies of which have been delivered to each of 
the Banks, fairly present, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles, the consolidated financial 
position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as 
of such date and their consolidated results of operations and 
cash flows for such fiscal year. 

          (b)  The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the 
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income 
and cash flows for the six months then ended, copies of which 
have been delivered to each of the Banks, fairly present, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
applied on a basis consistent with the consolidated financial


statements referred to in subsection (a) of this Section, the 
consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its 
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their 
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such six 
month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments). 

          (c)  Since June 30, 1994 there has been no change in 
the business, financial position, results of operations or 
prospects of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, 
which could materially adversely affect the present or 
prospective ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations 
under this Agreement or any Note or which in any manner draws 
into question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement 
or any Note. 

          SECTION 4.05.  Litigation.  There is no action, suit 
or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the 
Borrower threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any 
of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any 
governmental body, agency or official in which there is a 
reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could 
materially adversely affect the present or prospective ability 
of the Borrower to perform its obligations under this 
Agreement or any Note or which in any manner draws into 
question the validity of this Agreement or the Notes. 

          SECTION 4.06.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member 
of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the 
minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue 
Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all 
material respects with the currently applicable provisions of 
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan.  
No member of the ERISA Group has:

          (i)  sought a waiver of the minimum funding 
     standard under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code 
     in respect of any Plan,

         (ii)  failed to make any contribution or payment to 
     any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any 
     Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan 
     or Benefit Arrangement, which has resulted or could 
     result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a 
     bond or other security under ERISA or the Internal 
     Revenue Code or

        (iii)  incurred any liability under Title IV of 
     ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums 
     under Section 4007 of ERISA and aggregate withdrawal 


     liabilities not in excess of $5,000,000 at any one time 
     outstanding. 

          SECTION 4.07.  Environmental Matters.  In the 
ordinary course of its business, the Borrower conducts reviews 
of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, 
operations and properties of the Borrower and its 
Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and 
evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without 
limitation, related United States environmental protection 
operating expenses, which include operating costs of pollution 
control facilities and certain environmental accruals and 
administrative expenses, and capital expenditures for the 
current fiscal year and related amounts projected for capital 
expenditures up to five years subsequent to such current 
fiscal year, expressed in then-current dollar amounts).  On 
the basis of this review, the Borrower has reasonably 
concluded that Environmental Laws are unlikely to have an 
effect on the business, financial condition, results of 
operations or prospects of the Borrower and its Consolidated 
Subsidiaries during the term of this Agreement, which could 
materially adversely affect the present or prospective ability 
of the Borrower to perform its obligations under this 
Agreement or any Note. 

          SECTION 4.08.  Restricted Subsidiaries.  Each 
corporate Restricted Subsidiary is a corporation duly 
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the 
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all 
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, 
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on 
its business as now conducted. 

          SECTION 4.09.  Not an Investment Company.  The 
Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

          SECTION 4.10.  Disclosure.  None of the material 
furnished to the Agents and the Banks in connection herewith 
(excluding financial projections and estimates of future 
results) contains, or contained at the time so furnished, any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omits, or omitted at 
the time so furnished, to state any material fact necessary in 
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  All 
financial projections and estimates of future results included 
in such material represented the Borrower's good faith 
estimates, based on assumptions which the Borrower considered 
reasonable, as of the date thereof (it being understood that 
the Borrower does not represent or warrant that such


projections and future results will in fact be realized or 
that such assumptions included all possible assumptions).

                             COVENANTS

     year, setting forth in each case in comparative form 
     the figures for the previous fiscal year, all reported

     accountants of nationally recognized standing;

     Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of such quarter

     statement of income for such quarter and the related 
     consolidated statements of income and cash flows for 
     the portion of the Borrower's fiscal year ended at the 
     end of such quarter, setting forth in each case in 
     comparative form the figures for the corresponding 
     quarter and the corresponding portion of the Borrower's

     are filed with the SEC, all reported on in conformity

          calculations required to establish whether the 
          Borrower was in compliance with any applicable 
          requirements of Sections 5.05, 5.07, 5.08 and 5.09 
          on the date of such financial statements,

              (ii)  stating whether the Borrower was in

             (iii)  stating whether any Default or Potential 
          Cross-Default exists on the date of such 
          certificate and, if any Default or Potential

the Administrative Agent, at the request of any Bank, may 
reasonably request. 

          SECTION 5.02.  Maintenance of Property; Insurance. 
(a)  The Borrower will keep, and will cause each of its 
Subsidiaries to keep, all property useful and necessary in its 
respective business in good working order and condition, 
ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

          (b)  The Borrower will maintain, and will cause each 
of its Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance policies on its 
assets at coverage levels that are at least as high as the 
coverage levels that are usually insured against in the same 
general area by companies of established repute engaged in the 
same or a similar business as the Borrower or such Subsidiary, 
as the case may be; and, upon request of the Documentation 
Agent, will promptly furnish to the Documentation Agent for 
distribution to the Banks information presented in reasonable 
detail as to the insurance so carried. 

          SECTION 5.03.  Restricted Subsidiaries. 

          (a)  The Borrower will notify the Administrative 
Agent, each time that the Borrower delivers financial 
statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), whether or not 
the total assets of the Borrower and all Restricted 
Subsidiaries (excluding any loans or other extensions of 
credit, other than receivables related to trade transactions, 
from any Restricted Subsidiary to any Unrestricted Subsidiary) 
were equal to at least 60% of the total assets of the Borrower


and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date of such 
financial statements (the "Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test"). 

          (b)  If the total assets of the Borrower and all 
Restricted Subsidiaries as so reported did not meet the 
Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test as of such date, the Borrower 
will, on the date such financial statements are delivered to 
the Administrative Agent, designate as Restricted Subsidiaries 
one or more additional Consolidated Subsidiaries which were 
theretofore Unrestricted Subsidiaries having sufficient assets 
as of the date of such financial statements so that the 
Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test as of such date will be met. 

          (c)  Each Consolidated Subsidiary which is a 
Restricted Subsidiary by reason of clause (ii) of the 
definition of "Restricted Subsidiary" (a "Designated 
Subsidiary") shall be a Restricted Subsidiary from the time of 
such designation until (subject to Section 5.03(d)) the 
Borrower subsequently notifies the Administrative Agent, 
concurrently with the delivery of financial statements 
pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), that it is no longer 
necessary to include such Designated Subsidiary as a 
Restricted Subsidiary to meet the Restricted Subsidiary Asset 
Test (measured as of the date of such financial statements), 
at which time such Designated Subsidiary shall become an 
Unrestricted Subsidiary. 

          (d)  The Borrower may from time to time substitute 
one or more

          (i)  Domestic Consolidated Subsidiaries of the 
     Borrower having (x) total assets of $20,000,000 or less 
     and (y) total net worth of $5,000,000 or less or

         (ii)  Foreign Consolidated Subsidiaries

which (in either case) are Unrestricted Subsidiaries for one 
or more Designated Subsidiaries, provided the Restricted 
Subsidiary Asset Test (measured as of the date of the most 
recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 
5.01(a) or (b)) continues to be met, upon which substitution 
such theretofore Designated Subsidiaries shall become 
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 

          SECTION 5.04.  Negative Pledge.  The Borrower will 
not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries 
to, create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Debt 
on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except:



          (a)  any Lien existing on the date of this 
     Agreement securing Debt outstanding on the date of this 
     Agreement in an aggregate principal amount not 
     exceeding $50,000,000;

          (b)  any Lien existing on any asset of any 
     corporation at the time such corporation becomes a 
     Restricted Subsidiary and not created in contemplation 
     of such event;

          (c)  any Lien on any asset securing Debt incurred 
     or assumed for the purpose of financing all or any part 
     of the cost of acquiring such asset, provided that such 
     Lien attaches to such asset concurrently with or within 
     90 days after the acquisition thereof;

          (d)  any Lien on any improvements constructed on 
     any property of the Borrower or any Restricted 
     Subsidiary and any theretofore unimproved real property 
     on which such improvements are located securing Debt 
     incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part 
     of the cost of constructing such improvements, provided 
     that such Lien attaches to such improvements within 90 
     days after the later of (1) completion of construction 
     of such improvements and (2) commencement of full 
     operation of such improvements;

          (e)  any Lien existing on any asset prior to the 
     acquisition thereof by the Borrower or a Restricted 
     Subsidiary and not created in contemplation of such 
     acquisition;

          (f)  Liens on property of the Borrower or a 
     Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United States of 
     America or any State thereof, or any department, agency 
     or instrumentality or political subdivision of the 
     United States of America or any State thereof, or any 
     other government or department, agency, instrumentality 
     or political subdivision thereof, to secure partial, 
     progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any 
     contract or statute or to secure any Debt incurred for 
     the purpose of financing all or any part of the 
     purchase price or the cost of construction of the 
     property subject to such Liens;

          (g)  any Lien arising out of the refinancing, 
     extension, renewal or refunding of any Debt secured by 
     any Lien permitted by any of the foregoing clauses of 
     this Section, but only to the extent that such Debt is 


     not increased and is not secured by any additional 
     assets;

          (h)  Liens securing Debt permitted to be secured 
     under Section 5.05(a)(i); and

          (i)  Liens not otherwise permitted by the 
     foregoing clauses of this Section securing Debt in an 
     aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not 
     to exceed $200,000,000.

          (i)  any Debt owing to the Borrower or another 
     Subsidiary, provided that any such Debt owing to the 
     Borrower is made or issued solely on a senior basis, 
     and provided further that any such Debt owing to a 
     Subsidiary is made or issued solely on a senior, 
     unsecured basis;

Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any 
Debt owing to a Person other than the Borrower or a Subsidiary 
(including Debt referred to in clause (ii) of subsection (a) 
of this Section) if the aggregate outstanding principal amount 
of all such Debt (except Excluded Working Capital Financings) 
of all such Subsidiaries would at any time exceed

     and punctual performance and observance of all of the 
     covenants and agreements of the Borrower contained in 
     this Agreement and the Notes, and

         (ii)  immediately after giving effect to such 
     merger or consolidation, or such sale, lease, transfer 
     or other disposition, no Default or Potential Cross-
     Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

          SECTION 5.07.  Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net

     amount of $100,000,000, 

         (ii)  50% of Consolidated Net Income (calculated 
     before giving effect to any Restructuring Charges 
     deducted pursuant to clause (i) above), for each fiscal

     option of the holder thereof and that the issuer 
     thereof is not required to repurchase at the option of 
     the holder thereof; 

provided that proceeds from the sale of capital stock issued 
pursuant to any employee benefit plan, stock option plan or 
dividend reinvestment plan shall be excluded from any 
determination under this Section 5.07. 



          SECTION 5.08.  Leverage Ratio.  The Leverage Ratio 
will not (i) at any time prior to June 30, 1995 exceed 1.65

          SECTION 5.09.  Interest Coverage Ratio.  At the end 
of any fiscal quarter ending after June 30, 1994, the Interest

buying or carrying any "margin stock" within the meaning of 
Regulation U. 

          SECTION 5.11.  Payments from Domestic Restricted 
Subsidiaries.  The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit 
any Domestic Consolidated Subsidiary that is a Restricted 
Subsidiary to, enter into any agreement which expressly 
prohibits or limits in any manner the ability of such 
Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to declare or 
pay any dividend or other distribution, loan, advance or other 
payment to the Borrower.

     to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent at the 
     request of any Bank;

          (d)  any representation, warranty, certification 
     or statement made (or deemed made) by the Borrower in

          (f)  any event or condition (except a failure to 
     pay or other event or condition covered by clause (e)

     under this clause (f) and (ii) the Administrative Agent 
     shall have given the Borrower written notice of such 
     determination;

          (g)  the Borrower or Material Subsidiaries shall:

     of ERISA) in respect of, or to cause a trustee to be 
     appointed to administer, any Material Plan;

              (iv)  a condition shall exist by reason of

     outstanding shares of common stock of the Borrower; or, 
     during any period of twelve consecutive calendar 
     months, individuals who were directors of the Borrower 
     on the first day of such period shall cease to 
     constitute a majority of the board of directors of the 
     Borrower;

then, and in every such event, the Administrative Agent shall:

          (i)  if requested by Banks having more than 50% in 
     aggregate amount of the Commitments, by notice to the 
     Borrower terminate the Commitments and they shall

                          ARTICLE VII

                   THE AGENTS AND CO-AGENTS

          SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization. Each 
Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes each Agent to take 
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers 
under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to such 
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such 
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

          SECTION 7.02.  Agents and Affiliates.  Morgan 
Guaranty Trust Company of New York and Chemical Bank shall 
each have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as 
any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the 
same as though it were not an Agent, and Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Company of New York and Chemical Bank and their respective 
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and 
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or 
any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not 
an Agent hereunder.

          SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agents.  The obligations of 
each Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth 
herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no 
Agent shall be required to take any action with respect to any 
Default or Potential Cross-Default, except as expressly 
provided in Article VI.

          SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  Any Agent 
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the 
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts 
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or 
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the 
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

          SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agents.  Neither any 
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, or employees 
shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in 
connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of 
the Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross 
negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither any Agent nor any 
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be 
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or


verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in 
connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; 
(ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or 
agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any 
condition specified in Article III, except, in the case of the 
Documentation Agent or the Administrative Agent, receipt of 
items required to be delivered to it; or (iv) the validity, 
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or 
any other instrument or writing furnished in connection 
herewith.  An Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in 
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or 
other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex or similar 
writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the 
proper party or parties.

          SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, 
ratably in accordance with its Commitment, indemnify each 
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against 
any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), 
claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as 
result from such Agent's gross negligence or willful 
misconduct) that such Agent may suffer or incur in connection 
with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such 
Agent hereunder.

          SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank 
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other Bank, and based on 
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, 
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this 
Agreement.  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, 
independently and without reliance upon any Agent, any Co-
Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and 
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue 
to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any 
action under this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agents.  (a)  Any Agent may 
resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice 
thereof to the Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such 
resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to 
appoint a successor Agent which shall be a Bank.  If no 
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required 
Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 
days after the retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, 
then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a 
successor Agent, which shall be a Bank.  Upon the acceptance 
of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, 
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become 
vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent,


and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and 
obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation 
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure 
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken 
by it while it was an Agent.

          (b)  If at any time any Agent shall have assigned 
its rights and obligations in respect of all of its Commitment 
hereunder, such Agent shall resign as Agent in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in subsection (a) of this 
Section 7.08.

          SECTION 7.09.  Distribution of Information.  The 
Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent each agree to 
mail or deliver to each of the Banks so requesting photocopies 
of documents, certificates, financial statements and other 
information received by it from the Borrower pursuant to the 
express provisions of this Agreement and not otherwise 
distributed to the Banks.

          SECTION 7.10.  Co-Agents.  The Co-Agents, in their 
capacities as such, shall have no duties or obligations of any 
kind under this Agreement.


                          ARTICLE VIII

                    CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate 
Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any 
Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Borrowing (other than Money 
Market Absolute Rate Borrowings):

          (a)  the Administrative Agent is advised by the 
     Reference Banks that deposits in Dollars (in the 
     applicable amounts) are not being offered to the 
     Reference Banks in the relevant market for such 
     Interest Period, or

          (b)  in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks 
     having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the 
     Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the 
     Adjusted CD Rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, 
     as the case may be, as determined by the Administrative 
     Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost 
     to such Banks of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar 
     Loans, as the case may be, for such Interest Period,



the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof 
to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the 
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the 
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, 
the obligations of the Banks to make CD Loans or Euro-Dollar 
Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended. Unless the 
Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two 
Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate 
Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been 
given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such 
Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing 
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if 
such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, 
the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall 
bear interest for each day from and including the first day to 
but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable 
thereto at the Base Rate for such day.

          SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  (a) If, after the date 
of this Agreement, the adoption of, or any change in, any 
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the 
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental 
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the 
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any 
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or 
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it 
unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar 
Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar 
Loans and such Bank shall promptly so notify the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith 
give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, 
whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to 
such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank 
to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.

          (b)  Before giving any notice to the Administrative 
Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a 
different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will 
avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the 
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such 
Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully 
continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding 
Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such 
notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then 
outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, 
together with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with


prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall 
borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such 
Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable 
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the 
other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

          SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return. 
(a)  If, after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any 
Committed Loan or any obligation to make Committed Loans or 
(y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of 
any Money Market Loan, the adoption of, or any change in, any 
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the 
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental 
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the 
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any 
Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or 
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency:

          (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable 
     Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with 
     respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note to the extent 
     evidencing Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make 
     Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation 
     of payments to any Bank (or its Applicable Lending 
     Office) of the principal of or interest on its Fixed 
     Rate Loans or any other amounts due under this 
     Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its 
     obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes 
     in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such 
     Bank or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by the 
     jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive 
     office or Applicable Lending Office is located); or

         (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any 
     reserve, special deposit or similar requirement 
     (including, without limitation, any such requirement 
     imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
     Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any CD 
     Loan any such requirement included in an applicable 
     Domestic Reserve Percentage) against assets of, 
     deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended 
     by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or 
     shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending 
     Office) or on the United States market for certificates 
     of deposit or the London interbank market any other 
     condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note to 
     the extent evidencing Fixed Rate Loans or its 
     obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;



and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost 
to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or 
maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of 
any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable 
Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with 
respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be 
material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with 
a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to 
such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate 
such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after 
the date hereof, the adoption of, or any change in, any 
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, 
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof 
by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable 
agency charged with the interpretation or administration 
thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital 
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency has the effect of 
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its 
Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder 
to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could 
have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or 
directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect 
to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be 
material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand 
by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the 
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or 
amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent), without 
duplication, for such reduction.

          (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has 
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle 
such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will 
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such 
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, 
such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, 
be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of 
any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting 
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it 
hereunder, accompanied by a computation thereof in reasonable 
detail, shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  
In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable 
averaging and attribution methods.



          (d)  If any Bank has demanded compensation under 
this Section, the Borrower:

          (i)  shall have the right, with the assistance of 
     the Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent 
     and upon notification to such Bank, to require such 
     Bank to transfer, pursuant to an Assignment and 
     Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of 
     Exhibit H hereto, its Note and Commitment to a 
     substitute bank or banks satisfactory to the Borrower 
     and such Agents (which may be one or more of the Banks) 
     or

         (ii)  may elect to terminate this Agreement as to 
     such Bank, and in connection therewith to prepay any 
     Base Rate Loan made pursuant to Section 8.04, provided 
     that the Borrower (1) notifies the Administrative Agent 
     (which will forthwith notify such Bank) of such 
     election at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days 
     before any date fixed for such a prepayment, and (2) 
     either (x) repays all of such Bank's outstanding Loans 
     at the end of the respective Interest Periods 
     applicable thereto or as otherwise required by Section 
     8.02 or (y) subject to Section 2.12, prepays all of 
     such Bank's outstanding Loans (other than Money Market 
     Loans).  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of 
     such notice, the Commitment of such Bank shall 
     terminate.

          SECTION 8.04.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for 
Affected Fixed Rate Loans.  Subject to Sections 2.10 and 2.12, 
if (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans 
has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank 
has demanded compensation under Section 8.03(a) and the 
Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' 
prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, 
have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply 
to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the 
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension 
or demand for compensation no longer apply:

          (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by 
     such Bank as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case 
     may be, shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on 
     which interest and principal shall be payable 
     contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of 
     the other Banks), and

          (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar 
     Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid, all 


     payments of principal which would otherwise be applied 
     to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to 
     repay its Base Rate Loans instead.


                        ARTICLE IX

                       MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests, 
instructions and other communications to any party hereunder 
shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile 
transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such 
party:  (w) in the case of the Borrower or any Agent, at its 
address, facsimile number or telex number (if any) set forth 
on the signature pages hereof, (x) in the case of any Bank, at 
its address, facsimile number or telex number (if any) set 
forth in its Administrative Questionnaire, (y) in the case of 
any party hereto, such other address, facsimile number or 
telex number as such party may hereafter specify for the 
purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the 
Borrower.  Each such notice, request or other communication 
shall be effective (i) if given by telex, when such telex is 
transmitted to the telex number specified in this Section and 
the appropriate answerback is received, (ii) if given by mail, 
72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails 
with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or 
(iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the 
address specified in this Section; provided that notices to 
the Administrative Agent under Article II or Article VIII and 
notices to the Borrower under Section 6.01(c) or 6.01(f) shall 
not be effective until received.

          SECTION 9.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by 
any Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or 
privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a 
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise 
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the 
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights 
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not 
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Documentary Taxes; 
Indemnification.  (a)  The Borrower shall pay (i) all 
out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents, including reasonable 
fees and disbursements of one special counsel (Davis Polk & 
Wardwell) for the Agents, in connection with the preparation 
of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any 
amendment hereof or any actual or alleged Default or Potential


Cross-Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default 
occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents or 
any Bank, including fees and disbursements of counsel 
(including the cost of staff counsel where used, without 
duplication of work, in lieu of separate special counsel), in 
connection with such Event of Default and collection and other 
enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.  The Borrower 
shall indemnify each Bank against any transfer taxes, 
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any 
governmental authority by reason of the execution and delivery 
of this Agreement or the Notes.

          (b)  The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank and its 
directors, officers and employees for, and hold each Bank and 
its directors, officers and employees harmless from and 
against (i) any and all damages, losses and other liabilities 
of any kind, including, without limitation, judgments and 
costs of settlement, and (ii) any and all reasonable 
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind, including, 
without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel 
(including the cost of staff counsel where used, without 
duplication of work, in lieu of separate special counsel) and 
any other costs of defense, including, without limitation, 
costs of discovery and investigation, for such Bank and its 
officers and directors (all of which shall be paid or 
reimbursed by the Borrower monthly), suffered or incurred in 
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial 
proceeding (whether or not such Bank shall be designated a 
party thereto) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or 
any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; 
provided that no such Bank, director, officer or employee 
shall have any right to be indemnified or held harmless 
hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct 
as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  
The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, in 
its capacity as Agent hereunder, to the same extent that the 
Borrower indemnifies and holds harmless each Bank pursuant to 
this Section.

          SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank 
agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or 
counterclaim or otherwise (except pursuant to Section 
8.03(d)(ii)), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate 
amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Note 
held by it which is greater than the proportion received by 
any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal 
and interest due with respect to any Note held by such other 
Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment


shall purchase such participations in the Notes held by the 
other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may 
be required so that all such payments of principal and 
interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be 
shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that if at any time 
thereafter, the Bank that originally received such payment is 
required to repay (whether to the Borrower or to any other 
Person) all or any portion of such payment, each other Bank 
shall promptly (and in any event within five Domestic Business 
Days of its receipt of notification from such Bank requiring 
such repayment) repay to such Bank the portion of such payment 
previously received by it under this Section 9.04, together 
with such amount (if any) as is equal to the appropriate 
portion of any interest (in respect of the period during which 
such other Bank held such amount) such Bank shall have been 
obligated to pay when repaying such amount as aforesaid, in 
exchange for such participation in the Note of such other Bank 
as was previously purchased by such Bank; provided further 
that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any 
Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may 
have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the 
payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its 
indebtedness under the Notes.

          SECTION 9.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any 
provision of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or 
waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing 
and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if 
the rights or duties of any Agent are affected thereby, by 
such Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, 
unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the 
Commitment of any Bank or subject any Bank to any additional 
obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest 
on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date 
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan 
or any fees hereunder or for the termination of any 
Commitment, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or 
of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the 
number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any 
of them to take any action under this Section or any other 
provision of this Agreement or (v) amend or waive the 
provisions of this Section 9.05. The exercise by the Borrower 
of its right to decrease the Commitments pursuant to Section 
2.09 or to decrease the Commitment of a Bank pursuant to 
Section 8.03(d) shall not be deemed to require the consent of 
any party to this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The 
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure


to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective 
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not 
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this 
Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks.

          (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more 
banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") 
participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its 
Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a 
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon 
notice to the Borrower and the Agents, such Bank shall remain 
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, 
and the Borrower and the Agents shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's 
rights and obligations under this Agreement and such Bank's 
Note.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such 
a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall 
retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the 
obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes 
including, without limitation, the right to approve any 
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 
Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may 
provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, 
amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i) 
(only to the extent such modification, amendment or waiver 
would decrease the Commitment of such Bank), (ii) or (iii) of 
Section 9.05 or to any modification, amendment or waiver that 
would have the effect of increasing the amount of a 
Participant's participation in such Bank's Commitment, in any 
such case without the consent of the Participant.  The 
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent 
provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the 
benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating 
interest, subject to subsection (f) below.  An assignment or 
other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) 
below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement 
only to the extent of a participating interest granted in 
accordance with this subsection (b).

          (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more 
banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a 
proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under 
this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee shall assume 
such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and 
Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit H 
hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, 
with the subscribed consent of the Borrower in consultation


with the Administrative Agent and with the subscribed 
acknowledgment of the Administrative Agent; provided that, 

          (i)   if an Assignee is (x) any Person which 
     controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
     with, or is otherwise substantially affiliated with 
     such transferor Bank or (y) another Bank, no such 
     consent shall be required,

         (ii)  such assignment may, but need not, include 
     rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding 
     Money Market Loans and

        (iii) if the transferor Bank is assigning a 
     proportionate part (but not all) of its rights and 
     obligations under this Agreement and the Notes to an 
     Assignee that was not a Bank party to this Agreement 
     prior to such assignment, the amount so assigned 
     (disregarding Money Market Loans) shall be not less 
     than the amount that would be held at such time 
     (disregarding Money Market Loans) by a Bank having an 
     initial Commitment of $10,000,000.

Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by 
such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to 
the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and 
such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this 
Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a 
Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of 
assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its 
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no 
further consent or action by any party shall be required.  
Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this 
subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent 
and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, 
if required, new Notes are issued to the Assignee and the 
transferor Bank and the original Note is cancelled, and the 
Administrative Agent shall notify the other Agents of such 
assignment.  In connection with any such assignment, the 
transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an 
administrative fee of $2,000 for processing such assignment.  
If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the 
United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior 
to the first date on which interest or fees are payable 
hereunder for its account, deliver to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from 
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income 
taxes in accordance with Section 2.14.



          (d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any 
portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the 
transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

          (e)  The Agents and the Borrower may, for all 
purposes of this Agreement, treat any Bank as the holder of 
any Note drawn to its order (and owner of the Loans evidenced 
thereby) until written notice of assignment or other transfer 
shall have been received by them.

          (f)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of 
any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater 
payment under Section 8.03 than such Bank would have been 
entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, 
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written 
consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03 
requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable 
Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when 
the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not 
exist.

          (g)  If any Reference Bank assigns its Note to an 
unaffiliated institution, the Administrative Agent shall, with 
the consent of the Borrower and the Required Banks, appoint 
another Bank to act as a Reference Bank hereunder.

          SECTION 9.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks 
represents to the Agents and each of the other Banks that it 
in good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as 
defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or 
maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.08.  GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO 
JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH 
NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  THE BORROWER HEREBY SUBMITS TO 
THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT 
COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY NEW 
YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT 
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE BORROWER 
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 
ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING 
OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT 
AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  EACH OF THE 
BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES 
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING


ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

          SECTION 9.09.  Counterparts; Integration.  This 
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of 
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the 
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.  
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and 
understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and 
all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, 
relating to the subject matter hereof.

          SECTION 9.10.  Confidentiality.  In addition to any 
confidentiality requirements under applicable law, each of the 
Agents and each of the Banks (each a "Bank Party" and, 
collectively, the "Bank Parties") agrees that, through and 
including the later of (a) the Termination Date and (b) a date 
three years from the relevant Bank Party's receipt of the 
relevant information, it will take normal and reasonable 
precautions so that

          (i)  all information expressly designated by its 
     provider as confidential provided to any of them by the 
     Borrower, any Person on behalf of the Borrower, or by 
     any other Bank Party on behalf of the Borrower, in 
     connection with this Agreement or the transactions 
     contemplated hereby will be held and treated by each 
     such Bank Party and its respective directors, 
     Affiliates, officers, agents and employees in 
     confidence and

         (ii)  neither it nor any of its respective 
     directors, Affiliates, officers, agents or employees 
     shall, without the prior written consent of the 
     Borrower, use any such information for any purpose or 
     in any manner other than pursuant to the terms of and 
     for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any Bank 
Party may disclose any such information or portions thereof

          (a)  that is or becomes publicly available other 
     than through a breach by such Bank Party of its 
     obligations hereunder;

          (b)  that is also provided to such Bank Party by a 
     Person other than the Borrower not in violation, to the 
     actual knowledge of such Bank Party, of any duty of 
     confidentiality;



          (c)  at the request of any bank regulatory 
     authority or examiner;

          (d)  pursuant to subpoena or other court process;

          (e)  when required by applicable law;

          (f)  at the written request or the express 
     direction of any other authorized government agency;

          (g)  to its independent auditors, counsel and 
     other professional advisors in connection with their 
     provision of professional services to such Bank Party; 
     or

          (h)  to any (i) Participant or (ii) prospective 
     Participant or prospective Bank, if such Participant, 
     prospective Participant or prospective Bank (which 
     prospective Bank is promptly identified to the 
     Borrower), prior to any such disclosure, agrees in 
     writing to keep such information confidential to the 
     same extent required of the Bank Parties hereunder;

provided that any Bank Party's failure to comply with the 
provisions of this Section 9.10 shall not affect the 
obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

          SECTION 9.11.  Severability.  Any provision of this 
Agreement that is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized 
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, 
unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the 
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity, 
enforceability or legality of such provision in any other 
jurisdiction.



          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused 
this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective 
authorized officers as of the day and year first above 
written.

not outstanding at such date) are rated either BBB (or the

          "Level V Pricing" applies on any day if no higher

another Person or if the ratings business of Moody's or S&P is 
acquired by another Person (the entity conducting such ratings 
business after any such merger, consolidation or acquisition 
being herein called the "Successor"), the ratings provided by 
the Successor shall be used for purposes of this Pricing 
Schedule unless and until the Borrower and the Required Banks 
shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent, designate a 
different rating agency to provide such ratings, in which case 
the ratings provided by the rating agency so designated shall 
thereafter replace those provided by the Successor for 
purposes of this Pricing Schedule.

of the Borrower and such other documents, certificates and 
corporate or other records as I have deemed necessary or 
appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.

          In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of 
all signatures (other than signatures on behalf of the 
Borrower), the authenticity of all documents submitted to me 
as originals, the conformity to original documents of all 
documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies 
and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.

          No opinion is expressed herein as to any matters 
involving or governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other 
than the laws of the State of New York, the laws of the State


of Connecticut and the federal laws of the United States of 
America.  Without limiting the foregoing, I express no opinion 
as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction 
(except the States of New York and Connecticut) in which any 
Bank is located which limits the rate of interest that such 
Bank may charge.  I have investigated such questions of law 
and investigated such questions of fact for the purpose of 
rendering the opinions expressed herein as I have deemed 
necessary or appropriate.

          On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and to 
the qualifications set forth below, I am of the opinion that:

          1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly 
     incorporated, validly existing and in good standing 
     under the laws of the State of New York and is duly 
     qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and 
     in good standing under the laws of the State of 
     Connecticut.

          2.  The Borrower has the corporate power and 
     corporate authority to enter into the Credit Agreement 
     and the Notes and to consummate the transactions 
     provided for therein.


          3.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
     Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the 
     consummation by the Borrower of the transactions 
     provided for therein have been duly authorized by all 
     requisite corporate action on the part of the Borrower.

          4.  The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been 
     duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and are 
     valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, 
     enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with 
     their respective terms, except as (i) limited by 
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
     other laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or 
     limiting creditors' rights generally, (ii) limited by 
     equitable principles of general applicability and the 
     discretion of the court before which any proceeding 
     thereafter may be brought in applying such principles 
     and (iii) the enforceability of indemnification against 
     securities law liabilities may be limited by applicable 
     federal and state securities laws and general 
     principles of public policy.  Additionally, I express 
     no opinion as to the validity of the provisions of 
     Section 9.08 of the Agreement providing for a waiver of 
     trial by jury.


          5.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
     Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes will not 
     (i) constitute a violation of any law or regulation of 
     the State of New York or Connecticut or the United 
     States of America which is binding on the Borrower, 
     (ii) violate the certificate of incorporation or 
     by-laws of the Borrower or (iii) result in a breach of, 
     or constitute a default under, or require any consent 
     under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument 
     known to me (such agreements being listed in Schedule 1 
     hereto) evidencing or governing indebtedness for 
     borrowed money of the Borrower.

         6.  No consent or approval of, or action by or 
     filing with, any court or administrative or 
     governmental body which has not been obtained, taken or 
     made is required under the laws of the State of New 
     York or Connecticut or the United States of America for 
     the Borrower to execute and deliver the Credit 
     Agreement and the Notes and to consummate the 
     transactions provided for therein.

         7.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no 
     action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened 
     against or affecting the Borrower or any of its 
     Restricted Subsidiaries, before any court or arbitrator 
     or any governmental body, agency or official in which 
     there is a reasonable likelihood of an adverse decision 
     which could materially adversely affect the present or 
     prospective ability of the Borrower to perform its 
     obligations under the Credit Agreement or any Note or 
     which draws into question the validity of the Credit 
     Agreement or the Notes.

          In giving the opinions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 
2 above, I have relied upon telegraphic or oral confirmations 
as to the existence and good standing of the Borrower.

          This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection 
with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by 
you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person 
(except for deliveries required in accordance with applicable 
law) without my prior written consent.

                                   Very truly yours,



                                                    EXHIBIT F



                             OPINION OF
              DAVIS POLK & WARDWELL, SPECIAL COUNSEL
                           FOR THE AGENTS           


                                  [Effective Date]


To the Banks and the Agents
  Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
  of New York, as Documentation Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260

Dear Sirs:

          We have participated in the preparation of the 
$1,000,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated 
as of November 4, 1994 among Union Carbide Corporation, a New 
York corporation (the "Borrower"), the Banks party thereto, 
the Co-Agents party thereto, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of 
New York, as Documentation Agent, and Chemical Bank, as 
Administrative Agent and Auction Agent, and have acted as 
special counsel for the Agents for the purpose of rendering 
this opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit 
Agreement.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used 
herein as therein defined. 

          We have examined originals or copies, certified or 
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, 
corporate records, certificates of public officials and other 
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of 
fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for 
purposes of this opinion. 

          Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the 
opinion that:

          1.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the 
Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by 
all necessary corporate action. 

          2.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and 
binding agreement of the Borrower and the Notes constitute


valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, in each case 
enforceable in accordance with its terms except as limited by 
(i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' 
rights generally and (ii) equitable principles of general 
applicability. 

          We are members of the Bar of the State of New York 
and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State 
of New York and the federal laws of the United States of 
America.  In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no 
opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any 
jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Bank 
is located which limits the rate of interest that such Bank 
may charge or collect. 

          This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection 
with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by 
you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person 
(except for deliveries required in accordance with applicable 
law) without our prior written consent. 

                             Very truly yours, 



                                                    EXHIBIT G

            ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT



          AGREEMENT dated as of _________, 19__ among 
[ASSIGNOR] (the "Assignor"), [ASSIGNEE] (the "Assignee"), 
UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION (the "Borrower")* and CHEMICAL BANK, 
as the Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). 


                  W I T N E S S E T H


          WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement 
(the "Agreement") relates to the $1,000,000,000 Credit 
Agreement dated as of November 4, 1994 among the Borrower, the 
Assignor and the other Banks party thereto, as Banks, the Co-
Agents party thereto, the Administrative Agent and the other 
Agents (as defined therein) (as the same may be amended from 
time to time, the "Credit Agreement");

          WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement, the 
Assignor has a Commitment to make Committed Loans to the 
Borrower in an aggregate principal amount at any time 
outstanding not to exceed $__________;

          WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by the 
Assignor under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal 
amount of $__________ are outstanding at the date hereof; and

          WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the 
Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit 
Agreement in respect of a portion of its Commitment thereunder 
in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned Amount"), 
together with a corresponding portion of its outstanding 
Committed Loans, and the Assignee proposes to accept 
assignment of such rights and assume the corresponding 
obligations from the Assignor on such terms;




*  If the Borrower's consent to this assignment is not 
required by Section 9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement, 
references to the Borrower as a party hereto and Section 4 
hereof should be deleted.


          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing 
and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto 
agree as follows:

          SECTION 1.  Definitions.  All capitalized terms not 
otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings set 
forth in the Credit Agreement. 

          SECTION 2.  Assignment.  The Assignor hereby assigns 
and sells to the Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor 
under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned 
Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment from 
the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the 
Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the 
Assigned Amount, including the purchase from the Assignor of 
the corresponding portion of the principal amount of the 
Committed Loans made by the Assignor outstanding at the date 
hereof.  Upon the execution and delivery hereof by the 
Assignor, the Assignee, the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent and the payment of the amounts specified in Section 3 
required to be paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee shall, 
as of the date hereof, succeed to the rights and be obligated 
to perform the obligations of a Bank under the Credit 
Agreement with a Commitment in an amount equal to the Assigned 
Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the Assignor shall, as of 
the date hereof, be reduced by a like amount and the Assignor 
released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement to 
the extent such obligations have been assumed by the Assignee.  
The assignment provided for herein shall be without recourse 
to the Assignor. 

          SECTION 3.  Payments.  As consideration for the 
assignment and sale contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the 
Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date hereof in 
Federal funds an amount equal to $_________.**  It is 
understood that commitment and/or facility fees accrued to the 
date hereof are for the account of the Assignor and such fees 
accruing from and including the date hereof with respect to 
the Assigned Amount are for the account of the Assignee.  Each 
of the Assignor and the Assignee hereby agrees that if it 
receives any amount under the Credit Agreement which is for 



**  Amount should combine principal together with accrued 
interest and breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the 
Assignee, net of any portion of any upfront fee to be paid by 
the Assignor to the Assignee.   It may be preferable in an 
appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by 
formula rather than as a fixed sum.  


the account of the other party hereto, it shall receive the 
same for the account of such other party to the extent of such 
other party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same 
to such other party. 

          SECTION 4.  Consent of the Borrower.  This Agreement 
is conditioned upon the consent of the Borrower pursuant to 
Section 9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement.  The execution of 
this Agreement by the Borrower is evidence of this consent.  
Pursuant to Section 9.06(c) the Borrower agrees to execute and 
deliver Notes payable to the order of the Assignee (and, if 
necessary, to the Assignor) to evidence the assignment and 
assumption provided for herein. 

          SECTION 5.  Non-Reliance on Assignor.  The Assignor 
makes no representation or warranty in connection with, and 
shall have no responsibility with respect to, the solvency, 
financial condition, or statements of the Borrower, or the 
validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower 
in respect of the Credit Agreement or any Note.  The Assignee 
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance 
on the Assignor, any other Bank, any Co-Agent or any Agent, 
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed 
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to 
enter into this Agreement and will continue to be responsible 
for making its own independent appraisal of the business, 
affairs and financial condition of the Borrower. 

          SECTION 6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be 
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of New York. 

          SECTION 7.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be 
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be 
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto 
and hereto were upon the same instrument. 

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this 
Agreement to be executed and delivered by their duly 
authorized officers as of the date first above written.

        (iii)  Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if 
it:

          (A)  is not substantially in conformity with 
     Exhibit D hereto or does not specify all of the 
     information required by subsection (d)(ii);

          (B)  contains qualifying, conditional or similar 
     language;

          (C)  proposes terms other than or in addition to 
     those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Money 
     Market Quotes; or

          (D)  arrives after the time set forth in 
     subsection (d)(i).

          (e)  Notice to Borrower.  The Auction Agent shall 
promptly notify the Borrower of the terms:

          (x)  of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank 
     that is in accordance with subsection (d) and

          (y)  of any Money Market Quote that amends, 
     modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous 
     Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect 
     to the same Money Market Quote Request.  Any such 
     subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by 
     the Auction Agent unless such subsequent Money Market 
     Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error 
     in such former Money Market Quote.

The Auction Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify:

          (A)  the aggregate principal amount of Money 
     Market Loans for which offers have been received for 
     each Interest Period specified in the related Money 
     Market Quote Request,

          (B)  the respective principal amounts and Money 
     Market LIBOR Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as 
     the case may be, so offered and



          (C)  if applicable, limitations on the aggregate 
     principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers 
     in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted.

          (f)  Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later 
than:

          (x)  1:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the third 
     Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of 
     Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or

          (y)  10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the 
     proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute 
     Rate Auction

(or, in either case, such other time or date as the Borrower 
and the Auction Agent shall have mutually agreed and the 
Auction Agent shall have notified the Banks not later than the 
date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR 
Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be 
effective), the Borrower shall notify the Auction Agent of its 
acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it 
pursuant to subsection (e) and the Auction Agent shall so 
notify the Administrative Agent.  In the case of acceptance, 
such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall 
specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each 
Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept any 
Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

          (i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Money 
     Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount 
     set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request,

         (ii)  the principal amount of each Money Market 
     Borrowing must be $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of 
     $5,000,000 and the principal amount of each Money 
     Market Loan with respect to such Money Market Borrowing 
     must be in an amount of $5,000,000 or a larger multiple 
     of $1,000,000,

        (iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the 
     basis of ascending Money Market LIBOR Margins or Money 
     Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be,

         (iv)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is 
     described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise 
     fails to comply with the requirements of this 
     Agreement, and



          (v)  failure by the Borrower to notify the Auction 
     Agent by the time specified above shall be deemed a 
     rejection of all offers.

          (g)  Allocation by Borrower.  If offers are made by 
two or more Banks with the same Money Market LIBOR Margins or 
Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater 
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which 
such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the 
principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such 
offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among 
such Banks as nearly as possible in proportion to the aggregate 
principal amounts of such offers (or as nearly in proportion as 
shall be practicable after giving effect to the requirement 
that Money Market Loans for each relevant maturity date shall 
each be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a multiple of 
$1,000,000 in excess thereof).

          SECTION 2.04.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

          (a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the 
contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such 
Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be 
revocable by the Borrower.

          (b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) 
on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein 
shall make the amount of its share of such Borrowing available 
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at 
the office of the Administrative Agent specified in or pursuant 
to Section 9.01 in funds immediately available to the 
Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent 
determines (or, in the case of the first Borrowing, the 
Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent determine) 
that any applicable condition specified in Article III has not 
been satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall make such 
aggregate funds available to the Borrower by depositing as 
promptly as practicable the proceeds thereof, in like funds as 
received by the Administrative Agent, in the account of the 
Borrower with the Administrative Agent on the date of such 
Borrowing.

          (c)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing 
that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative 
Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available 
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in


accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.04 and the 
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, 
make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding 
amount.  If the Administrative Agent does, in such 
circumstances, make available to the Borrower such amount, such 
Bank shall within three Domestic Business Days following such 
Borrowing make such share available to the Administrative 
Agent, together with interest thereon for each day from and 
including the date of such Borrowing that such share was not 
made available, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate.  If such 
amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative 
Agent shall constitute such Bank's share of such Borrowing for 
all purposes of this Agreement.  If such amount is not so made 
available to the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative 
Agent shall on the third Domestic Business Day following such 
Borrowing notify the Borrower of such failure and on the fourth 
Domestic Business Day following the date of such Borrowing, the 
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent such share, 
together with interest thereon for each day that the Borrower 
had the use of such share, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate.  
Nothing contained in this subsection (c) shall relieve any Bank 
which has failed to make available its share of any Borrowing 
hereunder from its obligation to do so in accordance with the 
terms hereof.

          (d)  The failure of any Bank to make available to the 
Administrative Agent its share of any Borrowing on the date of 
such Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its 
obligation, if any, hereunder to make available to the 
Administrative Agent its share of such Borrowing, but no Bank 
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make 
available the share of any Borrowing to be made available by 
such other Bank on such date of Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.05.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank 
shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of 
such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in 
an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of 
such Bank's Loans.

          (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent (to be given not later than two Domestic 
Business Days prior to the first Borrowing), request that its 
Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate Note in 
an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of 
such Loans.  Each such Note shall be in substantially the form 
of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate modifications to reflect 
the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  
Each reference in this Agreement


to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed to refer to and 
include any or all of such Notes, as the context may require.

          (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to 
Section 3.01(b), the Documentation Agent shall mail such Note 
to such Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date, amount and 
maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of 
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect 
thereto, and prior to any transfer of its Note may endorse on 
the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to 
evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such 
Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank to 
make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the 
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes.  Each 
Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to 
endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a 
continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

          SECTION 2.06.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Revolving 
Credit Loan shall mature, and the principal amount thereof 
shall be due and payable, on the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date.  Each Term Loan shall mature, and the principal amount 
thereof shall be due and payable, on the Term Loan Maturity 
Date.  Each Money Market Loan shall mature, and the principal 
amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of the 
Interest Period applicable to such Money Market Loan.

          SECTION 2.07.  Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base Rate 
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made to but 
excluding the date it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to 
the Base Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable 
monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month and, 
with respect to the principal amount of any Base Rate Loan 
converted to a CD Loan or a Euro-Dollar Loan, on the date such 
principal amount is so converted. Any overdue principal of or 
interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on 
demand, for each day from and including the date payment 
thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at 
a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for 
such day.

          (b)  Subject to Section 8.01, each CD Loan shall bear 
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each 
day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate 
per annum equal to the sum of the CD Margin for such day plus 
the applicable Adjusted CD Rate.  Such interest shall be


payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, 
if such Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 
90 days after the first day thereof.  Any overdue principal of 
or interest on any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable on 
demand, for each day from and including the date payment 
thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at 
a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for 
such day.

          "CD Margin" means a rate per annum determined in 
accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

          The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest 
Period means a rate per annum determined pursuant to the 
following formula:

                   [ CDBR       ]*
          ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                   [ 1.00 - DRP ]

          ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
          CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
           DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
            AR  =  Assessment Rate

     __________
     *  The amount in brackets being rounded upwards, if
     necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%

          The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period 
is the rate of interest determined by the Administrative Agent 
to be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next 
higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid at 
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as 
practicable) on the first day of such Interest Period by two or 
more New York certificate of deposit dealers of recognized 
standing for the purchase at face value from each CD Reference 
Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount comparable to 
the principal amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank 
to which such Interest Period applies and having a maturity 
comparable to such Interest Period.

          "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that 
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such 
day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum 
reserve requirement (including without limitation any basic, 
supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the


Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding 
$5,000,000,000 in respect of new non-personal time deposits in 
Dollars in New York City having a maturity comparable to the 
related Interest Period and in an amount of $100,000 or more.  
The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as 
of the effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve 
Percentage.

          "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual 
assessment rate in effect on such day which is payable by a 
member of the Bank Insurance Fund classified as adequately 
capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a 
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within the 
meaning of 12 C.F.R. Section 327.3(e) (or any successor 
provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or any 
successor) for such Corporation's (or such successor's) 
insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the 
United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted 
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in 
the Assessment Rate.

          (c)  Subject to Section 8.01, each Euro-Dollar Loan 
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable 
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the 
Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the applicable London 
Interbank Offered Rate.  Such interest shall be payable for 
each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such 
Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of 
three months after the first day thereof.

          "Euro-Dollar Margin" means a rate per annum 
determined in accordance with the Pricing Schedule.

          The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any 
Interest Period means the average (rounded upward, if 
necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective 
rates per annum at which deposits in Dollars are offered to 
each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank 
market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two 
Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such Interest 
Period in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount 
of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank to 
which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time 
comparable to such Interest Period.

          (d)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any 
Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for 
each day from and including the date payment thereof was due


to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate per 
annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

          (e)  Subject to Section 8.01, each Money Market LIBOR 
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate 
per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank Offered Rate 
for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section 
2.07(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a 
Committed Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money 
Market LIBOR Margin quoted by the Bank making such Loan in 
accordance with Section 2.03.  Each Money Market Absolute Rate 
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount 
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate 
per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the 
Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Interest 
on each Money Market Loan shall be payable for each Interest 
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is 
longer than three months, at intervals of three months after 
the first day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on 
any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, 
for each day from and including the date payment thereof was 
due to but excluding the date of actual payment at a rate per 
annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

          (f)  The Administrative Agent shall determine each 
interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The 
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower 
and the Banks making such Loans by telex, facsimile 
transmission or cable of each rate of interest so determined, 
and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the 
absence of manifest error.

          (g)  Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best 
efforts to furnish quotations to the Administrative Agent as 
contemplated by this Section.  If any Reference Bank does not 
furnish a timely quotation, the Administrative Agent shall 
determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the 
quotation or quotations furnished by the remaining Reference 
Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on a 
timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

          SECTION 2.08.  Facility Fees.  (a)  Revolving Credit 
Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative 
Agent for the account of the Banks ratably in proportion to 
their Commitments a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate


(determined for each day in accordance with the Pricing 
Schedule).  Such facility fee shall accrue:

          (i)  from and including the Effective Date to but 
     excluding the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or 
     earlier date of termination of the Commitments in their 
     entirety), on the daily aggregate amount of the 
     Commitments (whether used or unused), and

         (ii)  from and including the Revolving Credit 
     Termination Date (or such earlier date of termination) 
     to but excluding the date the Revolving Credit Loans 
     shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily 
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving 
     Credit Loans.

          (b)  Term Loan Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay 
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks 
ratably in proportion to the outstanding principal amounts of 
their Term Loans a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate 
(determined for each day in accordance with the Pricing 
Schedule).  Such facility fee shall accrue from and including 
the date on which the Term Loans are borrowed pursuant to 
Section 2.01(b) to but excluding the date the Term Loans shall 
be repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding 
principal amount of the Term Loans.

          (c)  Payments.  Accrued fees under this Section shall 
be payable quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 
and December 31 (in arrears) commencing on December 31, 1994.  
In the case of the facility fee payable with respect to the 
Commitments, such facility fee shall also be payable on the 
date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, 
if later, the date the Revolving Credit Loans shall be repaid 
in their entirety). In the case of the facility fee payable 
with respect to the Term Loans, such facility fee shall also be 
payable on the date the Term Loans shall be repaid in their 
entirety.

          SECTION 2.09.  Optional Termination or Reduction of 
Commitments.  During the Revolving Credit Period, the Borrower 
may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the 
Administrative Agent,

          (i)  terminate the Commitments at any time, if no 
     Loans (other than Term Loans) are outstanding at such 
     time, or

         (ii)  ratably reduce from time to time, by an 
     aggregate amount of at least $25,000,000, the aggregate 


     amount of the Commitments, provided that the aggregate 
     amount of the Commitments may not be reduced below the 
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans 
     (other than Term Loans).

          SECTION 2.10.  Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a)  
The Loans included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear 
interest initially at the type of rate specified by the 
Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Borrowing. 
Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change 
or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of 
Loans (subject in each case to the provisions of Article VIII), 
as follows:

          (i)  if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the 
     Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to CD Loans as 
     of any Domestic Business Day or to Euro-Dollar Loans as 
     of any Euro-Dollar Business Day;

         (ii)  if such Loans are CD Loans, the Borrower may 
     elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or 
     Euro-Dollar Loans or elect to continue such Loans as CD 
     Loans for an additional Interest Period, in each case 
     effective on the last day of the then current Interest 
     Period applicable to such Loans; and

        (iii)  if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the 
     Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate 
     Loans or CD Loans or elect to continue such Loans as 
     Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, in 
     each case effective on the last day of the then current 
     Interest Period applicable to such Loans.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a 
"Notice of Interest Rate Election") to the Administrative Agent 
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third 
Euro-Dollar Business Day before the conversion or continuation 
selected in such notice is to be effective (unless the relevant 
Loans are to be converted from Domestic Loans to Domestic Loans 
of the other type or continued as Domestic Loans of the same 
type for an additional Interest Period, in which case such 
notice shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent not later 
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Domestic Business 
Day next preceding the date the conversion or continuation 
selected in such notice is be effective).  A Notice of Interest 
Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion 
of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of 
Loans; provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably 
among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to 
which such Notice applies, and


the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each 
$25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000.

          (b)  Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall 
specify:

          (i)  the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to 
     which such notice applies;

         (ii)  the date on which the conversion or 
     continuation selected in such notice is to be 
     effective, which shall comply with the applicable 
     clause of subsection (a) above;

        (iii)  if the Loans comprising such Group are to be 
     converted, the new type of Loans and, if such new Loans 
     are Fixed Rate Loans, the duration of the initial 
     Interest Period applicable thereto; and

         (iv)  if such Loans are to be continued as CD Loans 
     or Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, 
     the duration of such additional Interest Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate 
Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition of 
Interest Period.

          (c)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate 
Election from the Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the 
contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be 
revocable by the Borrower.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a 
timely Notice of Interest Rate Election to the Administrative 
Agent for any Group of Fixed Rate Loans, such Loans shall be 
converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then 
current Interest Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.11.  Prepayments.  (a)  The Borrower may, 
upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of prepayment, 
prepay a Group of Base Rate Loans (or any Money Market Loan 
bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01) in 
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts 
aggregating $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, 
by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with 
accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.  



          (b)  Subject to Section 2.13, upon giving notice to 
the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York 
City time) on the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date 
of prepayment (in the case of a Group of CD Loans) or the third 
Euro-Dollar Business Day before the date of prepayment (in the 
case of a Group of Euro-Dollar Loans), the Borrower may prepay 
the Loans comprising such Group of Loans in whole at any time, 
or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating $25,000,000 
or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, by paying the principal 
amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to 
the date of prepayment.  

          (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant 
to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable 
share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not 
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.  Each such optional 
prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the 
several Banks included in the relevant Group of Loans.

          (d)  The Borrower may not prepay the Money Market 
Loans at any time (other than Money Market Loans bearing 
interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01).

          SECTION 2.12.  General Provisions as to Payments. (a)  
The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and 
interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date when due, in 
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, 
to the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or 
pursuant to Section 9.01.  The Administrative Agent will 
promptly distribute to each Bank its share of each such payment 
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the 
Banks.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, 
the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is 
not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall 
be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.  
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the 
Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a 
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be 
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless 
such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, 
in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next 
preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  Whenever any payment of 
principal of, or interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be 
due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date 
for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding 
Euro-Dollar Business Day. 


If the date for any payment of principal is extended by 
operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be 
payable for such extended time.

          (b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have 
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which 
any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower 
will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent 
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to 
the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative 
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be 
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to 
the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that the 
Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall 
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such 
amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, 
for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such 
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the 
Administrative Agent, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate.

          SECTION 2.13.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower makes 
any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan 
(pursuant to Section 2.11, Section 2.18, Article VI, Article 
VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of an 
Interest Period applicable thereto or if any Euro-Dollar Loan 
is converted to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 
8.02(b)(ii) on any day other than the last day of an Interest 
Period applicable thereto or if the Borrower fails to borrow or 
prepay any Fixed Rate Loans after notice of such borrowing or 
prepayment has been given to any Bank in accordance with 
Section 2.04(a) or 2.11(c), the Borrower shall reimburse each 
Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense actually 
incurred by it (or a Participant which has purchased or agreed 
to purchase a participation in the relevant Loan), including 
(without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, 
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but 
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment 
or conversion or failure to borrow or prepay, provided that 
such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a certificate 
containing a computation in reasonable detail of the amount of 
such loss or expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in 
the absence of manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14.  Computation of Interest and Fees. 
Interest based on the Reference Rate hereunder shall be 
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a 
leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed 
(including the first day but excluding the last day).  All
other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a 
year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed 
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

          SECTION 2.15.  Withholding Tax Exemption.  At least 
five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which 
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any 
Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the 
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will 
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue 
Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such 
Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and 
the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States 
federal income taxes.  Each Bank which so delivers a Form 1001 
or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form 
(or a successor form) on or before the date that such form 
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any 
event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered 
by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals 
thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the 
Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is 
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes 
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal 
income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any 
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the 
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required 
which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would 
prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such 
form with respect to it and such Bank promptly advises the 
Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of 
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of 
United States federal income tax.

          SECTION 2.16.  Regulation D Compensation.  (a)  So 
long as Regulation D shall require reserves to be maintained 
against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or against any other 
category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to 
which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or 
any category of extensions of credit or other assets which 
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to 
United States residents), each Bank subject to and actually 
incurring such reserve requirement may require the Borrower to 
pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the 
Euro-Dollar Loans additional interest on the related


Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum (the 
"Regulation D Rate") determined pursuant to the following 
formula:

                    [  LIBOR   ]
            RDR  =  [ -------- ]  -  LIBOR
                    [ 1 - ERR  ]

            RDR  =    Regulation D Rate
          LIBOR  =    The applicable London Interbank
                        Offered Rate
            ERR  =    Eurocurrency Reserve Ratio

          "Eurocurrency Reserve Ratio" means the applicable 
reserve ratio prescribed by Regulation D (as such Regulation 
shall have been amended to the first day of the related 
Interest Period) for such reserve requirements (expressed as a 
decimal).

          Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the 
contrary, the Regulation D Rate shall be adjusted automatically 
on and as of the effective date of any change in such reserve 
ratio.

          (b)  Any Bank wishing to require payment of such 
additional interest:

          (i)  shall so notify the Borrower, in which case 
     such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of 
     such Bank shall be payable on any date interest is 
     payable with respect to each Euro-Dollar Loan 
     commencing after the giving of such notice and

         (ii)  shall notify the Borrower from time to time 
     of the amount due it under this Section;

provided that the Borrower shall not be required to make any 
payment of an amount due hereunder earlier than the fifth 
Euro-Dollar Business Day after receipt of the notice referred 
to in clause (ii) of this Section.

          SECTION 2.17.  Judgment Currency.  If for the purpose 
of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a 
sum due from the Borrower hereunder or under any of the Notes 
in the currency expressed to be payable herein or under the 
Notes (the "specified currency") into another currency, the 
parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may 
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that 
at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the 
Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with 
such other currency at the
Administrative Agent's New York office on the Domestic Business 
Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The 
obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any 
Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note 
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than 
the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that 
on the Domestic Business Day following receipt by such Bank or 
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum 
adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Bank or the 
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance 
with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency 
with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified 
currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to 
such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in 
the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest 
extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation 
and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Bank 
or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such 
loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased 
exceeds:

          (a)  the sum originally due to such Bank or the 
     Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and

          (b)  any amounts shared with other Banks as a 
     result of allocations of such excess as a 
     disproportionate payment to such Bank under Section 
     9.04,

such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, 
agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

          SECTION 2.18.  Replacement of this Credit Facility. 
If the Borrower wishes at any time to replace the credit 
facility provided under this Agreement with another credit 
facility, the Borrower may give prior notice of the termination 
of the Commitments hereunder as required by Section 2.09 and 
prior notice of the prepayment of any Committed Loans 
outstanding hereunder as required by Section 2.11, in each case 
on a conditional basis (i.e., conditioned upon such other 
credit facility becoming available to the Borrower), provided 
that the Borrower gives definitive notice of such termination 
of the Commitments and prepayment of outstanding Committed 
Loans (if any) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 A.M. 
(New York City time) on the date of such termination and 
prepayment (if any) and complies with the applicable 
requirements of Sections 2.09 and 2.11 in all other respects.

          (j)  receipt by the Documentation Agent of all

to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

          (a)  receipt by the Administrative Agent of a 
     Notice of Borrowing as required by Section 2.02 or 
     2.03, as the case may be;

          (b)  immediately after such Borrowing, the

                           ARTICLE IV

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Borrower represents and warrants that:

          SECTION 4.01.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The 
Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing 
and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, 
and has all corporate powers and all material governmental 
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to 
carry on its business as now conducted. 

          SECTION 4.02.  Corporate and Governmental 
Authorization; No Contravention.  The execution, delivery and 
performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and the Notes are 
within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly 
authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action 
by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, 
agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a 
default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or 
of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower 
or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or 
other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its 
Subsidiaries or result in or permit the termination or 
modification of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, 
decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of 
its Subsidiaries or result in the creation or imposition of any 
Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 

          SECTION 4.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement 
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and 
the Notes, when executed and delivered in accordance with this 
Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the 
Borrower. 

          SECTION 4.04.  Financial Information. 

          (a)  The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower 
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 
the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by KPMG Peat 
Marwick, set forth in the Borrower's 1993 annual report to 
stockholders, copies of which have been delivered to each of 
the Banks, fairly present, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles, the consolidated financial 
position of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as


of such date and their consolidated results of operations and 
cash flows for such fiscal year. 

          (b)  The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the 
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and 
cash flows for the six months then ended, copies of which have 
been delivered to each of the Banks, fairly present, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
applied on a basis consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements referred to in subsection (a) of this Section, the 
consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its 
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their 
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such six 
month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments). 

          (c)  Since June 30, 1994 there has been no change in 
the business, financial position, results of operations or 
prospects of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, 
which could materially adversely affect the present or 
prospective ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations 
under this Agreement or any Note or which in any manner draws 
into question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement 
or any Note. 

          SECTION 4.05.  Litigation.  There is no action, suit 
or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the 
Borrower threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any 
of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any 
governmental body, agency or official in which there is a 
reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could 
materially adversely affect the present or prospective ability 
of the Borrower to perform its obligations under this Agreement 
or any Note or which in any manner draws into question the 
validity of this Agreement or the Notes. 

          SECTION 4.06.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member of 
the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum 
funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with 
respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all material 
respects with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and 
the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan.  No member 
of the ERISA Group has:

          (i)  sought a waiver of the minimum funding 
     standard under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code 
     in respect of any Plan,



         (ii)  failed to make any contribution or payment to 
     any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any 
     Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan 
     or Benefit Arrangement, which has resulted or could 
     result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a 
     bond or other security under ERISA or the Internal 
     Revenue Code or

        (iii)  incurred any liability under Title IV of 
     ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums 
     under Section 4007 of ERISA and aggregate withdrawal 
     liabilities not in excess of $5,000,000 at any one time 
     outstanding. 

          SECTION 4.07.  Environmental Matters.  In the 
ordinary course of its business, the Borrower conducts reviews 
of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations 
and properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the 
course of which it identifies and evaluates associated 
liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, related 
United States environmental protection operating expenses, 
which include operating costs of pollution control facilities 
and certain environmental accruals and administrative expenses, 
and capital expenditures for the current fiscal year and 
related amounts projected for capital expenditures up to five 
years subsequent to such current fiscal year, expressed in 
then-current dollar amounts).  On the basis of this review, the 
Borrower has reasonably concluded that Environmental Laws are 
unlikely to have an effect on the business, financial 
condition, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower 
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries during the term of this 
Agreement, which could materially adversely affect the present 
or prospective ability of the Borrower to perform its 
obligations under this Agreement or any Note. 

          SECTION 4.08.  Restricted Subsidiaries.  Each 
corporate Restricted Subsidiary is a corporation duly 
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the 
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all 
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, 
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its 
business as now conducted. 

          SECTION 4.09.  Not an Investment Company.  The 
Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning of 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

          SECTION 4.10.  Disclosure.  None of the material 
furnished to the Agents and the Banks in connection herewith


(excluding financial projections and estimates of future 
results) contains, or contained at the time so furnished, any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omits, or omitted at the 
time so furnished, to state any material fact necessary in 
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  All 
financial projections and estimates of future results included 
in such material represented the Borrower's good faith 
estimates, based on assumptions which the Borrower considered 
reasonable, as of the date thereof (it being understood that 
the Borrower does not represent or warrant that such 
projections and future results will in fact be realized or that 
such assumptions included all possible assumptions).


                           ARTICLE V

                           COVENANTS

          The Borrower agrees that, so long as any Bank has any 
Commitment hereunder or any amount payable under any Note 
remains unpaid:

          SECTION 5.01.  Information.  The Borrower will 
deliver to each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent:

          (a)  as promptly as practicable and in any event 
     within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of 
     the Borrower, a consolidated balance sheet of the 
     Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the 
     end of such fiscal year and the related consolidated 
     statements of income and cash flows for such fiscal 
     year, setting forth in each case in comparative form 
     the figures for the previous fiscal year, all reported 
     on in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
     principles (and in a manner acceptable to the SEC) by 
     KPMG Peat Marwick or other independent public 
     accountants of nationally recognized standing;

          (b)  as promptly as practicable and in any event 
     within 60 days after the end of each of the first three 
     quarters of each fiscal year of the Borrower, a 
     consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its 
     Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of such quarter 
     and comparative financial information as of the end of 
     the previous fiscal year, the related consolidated 
     statement of income for such quarter and the related 
     consolidated statements of income and cash flows for 
     the portion of the Borrower's fiscal year ended at the 
     end of such quarter, setting forth in each case in 
     comparative form the figures for the corresponding 
     quarter and the corresponding portion of the Borrower's 
     previous fiscal year, all certified (subject to normal 
     year-end adjustments) as to fairness of presentation,
     generally accepted accounting principles and 
     consistency by the principal financial officer, the 
     principal accounting officer or the Treasurer of the 
     Borrower or a person designated in writing by any of 
     the foregoing persons, and if such financial statements 
     are filed with the SEC, all reported on in conformity 
     with the financial reporting requirements of the SEC;

          (c)  simultaneously with the delivery of each set 
     of financial statements referred to in clauses (a) and 
     (b) above, a certificate of the principal financial 
     officer, the principal accounting officer or the 
     Treasurer of the Borrower, or a person designated in 
     writing by any of the foregoing persons

               (i)  setting forth in reasonable detail the 
          calculations required to establish whether the 
          Borrower was in compliance with any applicable 
          requirements of Sections 5.05, 5.07, 5.08 and 5.09 
          on the date of such financial statements,

              (ii)  stating whether the Borrower was in 
          compliance with the requirements of Sections 5.02 
          through 5.04, inclusive, on the date of such 
          financial statements, and

            (iii)  stating whether any Default or Potential 
          Cross-Default exists on the date of such

          SECTION 5.02.  Maintenance of Property; Insurance. 
(a)  The Borrower will keep, and will cause each of its 
Subsidiaries to keep, all property useful and necessary in its

ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

          (b)  The Borrower will maintain, and will cause each 
of its Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance policies on its 
assets at coverage levels that are at least as high as the 
coverage levels that are usually insured against in the same 
general area by companies of established repute engaged in the 
same or a similar business as the Borrower or such Subsidiary, 
as the case may be; and, upon request of the Documentation 
Agent, will promptly furnish to the Documentation Agent for
distribution to the Banks information presented in reasonable 
detail as to the insurance so carried. 

          SECTION 5.03.  Restricted Subsidiaries. 

          (a)  The Borrower will notify the Administrative 
Agent, each time that the Borrower delivers financial 
statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), whether or not 
the total assets of the Borrower and all Restricted 
Subsidiaries (excluding any loans or other extensions of 
credit, other than receivables related to trade transactions, 
from any Restricted Subsidiary to any Unrestricted Subsidiary) 
were equal to at least 60% of the total assets of the Borrower 
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date of such 
financial statements (the "Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test"). 

          (b)  If the total assets of the Borrower and all 
Restricted Subsidiaries as so reported did not meet the 
Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test as of such date, the Borrower 
will, on the date such financial statements are delivered to 
the Administrative Agent, designate as Restricted Subsidiaries 
one or more additional Consolidated Subsidiaries which were 
theretofore Unrestricted Subsidiaries having sufficient assets 
as of the date of such financial statements so that the 
Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test as of such date will be met. 

          (c)  Each Consolidated Subsidiary which is a 
Restricted Subsidiary by reason of clause (ii) of the 
definition of "Restricted Subsidiary" (a "Designated 
Subsidiary") shall be a Restricted Subsidiary from the time of 
such designation until (subject to Section 5.03(d)) the 
Borrower subsequently notifies the Administrative Agent, 
concurrently with the delivery of financial statements pursuant 
to Section 5.01(a) or (b), that it is no longer necessary to 
include such Designated Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary 
to meet the Restricted Subsidiary Asset Test (measured as of 
the date of such financial statements), at which time such 
Designated Subsidiary shall become an Unrestricted Subsidiary. 

          (d)  The Borrower may from time to time substitute 
one or more

          (i)  Domestic Consolidated Subsidiaries of the 
     Borrower having (x) total assets of $20,000,000 or less 
     and (y) total net worth of $5,000,000 or less or

         (ii)  Foreign Consolidated Subsidiaries
which (in either case) are Unrestricted Subsidiaries for one or 
more Designated Subsidiaries, provided the Restricted 
Subsidiary Asset Test (measured as of the date of the most 
recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 
5.01(a) or (b)) continues to be met, upon which substitution 
such theretofore Designated Subsidiaries shall become 
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 

          SECTION 5.04.  Negative Pledge.  The Borrower will 
not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, 
create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Debt on any 
asset now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except:

          (a)  any Lien existing on the date of this 
     Agreement securing Debt outstanding on the date of this 
     Agreement in an aggregate principal amount not 
     exceeding $50,000,000;

          (b)  any Lien existing on any asset of any 
     corporation at the time such corporation becomes a 
     Restricted Subsidiary and not created in contemplation 
     of such event;

          (c)  any Lien on any asset securing Debt incurred 
     or assumed for the purpose of financing all or any part 
     of the cost of acquiring such asset, provided that such 
     Lien attaches to such asset concurrently with or within 
     90 days after the acquisition thereof;

          (d)  any Lien on any improvements constructed on 
     any property of the Borrower or any Restricted 
     Subsidiary and any theretofore unimproved real property 
     on which such improvements are located securing Debt 
     incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part 
     of the cost of constructing such improvements, provided 
     that such Lien attaches to such improvements within 90 
     days after the later of (1) completion of construction 
     of such improvements and (2) commencement of full 
     operation of such improvements;

          (e)  any Lien existing on any asset prior to the 
     acquisition thereof by the Borrower or a Restricted 
     Subsidiary and not created in contemplation of such 
     acquisition;

          (f)  Liens on property of the Borrower or a 
     Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United States of 
     America or any State thereof, or any department, agency 
     or instrumentality or political subdivision of the 
     United States of America or any State thereof, or any 
     other government or department, agency, instrumentality 
     or political subdivision thereof, to secure partial, 
     progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any 
     contract or statute or to secure any Debt incurred for 
     the purpose of financing all or any part of the 
     purchase price or the cost of construction of the 
     property subject to such Liens;

     extension, renewal or refunding of any Debt secured by

     not increased and is not secured by any additional 
     assets;

     under Section 5.05(a)(i); and

     Subsidiary, provided that any such Debt owing to the 
     Borrower is made or issued solely on a senior basis,

     Subsidiary is made or issued solely on a senior, 
     unsecured basis;

Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any 
Debt owing to a Person other than the Borrower or a Subsidiary 
(including Debt referred to in clause (ii) of subsection (a) of 
this Section) if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 
all such Debt (except Excluded Working Capital Financings) of 
all such Subsidiaries would at any time exceed $800,000,000.

Subsidiaries.  The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any 
Domestic Consolidated Subsidiary that is a Restricted

          SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agents.  The obligations of 
each Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent 
shall be required to take any action with respect to any 
Default or Potential Cross-Default, except as expressly 
provided in Article VI.

          SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  Any Agent 
may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the 
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts 
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or


omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the 
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

          SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agents.  Neither any 
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, or employees 
shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in 
connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of 
the Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross 
negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither any Agent nor any of 
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be 
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or 
verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in 
connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) 
the performance or observance of any of the covenants or 
agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any 
condition specified in Article III, except, in the case of the 
Documentation Agent or the Administrative Agent, receipt of 
items required to be delivered to it; or (iv) the validity, 
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or 
any other instrument or writing furnished in connection 
herewith.  An Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in 
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or 
other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex or similar 
writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the 
proper party or parties.

          SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, 
ratably in accordance with its Commitment, indemnify each Agent 
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any 
cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), 
claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result 
from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that 
such Agent may suffer or incur in connection with this 
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such Agent 
hereunder.

          SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank 
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other Bank, and based on 
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, 
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this 
Agreement.  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, 
independently and without reliance upon any Agent, any Co-Agent 
or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information 
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its 
own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under 
this Agreement.



          SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agents.  (a)  Any Agent may 
resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written notice 
thereof to the Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such 
resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint 
a successor Agent which shall be a Bank.  If no successor Agent 
shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks, and shall 
have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the 
retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, then the retiring 
Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, 
which shall be a Bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment 
as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent 
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the 
rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent 
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the 
provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any 
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an 
Agent.

          (b)  If at any time any Agent shall have assigned its 
rights and obligations in respect of all of its Commitment 
hereunder, such Agent shall resign as Agent in accordance with 
the procedures set forth in subsection (a) of this 
Section 7.08.

          SECTION 7.09.  Distribution of Information.  The 
Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent each agree to 
mail or deliver to each of the Banks so requesting photocopies 
of documents, certificates, financial statements and other 
information received by it from the Borrower pursuant to the 
express provisions of this Agreement and not otherwise 
distributed to the Banks.

          SECTION 7.10.  Co-Agents.  The Co-Agents, in their 
capacities as such, shall have no duties or obligations of any 
kind under this Agreement.


                            ARTICLE VIII

                       CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate 
Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any 
Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Loan (other than Money 
Market Absolute Rate Loans):

          (a)  the Administrative Agent is advised by the 
     Reference Banks that deposits in Dollars (in the 


     applicable amounts) are not being offered to the 
     Reference Banks in the relevant market for such 
     Interest Period, or

          (b)  in the case of CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, 
     Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of the 
     affected Loans advise the Administrative Agent that the 
     Adjusted CD Rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, 
     as the case may be, as determined by the Administrative 
     Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost 
     to such Banks of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar 
     Loans, as the case may be, for such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to 
the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative 
Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise 
to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the 
Banks to make CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may 
be, or to convert outstanding Loans into CD Loans or Euro-
Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended and (ii) 
each outstanding CD Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, as the case may 
be, shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of 
the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.  Unless 
the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two 
Domestic Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate 
Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been 
given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such 
Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing 
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such 
Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, the 
Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear 
interest for each day from and including the first day to but 
excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable 
thereto at the Base Rate for such day.

          SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  (a) If, after the date of 
this Agreement, the adoption of, or any change in, any 
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the 
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental 
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the 
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any 
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or 
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it 
unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending 
Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and 
such Bank shall promptly so notify the


Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith 
give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, 
whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the 
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such 
suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make 
Euro-Dollar Loans, or to convert outstanding Loans into 
Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended.

          (b)  Before giving any notice to the Administrative 
Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a 
different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will 
avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the 
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such 
Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully 
continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding 
Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such 
notice, each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank then outstanding 
shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last 
day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such 
Euro-Dollar Loan if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain 
and fund such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Bank 
shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain 
and fund such Loan to such day.

          SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a)  
If, after (x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed 
Loan or any obligation to make Committed Loans or (y) the date 
of the related Money Market Quote, in the case of any Money 
Market Loan, the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable 
law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or 
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central 
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or 
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its 
Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive 
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, 
central bank or comparable agency:

          (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable 
     Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with 
     respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note to the extent 
     evidencing Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make 
     Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation 
     of payments to any Bank (or its Applicable Lending 
     Office) of the principal of or interest on its Fixed 
     Rate Loans or any other amounts due under this 
     Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its 
     obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes 
     in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such 


     Bank or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by the 
     jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive 
     office or Applicable Lending Office is located); or

         (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any 
     reserve, special deposit or similar requirement 
     (including, without limitation, any such requirement 
     imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
     Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any CD 
     Loan any such requirement included in an applicable 
     Domestic Reserve Percentage) against assets of, 
     deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended 
     by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or 
     shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending 
     Office) or on the United States market for certificates 
     of deposit or the London interbank market any other 
     condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note to 
     the extent evidencing Fixed Rate Loans or its 
     obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost 
to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or 
maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any 
sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable 
Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with 
respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be 
material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with 
a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to 
such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate 
such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after 
the date hereof, the adoption of, or any change in, any 
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, 
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof 
by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable 
agency charged with the interpretation or administration 
thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy 
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, 
central bank or comparable agency has the effect of reducing 
the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a 
consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level 
below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved 
but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking 
into consideration its policies with respect to capital 
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then 
from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank 
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the


Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or 
amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent), without 
duplication, for such reduction.  Any determination by any such 
authority, central bank or comparable agency that, for purposes 
of capital adequacy requirements, the Commitments hereunder do 
not constitute commitments with an original maturity of one 
year or less, shall be deemed a change in the interpretation 
and administration of such requirements for purposes of this 
subsection (b), and the additional amount or amounts payable by 
the Borrower to each Bank under this subsection (b) as a result 
thereof shall be calculated, with respect to the relevant 
unused portion of such Bank's Commitment for the relevant 
period, at the rate of 0.05% per annum.

          (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has 
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle 
such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will 
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such 
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, 
such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, 
be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of 
any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting 
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it 
hereunder, accompanied by a computation thereof in reasonable 
detail, shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  
In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable 
averaging and attribution methods.

          (d)  If any Bank has demanded compensation under this 
Section, the Borrower:

          (i)  shall have the right, with the assistance of 
     the Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent 
     and upon notification to such Bank, to require such 
     Bank to transfer, pursuant to an Assignment and 
     Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of 
     Exhibit H hereto, its Note and Commitment to a 
     substitute bank or banks satisfactory to the Borrower 
     and such Agents (which may be one or more of the Banks) 
     or

         (ii)  may elect to terminate this Agreement as to 
     such Bank, and in connection therewith to prepay any 
     Base Rate Loan made pursuant to Section 8.04, provided 
     that the Borrower (1) notifies the Administrative Agent 
     (which will forthwith notify such Bank) of such 
     election at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days 


     before any date fixed for such a prepayment, and (2) 
     either (x) repays all of such Bank's outstanding Loans 
     at the end of the respective Interest Periods 
     applicable thereto or as otherwise required by Section 
     8.02 or (y) subject to Section 2.13, prepays all of 
     such Bank's outstanding Loans (other than Money Market 
     Loans).  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of 
     such notice, the Commitment of such Bank shall 
     terminate.

          SECTION 8.04.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for 
Affected Fixed Rate Loans.  Subject to Sections 2.11 and 2.13, 
if (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has 
been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has 
demanded compensation under Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower 
shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice 
to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected 
that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, 
then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the 
circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for 
compensation no longer apply:

          (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by 
     such Bank as (or continued as or converted into) CD 
     Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall 
     instead be made as or converted into Base Rate Loans 
     (on which interest and principal shall be payable 
     contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of 
     the other Banks), and

          (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar 
     Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid (or 
     converted to a Base Rate Loan), all payments of 
     principal which would otherwise be applied to repay 
     such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its 
     Base Rate Loans instead.

If such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances 
giving rise to such notice no longer apply, the principal 
amount of each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a CD 
Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, as the case may be, on the first day 
of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the 
related CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks.




                        ARTICLE IX

                       MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests, 
instructions and other communications to any party hereunder 
shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile 
transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such 
party:  (w) in the case of the Borrower or any Agent, at its 
address, facsimile number or telex number (if any) set forth on 
the signature pages hereof, (x) in the case of any Bank, at its 
address, facsimile number or telex number (if any) set forth in 
its Administrative Questionnaire, (y) in the case of any party 
hereto, such other address, facsimile number or telex number as 
such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to 
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  Each such notice, 
request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given 
by telex, when such telex is transmitted to the telex number 
specified in this Section and the appropriate answerback is 
received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such 
communication is deposited in the mails with first class 
postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by 
any other means, when delivered at the address specified in 
this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent 
under Article II or Article VIII and notices to the Borrower 
under Section 6.01(c) or 6.01(f) shall not be effective until 
received.

          SECTION 9.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by 
any Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or 
privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver 
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise 
of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and 
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive 
of any rights or remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Documentary Taxes; 
Indemnification.  (a)  The Borrower shall pay (i) all 
out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents, including reasonable fees 
and disbursements of one special counsel (Davis Polk & 
Wardwell) for the Agents, in connection with the preparation of 
this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any 
amendment hereof or any actual or alleged Default or Potential 
Cross-Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, 
all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents or any Bank, 
including fees and disbursements of counsel (including the cost 
of staff counsel where used, without duplication of work, in 
lieu of separate special counsel), in


connection with such Event of Default and collection and other 
enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.  The Borrower 
shall indemnify each Bank against any transfer taxes, 
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any 
governmental authority by reason of the execution and delivery 
of this Agreement or the Notes.

          (b)  The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank and its 
directors, officers and employees for, and hold each Bank and 
its directors, officers and employees harmless from and against 
(i) any and all damages, losses and other liabilities of any 
kind, including, without limitation, judgments and costs of 
settlement, and (ii) any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs 
and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, fees 
and disbursements of counsel (including the cost of staff 
counsel where used, without duplication of work, in lieu of 
separate special counsel) and any other costs of defense, 
including, without limitation, costs of discovery and 
investigation, for such Bank and its officers and directors 
(all of which shall be paid or reimbursed by the Borrower 
monthly), suffered or incurred in connection with any 
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether 
or not such Bank shall be designated a party thereto) relating 
to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed 
use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no such Bank, 
director, officer or employee shall have any right to be 
indemnified or held harmless hereunder for its own gross 
negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a 
court of competent jurisdiction.  The Borrower shall indemnify 
and hold harmless each Agent, in its capacity as Agent 
hereunder, to the same extent that the Borrower indemnifies and 
holds harmless each Bank pursuant to this Section.

          SECTION 9.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank agrees 
that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or 
counterclaim or otherwise (except pursuant to Section 
8.03(d)(ii)), receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate 
amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Note 
held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any 
other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and 
interest due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank, 
the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall 
purchase such participations in the Notes held by the other 
Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be 
required so that all such payments of principal and interest 
with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by 
the Banks pro rata; provided that if at any time


thereafter, the Bank that originally received such payment is 
required to repay (whether to the Borrower or to any other 
Person) all or any portion of such payment, each other Bank 
shall promptly (and in any event within five Domestic Business 
Days of its receipt of notification from such Bank requiring 
such repayment) repay to such Bank the portion of such payment 
previously received by it under this Section 9.04, together 
with such amount (if any) as is equal to the appropriate 
portion of any interest (in respect of the period during which 
such other Bank held such amount) such Bank shall have been 
obligated to pay when repaying such amount as aforesaid, in 
exchange for such participation in the Note of such other Bank 
as was previously purchased by such Bank; provided further that 
nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to 
exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and 
to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of 
indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness under 
the Notes.

          SECTION 9.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any provision 
of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but 
only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed 
by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or 
duties of any Agent are affected thereby, by such Agent); 
provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed 
by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of 
any Bank or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) 
reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any 
fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment 
of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder 
or for any reduction or termination of any Commitment, (iv) 
change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate 
unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, 
which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take 
any action under this Section or any other provision of this 
Agreement or (v) amend or waive the provisions of this Section 
9.05.  Neither a pro rata reduction of the Commitments pursuant 
to Section 2.01(a) nor any exercise by the Borrower of its 
right to decrease the Commitments pro rata pursuant to Section 
2.09 or to decrease the Commitment of a Bank pursuant to 
Section 8.03(d) shall require the consent of any party to this 
Agreement.

          SECTION 9.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The 
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to 
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective 
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign 
or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement 
without the prior written consent of all Banks.



          (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more 
banks or other institutions (each a "Participant") 
participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its 
Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a 
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon 
notice to the Borrower and the Agents, such Bank shall remain 
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, 
and the Borrower and the Agents shall continue to deal solely 
and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's 
rights and obligations under this Agreement and such Bank's 
Note.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such 
a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall 
retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the 
obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes 
including, without limitation, the right to approve any 
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this 
Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may 
provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, 
amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i) 
(only to the extent such modification, amendment or waiver 
would decrease the Commitment of such Bank), (ii) or (iii) of 
Section 9.05 or to any modification, amendment or waiver that 
would have the effect of increasing the amount of a 
Participant's participation in such Bank's Commitment, in any 
such case without the consent of the Participant.  The Borrower 
agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in 
its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of 
Article VIII with respect to its participating interest, 
subject to subsection (f) below.  An assignment or other 
transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below 
shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to 
the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance 
with this subsection (b).

          (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more 
banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a 
proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under 
this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee shall assume 
such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and 
Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit H 
hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with 
the subscribed consent of the Borrower in consultation with the 
Administrative Agent and with the subscribed acknowledgment of 
the Administrative Agent; provided that, 

          (i)  if an Assignee is (x) any Person which 
     controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
     with, or is otherwise substantially affiliated with 


     such transferor Bank or (y) another Bank, no such 
     consent shall be required,

         (ii)  such assignment may, but need not, include 
     rights of the transferor Bank in respect of outstanding 
     Money Market Loans and

        (iii)  if the transferor Bank is assigning a 
     proportionate part (but not all) of its rights and 
     obligations under this Agreement and the Notes to an 
     Assignee that was not a Bank party to this Agreement 
     prior to such assignment, the amount so assigned 
     (disregarding Money Market Loans) shall be not less 
     than the amount that would be held at such time 
     (disregarding Money Market Loans) by a Bank having an 
     initial Commitment of $10,000,000.

Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by 
such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the 
purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such 
Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement 
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a 
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and 
the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations 
hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or 
action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation 
of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the 
transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower 
shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new 
Notes are issued to the Assignee and the transferor Bank and 
the original Note is cancelled, and the Administrative Agent 
shall notify the other Agents of such assignment.  In 
connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall 
pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee of $2,000 
for processing such assignment.  If the Assignee is not 
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or 
a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which 
interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver 
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as 
to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States 
federal income taxes in accordance with Section 2.15.

          (d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any 
portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a 
Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the 
transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.



          (e)  The Agents and the Borrower may, for all 
purposes of this Agreement, treat any Bank as the holder of any 
Note drawn to its order (and owner of the Loans evidenced 
thereby) until written notice of assignment or other transfer 
shall have been received by them.

          (f)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of 
any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater 
payment under Section 8.03 than such Bank would have been 
entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, 
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written 
consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03 
requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending 
Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the 
circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not 
exist.

          (g)  If any Reference Bank assigns its Note to an 
unaffiliated institution, the Administrative Agent shall, with 
the consent of the Borrower and the Required Banks, appoint 
another Bank to act as a Reference Bank hereunder.

          SECTION 9.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks 
represents to the Agents and each of the other Banks that it in 
good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined 
in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance 
of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.08.  GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO 
JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH 
NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  THE BORROWER HEREBY SUBMITS TO 
THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT 
COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY NEW YORK 
STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY 
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION 
WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE 
OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM 
THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN 
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE 
AGENTS AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL 
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE TRANSACTIONS 
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

          SECTION 9.09.  Counterparts; Integration.  This 
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of


which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the 
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.  
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and 
understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and 
all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, 
relating to the subject matter hereof.

          SECTION 9.10.  Confidentiality.  In addition to any 
confidentiality requirements under applicable law, each of the 
Agents and each of the Banks (each a "Bank Party" and, 
collectively, the "Bank Parties") agrees that, through and 
including the latest of (a) the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, (b) the Term Loan Maturity Date and (c) a date three 
years from the relevant Bank Party's receipt of the relevant 
information, it will take normal and reasonable precautions so 
that

          (i)  all information expressly designated by its 
     provider as confidential provided to any of them by the 
     Borrower, any Person on behalf of the Borrower, or by 
     any other Bank Party on behalf of the Borrower, in 
     connection with this Agreement or the transactions 
     contemplated hereby will be held and treated by each 
     such Bank Party and its respective directors, 
     Affiliates, officers, agents and employees in 
     confidence and

         (ii)  neither it nor any of its respective 
     directors, Affiliates, officers, agents or employees 
     shall, without the prior written consent of the 
     Borrower, use any such information for any purpose or 
     in any manner other than pursuant to the terms of and 
     for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any Bank 
Party may disclose any such information or portions thereof

          (a)  that is or becomes publicly available other 
     than through a breach by such Bank Party of its 
     obligations hereunder;

          (b)  that is also provided to such Bank Party by a 
     Person other than the Borrower not in violation, to the 
     actual knowledge of such Bank Party, of any duty of 
     confidentiality;

          (c)  at the request of any bank regulatory 
     authority or examiner;

          (d)  pursuant to subpoena or other court process;



          (e)  when required by applicable law;

          (f)  at the written request or the express 
     direction of any other authorized government agency;

          (g)  to its independent auditors, counsel and 
     other professional advisors in connection with their 
     provision of professional services to such Bank Party; 
     or

          (h)  to any (i) Participant or (ii) prospective 
     Participant or prospective Bank, if such Participant, 
     prospective Participant or prospective Bank (which 
     prospective Bank is promptly identified to the 
     Borrower), prior to any such disclosure, agrees in 
     writing to keep such information confidential to the 
     same extent required of the Bank Parties hereunder;

provided that any Bank Party's failure to comply with the 
provisions of this Section 9.10 shall not affect the 
obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

          SECTION 9.11.  Severability.  Any provision of this 
Agreement that is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized 
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability 
or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining 
provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or 
legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction.



          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused 
this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective 
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

                    PRICING SCHEDULE



          The "Euro-Dollar Margin", "CD Margin" and "Facility Fee 
Rate" for any day are the respective rates per annum set forth 
below in the applicable row under the column corresponding to the 
Pricing Level that applies on such day; provided that the 
Euro-Dollar Margins and CD Margins applicable to Term Loans shall 
be the applicable rate per annum set forth below plus 0.0625% if 
the Borrower selects a one-year maturity for the Term Loans or 
0.1250% if the Borrower selects a two-year maturity for the Term 
Loans:


             Status        Level I    Level II   Level III

       Euro-Dollar Margin  0.3250%    0.3250%    0.4000%

       CD Margin           0.4500%    0.4500%    0.5250%

       Facility Fee Rate   0.1000%    0.1250%    0.1750%


          For purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have 
the following meanings:

          "Level I Pricing" applies on any day if on such day the 
Borrower's long-term debt securities (whether or not outstanding 
at such date) are rated BBB or higher (or the equivalent) by S&P 
and Baa2 or higher (or the equivalent) by Moody's.

          "Level II Pricing" applies on any day if on such day 
(i) the Borrower's long-term debt securities (whether or not 
outstanding at such date) are rated either BBB or higher (or the 
equivalent) by S&P or Baa2 or higher (or the equivalent) by 
Moody's and (ii) Level I Pricing does not apply.

          "Level III Pricing" applies on any day if no higher 
Pricing Level applies on such day.

          "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a 
Delaware corporation.

          "Pricing Level" refers to the determination of which of 
Level I Pricing, Level II Pricing or Level III Pricing


applies on any day. Level I Pricing is the highest Pricing Level 
and Level III Pricing the lowest.

          "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Group.

The ratings to be utilized for purposes of this Pricing Schedule 
are those assigned to the senior unsecured long-term debt 
securities of the Borrower without thirdparty credit enhancement, 
and any rating assigned to any other debt security of the 
Borrower shall be disregarded.  The rating in effect on any day 
is the rating in effect at the close of business on such day.

If either Moody's or S&P is merged or consolidated with another 
Person or if the ratings business of Moody's or S&P is acquired 
by another Person (the entity conducting such ratings business 
after any such merger, consolidation or acquisition being herein 
called the "Successor"), the ratings provided by the Successor 
shall be used for purposes of this Pricing Schedule unless and 
until the Borrower and the Required Banks shall, by notice to the 
Administrative Agent, designate a different rating agency to 
provide such ratings, in which case the ratings provided by the 
rating agency so designated shall thereafter replace those 
provided by the Successor for purposes of this Pricing Schedule.

                           OPINION OF
                        COUNSEL FOR THE
                            BORROWER


                                        [Effective Date]


To the Banks and the Agents
  Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company 
  of New York, as Documentation Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260

Dear Sirs:

          I have acted as counsel to Union Carbide Corporation 
(the "Borrower") in connection with the $200,000,000 Credit 
Agreement dated as of November 4, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement") 
among the Borrower, the Banks party thereto, the Co-Agents party 
thereto, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as 
Documentation Agent, and Chemical Bank, as Administrative Agent 
and Auction Agent, and I am rendering this opinion pursuant to 
Section 3.01(c) of the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms used 
herein without definition have the same meanings as in the Credit 
Agreement.

          I have examined originals or copies, certified or 
otherwise identified to my satisfaction as being true copies, of 
the Credit Agreement, the Notes, certain information and 
documents provided to me by responsible officers or employees of 
the Borrower and such other documents, certificates and corporate 
or other records as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a 
basis for the opinions set forth herein.

          In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of all 
signatures (other than signatures on behalf of the Borrower), the 
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the 
conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me 
as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the 
originals of such copies.

          No opinion is expressed herein as to any matters 
involving or governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other


than the laws of the State of New York, the laws of the State of 
Connecticut and the federal laws of the United States of America.  
Without limiting the foregoing, I express no opinion as to the 
effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the States 
of New York and Connecticut) in which any Bank is located which 
limits the rate of interest that such Bank may charge.  I have 
investigated such questions of law and investigated such 
questions of fact for the purpose of rendering the opinions 
expressed herein as I have deemed necessary or appropriate.

          On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, and to 
the qualifications set forth below, I am of the opinion that:

          1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly 
     incorporated, validly existing and in good standing 
     under the laws of the State of New York and is duly 
     qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and 
     in good standing under the laws of the State of 
     Connecticut.

          2.  The Borrower has the corporate power and 
     corporate authority to enter into the Credit Agreement 
     and the Notes and to consummate the transactions 
     provided for therein.

          3.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
     Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the 
     consummation by the Borrower of the transactions 
     provided for therein have been duly authorized by all 
     requisite corporate action on the part of the Borrower.

          4.  The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been 
     duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and are 
     valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, 
     enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with 
     their respective terms, except as (i) limited by 
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
     other laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or 
     limiting creditors' rights generally, (ii) limited by 
     equitable principles of general applicability and the 
     discretion of the court before which any proceeding 
     thereafter may be brought in applying such principles 
     and (iii) the enforceability of indemnification against 
     securities law liabilities may be limited by applicable 
     federal and state securities laws and general 
     principles of public policy.  Additionally, I express 
     no opinion as to the validity of the provisions of 
     Section 9.08 of the Agreement providing for a waiver of 
     trial by jury.



          5.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
     Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes will not 
     (i) constitute a violation of any law or regulation of 
     the State of New York or Connecticut or the United 
     States of America which is binding on the Borrower, 
     (ii) violate the certificate of incorporation or 
     by-laws of the Borrower or (iii) result in a breach of, 
     or constitute a default under, or require any consent 
     under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument 
     known to me (such agreements being listed in Schedule 1 
     hereto) evidencing or governing indebtedness for 
     borrowed money of the Borrower.

         6.  No consent or approval of, or action by or 
     filing with, any court or administrative or 
     governmental body which has not been obtained, taken or 
     made is required under the laws of the State of New 
     York or Connecticut or the United States of America for 
     the Borrower to execute and deliver the Credit 
     Agreement and the Notes and to consummate the 
     transactions provided for therein.

         7.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no 
     action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened 
     against or affecting the Borrower or any of its 
     Restricted Subsidiaries, before any court or arbitrator 
     or any governmental body, agency or official in which 
     there is a reasonable likelihood of an adverse decision 
     which could materially adversely affect the present or 
     prospective ability of the Borrower to perform its 
     obligations under the Credit Agreement or any Note or 
     which draws into question the validity of the Credit 
     Agreement or the Notes.

          In giving the opinions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 
above, I have relied upon telegraphic or oral confirmations as to 
the existence and good standing of the Borrower.

          This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection 
with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by 
you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person 
(except for deliveries required in accordance with applicable 
law) without my prior written consent.

                                   Very truly yours,

To the Banks and the Agents
  Referred to Below
c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
  of New York, as Documentation Agent
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10260

Dear Sirs:

          We have participated in the preparation of the 
$200,000,000 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as 
of November 4, 1994 among Union Carbide Corporation, a New York 
corporation (the "Borrower"), the Banks party thereto, the Co-
Agents party thereto, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, 
as Documentation Agent, and Chemical Bank, as Administrative 
Agent and Auction Agent, and have acted as special counsel for 
the Agents for the purpose of rendering this opinion pursuant to 
Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement.  Terms defined in the 
Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined. 

          We have examined originals or copies, certified or 
otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, 
corporate records, certificates of public officials and other 
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact 
and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of 
this opinion. 

          Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion 
that:

          1.  The execution, delivery and performance by the 
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the 
Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all 
necessary corporate action. 

          2.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and 
binding agreement of the Borrower and the Notes constitute


valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, in each case 
enforceable in accordance with its terms except as limited by (i) 
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' rights 
generally and (ii) equitable principles of general applicability. 

          We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and 
the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New 
York and the federal laws of the United States of America.  In 
giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the 
effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State 
of New York) in which any Bank is located which limits the rate 
of interest that such Bank may charge or collect. 

          This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection 
with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by 
you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person 
(except for deliveries required in accordance with applicable 
law) without our prior written consent. 

                             Very truly yours,

          that result in, and are directly related to, a net
          decrease in aggregate related Operating Expenses for
          the Building, as reasonably justified by Landlord, at
          least equivalent to such costs in the year incurred or
          thereafter (but not to exceed twenty-four (24)

          Tenant Services, as identified on Schedule I attached
          hereto; provided, however, that (i) Tenant shall give
          Landlord reasonable notice of any Tenant Services work


          it performs in excess of $2,000.00 per job, (ii) any
          Tenant Services work shall conform to Building standard
          as to materials and workmanship, (iii) Tenant shall be

          each promptly notify the other in writing of its

          Services for which Tenant has assumed responsibility,

          Data Center located at 55 Old Ridgebury Road, Danbury,

          wiring, switching equipment or cables.  Landlord shall
          cooperate fully to permit Tenant to receive
          telecommunications service at the Demised Premises and
          the Linde Data Center."

required by the Lease and does not intend to seek the consent of 
Overlandlord with respect to this Amendment.

    10.   Landlord shall inform Tenant in advance of any 
modifications of the Prime Lease with Overlandlord and Landlord 
shall give to Tenant a reasonable opportunity to benefit from any 
transaction with Overlandlord reducing Landlord's payments to

any decrease in Landlord's payments of Basic Rent, Additional 
Rent or other amounts to Overlandlord unless Tenant has 
contributed in a mutually agreed proportionate amount to the cost 
of obtaining any such decrease.  As used herein, "cost" shall 
include all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord and related 
to such reductions, whether paid to Overlandlord or to others,

remain in full force and effect.

Amendment by their duly authorized officers as of the day and 
year first above written.

            telecommunications and computer wiring in the Building 
            which now services the Demised Premises, to install 
            its own telephone switching equipment for the Demised 
            Premises in Landlord's N-O telephone room in the 
            Corporate Center located at 39 Old Ridgebury Road, 
            Danbury, Connecticut (the "Corporate Center"), and to 
            use the telecommunications cables located between (i) 
            Old Ridgebury Road and the Demised Premises, (ii) the 
            Demised Premises and the Corporate Center, and (iii) 
            the Corporate Center and Old Ridgebury Road.  Further, 
            Tenant shall have the right to repair and replace, or 
            cause to be repaired and replaced, any such 
            telecommunications and computer wiring, switching 
            equipment or cables.  Landlord shall cooperate fully 
            to permit Tenant to receive telecommunications service 


            at the Demised Premises." 
     6.     Tenant hereby acknowledges that Landlord is not 
required by the Lease and does not intend to seek the consent of 
Overlandlord with respect to this Amendment.
     7.     Landlord shall inform Tenant in advance of any 
modifications of the Prime Lease with Overlandlord and Landlord 
shall give to Tenant a reasonable opportunity to benefit from any 
transaction with Overlandlord reducing Landlord's payments to 
Overlandlord.  Tenant will take no benefit under the Lease from 
any decrease in Landlord's payments of Basic Rent, Additional Rent 
or other amounts to Overlandlord unless Tenant has contributed in 
a mutually agreed proportionate amount to the cost of obtaining 
any such decrease.  As used herein, "cost" shall include all costs 
and expenses incurred by Landlord and related to such reductions, 
whether paid to Overlandlord or to others, including but not 
limited to, prepayments of Basic Rent or Additional Rent and 
payment of transaction costs such as underwriting fees, legal 
fees, appraisal fees, survey fees, brokers' fees, or otherwise, of 
any nature whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the 
foregoing.
     8.     All terms which are defined in the Lease shall have 
the same meaning when used herein.
     9.     Except as otherwise provided herein, the Lease shall 
remain in full force and effect.





     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have executed this 
Amendment by their duly authorized officers as of the day and year 
first above written.

                      TAX SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT


     AGREEMENT made May 31, 1994 among Union Carbide Corporation, 
a New York corporation ("Union Carbide") with offices at 39 Old 
Ridgebury Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06817, and Praxair, Inc., a 
Delaware corporation ("Praxair"), with offices at 39 Old Ridgebury 
Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06817, 
                       W I T N E S S E T H:
     WHEREAS, Union Carbide spun-off its industrial gases and 
coatings service businesses to its shareholders on June 30, 1992 
by distributing the shares of Praxair to such shareholders;
     WHEREAS, Union Carbide and Praxair each have a number of tax 
claims and open items relating to the spin-off;
     WHEREAS, Union Carbide and Praxair hereby agree to resolve 
the tax issues as set forth below;
     NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual 
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby 
agree as follows:

     1.  Reference is made to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement 
dated as of June 4, 1992 between Union Carbide and Praxair 
("TDA").

        (a)  Praxair acknowledges its liability under the TDA and
        agrees to pay Union Carbide $6,495,624 representing


        Praxair's share of federal income taxes for the short
        taxable period January 1, 1992 through June 30, 1992.

        (b)  This is to clarify that Section 1.04 "Business of 
        Gases" includes assets or liabilities transferred to 
        Praxair pursuant to the Transfer Agreement.  In 
        particular, Praxair acknowledges its liability under 
        Section 2.02(a)(v) of the TDA for any sales, use or 
        similar transfer taxes imposed by a taxing 
        jurisdiction in California or any other taxing 
        jurisdiction outside California in connection with the 
        transfer of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the 
        Transfer Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein 
        without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to 
        them in the TDA.  

        (c)  Pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i)(A) and Section 
        2.02(a)(ii) of the TDA, Praxair is liable to Union 
        Carbide for any unintentional erroneous exclusion of 
        income for periods prior to July 1, 1992.  Praxair 
        inadvertently omitted income for the year 1991 on the 
        sale of the assets of Linde Gases of the Great Lakes, 
        Inc. and Linde Gases of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc. resulting 
        in additional federal income tax in the amount of 
        $5,607,163.  The TDA does not specifically provide for a 
        payment of a tax audit issue prior to the time of a Final 
        Determination as defined in the TDA.  In order to stop 
        the running of interest on the $5,607,163 owed to Union 
        Carbide, Praxair will pay Union Carbide $5,607,163 plus 
        interest at 7% i.e. $938,036 for a total of $6,545,199 
        (plus $1,241 interest per day for any period after May 
        31, 1994 for which the sum of $6,545,199 remains unpaid).  
        Union Carbide hereby waives and shall hold Praxair 
        harmless for any additional interest (other than interest 
        stated in the preceding sentence) that may otherwise 
        become due under the TDA on the amount of $5,607,163 owed 
        to the Internal Revenue Service for federal income taxes 
        on the sale of Linde Gases of the Great Lakes, Inc. and 
        Linde Gases of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc.  State and local 
        income taxes (and interest and penalties if any,) for 
        which Praxair acknowledges liability to Union Carbide 
        under Section 2.02(a)(ii) of the TDA, shall be computed 
        and paid to Union Carbide at the time of a Final 
        Determination of such liability. For this purpose, a 
        Final Determination will occur when the federal revenue 
        agent's report (RAR) results in a state and local income 
        tax assessment against Union Carbide.  

        (d)  Section 9.01 of the TDA , Deduction for Employee 
        Stock Options, 3rd sentence shall be amended to read as 
        follows:



            "...The amount of the decrease in the cumulative
            income taxes actually paid by a party shall equal
            the difference, if any, between (a) the income tax
            liability of the party determined without regard to
            any deduction claimed or income realized with respect
            to the transfer or exercise of the stock option and 
            (b) the actual income tax liability of the party."

     2.  Reference is made to the Transfer Agreement as defined in 
the TDA.  Although the Transfer Agreement is unclear because 
Praxair is referred to as the "Transferee", Union Carbide 
acknowledges its liability within the spirit of the Transfer 
Agreement for the Stock Exchange Transfer Tax for the transfer of 
Union Carbide Chemicals (Deutschland) GmbH and Union Carbide 
Metals GmbH.  The aggregate tax liability for the transfer of 
shares of both companies is $23,410 which Union Carbide hereby 
agrees to pay Praxair.
     3.  A credit memorandum of $3,400,000 will be issued to 
Praxair by Union Carbide representing the tax accrual for the 8% 
tax imposed on Electric Furnace Products Company (EFP) for 
undistributed profits of S.A. White Martins (SAWM) for which 
Praxair is liable and for which Union Carbide received the 
$3,400,000 tax accrual.  The $3,400,000 credit memorandum is to 
reverse the inadvertent error.  
     4.  Praxair acknowledges liability for and hereby agrees to 
pay Union Carbide $67,000 for Connecticut Sales taxes in 
connection with services provided to Praxair by Union Carbide 
Chemicals and Plastics Company Inc. ("UCC&P") during the period 
July 1, 1992 and September 30, 1993 pursuant to the Bridging 
Services Agreement among Union Carbide, UCC&P, Praxair and Praxair


Surface Technologies Inc.("PST") dated June 4, 1992, the Services 
Agreement between Union Carbide, UCC&P, Praxair and PST dated June 
4, 1992 and the Aviation Services Agreement between Union Carbide 
and Praxair dated June 10, 1992.
     IN WITNESSETH WHEREOF, the parties have executed this 
Agreement as of the date first set forth above.

             FIRST AMENDATORY AGREEMENT TO THE
                EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AGREEMENT   
     This Amendatory Agreement, dated as of May 31, 1994, between 
Union Carbide Corporation ("UCC") and Praxair, Inc. (formerly 
Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc.) ("Praxair") amends the 
Employee Benefits Agreement between the same parties dated as of 
June 4, 1992 ("Employee Benefits Agreement").  All capitalized 
terms in this Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein, shall 
have the same meaning as set forth in the Employee Benefits 
Agreement.
                    W I T N E S S E T H:
     WHEREAS, UCC and Praxair are parties to the Employee 
Benefits Agreement, which was intended, inter alia, to establish 
a system of payments and reimbursements between the parties with 
respect to employee benefit matters arising out of the spinoff of 
Praxair (formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of UCC) to UCC's 
shareholders; and
     WHEREAS, UCC and Praxair wish to settle the transfer of 
assets between their respective defined benefit plans as provided 
in Paragraph 1 below; and
     WHEREAS, UCC and Praxair desire to revise certain provisions 
of the Employee Benefits Agreement for simplification purposes 
and have determined that the best way to achieve such 
simplification is for each party to give up the right to certain 
payments under the Employee Benefits Agreement in amounts which 
are intended to be, to the extent possible, economically neutral, 
as provided in Paragraphs 2 to 5 below.


     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and 
covenants contained herein, UCC and Praxair agree as follows:
     1.   In final satisfaction of all obligations with respect 
to the transfer of assets between the parties' qualified defined 
benefit plans, Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) shall be 
transferred in cash or securities from the trust for Praxair's 
Retirement Plan to the trust for UCC's Retirement Plan ten days 
after the date of this Agreement.
     2.   With respect to Paragraph 6 of the Employee Benefits 
Agreement:
          (a)  A book reserve is maintained under UCC's 
     retire medical plan for claims incurred but unpaid (as 
     of June 30, 1992).  The Praxair portion (29%) of such 
     reserve is fixed at Three Million Seven Hundred Thousand 
     Dollars ($3,700,000.00).  This amount shall be applied 
     to Praxair's obligations for retiree medical claims.  
     Praxair's obligation to reimburse UCC for retiree 
     medical claims will commence only when such reserve 
     amount has been exhausted.
          (b)  There are reserves at Metropolitan Life for 
     Basic Life Plan claims for deaths before the Spinoff 
     Date and for employees who were disabled before 1986 and 
     die before attaining age 65.  Settlement of these 
     claims shall be entirely for UCC's account.  Thus, UCC 
     will be entitled to the positive or negative experience 
     of such reserves after payment of such claims.  Praxair 
     shall have no responsibility for, or rights in, such 
     reserves and shall have no liability with respect to
     such claims.


          (c)  The Consumer Products reserve credit 
     adjustment, and the value of Kemet reimbursements, for 
     retiree life and medical benefits shall be eliminated 
     from all calculations under the Employee Benefits 
     Agreement.
          (d)  Internal and external administrative costs for 
     retiree life and medical shall be 7.5% of gross claims 
     paid.
          (e)  The value of UCAR reimbursement is eliminated 
     from all calculations under retiree life and medical 
     and, in exchange, Praxair's reimbursement obligations is 
     changed from twenty-nine percent (29%) to twenty-seven 
     and four one-hundredths percent (27.04%).  In keeping 
     with UCC's past practice for charging businesses for 
     expenses before the Spinoff Date, if UCAR defaults on 
     its payment obligation to UCC, and UCC is not otherwise 
     compensated with respect to such default, Praxair's 
     obligation will revert to twenty-nine percent (29%) 
     during the period of any such default.  Should 
     UCC subsequently be reimbursed by UCAR with respect to 
     such defaulted amount, Praxair will share in such 
     reimbursement to the extent necessary to restore it to 
     its 27.04% contribution level.
     3.   Paragraph 8 of the Employee Benefits Agreement is 
expanded to provide that from and after the Spinoff Date, Praxair 
will be entitled to twenty-nine percent (29%) of any recovery, 
whether by successful claim or settlement, made by the UCC 
Retirement Plan arising from events which occurred before the 
Spinoff Date, excluding any recovery in the Aqua Culture


investment which was retained in UCC's Retirement Plan after the 
Spinoff.  The calculation of any such recovery will be net of 
expenses, including legal fees, incurred in pursuing such claims.
     For purposes of Paragraph 8 of the Employee Benefits 
Agreement, the American Typlax settlement is expressly included 
in claims against the UCC Retirement Plan for which Praxair has a 
contribution obligation.

     4.   With respect to Paragraph 22 of the Employee Benefits 
Agreement:
          (a)  The administrative cost of UCC's pension 
     operations is excluded from all calculations of 
     Praxair's reimbursement obligations.
          (b)  Praxair's annual reimbursement obligation for 
     administrative services other than pension operations 
     shall be the lesser of (i) fourteen and one-half percent 
     (14.5%) of UCC's cost, or (ii) one-hundred thousand 
     dollars ($100,000.00).
     5.   All the above provisions are effective as of the 
Spinoff Date, as if included in the Employee Benefits Agreement, 
and any contrary or inconsistent provision in the Employee 
Benefits Agreement is hereby superceded.
     6.   In the event of national health care legislation which 
would substantially change the rights of the parties under the 
Employee Benefits Agreement and this Amendatory Agreement, the 
parties agree to re-negotiate the provisions of this Amendatory 
Agreement to the extent necessary to achieve an equitable 
arrangement which comports with the intent of the Employee 
Benefits Agreement and this Amendatory Agreement.


     7.   All bills rendered and paid to date under the Employee 
Benefits Agreement will be adjusted to comport with this 
Amendatory Agreement.

     8.   The parties believe that Exhibit A hereto is an 
accurate representation of the financial impact of the terms of 
this Amendatory Agreement for the period July 1, 1992 through 
December 31, 1993, but reserve the right to subject to contents 
of such Exhibit A to the review and audit procedures described in 
Paragraph 28 of the Employee Benefits Agreement.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed and 
entered into this Agreement, as of the date first above written.

Mr. R. Van Mynen
P2-607



Dear Ron:

     The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Union Carbide 
Corporation (the "Corporation") recognizes that the possibility of 
a change in control of the Corporation exists, as is the case with 
many publicly held corporations, and the uncertainty and questions 
which it may raise among management may result in the departure or 
distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the 
Corporation and its stockholders.

     The Board has determined that appropriate steps should be 
taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the Corporation's management, including 
yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from a possible 
change in control of the Corporation. The Board has also 
determined that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and 
its stockholders to ensure your continued availability to the 
Corporation in the event of a potential change in control of the 
Corporation.

     In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the 
Corporation and in consideration of your agreement set forth in 
Paragraph 2 hereof, the Corporation agrees that you shall receive 
the severance benefits set forth in this letter agreement 
("Agreement") in the event your employment with the Corporation is 
terminated subsequent to a change in control under the 
circumstances described below.

1.   Definitions.

     a.  "Change in Control" of the Corporation shall be deemed to 
occur if any of the following circumstances shall occur:

          (i)  if a change in control of the Corporation would be 
     required to be reported in response to Item 1(a) of the 
     Current Report on Form 8-K, as in effect on the date hereof, 
     pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange 
     Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), whether or not the 
     Corporation is then subject to such reporting requirement;

         (ii)  there shall be consummated (x) any consolidation 
     or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not 
     the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which 
     shares of the Corporation's Common Stock would be converted 
     into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger 
     of the Corporation in which the holders of the Corporation's 
     Common Stock immediately prior to the merger have the same 
     proportion and ownership of common stock of the surviving 
     corporation immediately after the merger, or (y) any sale, 
     lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a 
     series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, 
     of the assets of the Corporation, provided, that the 
     divestiture of less than substantially all of the assets of 
     the Corporation in one transaction or a series of related 
     transactions, whether effected by sale, lease, exchange, 
     spin-off, sale of the stock or merger of a subsidiary or 
     otherwise, shall not constitute a Change in Control;

        (iii)  any "person" or "group" within the meaning of 
     Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Act (x) becomes the 
     "beneficial owner" as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act of 
     more than 20% of the then outstanding voting securities of 
     the Corporation, otherwise than through a transaction or 
     transactions arranged by, or consummated with the prior 
     approval of, the Board, or (y) acquires by proxy or otherwise 
     the right to vote for the election of directors, for any 
     merger or consolidation of the Corporation or for any other 
     matter or question more than 20% of the then outstanding 
     voting securities of the Corporation, otherwise than through 
     an arrangement or arrangements consummated with the prior 
     approval of the Board;

         (iv)  if during any period of twenty-four consecutive 
     months (not including any period prior to the date of this 
     Agreement), Present Directors and/or New Directors cease for 
     any reason to constitute a majority of the Board. For 
     purposes of the preceding sentence, "Present Directors" shall 
     mean individuals who at the beginning of such consecutive 
     twenty-four month period were members of the Board and "New 
     Directors" shall mean any director whose election by the 
     Board or whose nomination for election by the Corporation's 
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of 
     the Directors then still in office who were Present Directors 
     or New Directors.

     b.  "Date of Termination" shall mean:

          (i)  in case employment is terminated for Total 
     Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is 
     given (provided that you shall not have returned to the full-
     time performance of your duties during such thirty (30) day 
     period), and

         (ii)  in all other cases, the date specified in the 
     Notice of Termination (which shall not be less than thirty 
     (30) nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the 
     date such Notice of Termination is given),

        (iii)  provided that if within thirty (30) days after any 
     Notice of Termination is given, the party receiving the 
     Notice advises the other party that a dispute exists 
     concerning the termination, the Date of Termination shall be 
     the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by 
     mutual written agreement of the parties, or by a final 
     judgment, order or decree of a court of competent 
     jurisdiction (which is not appealable or the time for appeal 
     therefrom having expired and no appeal having been 
     perfected); provided further that the Date of Termination 
     shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice 
     is given in good faith and the party giving such notice 
     pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable 
     diligence.

     c.  "Total Disability" shall mean total and permanent 
physical or mental disability to perform any work for compensation 
in any occupation or position. Any question as to the existence of 
your Total Disability upon which you and the Corporation cannot 
agree shall be determined by a qualified physician not employed by 
the Corporation and selected by you (or, if you are unable to make 
such selection, it shall be made by any adult member of your 
immediate family), and approved by the Corporation. The 
determination of such physician made in writing to the Corporation 
and to you shall be final and conclusive for all purposes of this 
Agreement.

     d.  "Good Reason for Resignation" shall mean, without your 
express written consent, any of the following:

          (i)  a change in your status or position with the 
     Corporation which in your reasonable judgment does not 
     represent a promotion from your status or position 
     immediately prior to the Change in Control, or the assignment 
     to you of any duties or responsibilities which in your 
     reasonable judgment are inconsistent with your status as an 
     employee of the Corporation in effect immediately prior to 
     the Change in Control, it being understood that any of the 
     foregoing in connection with termination of your employment 
     for Cause, Retirement, or Total Disability shall not 
     constitute Good Reason for Resignation; 

         (ii)  a reduction by the Corporation in the annual rate 
     of your base salary as in effect immediately prior to the 
     date of a Change of Control or as the same may be increased 
     from time to time thereafter, or the Corporation's failure to 
     increase the annual rate of your base salary in an amount at 
     least equal to the average percentage increase in base salary 
     for all officers of the Corporation in the preceding 12 
     months;

        (iii)  the relocation of the Corporation's principal 
     executive offices to a location more than thirty-five miles 
     from Danbury, Connecticut or the Corporation's requiring you 
     to be based anywhere other than the Corporation's principal 
     executive offices (or, if you were not based at the 
     Corporation's principal executive offices immediately prior 
     to a Change in Control, the Corporation's requiring you to be 
     based anywhere other than where your office is located 
     immediately prior to such Change in Control) except for 
     required travel on the Corporation's business to an extent 
     substantially consistent with your business travel 
     obligations immediately prior to a Change in Control;

         (iv)  the failure by the Corporation to continue in 
     effect any compensation plan in which you participate as in 
     effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, including 
     but not limited to the Retirement Program, the Savings 
     Program and the Incentive Compensation Plans, or any 
     substitute plans adopted prior to the Change in Control, 
     unless an arrangement satisfactory to you (embodied in an 
     ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with 
     respect to such plan, or the failure by the Corporation to 
     continue your participation therein on at least as favorable 
     a basis, both in terms of the amount of benefits provided and 
     the level of your participation relative to other 
     participants, as existed immediately prior to the Change in 
     Control;

          (v)  the failure by the Corporation to continue to 
     provide you with benefits at least as favorable as those 
     enjoyed by you under any of the Corporation's pre-retirement

     accident, and disability plans or any other plan, program or 
     policy of the Corporation intended to benefit employees in 
     which you were participating immediately prior to the Change 
     in Control, the taking of any action by the Corporation which 
     would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such 
     benefits or deprive you of any material fringe benefit 
     enjoyed by you immediately prior to the Change in Control, or 
     the failure by the Corporation to provide you with the number 
     of annual paid vacation days to which you were annually 
     entitled immediately prior to the Change in Control;

         (vi)  the failure of the Corporation to obtain a 
     satisfactory agreement from any Successor (as defined in 
     Paragraph 5a hereof) to assume and agree to perform this 
     Agreement, as contemplated in Paragraph 5a hereof; or

        (vii)  any purported termination of your employment which 
     is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination 
     satisfying the requirements hereof; for purposes of this 
     Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective 
     for any purpose except to constitute a Good Reason for 
     Resignation.

     e.  "Incentive Compensation Plans" shall mean:

          (i)  the 1989 Bonus Plan

         (ii)  the 1988 Long-Term Incentive Plan

     consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a 
     Change in Control;

         (ii)  any person (including any individual, corporation,

        (iii)  any person as defined above becomes the beneficial

     securities; or

         (iv)  the Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, 
     for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change in Control 
     of the Corporation has occurred.

     g.  "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice as 
provided in Paragraph 9 hereof.

     h.  "Retirement" shall mean (1) voluntary retirement before 
your mandatory retirement age with an immediate, nonactuarially-
reduced pension under the Corporation's Retirement Program 
(termination of your employment by you before your mandatory 
retirement age with Good Reason for Resignation shall not be 
deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Agreement even though you 
are eligible for and elect to receive an immediate, 
nonactuarially-reduced pension under the Corporation's Retirement 
Program) or (2) termination in accordance with any retirement 
arrangement other than under the Corporation's Retirement Program, 
which is established with your consent with respect to you or (3)

     i.  "Retirement Program" shall mean:

          (i)  the Retirement Program Plan for Employees of Union 
     Carbide Corporation and its Participating Subsidiaries;

         (ii)  the Equalization Benefit Plan for Participants of

     of Union Carbide Corporation.

     k.  "Termination for Cause" shall mean termination of your 
employment upon:

          (i)  your willful and continued failure to substantially 
     perform your duties with the Corporation (other than any such 
     failure resulting from your Total Disability or any such 
     actual or anticipated failure resulting from your resignation 
     with Good Reason for Resignation) after a written demand for 
     substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, 
     which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the 
     Board believes that you have not substantially performed your 
     duties, or

         (ii)  your willfully engaging in conduct demonstrably 
     and materially injurious to the Corporation, monetarily or 
     otherwise,

but only so long as there shall have been delivered to you a copy 
of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less 
than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Board at 
a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after 
reasonable notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with 
your counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the 
good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct set 
forth and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

For purposes of this Paragraph 1k, no act, or failure to act, on 
your part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be 
done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that 
your action or omission was in the best interest of the 
Corporation. Any act or failure to act based upon authority given 
pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon 
the advice of counsel for the Corporation shall be conclusively 
presumed to be done or omitted to be done by you in good faith and 
in the best interests of the Corporation.

2.  Agreement to Remain Employed.  You agree that, subject to the 
terms and conditions of this Agreement, you will remain in the 
employ of the Corporation and continue to render the services 
contemplated in the recitals to this Agreement (except for Total 
Disability or Retirement or resignation with Good Reason for 
Resignation) for a period of six (6) months from the date of this 
Agreement. If a Potential Change in Control of the Corporation 
occurs during the term of this Agreement, you will remain in the 
employ of the Corporation and continue to render such services for 
a period of six (6) months after the occurrence of each such 
Potential Change in Control of the Corporation occurring prior to 
the occurrence of a Change in Control.

3.   Compensation Upon Termination or While Disabled.  Following a 
Change in Control of the Corporation you shall be entitled to the 
following benefits:

     a.  Termination Other Than for Cause, Retirement, Death or 
Total Disability; Termination By Your Resignation with Good Reason 
for Resignation.  If your employment by the Corporation shall be 
terminated subsequent to the Change in Control and during the term 
of this Agreement (a) by the Corporation other than for Cause, 
Retirement, Death or Disability or (b) by you for Good Reason for 
Resignation, then you shall be entitled to the benefits provided 
below, without regard to any contrary provision of any plan:

          (i)  Accrued Salary. The Corporation shall pay you, in a 
     lump sum in cash, not later than the fifth day following the 
     Date of Termination your full base salary and vacation pay 
     accrued through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect 
     at the time the Notice of Termination is given (or at the 
     rate in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control, if 
     such amounts were higher).

         (ii)  Accrued Incentive Compensation. If the Date of 
     Termination is after a Bonus Year, but before Incentive 
     Compensation for said Bonus Year has been paid, the 
     Corporation shall pay you as Incentive Compensation for that 
     Bonus Year, the greater of (x) the amount of Incentive 
     Compensation awarded or determined to be awarded to you by 
     the Board for that Bonus Year, or (y) an amount that bears 
     the same ratio to your total base salary in said Bonus Year 
     as the total of all Incentive Compensation paid to 
     participants in the Incentive Compensation Program for said 
     Bonus Year bears to the total of all base salaries paid to 
     said participants in said Bonus Year, such payment to you to 
     be made at the same time the Corporation pays Incentive 
     Compensation for said Bonus Year under the applicable 
     Incentive Compensation Program. In addition, if the Date of 
     Termination is other than the first day of a Bonus Year, the 
     Corporation shall pay you, as Incentive Compensation for the 
     Bonus Year in which the Date of Termination occurs, the 
     greater of (x) the amount of incentive compensation awarded 
     or determined to be awarded to you by the Board for that 
     Bonus Year, or (y) an amount that bears the same ratio to 
     your total base salary in said Bonus Year as the total of all 
     Incentive Compensation paid to participants in the Incentive 
     Program for said Bonus Year bears to the total of all base 
     salaries paid to said participants in said Bonus Year, such 
     payment to you to be made at the same time the Corporation 
     pays Incentive Compensation for said Bonus Year under the 
     applicable Incentive Compensation Program. If there is more 
     than one Incentive Compensation Program, your accrued 
     Incentive Compensation under each Program shall be determined 
     individually for that Program. For the purpose of this 
     Paragraph 3(a)(ii), "Incentive Compensation Program" means 
     any of the Incentive Compensation Plans defined in Paragraph 
     1e and any other plan or program for the payment of 
     incentive compensation, bonus, benefits or awards for which 
     you were, or your position was, eligible to participate; 
     "Incentive Compensation" means any compensation, bonus, 
     benefit or award paid or payable under an Incentive 
     Compensation Program; "Bonus Year" means a calendar year of 
     an Incentive Compensation Program, and "Board" means the 
     Board of Directors of the Corporation, any committee of the 
     Board of Directors or any person or group designated by the 
     Board of Directors to determine the amount of Incentive 
     Compensation payable under an Incentive Compensation Program.

        (iii)  Insurance Coverage. The Corporation shall 
     arrange to provide you with life, disability, accident and 
     health insurance benefits substantially similar to those 
     which you are receiving or entitled to receive immediately 
     prior to the Change in Control of the Corporation. Such 
     insurance benefits shall be provided to you for the longer of 
     (x) twenty-four (24) months after such Date of Termination or 
     (y) the period during which such insurance benefits would 
     have been provided to you under the applicable life 
     insurance, medical, health and accident and disability 
     insurance plans of the Corporation in effect immediately 
     prior to the Change in Control of the Corporation.

         (iv)  Retirement Benefits. The Corporation shall pay you, 
     at the time you are entitled to be paid a retirement pension 
     under the Retirement Program, a retirement pension equal to 
     the greater of (x) an amount computed in accordance with the 
     terms of the Retirement Program in effect immediately prior 
     to the Change in Control of the Corporation and as if those 
     terms were in effect on the Date of Termination, or (y) an 
     amount computed in accordance with the terms of the 
     Retirement Program in effect immediately prior to the Date of 
     Termination, in either case less the amount of retirement 
     pension actually to be paid to you under the Retirement 
     Program. In computing the amounts of your retirement pension 
     under clauses (x) and (y) of this Paragraph 3a(iv), to the 
     extent such benefits are payable under the tax qualified 
     Retirement Program Plan for Employees of Union Carbide 
     Corporation and its Participating Subsidiaries, three years 
     shall be added to your actual age and to your actual Company 
     Service Credit under the Retirement Program Plan for 
     Employees of Union Carbide Corporation and its Participating 
     Subsidiaries so that your retirement pension under clauses 
     (x) and (y) will be the amount it would have been if you had 
     been three years older than you actually were, and had three 
     years more Company Service Credit than you actually had, on 
     the Date of Termination.

          (v)   Severance Payment. The Corporation shall pay as 
     severance pay to you, not later than the fifth day following 
     the Date of Termination, a lump sum severance payment (the 
     "Severance Payment") equal to 2.99 times the average of the 
     annual compensation which was payable to you by the 
     Corporation (or any corporation affiliated with the 
     Corporation within the meaning of section 1504 of the 
     Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended ("Code")) and 
     includible in your gross income for Federal income tax 
     purposes for the five calendar years (the "Base Period") 
     preceding the calendar year in which a Change in Control of 
     the Corporation occurred. The Severance Payment shall be 
     reduced pursuant to Paragraph 3a(vi) hereof to the extent the 
     Corporation could not properly deduct amounts paid pursuant 
     to Paragraph 3a(i) through 3a(iv) hereof or otherwise 
     pursuant to section 280G of the Code. For purposes hereunder, 
     the average annual compensation shall be determined in 
     accordance with proposed, temporary or final regulations 
     promulgated under section 280G(d) of the Code. Compensation 
     payable to you by the Corporation (or an affiliate) shall 
     include every type and form of compensation includible in 
     your gross income in respect of your employment by the 
     Corporation (or an affiliate), including but not limited to 
     compensation income recognized as a result of your exercise 
     of stock options or sale of the stock so acquired, bonuses, 
     dividend equivalents, fringe benefits, relocation payments, 
     and stock appreciation rights, except to the extent otherwise 
     provided in proposed, temporary or final regulations 
     promulgated under section 280G(d) of the Code. For purposes 
     of Paragraphs 3a(v) and 3a(vi) only, a "Change in control of 
     the Corporation" shall have the meaning set forth in section 
     280G(d) of the Code and any proposed, temporary or final 
     regulations promulgated thereunder.

         (vi)  Reduction in Severance Payment. The Severance 
     Payment shall be reduced but not below zero by the amount of 
     any other payment or the value of any benefit received or to 
     be received by you contingent upon a Change in Control of the 
     Corporation (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this 
     Agreement, any other plan, agreement or arrangement with the 
     Corporation or an affiliate) unless (1) you shall have 
     effectively waived your receipt or enjoyment of such payment 
     or benefit prior to the date of payment of the Severance 
     Payment, or (2) in the opinion of Messrs. Kelley Drye & 
     Warren, which shall be binding upon the Corporation and upon 
     you, such other payment or benefit plus the Severance Payment 
     (in its full amount or as partially reduced hereunder, as the 
     case may be) would be properly deductible by the Corporation 
     without restriction pursuant to Code section 280G. The value 
     of any non-cash benefit or any deferred cash payment shall 
     promptly be determined by the Corporation's independent 
     auditors in accordance with the principles of sections 
     280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

        (vii)  Repayment of excess payment. If it is established 
     pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal 
     Revenue Service proceeding that, notwithstanding the good 
     faith of you and the Corporation in applying the terms of 
     this Paragraph 3a, the aggregate payments hereunder to or for 
     your benefit would result in any portion of such payments not 
     being deductible by the Corporation or its affiliates by 
     reason of section 280G of the Code, then you agree to pay the 
     Corporation upon demand an amount equal to the sum of (1) the 
     excess of the aggregate payments hereunder paid to or for 
     your benefit over the aggregate payments hereunder that would 
     have been paid to or for your benefit without any portion of 
     such payments not being deductible by reason of section 280G 
     of the Code; and (2) interest on the amount set forth in 
     clause (1) of this sentence at the applicable Federal rate 
     (as defined in section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of 
     your receipt of such excess until the date of such payment. 
     No amount shall be payable by you hereunder if and to the 
     extent that in the opinion of Messrs. Kelley Drye & Warren 
     such repayment would not reduce the amount of payments to you 
     which are considered nondeductible by the Corporation 
     pursuant to Code section 280G.

       (viii)  No duty to mitigate. You shall not be required to 
     mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this 
     Paragraph 3 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor 
     shall the amount of any payment or benefit as provided for be 
     reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of 
     employment by another employer or by retirement benefits 
     after the Date of Termination, or otherwise except as 
     specifically provided herein.

     b.  Payments While Disabled. During any period prior to the 
Date of Termination and during the term of this Agreement that you 
are unable to perform your full-time duties with the Corporation, 
whether as a result of your Total Disability or as a result of a 
physical or mental disability that is not total or is not 
permanent and therefore is not a Total Disability, you shall 
continue to receive your base salary at the rate in effect at the 
commencement of any such period, together with all other 
compensation and benefits that are payable under the Corporation's 
disability benefit plans. After the Date of Termination, your 
benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's 
Retirement Program, insurance and other applicable programs. The 
compensation and benefits, other than salary, payable pursuant to 
this Paragraph 3b shall be the greater of (x) the amounts computed 
under the Retirement Program, disability benefit plans, insurance 
and other applicable programs in effect immediately prior to a 
Change in Control of the Corporation, and (y) the amounts computed 
under the Retirement Program, disability benefit plans, insurance 
and other applicable programs in effect at the time the 
compensation and benefits are paid.

     c.  Payments if Terminated for Cause, or by You Except With 
Good Reason. If your employment shall be terminated by the 
Corporation for Cause or by you other than with Good Reason for 
Resignation, the Corporation shall pay you your full base salary 
then in effect through the Date of Termination, at the rate in 
effect at the time Notice of Termination is given plus any 
benefits or awards which have been earned or become payable but 
which have not yet been paid to you. Thereafter the Corporation 
shall have no further obligation to you under this Agreement.

     d.  After Retirement or Death. If your employment shall be 
terminated by your Retirement, or by reason of your death, your 
benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Corporation's 
retirement and insurance programs then in effect.

4.   Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall commence on the date 
hereof and shall continue in effect through December 31, 1992; 
provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 1993 and each 
January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall 
automatically be extended for one additional year unless, not 
later than September 30 of the preceding year, the Corporation or 
you shall have given notice that it or you do not wish to extend 
this Agreement; provided, further, that notwithstanding any such 
notice by the Corporation or you not to extend, if a Change in 
Control shall have occurred during the original or extended term 
of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a 
period of twenty-four (24) months beyond the term in effect 
immediately before such Change in Control. This Agreement shall 
terminate if your employment is terminated by you or the 
Corporation prior to a Change in Control.

5.   Successors; Binding Agreement.

     a.  Successors of the Corporation. The Corporation will 
require any Successor to all or substantially all of the business 
and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly assume and agree, by 
an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to perform 
this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the 
Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession 
had taken place. Failure of the Corporation to obtain such assent 
at least five business days prior to the time a person becomes a 
Successor (or where the Corporation does not have at least five 
business days advance notice that a person may become a Successor, 
within three business days after having notice that such person 
may become or has become a Successor) shall constitute Good Reason 
for Resignation by you and, if a Change in Control of the 
Corporation has occurred or thereafter occurs, shall entitle you 
immediately to the benefits provided in Paragraph 3a hereof upon 
delivery by you of a Notice of Termination which the Corporation, 
by executing this Agreement hereby assents to. For purposes of 
this Agreement, "Successor" shall mean any person that obtains or 
succeeds to, or has the practical ability to control (either 
immediately or with the passage of time), the Corporation's 
business directly, by merger or consolidation, or indirectly, by 
purchase of voting securities of the Corporation, by acquisition 
of rights to vote voting securities of the Corporation or 
otherwise, including but not limited to any person or group that 
acquires the beneficial ownership or voting rights described in 
Paragraph 1a(iii) and any person or group required to be 
identified in a Current Report on Form 8-K described in Paragraph 
1a(i).

     b.  Your Successor.  This Agreement shall inure to the 
benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal 
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, 
distributees, devisees and legatees. If you should die while any 
amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had 
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided 
herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there 
is no such designee, to your estate.

6.   Relationship to Other Agreements.  To the extent that any 
provision of any other agreement between the Corporation or any of 
its subsidiaries and you shall limit, qualify or be inconsistent 
with any provision of this Agreement, then for purposes of this 
Agreement, while the same shall remain in force, the provision of 
this Agreement shall control and such provision of such other 
agreement shall be deemed to have been superseded, and to be of no 
force or effect, as if such other agreement had been formally 
amended to the extent necessary to accomplish such purpose.

7.   Validity.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any 
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which 
shall remain in full force and effect.

8.   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in several 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but 
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

9.   Notice.  Any purported termination by the Corporation or by 
you following a Change in Control shall be communicated to the 
other party by a Notice of Termination. A Notice of Termination 
shall indicate the specific termination provision in this 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the 
facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination 
of your employment under the provision so indicated. For the 
purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other communications 
provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be 
deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United 
States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, 
addressed to the respective addresses set forth on the first page 
of this Agreement, provided that all notices to the Corporation 
shall be directed to the attention of the Board with a copy to the 
Secretary of the Corporation, or to such other address as either 
party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance 
herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be 
effective only upon receipt.

10.  Fees and Expenses.  The Corporation shall pay all legal fees 
and related expenses incurred by you as a result of your 
termination following a Change in Control or by you in seeking to 
obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement 
(including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred in contesting 
or disputing any such termination or incurred by you in seeking 
advice in connection therewith).

11.  Survival.  The respective obligations of, and benefits 
afforded to, the Corporation and you as provided in Paragraphs 3, 
5, 6 and 10 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this 
Agreement.

12.  Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may be 
modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or 
discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by you and such 
officer as may be specifically designated by the Board. No waiver 
by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other 
party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of 
this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed 
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the 
same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or 
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with 
respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either 
party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The 
validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this 
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

     If this letter sets forth our agreement on the subject matter 
hereof, kindly sign and return to the Corporation the enclosed 
copy of this letter which will then constitute our agreement on 
this subject.

                                    Sincerely,

                                    UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION

                                    Chairman of the Board and
                                    Chief Executive Officer

       Re:  Amendment of Severance Compensation Agreement

Dear Ron:

     Pursuant to paragraph 12 of Severance Compensation Agreement 
("Agreement") between you and Union Carbide Corporation 
("Corporation"), dated as of July 21, 1992, the Corporation and 
you now agree to amend the Agreement as follows:

     1.   The Agreement is amended by adding the following
          sentence at the end of Paragraph 4:

            BENEFITS PROTECTION TRUST AGREEMENT
     THIS AGREEMENT, made as of the 1st day of August 1989, by 
and between UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION, a corporation organized 
and existing under the laws of the State of New York (hereinafter 
referred to as the "Company"), and MANUFACTURERS HANOVER TRUST 
COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of 
the State of New York (hereinafter referred to as the "Trustee"),
                         W I T N E S S E T H :
     WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the plans listed on 
Schedule 1 (hereinafter referred to as defined in Schedule 1 or 
collectively as the "Plans") and may adopt or enter into other 
such Plans as will be listed from time to time on Schedule 1 and 
may, from time to time, amend, modify or terminate any such Plan 
in accordance with its terms; and
     WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the plans, programs, and 
policies listed on Schedule 2 (hereinafter referred to 
collectively as the "Protected Plans") and may adopt or enter 
into other such Protected Plans as will be listed from time to 
time on Schedule 2 and may, from time to time, amend, modify, or 
terminate any such Protected Plan in accordance with its terms; 
and
     WHEREAS, the Company desires to establish the Benefits 
Protection Trust (hereinafter referred to as the "Trust") in 
order to ensure that its employees, the employees of its 
Participating Subsidiaries, and their beneficiaries will receive 
the benefits which the Company is obligated to provide for them 
or which they reasonably anticipate receiving pursuant to the 
Protected Plans; and
     WHEREAS, the Trust is intended to be a "grantor trust" with 
the corpus and income of the Trust treated as assets and income 
of the Company for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 
Sections 671 through 678 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(the "Code"), as amended; and
     WHEREAS, the Company intends that the assets of the Trust 
will be subject to the claims of creditors of the Company as 
provided in Article FIFTEENTH; and
     WHEREAS, the Company intends that the existence of the Trust 
will not alter the characterization of the Plans as "unfunded" 
and will not be construed to provide taxable income to any 
participant under the Plans prior to actual payment of benefits 
thereunder; and
     WHEREAS, the Trustee is not a party to the Plans and makes 
no representations with respect thereto, and all representations 
and recitals with respect to the Plans shall be deemed to be 
those of the Company;
     NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and the Trustee agree as 
follows:
     FIRST:  Definitions.  
     (a)  Any term that is referenced in the Plans shall have in 
this Agreement the same meaning ascribed to it in the Plans, 
unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning.  
     (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, an Unfriendly Change In 
Control shall be deemed to occur if:
          (1)  a change in control of the Company would be 
required to be reported in response to item 1(a) of the current 
Report of Form 8-K, as in effect on the date hereof, pursuant to 
Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the "Exchange Act"), whether or not the Company is then 
subject to such reporting requirement;

          (2)  there shall be consummated (A) any consolidation 
or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the 
continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares 
of the Company's common stock would be converted into cash, 
securities or other property, other than a merger of the Company 
in which the holders of the Company's Common Stock immediately 
prior to the merger have the same proportion and ownership of 
common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the 
merger, or (B) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in 
one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or 
substantially all, of the assets of the Company, provided, that 
the divestiture of less than substantially all of the assets of 
the Company in one transaction or a series of related 
transactions, whether effected by sale, lease, exchange, spin-
off, sale of the stock or merger of a subsidiary or otherwise, 
shall not constitute an Unfriendly Change in Control;

          (3)  any "person" or "group" within the meaning of 
Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (A) becomes the 
"beneficial owner" as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange 
Act of more than 20% of the then outstanding voting securities of 
the Company, otherwise than through a transaction or transactions 
arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval of, the Board 
of Directors of the Company, or (B) acquires by proxy or 
otherwise the right to vote for the election of directors, for 
any merger or consolidation of the Company or for any other 
matter or question more than 20% of the then outstanding voting 
securities of the Company, otherwise than through an arrangement 
or arrangements consummated with the prior approval of the Board 
of Directors of the Company; or

          (4)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive 
months (not including any period prior to the adoption of this 
Agreement), Present Directors and/or New Directors cease for any 
reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the 
Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Present Directors" 
shall mean individuals who at the beginning of such consecutive 
twenty-four month period were members of the Board and "New 
Directors" shall mean any director whose election by the Board of 
Directors of the Company or whose nomination for election by the 
Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-
thirds of the Directors then still in office who were Present 
Directors or New Directors.  

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Unfriendly Change of 
Control shall not be deemed to occur pursuant to Subparagraph 
(2), above, solely because twenty percent (20%) or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
securities is acquired by one or more employee benefit plans 
maintained by the Company.  
     Provided, however, that a transaction or transactions 
described in Subparagraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this 
Article FIRST arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval 
of, a majority of the Present Directors and New Directors, shall 
not be deemed an Unfriendly Change in Control if a majority of 
the Present Directors and New Directors certify to the Trustee 
that such transaction or transactions should not be deemed an 
Unfriendly Change in Control.  
     The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the 
occurrence of any event described in subparagraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(4) above, as soon as practicable after the Company first 
learns of such event.  The Trustee may rely upon such notice from 
the Company in performing any of its obligations or taking any 
discretionary action under this Agreement which is dependent upon 
an Unfriendly Change in Control having occurred, provided, 
however, that in the absence of such notice, the Trustee may rely 
on its own determination, including opinion of counsel (who may 
be counsel to the Company or the Trustee), that an Unfriendly 
Change in Control has occurred, unless such a determination 
arises out of the Trustee's gross negligence or willful 
misconduct.  The Trustee may also request that the Company 
furnish evidence to determine or to enable the Trustee to 
determine, whether an Unfriendly Change in Control has occurred. 
The Trustee's determination whether an Unfriendly Change in 
Control has occurred shall be binding and conclusive on all 
Participants.  
     (c)  "Threatened Change in Control" shall mean each of the 
following events (but no event other than the following events), 
except as otherwise provided below:
          (1)  Any persons as defined in Paragraph (b) above, 
without the prior approval of a majority of the Present Directors 
(A) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 
securities of the Company representing ten percent (10%) or more 
of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
voting securities, or (B) initiates a tender offer to acquire 
securities of the Company representing twenty percent (20%) or 
more of the combined voting power of the Company's then 
outstanding voting securities; or
          (2)  The Board of Directors of the Company notifies the 
Trustee in writing that a Threatened Change in Control exists.  
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Threatened Change in 
Control shall not be deemed to occur pursuant to Subparagraph (1) 
above solely because ten percent (10%) or more of the combined 
voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities 
is acquired by one or more employee benefit plans maintained by 
the Company.  
     The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the 
occurrence of any event described in subparagraph (c)(1) above as 
soon as practicable after the Company first learns of such event.  
The Trustee may rely upon such notice from the Company in 
performing any of its obligations or taking any discretionary 
action under this Agreement which is dependent upon a Threatened 
Change in Control having occurred, provided, however, that in the 
absence of such notice, the Trustee may rely on its own 
determination, including opinion of counsel (who may be counsel 
to the Company or the Trustee), that a Threatened Change in 
Control has occurred, unless such a determination arises out of 
the Trustee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The 
Trustee may also request that the Company furnish evidence to 
determine or to enable the Trustee to determine, whether a 
Threatened Change in Control has occurred.  The Trustee's 
determination whether a Threatened Change in Control has occurred 
shall be binding and conclusive on all Participants.  
     (d)  "Threatened Change in Control Period" shall mean the 
period beginning on the date a Threatened Change of Control 
occurs and ending on the earliest of
          (1)  If the Threatened Change in Control was caused by 
an event described in  Subparagraph (c)(1), on the date first 
subsequent to the date on which the person referred to therein 
does not own securities of the Company representing ten percent 
(10%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then 
outstanding voting securities, having terminated any tender offer 
instituted by him; or
          (2)  If the Threatened Change in Control shall be 
deemed to have occurred by reason of the notice described in 
Subparagraph (c)(2), on the date that a majority of the Present 
Directors and New Directors of the Board of Directors of the 
Company shall have notified the Trustee in writing that the 
Threatened Change in Control has terminated; or
     (e)  The date the Unfriendly Change in Control occurs.  
     SECOND:  Creation of Trust.  (a)  The Company hereby 
establishes with the Trustee and the Trustee hereby accepts a 
trust consisting of the following property (subject to the rights 
of the Company to withdraw such property pursuant to Paragraph 
(f) of this Article SECOND):
          (1)  such cash or other property acceptable to the 
Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to

Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to

Bonus Deferral Account");
          (4)  such cash or other property acceptable to the 
Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to 
time as contributions under the 1984 Bonus Deferral Plan, 
together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation 
thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter called the "1984 
Bonus Deferral Account");
          (5)  such cash or other property acceptable to the 
Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to 
time as contributions under the Key International Management 
Plan, together with the earnings, income, additions and 
appreciation thereon and thereto (all of which is hereinafter 
called the "KIMP Account");
          (6)  such cash or other property acceptable to the 
Trustee as shall be paid or delivered to the Trustee from time to 
time to be used to satisfy future liabilities of the Company with 
regard to the Severance Compensation Agreements of the Company, 
together with the earnings, income, additions and appreciation

"Severance Compensation Agreement Account"); and
          (7)  cash in the amount of 1.5 million dollars 
($1,500,000), together with the earnings thereon, and realized 
and unrealized gains (net of any losses) attributable thereto, 
(all of which is hereinafter called the "Benefits Protection 
Account").  Neither the cash nor any other property held in the 
Benefits Protection Account shall be available for payment of 
benefits to participants and beneficiaries under the Plans.  
     (b)  The Company may contribute to any Account an 
irrevocable letter of credit (hereinafter referred to as a 
"L/C").  The following provisions shall be applicable to any such 
L/C:
          (1)  the L/C shall expire no sooner than two (2) years 
from the date of issuance,
          (2)  the Company shall continue to maintain such L/C in 
effect until it is replaced by cash or another irrevocable L/C or 
the Company withdraws such L/C pursuant to Paragraph (f) of this 
Article SECOND or this Agreement terminates, whichever occurs 
first,
          (3)  the Company shall renew or replace such L/C at 
least thirty (30) days before its expiration for an additional 
period of one (1) year,
          (4)  if such L/C, or any renewal thereof, is not 
renewed or replaced by a L/C delivered to the Trustee at least 
thirty (30) days before the expiration of the predecessor L/C, 
the Trustee may draw down the full amount of such L/C and hold 
the proceeds pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
          (5)  the Trustee may also draw down on such L/C at any 
time the Trustee determines the proceeds of such L/C are 
necessary to allow the Trustee to fulfill its obligations under 
this Agreement,
          (6)  the proceeds of such L/C shall be available to the 
Trustee upon the Trustee's presentation of its sight draft,
          (7)  the Company may, at any time, replace such L/C 
with another irrevocable L/C having substantially similar terms, 
or with an equal amount of cash, or any combination thereof,
          (8)  any L/C shall be issued by a bank (including the 
Trustee) with assets in excess of $2 billion and net worth in 
excess of $100 million, shall be reasonably acceptable to the 
Trustee, and shall be in a form as shall be reasonably acceptable 
to the Trustee.  
     (c)  The Trustee, for investment purposes only, may

the records of the Trustee at all times shall show the 
percentages of the Trust allocable to the Equalization Account, 
the SRIP Account, the 1983 Bonus Deferral Account, the 1984 Bonus 
Deferral Account, the KIMP Account, the Severance Compensation 
Agreement Account, the Benefits Protection Account and such other 
Account(s) as may subsequently be established under this Trust 
(herein referred to collectively as the "Accounts").
      (d)  The assets of the Accounts may be used to discharge 
the obligations of the Company as follows:
          (1)  The assets of the Equalization Account may be used 
to discharge the obligations of the Equalization Plan and, to the 
extent the assets of the SRIP Account are insufficient, the 
obligations of the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan;
          (2)  The assets of the SRIP Account may be used to 
discharge the obligations of the Supplemental Retirement Income 
Plan and, to the extent the assets of the Equalization Account 
are insufficient, the obligations of the Equalization Plan.  
          (3)  The assets of the 1983 Bonus Deferral Account may 
be used to discharge the obligations of the 1983 Bonus Deferral 
Plan and, to the extent the assets of the 1984 Bonus Deferral 
Account are insufficient, the obligations of the 1984 Bonus 
Deferral Plan.  
          (4)  The assets of the 1984 Bonus Deferral Account may 
be used to discharge the obligations of the 1984 Bonus Deferral 
Plan and, to the extent the assets of the 1983 Bonus Deferral 
Account are insufficient, the obligations of the 1983 Bonus 
Deferral Plan.  
          (5)  The assets of the KIMP Account shall be used to 
discharge the obligations of the Key International Management 
Plan.  
          (6)  The assets of the Severance Compensation Agreement 
Account shall be used to discharge the obligations of the Company 
under the Severance Compensation Agreements.  
          (7)  The assets of the Benefits Protection Account may 
be used as set forth in Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH, and 
Article SEVENTH.  
          (8)  After an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs, the 
assets of each Account, upon the termination of the Plan under 
which such Account was established, and the satisfaction of all 
liabilities with regard to such terminated Plan pursuant to 
Paragraph (d) of Article FOURTEENTH, shall be distributed among 
such remaining Account(s), other than the Benefits Protection 
Account, that the Trustee determines may not have sufficient 
assets to pay all future liabilities relating to such Account(s). 
      (e)  The Company and the Trustee agree that the Trust 
created herein shall not be revocable by the Company or by any 
successor thereto during a Threatened Change in Control Period or 
after an Unfriendly Change in Control, and is intended to be a 
grantor trust under the provisions of Sections 671 through 678 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  
      (f)  The Company may, from time to time, add to or withdraw 
from the assets of the Trust, but subject to the termination 
provisions of Article FOURTEENTH hereof, such withdrawal may not 
reduce the property in the Benefits Protection Account of the 
Trust, including any L/C, below 1.5 million dollars ($1,500,000).  
The Company may add funds to the Trust at any time and shall 
designate the Account to which such funds shall be credited.  Any 
such additional funds shall also be available to pay the fees and 
expenses of the Trustee if the amounts transferred pursuant to 
the Benefits Protection Account are exhausted.  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Company shall not make any withdrawal from the 
Trust during a Threatened Change in Control Period or after an 
Unfriendly Change in Control until all liabilities of the Company 
under the Plans are satisfied and all of the purposes of this 
Agreement are fulfilled.  
     THIRD:  Payments from the Trust.  (a)  Subject to Paragraph 
(f) of Article SECOND hereof, Paragraph (b) of this Article THIRD 
and Paragraph (b) of Article FIFTEENTH hereof, the Trustee, from 
time to time upon receipt of direction from the Company prior to 
an Unfriendly Change in Control (other than during a Threatened 
Change in Control Period), shall make payments from the Trust, as 
specified in such direction to such persons, in such manner and 
in such amounts as the Company shall direct, and amounts paid 
pursuant to such direction (or in accordance with Article SEVENTH 
hereof) thereafter no longer shall constitute a part of the 
Trust.  
      (b)  The Company may, from time to time, prior to an 
Unfriendly Change in Control, furnish the Trustee with certain 
information regarding the participants and beneficiaries under 
the Plans and the determination of the benefits under the Plans 
(hereinafter referred to as "Participants Data").  The Trustee 
shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the Participant Data 
provided by the Company prior to an Unfriendly Change in Control, 
and shall have no duty to verify the accuracy thereof.  The 
Company shall, during a Threatened Change in Control Period, and 
after an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs, furnish the Trustee 
with Participant Data at least once each Plan Year.  Such 
Participant Data shall include (1) names, addresses, dates of 
birth, and social security numbers of each participant and 
beneficiary in the Plans; (2) the amount and form of benefits 
under each of the Plans of each participant and beneficiary if 
such participant would retire or die as of either the last day of 
such Plan Year or the last day of the Plan Year in which such 
Participant attained age 62; (3) earnings history, compensation 
(cash and deferred) and bonus history of each participant; (4) 
amounts payable from the Retirement Program Plan for Employees of 
Union Carbide Corporation and its Participating Subsidiary 
Companies on behalf of each participant; (5) a schedule of the 
estimated yearly cash payments under the Plans; and (6) any other 
information regarding the Plan which the Trustee may reasonably 
request or which the Company may deem necessary.  
     During a Threatened Change in Control Period or after an 
Unfriendly Change in Control and notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall, without 
direction from the Company, to the extent funds are available in 
the Trust for such purpose, make payments to participants and 
beneficiaries in such manner and in such amounts as the Trustee 
shall determine they are entitled to be paid under the Plans 
based on the most recent Participant Data furnished to the 
Trustee by the Company prior to an Unfriendly Change in Control 
and any supplemental information furnished to the Trustee by a 
participant or beneficiary upon which the Trustee may reasonably 
rely in making such determination.  The Trustee may make such 
reasonable inquiry of the Company as is necessary to determine 
whether any amounts that would otherwise be payable under this 
Agreement have previously been paid by the Company, and may 
reasonably rely on any information provided by the Company with 
regard to such payment.  A determination by the Trustee with 
regard to a Participant's entitlement to payments under the terms 
of this Agreement shall be binding as to all Participants and the 
Company.  
      (c)  In the event it shall be determined prior to an 
Unfriendly Change in Control that the participants and/or 
beneficiaries of the Plans are subject to any tax under the terms 
of the Trust created hereunder, then the Trustee, upon receipt of 
direction from the Company, shall make payments from the Trust to 
such persons, in such manner and in such amounts as the Company 
shall direct, for purposes of (1) paying the amount of Federal, 
State and Local tax and interest and any penalties thereon which 
such participants and/or beneficiaries may incur arising out of 
such determination or (2) distributing the interests of 
participants and beneficiaries in the Trust.    In the event such 
a determination is made after an Unfriendly Change in Control 
occurs, then each participant or beneficiary who is subject to 
such tax, may direct the Trustee, in writing, to make payments 
from the Trust for either of the purposes set forth in section 
(1) or (2) of the preceding sentence.  The Trustee shall not make 
the payments for the purposes set forth in the first sentence of 
this Paragraph (c) without such written direction.  
      (d)  Payments to participants and beneficiaries pursuant to 
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Article THIRD shall be made by the 
Trustee to the extent that Trust funds for such purposes are 
sufficient to allow such payments.  Subject to Paragraph (d) of 
Article SECOND, in any month in which the Trustee determines that 
a particular Account in the Trust does not have sufficient funds 
to provide for the payment of all amounts otherwise payable to 
participants and beneficiaries in such month under a particular 
Plan, the amount otherwise payable to each such participant or 
beneficiary under such Plan during such month shall be multiplied 
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of funds then 
available for the payment of benefits under such Plan and the 
denominator of which is the total of the benefits payable prior 
to such reduction during such month to all participants and 
beneficiaries under such Plan.  
      (e)  After an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs the 
Company shall make such contributions to the Trust created 
hereunder as shall be necessary to ensure the assets of the Trust 
shall at all times be sufficient to discharge the Company's 
obligations under the Plans.  
     FOURTH:  Management of Trust Assets.  (a)  Subject to 
Paragraph (b) of this Article FOURTH, the Trustee, prior to an 
Unfriendly Change in Control, shall have exclusive authority and 
discretion to manage and control the Trust assets, and pursuant 
to such authority and discretion, may exercise, from time to time 
and at any time, the power:
      (1)  To invest and reinvest the Trust, without distinction 
between principal and income, in shares of stock (whether common 
or preferred) or other evidences of ownership, bonds, debentures, 
notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unsecured or secured by 
mortgages on real or personal property wherever situated 
(including any part interest in a bond and mortgage or note and 
mortgage whether insured or uninsured) and other property, or 
part interest in property, real or personal, foreign or domestic, 
whether or not productive of income or consisting of wasting 
assets, and in order to reduce the rate of interest rate 
fluctuations, contracts, as either buyer or seller, for the 
future delivery of United States Treasury securities and 
comparable Federal-Government-backed securities;
      (2)   To sell, convey, redeem, exchange, grant options for 
the purchase or exchange of, or otherwise dispose of, any real or 
personal property, at public or private sale, for cash or upon 
credit, with or without security, without obligation on the part 
of any person dealing with the Trustee to see to the application 
of the proceeds of or to inquire into the validity, expediency or 
propriety of any such disposition;
      (3)  To manage, operate, repair and improve, and mortgage 
or lease for any length of time any real property held in the 
Trust; to renew or extend any mortgage, upon any terms the 
Trustee may deem expedient; to agree to reduction of the rate of 
interest or any other modification in the terms of any mortgage 
or of any guarantee pertaining to it; to enforce any covenant or 
condition of any mortgage or guarantee or to waive any default in 
the performance thereof; to exercise and enforce any right of 
foreclosure; to bid in property on foreclosure; to take a deed in 
lieu of foreclosure with or without paying consideration therefor 
and in connection therewith to release the obligation on the bond 
secured by the mortgage; and to exercise and enforce in any 
action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity any rights or 
remedies in respect of any mortgage or guarantee;
      (4)  To exercise, personally or by general or limited 
proxy, the right to vote any shares of stock, bonds or other 
securities held in the Trust; to delegate discretionary voting 
power to trustees of a voting trust for any period of time; and 
to exercise, personally or by power of attorney, any other right 
appurtenant to any securities or other property of the Trust;
      (5)  To join in or oppose any reorganization, 
recapitalization, consolidation, merger or liquidation, or any 
plan therefor, or any lease, mortgage or sale of the property of 
any organization the securities of which are held in the Trust; 
to pay from the Trust any assessments, charges or compensation 
specified in any plan of reorganization, recapitalization, 
consolidation, merger or liquidation; to deposit any property 
with any committee or depositary; and to retain any property 
allotted to the Trust in any reorganization, recapitalization, 
consolidation, merger or liquidation;
      (6)  To exercise or sell any conversion or subscription or 
other rights appurtenant to any stock, security or other property 
held in the Trust;
      (7)  To borrow from any lender (including the Trustee in 
its individual capacity) money, in any amount and upon any 
reasonable terms and conditions, for purposes of this Agreement, 
and to pledge or mortgage any property held in the Trust to 
secure the repayment of any such loan;
      (8)  To compromise, settle or arbitrate any claim, debt, or 
obligation of or against the Trust; to enforce or abstain from 
enforcing any right, claim, debt or obligation; and to abandon 
any property determined by it to be worthless;
      (9)  To make loans of securities held in the Trust to 
registered brokers and dealers upon such terms and conditions as 
are permitted by applicable law and regulations, and in each 
instance to permit the securities so lent to be registered in the 
name of the borrower or a nominee of the borrower, provided that 
in each instance the loan is adequately secured and neither the 
borrower nor any affiliate of the borrower has discretionary 
authority or control with respect to the assets of the Trust 
involved in the transaction or renders investment advice with 
respect to those assets; and
      (10)  To invest and reinvest any property in the Trust in 
any other form or type of investment not specifically mentioned 
in this Paragraph (a) of Article FOURTH, so long as such form or 
type of investment is a form or type of investment approved by 
the Principal Financial Officer of the Company, or such other 
officer designated by the Company, for the investment of assets 
of the Trust.  
          (b)  (1)  (A)  The Principal Financial Officer of the 
Company, or such other officer designated by the Company, at any 
time and from time to time may direct the Trustee to segregate 
one or more specified portions of the Trust into a separate 
investment account or accounts (each hereinafter called a 
"Segregated Investment Account"), and may appoint and designate 
an Investment Director to direct the Trustee in the management of 
the assets of each such Segregated Investment Account 
(hereinafter called "that Investment Director's Segregated 
Investment Account").  
          (B)     Any Investment Director appointed by the 
Principal Financial Officer of the Company may be either an 
officer or employee of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliate of 
the Company, or an Investment Manager who is not an officer or 
employee of the Company.  Any Investment Manager so appointed 
must be either (i) an investment adviser registered as such under 
the Investment Advisers Act; or (ii) a bank, as defined in that 
Act; or (iii) an insurance company qualified to perform services 
in the management, acquisition or disposition of the assets of 
the Trust under the laws of more than one State.    The Trustee 
until notified in writing to the contrary shall be fully 
protected in relying upon any written notice of the appointment 
of an Investment Director furnished to it by the Company.  In the 
event of any vacancy in the office of Investment Director, the 
Trustee shall be deemed to be the Investment Director of that 
Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account until an 
Investment Director shall have been duly appointed to direct the 
Trustee in the management of the assets of that Investment 
Director's Segregated Investment Account; and in such event until 
an Investment Director shall have been so appointed and 
qualified, references herein to the Trustee's acting in respect 
of that Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account 
pursuant to direction from the Investment Director shall be 
deemed to authorize the Trustee to act on its own discretion in 
managing and controlling the assets of that Investment Director's 
Segregated Investment Account, and Paragraphs (4) and (5) of this 
Paragraph (b) shall have no effect and shall be disregarded.  
          (2)     Any Investment Director appointed pursuant to 
Paragraph (b) (1) of this Article FOURTH shall have exclusive 
authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of that 
Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account, and pursuant 
to such authority and discretion may direct the Trustee from time 
to time and at any time:
          (A)     To invest and reinvest that Investment 
Director's Segregated Investment Account, without distinction 
between principal and income, in shares of stock (whether common 
or preferred) or other evidences of ownership, bonds, debentures, 
notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unsecured or secured by 
mortgages on real or personal property wherever situated 
(including any part interest in a bond and mortgage or note and 
mortgage whether insured or uninsured) and other property, or 
part interest in property, real or personal, foreign or domestic, 
whether or not productive of income or consisting of wasting 
assets, and in order to reduce the risk of interest rate 
fluctuations, contracts, as either buyer or seller, for the 
future delivery of United States Treasury securities and 
comparable Federal Government-backed securities; provided, 
however, that the Trustee, upon specific directions in writing 
from that Investment Director, shall invest and reinvest some or 
all of the assets of that Investment Director's Segregated 
Investment Account in qualifying securities issued by the Company 
or by an affiliate of the Company, to the extent permitted by the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, unless the 
Trustee shall deem such directed investment or reinvestment to be 
inconsistent with the provisions of Paragraph (a) of Article 
EIGHTH and that the Trustee may retain any such securities 
acquired for that Investment Director's Segregated Investment 
Account at the direction of that Investment Director until that 
Investment Director directs the Trustee to dispose of them; but 
no direction of any Investment Director to sell any securities 
issued by the Company or by an affiliate of the Company shall be 
binding if it would require the Trustee to violate any law 
respecting the public distribution of securities, and, in any 
event, without limiting the generality of the provisions of 
Article NINTH, the Company agrees, to the extent permitted by 
law, to indemnify the Trustee and hold it harmless from and 
against any claim or liability that may be asserted against it, 
otherwise than on account of the Trustee's breach of his own 
duties, by reason of the Trustee's investing in, or reinvesting 
in or selling such securities in accordance with any direction 
from any Investment Director or by reason of the Trustee's 
failure to sell any such securities in the absence of any 
direction from that Investment Director to sell them; and
          (B)     To perform acts similar to those authorized to 
the Trustee in Subparagraphs (2) through (10) of Paragraph (a) of 
this Article FOURTH.  
         (3)     In addition, each Investment Director from time 
to time and at any time may delegate to the Trustee discretionary 
authority to invest and reinvest funds of that Investment 
Director's Segregated Investment Account in debt securities 
(including obligations of the Government of the United States) 
payable on demand or having maturities not exceeding one year or 
in interests in any trust fund that has been or shall be created 
and maintained by the Trustee as trustee for the collective 
short-term investment of funds, the instrument creating such 
trust fund, together with any amendments, modifications or 
supplements thereof, being hereby effective when and as such 
investments are made, incorporated in and made a part of this 
Agreement as fully and to all intents and purposes as if set 
forth herein at length.  
          (4)     The Trustee shall exercise in respect of each 
Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account the powers 
set forth in Paragraph (b) (2) of this Article FOURTH only when 
and to the extent directed in writing by that Investment 
Director.  Each Investment Director, from time to time and at any 
time, may issue orders for the purchase or sale of securities 
directly to a broker or dealer, and for such purpose the Trustee 
will upon request execute and deliver to that Investment Director 
one or more trading authorizations.  Written notification of the 
issuance of each such order shall be given promptly to the 
Trustee by that Investment Director, and the execution of each 
such order shall be confirmed by the broker to that Investment 
Director and to the Trustee.  Such notification shall be 
authority to the Trustee to receive securities purchased against 
payment therefor and to deliver securities sold against receipt 
of the proceeds therefrom, as the case may be.  

          (5)     Unless the Trustee participates knowingly in, 
or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of any 
Investment Director, knowing such act or omission to be a breach 
of the fiduciary responsibility of that Investment Director with 
respect to the Trust, or enables such a breach to occur through 
the Trustee's failure to comply with the Trustee's own duties, 
the Trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission of any 
Investment Director, and shall not be under any obligation to 
invest or otherwise manage the assets of the Trust that are 
subject to the management of any Investment Director.    Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee shall not 
be liable by reason of its taking or refraining from taking at 
the direction of any Investment Director any action in respect of 
that Investment Director's Segregated Fund, pursuant to this 
Paragraph (b), or pursuant to a notification of an order to 
purchase or sell securities for the account of any Investment 
Director's Segregated Investment Account issued by that 
Investment Director, nor shall the Trustee be liable by reason of 
its refraining from taking any action in respect of any 
Investment Director's Segregated Investment Account because of 
the failure of that Investment Director to give such direction or 
order; the Trustee shall be under no duty to question or to make 
inquiries as to any direction or order or failure to give 
direction or order by any Investment Director; and the Trustee 
shall be under no duty to make any review of investments acquired 
for any Investment Manager's Segregated Investment Account at the 
direction or order of that Investment Manager and shall be under 
no duty at any time to make any recommendation with respect to 
disposing of or continuing to retain any such investment.  

          (6)     Without limiting the generality of the 
provisions of Article NINTH, the Company agrees, to the extent 
permitted by law, to indemnify the Trustee and hold it harmless 
from and against any claim or liability that may be asserted 
against it, otherwise than on account of the Trustee's breach of 
his own duties, by reason of the Trustee's taking or refraining 
from taking any action in accordance with this Paragraph (b), 
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any 
claim or liability that may be asserted against the Trustee on 
account of failure to receive securities purchased, or failure to 
deliver securities sold, pursuant to orders issued by an 
Investment Director directly to a broker or dealer.  
     (c)     After an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs and 
subject to Article SIXTH hereof, the Trustee shall have the 
exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the 
Trust assets, and may appoint Investment Managers (as defined in 
Paragraph (b) (1) (A) of this Article FOURTH) including 
affiliates of the Company or the Trustee to manage the investment 
of the Trust assets.  Pursuant to such authority and discretion, 
the Trustee, or any investment manager appointed pursuant to this 
Paragraph (c), may exercise, from time to time and at any time, 
the power to hold or dispose of any assets held by the Trust on 
the date an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs, and shall invest 
and reinvest the Trust, without distinction between principal and 
income, in an immunized or dedicated portfolio of bonds, 
debentures, equipment or collateral trust certificates, notes or 
other evidences of indebtedness, unsecured or secured by 
mortgages on real or personal property wherever situated 
(including any part interest in a bond and mortgage or note and 
mortgage whether insured or uninsured) and any portfolio of other 
property, or part interest in property, real or personal, foreign 
or domestic, such that the rates of return and maturity dates of 
the instruments of such portfolio may reasonably be expected to 
yield assets of the Trust sufficient to discharge the Company's 
obligations under the Plans as set forth in the most recent 
Participant Data (including, without limitation, the information 
specified in clause (5) of Paragraph (b) of Article THIRD hereof) 
furnished to the Trustee prior to such Unfriendly Change in 
Control.  
     FIFTH:  Administrative Powers.  The Trustee shall have and 
in its sole and absolute discretion may exercise from time to 
time and at any time the following administrative powers and 
authority with respect to the Trust:
     (a)     To hold property of the Trust in its own name or in 
the name of a nominee or nominees, without disclosure of the 
Trust, or in bearer form so that it will pass by delivery, but no 
such holding shall relieve the Trustee of its responsibility for 
the safe custody and disposition of the Trust in accordance with 
the provisions of this Agreement; the Trustee's books and records 
shall at all times show that such property is part of the Trust; 
and the Trustee shall be absolutely liable for any loss 
occasioned by the acts of its nominee or nominees with respect to 
securities registered in the name of the nominee or nominees;
     (b)     To continue to hold any property of the Trust 
whether or not productive of income; to reserve from investment 
and keep unproductive of income, without liability for interest, 
cash temporarily awaiting investment and such cash as it deems 
advisable or as the Company from time to time may specify prior 
to an Unfriendly Change in Control in order to meet the 
administrative expenses of the Trust or anticipated distributions 
therefrom;
     (c)     To organize and incorporate under the laws of any 
state it may deem advisable one or more corporations (and to 
acquire an interest in any such corporation that it may have 
organized and incorporated) for the purpose of acquiring and 
holding title to any property, interests or rights that the 
Trustee is authorized to acquire under Article FOURTH hereof;
     (d)     To employ in the management of the Trust suitable 
agents, without liability for any loss occasioned by any such 
agents selected by the Trustee with the care, skill, prudence and 
diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent 
man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters 
would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and 
with like aims;
     (e)     To make, execute and deliver, as Trustee, any deeds, 
conveyances, leases, mortgages, contracts, waivers or other 
instruments in writing that the Trustee may deem necessary or 
desirable in the exercise of its powers under this Agreement; and
     (f)     To do all other acts that the Trustee may deem 
necessary or proper to carry out any of the powers set forth in 
Articles FOURTH, FIFTH, and SIXTH hereof or otherwise in the best 
interests of the Trust.  
     SIXTH:  Insurance and Annuity Contracts.  (a)  The Trustee, 
upon written direction of the Company prior to an Unfriendly 
Change in Control, shall pay from the Trust such sums to such 
insurance company or companies as.  the Company may direct for 
the purpose of procuring participating or nonparticipating 
insurance and/or annuity contracts for the Trust (hereinafter in 
Article SIXTH referred to as "Contracts").  The Company shall 
prepare, or cause to be prepared in such form as it shall 
prescribe, the application for any Contract to be applied for. 
The Trustee shall receive and hold in the Trust, subject to the 
provisions hereinafter set forth in this Article SIXTH, all 
Contracts so obtained.  
     (b)     The Trustee shall be the complete and absolute owner 
of Contracts held in the Trust and, upon written direction of the 
Company prior to an Unfriendly Change in Control, shall have the 
power, without the consent of any other person, to exercise any 
and all of the rights, options or privileges that belong to the 
absolute owner of any Contract held in the Trust or that are 
granted by the terms of any such Contract or by the terms of this 
Agreement.  Prior to an Unfriendly Change in Control, the Trustee 
shall have no discretion with respect to the exercise of any of 
the foregoing powers or to take any other action permitted by any 
Contract held in the Trust, but shall exercise such powers or 
take such action only upon the written direction of the Company 
and the Trustee shall have no duty to exercise any of such powers 
or to take any such action unless and until it shall have 
received such direction.  The Trustee, upon the written direction 
of the Company prior to an Unfriendly Change in Control, shall 
deliver any Contract held in the Trust to such person or persons 
as may be specified in the direction.  
     (c)     The Trustee shall hold in the Trust the proceeds of 
any sale, assignment or surrender of any Contract held in the 
Trust and any and all dividends and other payments of any kind 
received in respect of any Contract held in the Trust.  
     (d)     Upon the written direction of the Company prior to 
an Unfriendly Change in Control, the Trustee shall pay from the 
Trust premiums, assessments, dues, charges and interest, if any, 
upon any Contract held in the Trust.  The Trustee shall have no 
duty to make any such payment unless and until it shall have 
received such direction.  After an Unfriendly Change in Control, 
the Trustee shall pay from the Trust premiums, assessments, dues, 
charges and interest, if any, upon any Contract held in the 
Trust, without direction from the Company.  
     (e)     No insurance company that may issue any Contract or 
Contracts held in the Trust shall be deemed to be a party to this 
Agreement for any purpose, or to be responsible in any way for 
the validity of this Agreement or to have any liability under 
this Agreement other than as stated in each Contract that it may 
issue.  Any insurance company may deal with the Trustee as sole 
owner of any Contract issued by it and held in the Trust, without 
inquiry as to the authority of the Trustee to act, and may accept 
and rely upon any written notice, instruction, direction, 
certificate or other communication from the Trustee believed by 
it to be genuine and to be signed by an officer of the Trustee 
and shall incur no liability or responsibility for so doing.  Any 
sums paid out by any insurance company under any of the terms of 
a Contract issued by it and held in the Trust either to the 
Trustee, or, in accordance with its direction, to any other 
person or persons designated as payees in such Contract shall be 
a full and complete discharge of the liability to pay such sums, 
and the insurance company shall have no obligation to look to the 
disposition of any sums so paid.  No insurance company shall be 
required to look into the terms of this Agreement, to question 
any action of the Trustee or to see that any action of the 
Trustee is authorized by the terms of this Agreement.  
     (f)     Anything contained herein to the contrary 
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be 
liable for the refusal of any insurance company to issue or 
change any Contract or Contracts or to take any other action 
requested by the Trustee; nor for the form, genuineness, 
validity, sufficiency or effect of any Contract or Contracts held 
in the Trust; nor for the act of any person or persons that may 
render any such Contract or Contracts null and void; nor for the 
failure of any insurance company to pay the proceeds and avails 
of any such Contract or Contracts as and when the same shall 
become due and payable; nor for any delay in payment resulting 
from any provision contained in any such Contract or Contracts; 
nor for the fact that for any reason whatsoever (other than their 
own negligence or willful misconduct) any Contract or Contracts 
shall lapse or otherwise become uncollectible.  
     (g)     After an Unfriendly Change in Control, the Trustee 
shall exercise any of the powers set forth in this Article SIXTH 
without direction from the Company, including the power to 
negotiate for and purchase Contracts the rates of return and 
maturity dates of which may reasonably be expected to yield 
assets of the Trust sufficient to discharge any or all of the 
obligations of the Company under the Plans.  
     SEVENTH:  Taxes, Expenses and Compensation of Trustee.  
     (a)     The Company shall pay any Federal, State, Local or 
other taxes imposed or levied with respect to the corpus and/or 
income of the Trust or any part thereof under existing or future 
laws, and the Company, in its discretion, or the Trustee, in its 
discretion, may contest the validity or amount of any tax, 
assessment, claim or demand respecting the Trust or any part 
thereof.  The Trustee shall deduct any payroll taxes required to 
be withheld with respect to any payments made pursuant to the 
Trust.  
      (b)     The Trustee, without direction from the Company, 
shall pay from the Trust the reasonable and necessary expenses 
and compensation of counsel and all other reasonable and 
necessary expenses of managing and administering the Trust that 
are not paid by the Company including, but not limited to, 
Participant record keeping expenses, investment management fees, 
computer time charges, data retrieval and input costs, and 
charges for time expended by personnel of the Trustee in 
fulfilling the Trustee's duties.  
     (c)     The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to 
time such reasonable compensation for its services as trustee as 
is specified in Schedule 3 or as subsequently agreed to by the 
Company and the Trustee, but until paid, such compensation and 
reimbursement for expenses incurred by the Trustee pursuant to 
this Article SEVENTH shall constitute a charge upon the Trust, 
such charge to have priority over any payments due participants 
under the Plans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the 
initial three-year term of this Agreement or any renewal term 
ends during a Threatened Change in Control Period, or after an 
Unfriendly Change in Control, the Trustee's compensation for each 
twelve-month period beginning upon termination of such initial or 
renewal term shall be adjusted for any increases in the cost of 
living by multiplying the rate of compensation at the end of such 
initial or renewal term by a fraction (but not less than one)1 
the numerator of which is the monthly average for such twelve-
month period of the Consumer Price Index for the New York City 
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, as published by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the denominator of which is the 
monthly average of said Consumer Price Index for the last twelve 
months of the initial term, or the last renewal term, if any.  If 
the Consumer Price Index referred to in the preceding sentence is 
hereafter discontinued or revised so that the computation of the 
adjustment cannot be made in the manner hereinabove provided, 
then such other index then published by the United States 
Government, or an agency or department thereof, as shall most 
closely approximate the Consumer Price Index in effect on the 
date hereof, shall be used to make such adjustment.  Any such 
adjustment shall be billed when computed as an additional fee in 
respect of the twelve-month period to which it relates and shall 
be payable within thirty (30) days of the date billed, and the 
Trustee's compensation, as so adjusted, shall become the minimum 
fee for the next succeeding twelve-month period.  
     (d)     After an Unfriendly Change in Control, the Trustee 
shall bill the Company directly, on a monthly basis, for all 
expenses described in Paragraph (b) of this Article SEVENTH and 
all fees described in Paragraph (c) thereof which amounts shall 
be immediately due and payable except as otherwise provided in 
Paragraph (c).  If such amounts are not paid by the Company 
within thirty (30) days of the billing date, the Trustee may pay 
such amounts from the Benefits Protection Account.  The Trustee 
may commence legal action to recover any amount not paid within 
thirty (30) days of the billing date, and shall be obligated to 
commence such an action if the Company's failure to pay causes a 
reduction below $1,500,000 in the assets of the Trust 
attributable to the Benefits Protection Account.  
     EIGHTH:  General Duties of Trustee and Investment Director. 
(a)  Subject to Article FIFTEENTH hereof, the Trustee, any 
Investment Director appointed pursuant to Paragraph (b) of 
Article FOURTH, and any Investment Manager appointed pursuant to 
Paragraph (c) of Article FOURTH, shall discharge their duties 
under this Agreement solely in the interest of the participants 
in the Plans and their beneficiaries and (1) for the exclusive 
purpose of providing benefits to such participants and their 
beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering 
the Plans; and (2) with the care, skill, prudence and diligence 
under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting 
in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in 
the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like 
aims; and (3) by diversifying the investments of the Trust so as 
to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the 
circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; but the duties 
and obligations of the Trustee and any Investment Director shall 
be limited to those expressly imposed upon them by this Agreement 
notwithstanding any reference herein to the Plans or the 
Protected Plans.  
     (b)     The Trustee may consult with counsel, who may be 
counsel for the Company or for the Trustee in its individual 
capacity, and shall not be deemed imprudent by reason of its 
taking or refraining from taking any action in accordance with 
the opinion of counsel.  
     (c)     (1)      Within thirty (30) days after an Unfriendly 
Change in Control, the Company shall notify participants and 
beneficiaries of the Protected Plans in writing of the Trustee's 
availability to aid them in pursuing any claims they may have 
against the Company under the terms of those of the Protected 
Plans under which they are covered.  The Company shall provide 
such notice by using the same method used by Department of Labor 
29 C.  F.  R.  Section 2520.  104b-1(b)(1) as now in effect 
without regard to subsequent amendments.  If the Company fails to 
do so, the Trustee shall provide such notification by placing an 
advertisement in one newspaper of general circulation in each of 
the ten locations in which the largest number of employees are 
located as communicated by the Company to the Trustee prior to an 
Unfriendly Change in Control.  
           (2)     If, after an Unfriendly Change of Control, a 
participant or beneficiary of a Protected Plan notifies the 
Trustee that the Company (or insurance company, contract 
administrator or any other party, if applicable) has refused to 
pay a claim asserted by the participant or beneficiary under any 
of the Protected Plans, and the Trustee determines that the 
assets held in the Accounts are not available to pay such claim, 
then, unless the Trustee shall determine that the claim has no 
basis in law and fact (in which case the Trustee shall notify the 
participant or beneficiary of such determination and shall take 
no further action with respect to the claim), the Trustee:
          (A)     will promptly attempt to negotiate with the 
Company (or insurance company, contract administrator or other 
party, if applicable) to obtain payment, settlement, or other 
disposition of the claim, subject to the consent of the 
participant or beneficiary;
           (B)     will if (i) negotiations fail after sixty (60) 
days of their commencement to result in a payment, settlement or 
other disposition agreeable to the participant or beneficiary 
(hereafter referred to in this Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH as 
the "Plaintiff"), (ii) the Trustee at any time reasonably 
believes further negotiations not to be in the Plaintiff's best 
interest, or (iii) any applicable statute of limitations would 
otherwise expire within sixty (60) days, upon the receipt of 
written authorization from the Plaintiff in substantially the 
form attached as Exhibit A hereto, institute and maintain legal 
proceedings (the "Litigation") against the Company or other 
appropriate person or entity to recover on the claim on behalf of 
the Plaintiff; and
           (C)     may, subject to the written consent of the 
Plaintiff, settle or discontinue the Litigation.  The Trustee 
shall direct the course of the Litigation and shall keep the 
Plaintiff informed of the progress of the Litigation as the 
Trustee deems appropriate, but no less frequently than quarterly. 
If, during the Litigation,
               (i)     the Plaintiff directs in writing that the 
Litigation on behalf of the Plaintiff be settled or discontinued, 
the Trustee shall take all appropriate action to follow such 
direction, provided that the written direction specifies the 
terms and conditions of the settlement or discontinuance, and 
further provided that the Plaintiff, if requested by the Trustee, 
shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a document in a form 
acceptable to the Trustee releasing and holding harmless the 
Trustee from any liability resulting from the Trustees following 
such direction; or
                (ii)     the Plaintiff refuses to consent to the 
settlement or other disposition of the Litigation on terms 
recommended in writing by the Trustee, the Trustee may proceed, 
in its sole and absolute discretion, to take such action as it 
deems appropriate in the Litigation, including settlement or 
discontinuance of the Litigation, provided that the Trustee shall 
afford the Plaintiff at least fourteen (14) days' advance notice 
of any decision to settle or otherwise discontinue the 
Litigation, subject to the provisions of the following sentence. 
       If, at any time, the Plaintiff (x) revokes in writing (in 
substantially the form attached as Exhibit B hereto) the 
authorization of the Trustee to proceed on his behalf and 
delivers such writing to the Trustee and (y) appoints his own 
counsel and so notifies the Trustee in writing, whose fees and 
expenses are not to be paid by the Trust and who shall appear in 
the Litigation on behalf of the Plaintiff in lieu of counsel 
retained by the Trustee, then the Trustee shall not be authorized 
to proceed in the Litigation on behalf of the Plaintiff. 
Thereafter, the Trustee shall have no obligation to proceed 
further on behalf of such Plaintiff or to pay any costs or 
expenses incurred in the Litigation after the date of the 
delivery of such writing.  
       The Trustee is empowered to retain, at the expense of the 
Trust, counsel and other appropriate experts, including actuaries 
and accountants, to aid it in making any determination under this 
Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH and in determining whether to 
pursue or settle any Litigation.  The Trustee shall have the 
discretion to determine the form and nature that any Litigation 
against the Company or other appropriate person or entity shall 
take, and the procedural rules and laws applicable to such 
Litigation shall supersede any inconsistent provision of this 
Agreement.  
           (3)     Subparagraph (c)(2) shall be inapplicable in 
respect of any Litigation involving the payment of benefits under 
any Plan in which the Trustee is named a defendant.  Any 
Plaintiff in an action in which the Trustee is named a defendant 
shall engage his own counsel, whose fees and expenses shall be 
paid by the Plaintiff, provided, however, that the Trustee shall 
pay out of the assets of the Benefits Protection Account of the 
Trust any legal fees and costs awarded to the Plaintiff by a 
court in such Litigation pursuant to Section 502 (g) (1) of 
ERISA.  
          (4)     In the event the Trustee determines that the 
claim of a participant or beneficiary has no basis in law or fact 
and such participant or beneficiary pursues such claim against 
the Company, then the Trustee shall reimburse the participant or 
beneficiary out of the assets of the Benefits Protection Account 
of the Trust for any reasonable legal fees and other reasonable 
costs incurred in pursuing such claim if such participant or 
beneficiary obtains a settlement or final judgment of a court of 
competent jurisdiction under which the participant or beneficiary 
is to receive not less than 50% of the amount originally claimed 
to the Trustee as the amount owed by the Company.  
          (5)     With respect to claims by holders of Severance 
Compensation Agreements, such holders may elect to pursue their 
own claim (with counsel of their choice) or to have the Trustee 
pursue such claim.  In the event such holders elect to pursue 
their own claims, the Trustee shall promptly reimburse such 
holders for all attorneys fees and other expenses incurred to the 
extent the Company does not pay such amounts as provided in the 
Severance Compensation Agreements.  
          (d)      The Company may designate, prior to an 
Unfriendly Change in Control, counsel to be retained by the 
Trustee at the expense of the Trust after an Unfriendly Change in 
Control, to enforce the rights of participants and beneficiaries 
to benefits under the Protected Plans, as described above.  If 
the designated counsel declines to provide representation, or the 
Trustee is not satisfied with the quality of representation 
provided, the Trustee may, from time to time, dismiss the 
designated firm or any successor and engage another qualified law 
firm for this purpose including the same law firm which 
represents the Trustee with respect to its responsibilities as 
Trustee under this Agreement.  The Company may not dismiss or 
engage such counsel or cause the Trustee to engage or dismiss 
such counsel after an Unfriendly Change in Control.  
     NINTH:  Indemnification.  The Company agrees, to the extent 
permitted by law, to indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless from 
and against any liability that it may incur in the administration 
of the Trust, unless arising from the Trustee's own gross 
negligence or willful breach of the provisions of its obligations 
under this Agreement.  The Trustee shall not be required to give 
any bond or any other security for the faithful performance of 
its duties under this Agreement, except as required by law.  
     TENTH:  No Duty To Advance Funds.  The Trustee shall have no 
obligation to advance its own funds for the purposes of 
fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement, and its 
obligation to incur expenses shall at all times be limited to 
amounts in the Trust available to be applied toward such 
expenses.  
     ELEVENTH:  Accounts.  (a)  (1)  The Trustee shall keep 
accurate and detailed accounts of all its receipts, investments 
and disbursements under this Agreement on a calendar year basis, 
accounting for each Account on a separate basis.  Such person or 
persons as the Company shall designate shall be allowed to 
inspect the books of account relating to the Trust upon request 
at any reasonable time during the regular business hours of the 
Trustee.  
           (2)     Within 120 days after the close of each 
calendar year, the Trustee shall transmit to the Company, and 
certify the accuracy of, a written statement of the assets and 
liabilities of the Trust, showing the current value of each asset 
at that date, and a written account of all the Trustee's 
transactions relating to the Trust during the period from the 
last previous accounting to the close of that year.  The report 
of any such valuation shall not constitute a representation by 
the Trustee that the amounts reported as fair market values would 
actually be realized upon the liquidation of the Trust.    For 
the purposes of this Subparagraph, the date of the Trustee's 
resignation or removal as provided in Article THIRTEENTH hereof 
or the date of termination of the Trust as provided in Article 
FOURTEENTH hereof shall be deemed to be the close of a year.  
          (3)     Unless the Company shall have filed with the 
Trustee written exceptions or objections to any such statement 
and account within 60 days after receipt thereof, the Company 
shall be deemed to have approved such statement and account; and 
in such case or upon the written approval by the Company of any 
such statement and account, the Trustee shall be forever released 
and discharged with respect to all matters and things contained 
in such statement and account as though it had been settled by 
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action or 
proceeding to which the Company and all persons having any 
beneficial interest in the Trust were parties.  
     (b)     Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Plans 
shall deprive the Trustee of the right to have a judicial 
settlement of its accounts.  In any proceeding for a judicial 
settlement of the Trustee's accounts or for instructions in 
connection with the Trust, the only other necessary party thereto 
in addition to the Trustee shall be the Company.  If the Trustee 
so elects, it may bring in as a party or parties defendant any 
other person or persons.  No person interested in the Trust, 
other than the Company, shall have a right to compel an 
accounting, judicial or otherwise, by the Trustee, and each such 
person shall be bound by all accountings by the Trustee to the 
Company, as herein provided, as if the account had been settled 
by decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action or 
proceeding to which such person was a party.  
     TWELFTH:  Administration of the Plans; Communications.  (a) 
The Company shall administer the Plans as provided therein and 
subject to Paragraph (b) of Article THIRD and Paragraph (c) of 
Article EIGHTH hereof, or subject to any other delegation by the 
Company and assumption by the Trustee of the duties of 
administering the Plans, the Trustee shall not be responsible in 
any respect for administering the Plans nor shall the Trustee be 
responsible for the adequacy of the Trust to meet and discharge 
all payments and liabilities under the Plans.  The Trustee shall 
be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, 
instruction, direction or other communication signed by an 
officer of the Company who is authorized to execute and deliver, 
in the name and on behalf of the Company, documents or 
instruments relating to the Trust (hereinafter an "Authorized 
Officer").  The Company, from time to time, shall furnish the 
Trustee with the names and specimen signatures of the Authorized 
Officers and shall promptly notify the Trustee of the termination 
of office of any Authorized Officer and the appointment of a 
successor thereto.  Until notified to the contrary, the Trustee 
shall be fully protected in relying upon the most recent list of 
Authorized Officers furnished to it by the Company.  
          (b)     Any action required by any provision of this 
Agreement to be taken by the Board of Directors of the Company 
shall be evidenced by a resolution of such Board of Directors 
certified to the Trustee by the Secretary or an Assistant 
Secretary of the Company under its corporate seal, and the 
Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon any resolution 
so certified to it.  Unless other evidence with respect thereto 
has been specifically prescribed in this Agreement, any other 
action of the Company under any provision of this Agreement, 
including any approval of or exceptions to the Trustee's 
accounts, shall be evidenced by a certificate signed by an 
authorized officer, and the Trustee shall be fully protected in 
relying upon such certificate.  The Trustee may accept a 
certificate signed by an authorized officer as proof of any fact 
or matter that it deems necessary or desirable to have 
established in the administration of the Trust (unless other 
evidence of such fact or matter is expressly prescribed herein), 
and the Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon the 
statements in the certificate.  
            (c)     The Trustee shall be entitled conclusively to 
rely upon any written notice, instruction, direction, certificate 
or other communication believed by it to be genuine and to be 
signed by an authorized officer, and the Trustee shall be under 
no duty to make investigation or inquiry as to the truth or 
accuracy of any statement contained therein.  
          (d)     Until written notice is given to the contrary, 
communications to the Trustee shall be sent to it at its office 
at 450 West 33rd Street, New York, New York 10001; communications 
to the Company shall be sent to it at its office at 39 Old 
Ridgebury Road, Danbury, Connecticut 06817.  
     THIRTEENTH:  Resignation or Removal of Trustee.  (a)   The 
Trustee may resign at any time other than during a Threatened 
Change in Control Period or after an Unfriendly Change in Control 
upon 60 days' written notice to the Company or such shorter 
period as is acceptable to the Company.  During a Threatened 
Change in Control Period or after an Unfriendly Change in 
Control, the Trustee may resign only under one of the following 
circumstances:
          (1)     The Trustee is no longer in the business, or is 
actively in the process of removing itself from the business, of 
acting as trustee for employee benefit plans.  
          (2)     The Trustee determines that a conflict of 
interest exists which would prohibit it from fulfilling its 
duties under this Agreement in an ethically proper manner, and a 
law firm (appointed by the President of the Association of the 
Bar of the City of New York, or by the American Arbitration 
Association, if the President of the Association of the Bar of 
the City of New York fails to so appoint within thirty days of a 
request for such appointment, or notifies the Trustee that it is 
unable to make such appointment) concurs with the Trustee.  The 
Trustee shall use its best efforts to avoid the creation of such 
a conflict.  The decision of such law firm shall be binding, but 
may be appealed in the same manner, and under the same 
conditions, as if it were made by an arbitrator.  All costs 
incurred by the Trustee in connection with obtaining or appealing 
such a decision shall be reimbursable expenses pursuant to 
Article SEVENTH hereof.  
          (3)     The assets of the Trust have been exhausted or 
are insufficient to pay accrued and reasonably anticipated fees 
and expenses of the Trustee hereunder, the Company has refused 
voluntarily to pay the Trustee's accrued fees and expenses as 
required pursuant to Paragraph (d) of Article SEVENTH and the 
Trustee has been unsuccessful in obtaining a court order 
requiring the Company to make such payments or has been unable to 
collect on a judgment for such fees and expenses.  
     Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may resign for 
reasons set forth in (1) or (2) only if it has obtained the 
agreement of a bank with assets in excess of $2 billion and net 
worth in excess of $100 million to replace it as trustee under 
the terms of this Agreement.  The decision rendered under (ii), 
if that is the reason for the Trustee's resignation, may 
expressly excuse the Trustee from this requirement.  In any 
event, the Trustee shall continue to be custodian of the Trust 
assets until the new trustee is in place, and the Trustee shall 
be entitled to expenses and fees through the later of the 
effective date of its resignation as Trustee and the end of its 
custodianship of the Trust assets.  
          (b)     The Company, by action of its Board of 
Directors, may, other than during a Threatened Change in Control 
Period, remove the Trustee before an Unfriendly Change in 
Control, upon 60 days' written notice to the Trustee, or upon 
shorter notice if acceptable to the Trustees but in either event, 
if the removal occurs during the first three years of this 
Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all fees (but not 
expenses) which would have been due the Trustee for the remainder 
of such initial three-year period.  If the removal occurs after 
the first three years of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to 
the Trustee all fees (but not expenses) which would have been due 
the Trustee through the next one-year anniversary of the 
effective date of this Agreement.  The Company may not remove the 
Trustee during a Threatened Change in Control Period or after an 
Unfriendly Change in Control.  In the event it resigns or is 
removed, the Trustee shall have a right to have its accounts 
settled as provided in Article ELEVENTH hereof.  
          (c)     Each successor trustee shall have the powers 
and duties conferred upon the Trustee in this Agreement, and the 
term "Trustee" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to 
include any successor trustee.  Upon designation or appointment 
of a successor trustee, the Trustee shall transfer and deliver 
the Trust to the successor trustee, reserving such sums as the 
Trustee shall deem necessary to defray its expenses in settling 
its accounts, to pay any of its compensation due and unpaid and 
to discharge any obligation of the Trust for which the Trustee 
may be liable.  If the sums so reserved are not sufficient for 
these purposes, the Trustee shall be entitled to recover the 
amount of any deficiency from either the Company or the successor 
trustee, or both.  When the Trust shall have been transferred and 
delivered to the successor trustee and the accounts of the 
Trustee have been settled as provided in Article ELEVENTH hereof, 
the Trustee shall be released and discharged from all further 
accountability or liability for the Trust and shall not be 
responsible in any way for the further disposition of the Trust 
or any part thereof.  
     FOURTEENTH:  Amendment of Agreement; Termination of Trust. 
(a)  Subject to Paragraph (b) of this Article FOURTEENTH, the 
Company expressly reserves the right at any time to amend or 
terminate this Agreement and the Trust created thereby to any 
extent that it may deem advisable.  No amendment shall be made 
without the Trustee's consent thereto in writing if, and to the 
extent that, the effect of such amendment is to increase the 
Trustee's responsibilities hereunder.  Such proposed amendment 
shall be delivered to the Trustee as a written instrument of 
amendment, duly executed and acknowledged by the Company and 
accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of 
Directors of the Company authorizing such amendment.  The Company 
also shall deliver to the Trustee a copy of any modifications or 
amendments to the Plans.  The Trustee's consent shall not be 
required for the termination of the Trust or its removal as 
Trustee.  
          (b)     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement and the Trust created 
thereby may not be amended after the date an Unfriendly Change in 
Control occurs without the written consent of a majority in 
number of participants and beneficiaries.  The Trustee may 
request that the Company furnish evidence to establish that such 
a majority in number of participants and beneficiaries have 
granted written consent to such an amendment.  The Trustee, after 
an Unfriendly Change in Control, upon written advice of counsel, 
may amend the provisions of this Agreement to the extent required 
by applicable law.  The Company reserves the right to amend or 
eliminate this Paragraph (b) of Article FOURTEENTH prior to the 
date of an Unfriendly Change in Control.  
          (c)     In the event the Company terminates the Trust 
prior to the occurrence of an Unfriendly Change in Control, other 
than during a Threatened Change in Control Period, the Trustee 
(subject to the provisions of Paragraph (d) of Article THIRD and 
Article FIFTEENTH hereof and reserving such sums as the Trustee 
shall deem necessary in settling its accounts and to discharge 
any obligation of the Trust for which the Trustee may be liable) 
shall distribute all remaining assets of the Trust in accordance 
with the written directions of the Company.  
            (d)      In case any one or all of the Equalization 
Plan, the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan, the 1983 Bonus 
Deferral Plan, the 1984 Bonus Deferral Plan and the Key 
International Management Plan is terminated in whole or in part 
after an Unfriendly Change in Control occurs, then the Trustee, 
subject to the provisions of Paragraph (d) of Article THIRD, and 
Article FIFTEENTH hereof, and reserving such sums as the Trustee 
shall deem necessary in settling its accounts and to discharge 
any obligation of the Trust for which the Trustee may be liable) 
shall apply or distribute the Account established with regard to 
such Plan pursuant to Paragraph (a) of Article SECOND, in such 
manner and in such amounts as the Trustee shall determine based 
upon the most recent Participant Data (as defined in Paragraph 
(b) of Article THIRD hereof) forwarded by the Company to the 
Trustee prior to such Unfriendly Change in Control and any 
supplemental information furnished to the Trustee by a 
participant or beneficiary upon which the Trustee may reasonably 
rely in making such a determination.  After satisfying all 
liabilities with regard to such terminated Plan, from the Account 
established with regard to such Plan, the Trustee shall 
distribute the remaining assets in such Account in accordance 
with Paragraph (c)(8) of Article SECOND.  Subject to Paragraph 
(b) of Article FIFTEENTH, in the event of an Unfriendly Change in 
Control, the Trust shall continue in effect until the later of 
the fifth one year anniversary of the date on which an Unfriendly 
Change in Control occurs or the date upon which all of the 
participants' and beneficiaries' benefits under all of the Plans 
have been paid or otherwise provided for.  Upon termination of 
the Trust, the Trustee shall have a right to have its account 
settled as provided in Article ELEVENTH hereof.  Any assets 
remaining in the Trust after payment or provision for all 
benefits payable under the Plans, and after the Trustee has 
reserved such sums as it deems necessary for the payment of its 
expenses and fees hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the 
written directions of the Company.  When the Trust assets shall 
have been so applied or distributed and the accounts of the 
Trustee shall have been so settled, the Trustee shall be released 
and discharged from all further accountability or liability 
respecting the Trust.  
     FIFTEENTH:  Prohibition of Diversion.  (a)  Except as 
provided in Paragraph (b) below, at no time prior to the 
satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to the beneficiaries 
under this Trust shall any part of the corpus and/or income of 
the Trust be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for 
the exclusive benefit of such beneficiaries and the assets of the 
Trust shall never inure to the benefit of the Company and shall 
be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to 
participants in the Plans and their beneficiaries and defraying 
reasonable expenses of administering the Plans or performing any 
of the Trustee's duties under this Agreement.  
          (b)     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement 
to the contrary, the assets of the Trust shall at all times be 
subject to claims of the creditors of the Company.  In the event 
that (1) a final judicial determination is entered that the 
Company is unable to pay its debts as such debts mature or (2) 
there shall have been filed by or against the Company in any 
court or other tribunal either of the United States or of any 
State or of any other authority now or hereafter exercising 
jurisdiction, a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings 
or for reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver or 
trustee of all or substantially all of the Company's property 
under the present or any future Federal bankruptcy code or any 
other present or future applicable Federal, State or other 
bankruptcy or insolvency statute or law, then the Trustee shall 
not make payments from the Trust to any participant or 
beneficiary, but under either of such circumstances, the Trustee 
shall deliver any property held in the Trust only as a court or 
other tribunal of competent jurisdiction may direct to satisfy 
the claims of the Company's creditors.  The Trustee shall resume 
payments under the terms of the Trust only after determining that 
the Company is not insolvent or after receiving a judicial 
decision to that effect.  The Principal Financial Officer of the 
Company, or an officer of the Company with duties similar to 
those of a Principal Financial Officer, and the Board of 
Directors of the Company shall have the duty to inform the 
Trustee of the insolvency of the Company.  The Trustee is 
empowered to retain, at the expense of the Trust, counsel and 
other appropriate experts, including accountants, to aid it in 
making any determination with regard to the Company's insolvency 
under this Paragraph (b) of Article FIFTEENTH.  
     SIXTEENTH:  Prohibition of Assignment of Interest.  No 
interest, right or claim in or to any part of the Trust or any 
payment therefrom shall be assignable, transferable or subject to 
sale, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, commutation, anticipation, 
garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, and the 
Trustee shall not recognize any attempt to assign, transfer, 
sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, commute or anticipate the 
same, except to the extent required by law.  
     SEVENTEENTH:  Affiliates.  Any corporation that, directly or 
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or 
is under common control with the Company may adopt and become a 
party to this Agreement by delivering to the Trustee an 
instrument in writing, duly executed and acknowledged, adopting 
and assuming jointly and severally the obligations of the Company 
under this Agreement and constituting and appointing the Company 
to be the agent and attorney in fact of such corporation for the 
purposes of giving or receiving notices, instructions, directions 
and other communications to or from the Trustee and approving the 
accounts of the Trustee, accompanied by duly certified copies of 
resolutions of the Board of Directors of such corporation 
adopting the Plans and approving and authorizing execution, 
acknowledgment and delivery of such instrument and a duly 
certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the 
Company approving and consenting to the same.  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, no Affiliate may become a party to this Agreement 
after an Unfriendly or Threatened Change in Control.  
     EIGHTEENTH:  Miscellaneous.  (a)  This Agreement shall be 
interpreted, construed and enforced, and the trust hereby created 
shall be administered, in accordance with the laws of the United 
States and of the State of New York.  Nothing in this Agreement 
shall be construed to subject either the Trust created hereunder 
or the Plans to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended.  
          (b)     The titles to Articles of this Agreement are 
placed herein for convenience of reference only, and the 
Agreement is not to be construed by reference thereto.  
           (c)     This Agreement shall bind and inure to the 
benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company and the 
Trustee, respectively and the Plans.  
          (d)     This Agreement may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but 
all of which together shall constitute but one instrument, which 
may be sufficiently evidenced by any counterpart.  
          (e)     If any provision of this Agreement is 
determined to be invalid or unenforceable the remaining 
provisions shall not for that reason alone also be determined to 
be invalid or unenforceable.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this 
Agreement to be executed in their respective names by their duly 
authorized officers under their corporate seals as of the day and 
year first above written.

                     Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH of
              Union Carbide Corporation Benefits Protection Trust

TO:     Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company

     This is to authorize the Manufacturers Hanover Trust 
Company, as Trustee of the Union Carbide Corporation Benefits 
Protection Trust (the "Trust"), to institute and maintain legal

other appropriate person or entity to assert the following claim

                Pursuant to Paragraph (c) of Article EIGHTH of
              Union Carbide Corporation Benefits Protection Trust

any time; provided, however, that no such termination of the Plan 
shall alter or impair the rights of a Non-Employee Director to

Section 3:  Participation.  The Participants in the Plan 
("Participants") shall be those Employees serving in a 
managerial, administrative, or professional position who are 
selected to participate in the Plan by the Committee of the Board

pursuant to Section 4. 
Section 4:  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered and 
interpreted by a Committee of three or more members of the Board 
of Directors (hereinafter referred to as the "Committee") 
appointed by the Board.  Members of the Committee are not 
eligible to participate in the Plan and no member may have been 
eligible for selection as a person to whom stock may be allocated 
or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights may be 
granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Corporation 
or any of its affiliates within one year prior to serving on the 
Committee.  All decisions and acts of the Committee shall be 
final and binding upon all Participants.  The Committee shall: 
(i) determine the number and types of awards to be made under the 
Plan; (ii) select the awards to be made to Participants; (iii) 
set the option price, the number of options to be awarded, and 
the number of shares to be awarded out of the total number of 
shares available for award; (iv) delegate to the Chief Executive 
Officer of the Corporation the right to allocate awards among 
Employees who are not officers or directors of the Corporation 
within the meaning of the Exchange Act, such delegation to be 
subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its 
discretion shall determine; (v) establish administrative 
regulations to further the purpose of the Plan; and (vi) take any 
other action desirable or necessary to interpret, construe or 
implement properly the provisions of the Plan.
Section 5:  Awards.  Awards under this Plan may be in any of the 
following forms (or a combination thereof): (i) stock option 
awards; (ii) stock appreciation rights; (iii) exercise payment 
rights; (iv) grants of stock or Restricted Stock; or (v) 
performance awards.  Except as otherwise defined herein, "stock" 
shall mean the common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Corporation. 
All awards shall be made pursuant to award agreements between the 
Participant and the Corporation.  The agreements shall be in such 
form as the Committee approves from time to time.  
     a. Maximum Amount Available.  The total number of shares of 
stock (including Restricted Stock, if any) optioned or granted 
under this Plan during the term of the Plan shall not exceed 
7,500,000 shares.  No Participant may be granted, in the 
aggregate, awards which would result in the Participant receiving 
more than 10% of the maximum number of shares available for award 
under the Plan.  Solely for the purpose of computing the total 
number of shares of stock optioned or granted under this Plan, 
there shall not be counted any shares which have been forfeited 
and any shares covered by an option which, prior to such 
computation, has terminated in accordance with its terms or has 
been canceled by the Participant or the Corporation.
     b.  Adjustment in the Event of Recapitalization, etc.            
In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of the 
Corporation by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, 
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange 
of shares or other similar corporate change or in the event of 
any special distribution to the stockholders, the Committee shall 
make such equitable adjustments in the number of shares and 
prices per share applicable to options then outstanding and in 
the number of shares which are available thereafter for Stock 
Option Awards or other awards, both under the Plan as a whole and 
with respect to individuals, as the Committee determines are 
necessary and appropriate.  Any such adjustment shall be 
conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
Section 6:  Stock Options.
     6.1:  The Corporation may award options to purchase common 
stock or Restricted Stock of the Corporation (hereinafter 
referred to as "Stock Option Awards") to such Participants as the 
Committee, or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, if 
the Committee in its discretion delegates the right to allocate 
awards pursuant to Section 4, authorizes and under such terms as 
the Committee establishes. The Committee shall determine with 
respect to each Stock Option Award and designate in the grant 
whether a Participant is to receive an Incentive Stock Option or 
a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
     6.2:  The option price of each share of stock subject to a 
Stock Option Award shall be specified in the grant, but in no 
event shall the exercise price be less than the closing price of 
the common stock of the Corporation on the date the award is 
authorized as reported in the New York Stock Exchange-Composite 
Transactions.  If the Participant to whom an Incentive Stock 
Option is granted owns, at the time of the grant, more than ten 
percent (10%) of the combined voting power of the Participant's 
employer or a parent or subsidiary of the employer, the option 
price of each share of stock subject to such grant shall be not 
less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the closing price 
described in the preceding sentence.
     6.3:  A stock option by its terms shall not be transferable 
by the Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and 
distribution, and, during the Participant's lifetime, will be 
exercisable only by the Participant.  A stock option by its terms 
also shall be of no more than 10 years' duration, except that an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time 
of the grant, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) 
of the combined voting power of the Participant's employer or a 
parent or subsidiary of the employer shall be by its terms be of 
no more than five (5) years' duration.  A stock option by its 
terms shall be exercisable only after the earliest of:  (i) such 
period of time as the Committee shall determine and specify in 
the grant, but in no event less than one year following the date 
of grant of such award; (ii) the Participant's death; or (iii) a 
Change in Control of the Corporation.   
     An option is only exercisable by a Participant while the 
Participant is in active employment with the Corporation, or its 
subsidiary, except (i) in the case of a Participant's death, 
Retirement or disability;  (ii) during a three-year period 
commencing on the date of a Participant's termination of 
employment by the Corporation other than for cause;  (iii) during 
a three-year period commencing on the date of termination, by the 
Participant or the Corporation, of employment after a Change in 
Control of the Corporation, unless such termination of employment 
is for cause; or (iv) if the Committee decides that it is in the 
best interest of the Corporation to permit individual exceptions. 
An option may not be exercised pursuant to this paragraph after 
the expiration date of the option.
     6.4:  An option may be exercised with respect to part or all 
of the shares subject to the option by giving written notice to 
the Corporation of the exercise of the option.  The option price 
for the shares for which an option is exercised shall be paid on 
or within ten business days after the date of exercise in cash, 
in whole shares of common stock of the Corporation owned by the 
Participant prior to exercising the option, or in a combination 
of cash and such shares of common stock.  The value of any share 
of common stock delivered in payment of the option price shall be 
its Market Price on the date the option is exercised.
     6.5:  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant to 
Participants holding stock options the right to receive with 
respect to each share covered by an option payments of amounts 
equal to the regular cash dividends paid to holders of the 
Company's common stock during the period that the option is 
outstanding (such payments are hereinafter referred to as 
"Dividend Payments").
     6.6:  The aggregate fair market value of all shares of stock 
with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for 
the first time by a Participant in any one calendar year, under 
this Plan or any other stock option plan maintained by the 
Corporation (or by any subsidiary or parent of the Corporation), 
shall not exceed $100,000.  The fair market value of such shares 
of stock shall be the mean of the high and low prices of the 
common stock of the Corporation as reported in the New York Stock 
Exchange - Composite Transactions on the date the related stock 
option is granted (or on the next preceding day such stock was 
traded on a stock exchange included in the New York Stock 
Exchange - Composite Transactions if it was not traded on any 
such exchange on the date the related stock option is granted).
Section 7:  Stock Appreciation Rights.
     7.1:  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant stock 
appreciation rights to Participants who have received a Stock 
Option Award.  The stock appreciation rights may relate to such 
number of shares, not exceeding the number of shares that the 
Participant may acquire upon exercise of a related stock option, 
as the Committee determines in its discretion.  Upon exercise of 
a stock option by a Participant, the stock appreciation rights 
relating to the shares covered by such exercise shall terminate. 
Upon termination or expiration of a stock option, any unexercised 
stock appreciation rights related to that option shall also 
terminate.  Upon exercise of stock appreciation rights, such 
rights and the related option to the extent of an equal number of 
shares shall terminate.
     7.2:  The Committee at its discretion may revoke at any time 
any unexercised stock appreciation rights granted to a 
Participant under this Plan, without compensation to such 
Participant.  Revocation of a Participant's stock appreciation 
rights under this section shall not affect any related stock 
options granted to the Participant under this Plan.
     7.3:  Upon a Participant's exercise of some or all of the 
Participant's stock appreciation rights, the Participant shall 
receive an amount equal to the value of the Stock Appreciation 
for the number of rights exercised, payable in cash, common 
stock, Restricted Stock, or a combination thereof, at the 
discretion of the Committee.
     7.4:  The Committee shall have the discretion either to 
determine the form in which payment of a stock appreciation right 
will be made, or to consent to or disapprove the election of the 
Participant to receive cash in full or partial settlement of the 
right.  Such consent or disapproval may be given at any time 
before or after the election to which it relates.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, if a Participant 
exercises a stock appreciation right during the 60-day period 
commencing on the date of a Change in Control of the Corporation, 
the form of payment of such stock appreciation right shall be 
cash, provided that such stock appreciation right was granted as 
least six months prior to the date of exercise, and shall be 
common stock if such stock appreciation right was granted six 
months or less prior to the date of the exercise.  
     7.5:  Except in the case of a stock appreciation right that 
was granted at least six months prior to exercise and is 
exercised for cash during the 60-day period commencing on the 
date of the Change in Control of the Corporation, any election by 
the Participant to receive cash in full or partial settlement of 
the stock appreciation right, as well as any exercise by the 
Participant of the Participant's stock appreciation right for 
such cash, shall be made only during the period beginning on the 
third business day following the date of release of the quarterly 
or annual summary statements of sales and earnings and ending on 
the twelfth business day following such date.
     7.6:  Settlement for exercised stock appreciation rights may 
be deferred by the Committee in its discretion to such date and 
under such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
     7.7:  A stock appreciation right is only exercisable and 
transferable during the period when the stock option to which it 
is related is also exercisable and transferable, respectively.  
If the Participant is a person subject to Section 16 of the 
Exchange Act, the election to exercise the stock appreciation 
right may not be exercised within six months after the grant of 
the option, unless otherwise permitted by law.
Section 8:  Exercise Payments.
     8.1:  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant to 
Participants holding stock options the right to receive Exercise 
Payments relating to such number of shares covered by the 
Participant's stock options as the Committee determines in its 
discretion.  Exercise Payments shall be reduced by the total 
amount which may have been received as Dividend Payments pursuant 
to Section 6.5 with respect to the stock option that is being 
exercised.
     8.2:  At the discretion of the Committee, the Exercise 
Payment may be made in cash, common stock, Restricted Stock, or a 
combination thereof; provided, however, Exercise Payments may be 
made in cash to Participants subject to Section 16(b) of the 
Exchange Act only if they exercise the related stock option 
during a period beginning on the third business day following the 
date of release of the quarterly or annual summary statements of 
sales and earnings and ending on the twelfth business day 
following such date.  Exercise Payments shall be paid within 20 
business days following the exercise of a related stock option; 
provided, however, that payment may be deferred by the Committee 
in its discretion to such date and under such terms and 
conditions as the Committee may determine.
     8.3:  Exercise Payments shall be paid only upon the exercise 
of related stock options which are exercised by the Participant 
while an active Employee; provided, however, that in the case of 
a Participant's death, Exercise Payments will be paid if the 
related stock options are exercised within nine months after 
death, but before the expiration of the stock option's term.
     In the case of a Participant's Retirement, any exercise 
payments awarded to the Participant will be paid if the stock 
options are exercised within the later of (i) three months after 
Retirement or (ii) three months after such options became 
exercisable, but before the expiration of the term of the stock 
option.
Section 9:  Grants of Stock.
     9.1:  The Committee may grant, either alone or in addition 
to other awards granted under the Plan, shares of stock or 
Restricted Stock to such Participants as the Committee, or the 
Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, if the Committee in 
its discretion delegates the right to allocate awards pursuant to 
Section 4, authorizes and under such terms as the Committee 
establishes.  The Committee, in its discretion, may also make a 
cash payment to a Participant granted shares of stock or 
Restricted Stock under the Plan to allow such Participant to 
satisfy tax obligations arising out of receipt of the stock or 
Restricted Stock.
     9.2:  The Committee from time to time may authorize a 
Participant to elect within 60 days of the receipt of the 
variable compensation payment paid by the Corporation to the 
Participant to deposit with the Corporation shares of common 
stock of the Corporation owned by the Participant with a value on 
the date of deposit not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of 
the variable compensation payment, and receive a matching grant 
of an equal number of shares of Restricted Stock subject to the 
following terms and conditions:
(i)  A Participant may designate shares of 
common stock of the Corporation (exclusive of 
ESOP Stock) held for the Participant's 
account in the Savings Program for Employees 
of Union Carbide Corporation and 
Participating Subsidiary Companies (the 
"Savings Plan") in lieu of depositing shares 
of stock owned by the Participant.

(ii)  The Restricted Stock shall be issued 
and registered in the name of the Participant 
but shall be held in the custody of the 
Corporation until the Restricted Stock 
becomes non-forfeitable;

(iii)  The Restricted Stock shall not be 
transferable until the earlier of (a) three 
years from the date of grant and (b) the date 
the Restricted Stock becomes non-forfeitable;

(iv)  The Restricted Stock shall be forfeited 
by the Participant if the shares of common 
stock deposited with the Corporation (or 
designated pursuant to (i) above) do not 
remain deposited with the Corporation or so 
designated for three years from the date of 
grant; provided, however, that such stock may 
be withdrawn without any resulting forfeiture 
upon the Participant's separation from 
service by reason of death, disability, 
Retirement or termination by the Corporation 
without cause if such separation from service 
occurs within the three year period;

(v)  The Restricted Stock shall be forfeited 
by the Participant if the Participant 
separates from service with the Corporation 
during the three year period from the date of 
grant.  However, if a Participant separates 
from service on account of death, disability, 
or termination by the Corporation without 
cause, the Restricted Stock shall become 
nonforfeitable at the time of such separation 
from service.  If the Participant separates 
from service on account of Retirement, the 
Restricted Stock shall become nonforfeitable 
at the expiration of three years from the 
date of grant, provided the Participant 
complies with clause (iv) above.

(vi)  Dividends paid on the stock held in the 
Participant's Savings Plan accounts and 
utilized for the purpose of obtaining the 
Restricted Stock grant under this Section 9.2 
shall be paid according to the terms of the 
Savings Plan;

(vii)  Dividends paid on the stock deposited 
with the Corporation during the three-year 
period from the date of grant shall be 
distributed to the Participant, or, at the 
Participant's election, reinvested in the 
Union Carbide Dividend Reinvestment and Stock 
Purchase Plan; and

(viii)  Dividends paid on the Restricted 
Stock during the three year period from the 
date of grant shall be held in the custody of 
the Corporation and reinvested on the 
Participant's behalf in common stock of the 
Corporation at its market value at the time 
of purchase; provided, however, that the 
stock so purchased shall be forfeited by the 
Participant if the Restricted Stock to which 
the dividends relate is forfeited.

     This provision does not limit the Committee's authority 
under Section 9.1 to grant Restricted Stock to Participants under 
different terms than those described in this Section 9.2.      
Section 10:  Performance Awards.
     10.1:  The Committee may grant, either alone or in addition

("Performance Awards") to such Participants as the Committee, or 
the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, if the Committee 
in its discretion delegates the right to allocate awards pursuant

establishes.  Performance Awards may be paid in common stock, 
Restricted Stock or other securities of the Company, cash or any 
other form of property as the Committee shall determine.

     11.1:  Any assignment or transfer of any awards without the 
written consent of the Corporation shall be null and void.
     11.2: Nothing contained herein shall require the Corporation 
to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any 
trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or 
deferred amounts payable to any Participant for any year.
     11.3:  Participation in this Plan shall not affect the 
Corporation's right to discharge a Participant.
     11.4:  Restricted Stock may not be sold or transferred by 
the Participant until any restrictions that have been established 
by the Committee have lapsed.
     11.5:  The Participant shall have, with respect to 
Restricted Stock, all of the rights of a stockholder of the 
Corporation, including the right to vote the shares and the right 
to receive any dividends, unless the Committee shall otherwise 
determine.
     11.6:  Upon a Participant's termination of employment during 
the period any restrictions are in effect, all Restricted Stock

effect, Eligible Employees shall be informed of the opportunity 
to participate in this Program.  An Eligible Employee choosing to 
participate in this Program must make an election to do so on or 
before the date designated by the Administrative Committee and 
otherwise in accordance with such procedures as may be 
established by the Administrative Committee. 
     5.2       (a)  While an election to defer Variable 
Compensation under one of the Variable Compensation Plans shall 
be irrevocable when made until the next scheduled annual election 
period, participation in this Program with respect to Variable 
Compensation shall become effective only on the Date of Deferral 
and only if, on such date, the Eligible Employee receives an 
award under one of the Variable Compensation Plans (or would have 
received an award but for an election to defer under this 
Program).
     Variable Compensation awards, if any, for services performed 
in calendar years 1994 and 1995, must be deferred during the 1994 
annual election period.  Variable Compensation awards, if any, 
for services performed in calendar years 1996 and beyond, must be 
deferred during the annual election period immediately preceding 
the calendar year in which such services will be performed. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible Employee who becomes 
eligible to participate in this Program after January 1, 1995 may 
elect to defer a Variable Compensation award during the calendar 
year in which services will be performed; provided, however, he 
or she makes an election to defer within 31 days after becoming 
eligible to participate in this Program.
     (b)  An Eligible Employee must elect to defer his or her 
base salary for services performed in calendar year 1995 during 
the 1994 annual election period.  Participation in this Program

on such date, the Eligible Employee remains employed with the 
Corporation.  Base salary for services performed in calendar 
years 1996, and beyond, must be deferred during the annual 
election period immediately preceding the calendar year in which 
such services will be performed.  A Participant may suspend his 
or her election to defer his or her base salary at any time; 
provided, however, that such Eligible Employee may not resume 
deferrals of base salary until the following calendar year. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible Employee who becomes 
eligible to participate in this Program after January 1, 1995, 
may elect to defer a portion of his or her base salary during the 
calendar year in which services will be performed; provided he or 
she makes an election to defer within 31 days after becoming 
eligible to participate in this Program.
     (c)  A Participant must elect to defer lump sum payments 
that he or she would otherwise receive in accordance with the 
terms of the SRIP or Equalization Plan during the annual election 
period immediately preceding the calendar year in which such 
payments would otherwise be received.
     5.3       (a)  On or before the date designated by the 
Administrative Committee and otherwise in accordance with such 
procedures as may be established, a Participant may elect 
voluntarily to defer (i) up to 100% of the Participant's award 
under the Variable Compensation Plans (in 10% increments), 
(ii) up to 25% of his or her base salary (in 5% increments), 
and/or (iii) up to 100% of his or her lump sum payment from the

calendar year, to defer in the aggregate a minimum of $2,000 of 
his base salary, Variable Compensation, lump sum payment from the 
SRIP or Equalization Plan in order to participate in this 
Program.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Program to the 
contrary, if a Participant fails to defer at least $2,000 of his 
base salary, Variable Compensation, lump sum payment from the 
SRIP or Equalization Plan in any calendar year, the 
Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, require 
such Participant to irrevocably elect to defer a minimum of 
$2,000 in the calendar year immediately following thereafter in 
order to participate in this Program.
     5.4       (a)  The Corporation shall credit a Participant 
with an amount equal to 75% of a Participant's deemed annual 
contribution as determined under subsection (b) of this Section 
5.4.
     (b)  A Participant's deemed annual contribution shall equal 
A multiplied by B, where A and B are as follow:
            A    equals that portion of a Participant's
                 compensation (as defined in Section 1.12 
                 of the Savings Program without regard to 
                 Code Section 401(a)(17), and without regard to
                 any deferrals under this Program), which is
                 between $150,000 and $235,840 and is deferred
                 under this Program.  Such $235,840 shall be
                 adjusted at the same time and in the same manner
                 as the limitation described in Code Section
                 415(d)(3) and such $150,000 shall be adjusted at
                 the same time and in the same manner as the
                 limitation described in Code Section 401(a)(17);
                 and
          B      equals the percentage of such Participant's
                 compensation (as defined under Section 1.12 of
                 the Savings Program) which has been contributed
                 to the Savings Program for the applicable
                 calendar year as a Basic Deduction pursuant to
                 Section 2.7.2 of the Savings Program.
     (c)  The Corporation shall credit each Participant with the 
amount determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 5.4, 
in arrears, on each Deferral Date; provided that such Participant 
remains eligible to participate in this Program and is employed 
by the Corporation on the Deferral Date.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Corporation shall not credit a Participant with 
the amount determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 
5.4 (as of the Participant's termination of employment) if the 
Participant terminates employment with the Corporation during a 
calendar year for any reason, except if the Participant's 
employment is terminated by reason of death, Disability, 
Retirement or termination by the Corporation other than for 
cause.

but has an Unforeseen Emergency, may receive any or all of his or

Control.
     6.2       Form of Payments.  (a)   A Participant may elect

     (b)  A Participant may elect to receive installment payments

payments, such payments shall be made in a lump sum payment.
     (d)  A Participant may change the form of payment previously 
elected only one time and subject to the following restrictions:
             (i)  such election is made in the calendar 
                  year that the Participant terminates
                  employment, to be effective no earlier than 
                  the following calendar year;
             (ii) the election is subject to the consent of the
                  Administrative Committee.

than his or her surviving spouse, such Participant's entire 
account balance under this Program shall be paid in a lump sum 
payment as soon as practical following the Participant's death.
          2.   If a Participant dies at any time after payment of 
his or her account balance under this Program has begun, such 
Participant's Beneficiary shall continue to receive payment of 
the Participant's account in the same manner as the Participant 
elected, or such shorter payment schedule as elected by the 
Beneficiary.
     (f)  If any lump sum distribution otherwise payable under 
this Program would be disallowed in any part as a deduction to 
the Corporation in accordance with Section 162(m) (or a successor 
Section) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Compensation Committee 
may determine to distribute the amount of such benefit in 
installments such that the Participant or Beneficiary shall 
receive the maximum amount permissible in each installment and 
still preserve the Corporation's full tax deduction.
     6.3       Amount of Payment   (a)  If a Participant is 
terminated by the Corporation for cause, he or she shall receive 
the lesser of (A) any amounts he or she actually deferred under

actually deferred under this Program, plus credits to his or her 
account at the Fixed Income Rate from his or her Date of Deferral 
less any previous payments made or (B) his or her account balance

                           BENEFICIARIES

     7.1       A Participant may at any time, and from time to 
time, prior to his or her death designate one or more 
Beneficiaries to receive any payments to be made following the 
Participant's death.  If no such designation is on file with the 
Corporation at the time of a Participant's death, the 
Participant's Beneficiary shall be the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries named in the beneficiary designation most recently 
filed by the Participant under the Corporation's Savings Program. 
If a Participant has not effectively designated a beneficiary 
under the Savings Program, or if no designated beneficiary has 
survived the Participant, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be 
the Participant's surviving spouse, or, if no spouse has survived 
the Participant, the estate of the deceased Participant.  If an 
individual Beneficiary cannot be located for a period of one year 
following the Participant's death, despite mail notification to 
the Beneficiary's last known address, and if the Beneficiary has 
not made a written claim for benefits within such period to the 
Administrative Committee, the Beneficiary shall be treated as 
having predeceased the Participant.  The Administrative Committee 
may require such proof of death and such evidence of the right of 
any person to receive all or part of a deceased Participant 
account balance, as the Administrative Committee may consider 
appropriate.  The Administrative Committee may rely upon any 
direction by the legal representatives of the estate of a 
deceased Participant, without liability to any other person.

                         ARTICLE VIII
                        EARNINGS ACCRUALS
     8.1       Each Participant's account balance under this 
Program shall be credited with earnings from the Date of Deferral 
through the date such deferral is paid out or withdrawn pursuant 
to Section 6.  Earnings under this Section 8.1 shall accrue at 
the rate elected in accordance with Section 8.2.
     8.2       (a)  Earnings accruing in accordance with Section 
8.1 shall accrue at (i) the Fixed Income Rate, (ii) the UCC Stock 
Value Rate, (iii) the UCC Discounted Stock Value Rate, (iv) the 
Applicable Equity Investment Fund Rate or (v) a combination of 
the four rates.  An election to use the UCC Discounted Stock 
Value Rate shall be effective for not less than one (1) year. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant has elected under 
Section 6.1 to receive payment of his or her account balance upon 
termination of employment, and such Participant's employment is 
terminated by the Corporation without cause, such Participant may 
then receive a distribution based on the UCC Discounted Stock 
Value Rate even if one (1) year has not yet passed since the 
relevant Date of Deferral.
     (b)  Subject to subparagraph (c), a Participant shall 
designate at the time of his or her election to defer any amounts 
under this Program which accrual rate or rates shall apply to his 
or her deferrals, including deferrals of matching contributions 
made pursuant to Section 5.4; provided such elections must be in 
whole percentage points.  Such elections shall be effective as of 
the Date of Deferral through the date such deferral is paid out 
or withdrawn pursuant to Article 6. 
     (c)  A Participant may, one time each calendar month, elect 
to change the accrual rate under this Section 8.2 with respect to 
any or all previous deferrals under this Program; provided, 
however, that Participants may elect to utilize the UCC 
Discounted Stock Value Rate with respect to future deferrals 
only, and not for the reallocation of any prior deferrals. 
Participants may utilize the UCC Stock Value Rate only for 
reallocation of previous deferrals.


                          ARTICLE IX

required to, and will not, for the purpose of funding this 
Program, segregate any monies from its general funds, create any 
trusts, or make any special deposits, and the right of a 
Participant or Beneficiary to receive a payment under this 
Program shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured 
general creditor of the Corporation. 
     9.3     Effect of Participation.  Neither selection as a 
Participant, nor an election to participate or participation in 
this Program, shall entitle a Participant to receive awards under

matching contribution under the Savings Program, or affect the 
Corporation's right to discharge a Participant.
     9.4       Communications To Be in Writing.  All elections, 
requests and communications to the Corporation from Participants 
and Beneficiaries, and all communications to such persons from

this Program at any time, but no amendment may be adopted which 
alters the payments due Participants or Beneficiaries, as of the 
date of the amendment, or the times at which payments are due, 
without the consent of each Participant affected by the amendment 
and of each Beneficiary (of a then deceased Participant) affected 
by the amendment.  In addition, any amendment which does not 
increase the Corporation's annual cost of any past or future 
benefits under this Program by more than $500,000, change the 
eligibility requirements, or impact the ability of officers to 
utilize the UCC Discounted Stock Value Rate or the UCC Stock 
Value Rate, may be authorized by the Administrative Committee.
     9.9       Program Termination.  The Compensation Committee 
may terminate this Program for any reason and at any time.  In 
the event of such termination, the accounts of each Participant

      This is an excess long term disability plan (the "Plan") 
for participants in the Union Carbide Corporation Long Term 
Disability Plan (the "LTD Plan").  The Plan has been established 
to restore certain long term disability benefits to those 
participants entitled to benefits under the LTD Plan, whose 
benefits under the LTD Plan are, or will be, limited by the 
restrictions on recognizable compensation imposed by Section 
505(b)(7) of the Code.  The Plan is completely separate from the 
LTD Plan, is unfunded, and is not qualified for special tax 
treatment under the Code.

Term Disability Plan Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary 
Associations, which are used to fund benefits for the LTD Plan.

                       ARTICLE III
                       Eligibility
    Section 1.  An employee will be eligible to receive a Benefit 
under the Plan, if, on or after the Effective Date, such employee 
becomes entitled to benefits under the LTD Plan and the amount of 
such employee's benefits under the LTD Plan are limited because 
the employee's compensation exceeds the limits imposed on the 
VEBA and LTD Plan in accordance with Section 505(b)(7) of the 
Code.  



                          ARTICLE IV

     Section 1.  The monthly amount of Benefit payable to a 
participant shall be the excess, if any, of 
     (a)     the amount of such participant's monthly benefit
     under the LTD Plan computed under the provisions of the LTD
     Plan without regard to the limitations of Section 505(b)(7)
     of the Code, but not exceeding $10,000 per month,
                             over
     (b)     the amount of such participant's monthly benefit
     actually payable under the LTD Plan computed under the
     provisions of the LTD Plan and subject to the limitations of
     Section 505(b)(7) of the Code.

                                ARTICLE V
                                Payments
     Section 1.  Benefits shall be paid to a participant 
commencing with the month in which benefit payments to such 
participant commence under the LTD Plan, and shall cease or be 
suspended at the same time the participant ceases to receive (or 
has suspended) benefits under the LTD Plan.  
     Section 2.  Benefits shall be paid in the same form, and 
with the same adjustments and restrictions, as distributions to 
the participant from the LTD Plan.



                              ARTICLE VI

administration of this Plan and its decision in all matters 
involving the interpretation and application of the Plan shall be

assignment of the rights and interests of a participant or 
survivor under the Plan shall be permitted, nor shall such rights 
be subject to attachment or other legal process or debts.
     Section 4.  The rights of a participant shall be solely 
those of an unsecured creditor of the Corporation.  Any asset 
acquired by the Corporation in connection with the obligations 
assumed by it hereunder shall not be deemed to be held under any 
trust for the benefit of a participant or to be security for the


performance of the obligations of the Corporation, but shall be, 
and remain, a general, unpledged, unrestricted asset of the 
Corporation.
     Section 5.  Nothing contained in this Plan and no action 
taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create or be 
construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary 
relationship between the Corporation and a participant.
     Section 6.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall give any 
participant the right to continue in the employment of the 
Corporation, or affect the right of the Corporation to discharge 
a participant.
     Section 7.  The Plan shall be construed and governed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

At a Glance
Union Carbide Corporation is a basic chemicals company with many of the 
industry's most advanced process technologies and some of the most cost-
efficient, large-scale production facilities in the world. The company also 
produces and markets numerous specialty chemicals from manufactured or 
purchased chemicals, and targets sharply defined market segments for many of 
its technologies.
     Union Carbide buys liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha to make ethylene 
and propylene - basic building-block chemicals (also known as olefins). The 
company then uses state-of-the-art process technologies to convert 
manufactured and purchased ethylene and propylene into products that include 
polyethylene (the world's most widely used plastic); ethylene oxide/glycol and 
derivatives for surfactants, polyester fiber, resin and film, and automobile 
antifreeze; and one of the industry's broadest lines of resins, intermediates, 
emulsions and additives for the paints and coatings, cosmetic and personal 
care, adhesives, household, pharmaceutical, fuel and lube oil additives and 
agricultural products markets. 
     Union Carbide also licenses certain of its key olefins-based technologies 
and offers other specialized technology licensing and services.

Chairman's Letter
Volume Growth, Competitive Advantage Spell Bright Prospects for the Decade

Nothing beats performance for validating a business strategy, and I'm pleased 
to report that Carbide's strategy of backing businesses with significant 
competitive advantage got a ringing endorsement from our 1994 performance.
     Net income available to shareholders from continuing operations rose 145 
percent from the prior year to $379 million, and per share income climbed to 
$2.44 from $1.00.
     Stockholders had another good year as well. Carbide's share price rose 
more than 31 percent for the year to close at $29.38. The increase put our 
stock performance at the top of the Dow Jones list of 30 industrials for the 
second time in the past three years.
     As stockholders know, we've made progress over several years in the teeth 
of the worst chemical industry downturn in memory. We did it mainly through 
massive cost reductions - approaching $575 million at year-end - made possible 
by the drive and initiative of Carbide people, who worked long and hard to 
streamline our major work processes.
     In mid-1994 we began to get help from the marketplace. As supply and 
demand came into better balance in the second half, stronger pricing signaled 
that the worst of the cyclical downturn was behind us. But I'm confident that 
today's Carbide can post highly competitive financial results regardless of 
conditions in the chemical markets. 
     Our operations are lean and efficient. Our people are working flat out, 
with a will to win bred of success. And we're keeping the pressure on costs 
through further work process improvements.
     With costs in line, our financial condition sound and returns exceeding 
our cost of capital, it is clearly time to expand in growing markets for our 
core operations. 
     By spreading fixed costs over larger volumes, and further reducing 
variable costs, we reduce our total cost per pound of product. And when 
billions of pounds of product are involved, shaving just a little off the cost 
of each pound can mean significantly improved profitability and greater 
shareholder value.
     Several internal expansions underway will help. And large productivity 
gains will come from joint ventures, acquisitions and business extensions that 
accelerate growth. We've announced several that will add substantial capacity 
around the world, for an average investment cost far below the cost of 
building new, "greenfield" capacity.
     Our planned joint venture with Petrochemical Industries Company of 
Kuwait, for example, will have a total of more than 3 billion pounds of 
ethylene, polyethylene and ethylene glycol capacity when completed in 1997. 
With an advantaged feedstock position and the benefit of Carbide process 
technologies - so highly prized that they formed part of our equity - venture 
production costs should be among the lowest in the world.
     Two European joint ventures announced in 1994 will add substantial 
volumes in key operations.
     In one, we're joining with EniChem of Italy, Europe's co-leader in 
polyethylene production. The venture, which is subject to approval of the 
European Union, will own all of EniChem's polyethylene operations.  Combined 
capacity of these facilities in Italy, France and Germany is about 3 billion 
pounds a year.
     In another venture, we've joined with Elf Atochem of France to produce 
and market specialty polyethylene compounds primarily for the wire and cable 
industry. The venture will operate about 600 million pounds per year of 
capacity in France by the end of 1995, plus new compounding capacity for wire 
and cable products.
     In a business extension we think has considerable potential for 
profitable growth, we announced plans to build a 200 million-pounds-per-year-
capacity plant in Texas to produce ethylene/propylene rubber. The business is 
a new one for Carbide, but one we enter with a product and cost advantage 
based on our UNIPOL Process technology that could reshape the industry.
     And as the year ended, we agreed to purchase ethylene oxide derivatives 
operations with 330 million pounds of capacity - which we'll expand to about 
600 million pounds - from Imperial Chemical Industries in London. The purchase 
will solidify our position as the industry's leading producer of these 
chemicals, used in fibers, resins, paints and personal care products.
     The combination of internal expansions and joint ventures will increase 
our polyethylene and ethylene glycol capacity by more than 50 percent to 10 
billion pounds by 1997. All the additions will benefit our customers and fit 
neatly with our strategy. All support or extend operations in which Carbide 
already has a significant competitive advantage. All will be advantaged in 
their own right. And all are going forward when the chemical business cycle 
appears to be trending upward.
     Those who recall the deep pessimism many felt about Carbide's future 
after the tragedy in Bhopal, India, in 1984, and the takeover attempt a year 
later that shrank the company by half, will appreciate how much has changed 
since then. We are in some of the same basic businesses, but we are a 
different company in virtually everything but name.
     Dec. 3 marked the 10th anniversary of that terrible event, the result of 
sabotage by a disgruntled employee. Carbide only recently was allowed to sell 
its shares in its former Indian affiliate. Part of the proceeds will be used 
to build and operate a hospital in Bhopal. This is beyond the $470 million 
settlement paid to the Indian government in 1989.
     Another outcome, important for every community where chemicals are made, 
is the RESPONSIBLE CARE initiative adopted by Union Carbide and other chemical 
companies in 35 countries around the world. RESPONSIBLE CARE commits signatory 
companies to a rigorous set of codes and practices designed to improve 
environmental and safety performance.
     Carbide operating policies, safety and environmental reporting, and work 
with community advisory panels all reflect our commitment to those codes and 
practices. Write to our Public Affairs Department for a copy of Carbide's 1994 
RESPONSIBLE CARE progress report.
     On a personal note, C. Peter McColough, who has served on the board with 
distinction since 1979, will not stand for reelection in accordance with the 
board's retirement policy. His wisdom, experience and unswerving support will 
be greatly missed.
     Also, as this report went to press I announced that I'll be ending my 
long and satisfying career with Union Carbide at the end of 1995. In passing 
the baton to President Bill Joyce, who will become chief executive officer in 
April and chairman of the board when I retire, I could not entrust the future 
of this great company to more capable hands.

President's Report
Carbide Boosts Profitability, Accelerates Growth

As 1994 began, the chemical business cycle was still in the cellar, with 
prices and margins near their historic lows. Producers got some modest price 
relief in the second quarter for the simple reason that they could no longer 
withstand the huge losses of the past two years in their commodity operations.
     As the year wore on, the economies of the U.S. and other major markets 
picked up steam, driving up the demand for chemicals and boosting prices.
     At the same time, operating problems at several ethylene production 
facilities in the U.S. tightened raw material supplies, causing prices of 
polyethylene and ethylene glycol, the two highest-volume downstream chemicals, 
to move up in earnest. And Union Carbide, with substantial help from cost 
reductions and operating improvements, benefited handsomely as margins 
improved and sales volumes rose.
     Several years of declining margins in our largest ethylene-based 
commodity chemical operations - ethylene glycol and commodity polyethylene 
resins - overwhelmed even the massive cost reductions Carbide had achieved. 
But results improved substantially as margins began to rebound in the second 
half of the year. The businesses, which had been losing money, were profitable 
in the third and fourth quarters. Sales volume for the ethylene-based 
commodities group rose 6 percent compared to the prior year.
     Carbide's less cyclical businesses, which prospered during the downturn, 
also benefited from the improved economy. They accounted for 56 percent of 
volume and 75 percent of revenues in 1994. The group - consisting of 
industrial performance chemicals, solvents and intermediates, UCAR emulsion 
systems, specialty polymers and products, UNIPOL licensing and specialty 
polyolefins - continued to post a rate of return substantially above the cost 
of capital, a sure sign of robust health.
     Not enough can be said about the contribution Carbide people made to our 
improved performance. They are largely responsible for Carbide successfully 
completing our $575 million cost reduction program by year-end 1994. And at 
year-end they were operating our businesses with great efficiency, introducing 
promising new products and doing more for our customers, while further 
improving Carbide's environmental and safety performance.

Better Work Processes
     Over the past several years, continuous improvement - the notion that 
things can be done better and more efficiently no matter how well they were 
done before - has become ingrained in the Carbide culture. And several new 
initiatives were under way as 1994 ended.
     In one, we eliminated more than $70 million of engineering support and 
installation costs by simplifying the design and construction process, and by 
sharply curtailing engineering work that did not directly support the 
strategies of our individual businesses. The Engineering Excellence initiative 
is targeting additional reductions in engineering support costs, and has a 
capital cost reduction target for 1995 of about $100 million.
     In one such project, associated with our entry into the ethylene/ 
propylene rubber business, we expect to save nearly $30 million in capital 
costs by simplifying product handling systems and using off-the-shelf designs 
where possible instead of starting from scratch, among other improvements.
     Another initiative, called Pathfinder, seeks to reduce product 
distribution costs. Pathfinder eliminated $8 million of annualized costs in 
1994 by finding more efficient ways of getting our products from the 
manufacturing plant to the customer. In one example, we expect to save $6 
million a year through better scheduling and routing, and by ensuring optimum 
loads for the 37,000 railcar shipments Carbide makes each year. Optimum loads 
will mean fewer cars and trips, less cleaning and handling, and lower total 
freight costs.
     We are also applying the reengineering concept to Carbide's research and 
development work. Our scientists and technicians are exploring ways to reduce 
by nearly one-third the time it takes to get newly developed products to the 
marketplace. And they are looking at ways to test product viability at early 
stages of development, so they can halt work quickly when the market outlook 
is doubtful.
     Because we expect work process improvement to be a long-term effort, we 
have formed a team of Carbide people who are permanently assigned as 
reengineering consultants. Their job is to help any group in our system 
identify new opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce costs. With 
Carbide people replacing outside consultants, the cost of doing the 
reengineering will itself be reduced by some 55 percent.
     Along with improved efficiency and lower costs in 1994, many of our 
operations made important advances during the year.
 
Examples include:
     Several value-added polyethylene products introduced by UNIPOL Polymers, 
including a new line of TUFLIN-PLUS film resins with superior puncture- and 
tear-resistance for garbage bags and stretch wrap.
     An 18 percent increase in export sales of telecommunications and power 
cable compounds (by Specialty Polyolefins) mainly to the fast-growing markets 
of the Pacific Rim. And a 40 percent increase in sales of flame-retardant 
cable jacketing and insulation compounds to the maritime and building 
industries.
     Signing of another licensee in Asia (by our UNIPOL Systems group) for our 
UNIPOL Process technology, bringing the new total of Asian licensees to 28 and 
the new worldwide total to 67. Eleven licensees - in Indonesia, China, France, 
Ukraine and the U.S. - are scheduled to start up operations in the 1995-96 
period. When they do, it is estimated that UNIPOL will account for 18.5 
billion pounds of world polyethylene operating capacity, or 18 percent, and 
5.6 billion pounds, or 11 percent, of world polypropylene capacity.
     Introduction in North America by Industrial Performance Chemicals of an 
aircraft anti-icing fluid, called UCAR AAF Ultra. Independent laboratory 
simulations have shown that UCAR Ultra can prevent ice formation on aircraft 
surfaces for at least 90 minutes, nearly three times as long as competing 
materials. A great benefit to aircraft facing long takeoff delays in bad 
weather, UCAR Ultra increased Carbide's share of the anti-icing fluid market 
in 1994 from less than 10 percent to an estimated 50 percent.
     A 9 percent increase in sales volumes of latex emulsions to the 
architectural coatings and waterborne adhesives markets by UCAR Emulsion 
Systems, the result of sharper marketing focus on the industry's fastest-
growing companies. An intensified marketing campaign in the Middle East and 
Southeast Asia that expanded sales volumes in those fast-growing markets by 
more than 10 percent.
     Completion of a plant in South Charleston, W.Va., for the manufacture of 
our line of TRITON specialty surfactants - chemicals that put the cleaning 
power in household and industrial detergents, and ensure even dispersal of 
color in paints and coatings. This state-of-the-art plant, operated by 
Industrial Performance Chemicals, nearly triples the number of specialty 
surfactants Carbide can produce.

Capacity Expansion
     With results improved, our strategies opening new opportunities, and 
employees working hard to make Carbide the preferred supplier in our industry, 
we are accelerating expansion of those operations in which we have a clear 
competitive advantage.
     For example, the new 650 million-pounds-per-year UNIPOL II polyethylene 
production facility under construction at Taft, La., is scheduled to come on 
stream in the second quarter of 1995. Its new resins will enable fabricators 
of industrial liner bags and construction film to make their products with 15 
percent less raw material, or to make products 15 percent stronger with the 
same amount of raw material. And they can do so without costly modifications 
of their fabricating equipment.
     To help customers meet the growing demand for paints and cleaning 
compounds, we completed a 50 percent expansion of production capacity for 
Butyl CARBITOL and Butyl CELLOSOLVE solvents at Seadrift, Tex. We accomplished 
the expansion through technology modifications, with little capital expense.
     We increased capacity for making isophorone at our Institute, W.Va., 
plant by 30 percent. Isophorone is a specialty chemical used in paint and 
agricultural chemicals.
     We're building a new butanol facility at our Taft, La., plant that will 
incorporate the industry's lowest-cost technology and increase our total 
butanol capacity by more than 50 percent. Butanol is a key ingredient in 
paints, coatings and plasticizers. And to help customers keep up with growing 
demand for coatings and adhesives, we began an expansion of our vinyl acetate 
facility in Texas City, Tex., that will increase capacity by 25 percent when 
completed in 1995.
     Other significant expansions include: acrolein derivatives for animal 
feed supplements, fragrances and industrial chemicals; POLYOX water-soluble 
resins used in personal care products, pharmaceuticals and adhesives; 
polyvinyl acetate used for chewing-gum resins and thermoplastic additives; 
specialty ketones used in agricultural chemicals; and alkyl alkanolamines used 
in gas treating, pharmaceuticals and other markets.
     UOP, a company owned equally by Carbide and AlliedSignal, also made a 
good contribution to 1994 results, broadening its product line while 
positioning itself for further growth. UOP provides technology, catalysts and 
related products and services to the oil refining, petrochemical and gas 
industries.
     UOP is doubling worldwide capacity for beaded adsorbents - products that 
selectively adsorb many compounds - through a recently completed expansion at 
its facility in Reggio, Italy, and another expansion under way in Mobile, Ala. 
UOP also acquired Separex Membrane Systems from Hoechst Celanese in 1994, 
expanding its gas processing technology offerings. And in January 1995 it 
acquired UNOCAL's licensing business for process technology.
     All of these initiatives and expansions are occurring in operations with 
strong technology-based competitive advantages. Technology is also a key to 
the advantaged position we believe our new joint ventures will have at start-
up.

New Ventures
     The largest of these, our planned joint venture with Petrochemical 
Industries Company of Kuwait, would combine a substantial raw materials 
advantage with our state-of-the-art polyethylene and ethylene glycol 
processing technologies. The combination will make the venture a formidable 
competitor in world markets. The Kuwait-based venture would have posted 
returns exceeding its cost of capital even at the lowest point of this latest 
cycle, which covered a span of about 7 years.
     Planning and financing for the venture are in the final stages. A Carbide 
management team is in place, contractors have been named and teams of Carbide 
and Kuwaiti engineers are making good progress on design and engineering of 
key units of the world-scale petrochemical complex. The venture is expected to 
start up in 1997.
     Our joint venture with EniChem of Italy, combining UNIPOL Process 
technology with EniChem's European production facilities and marketing 
network, will have all the earmarks of becoming Europe's leading and lowest-
cost polyolefins producer. In February 1995 we announced board-of-director 
approval of the formation of the joint venture company, Polimeri Europa. The 
venture is subject to European Union approval.
     At year-end we completed a joint venture with Elf Atochem of France that 
also combines our technology and experience with our partner's manufacturing 
facilities. In this case we will license the venture to use our UNIPOL Process 
technology, which will double the output of existing facilities. Carbide will 
license other technology to the venture to produce compounds for the wire and 
cable industry in Europe.
     Our customers had asked us to establish a manufacturing presence in 
Europe, so along with the venture's competitive strength, we expect it will 
have a warm welcome. Carbide sales people in Europe will market the wire and 
cable compounds, while Atochem will market the venture's other products.
     A fourth joint venture, with Mitsui of Japan and Far Eastern Textile 
Limited of Taiwan, started up glycol production in September at a new, world-
scale unit at our plant in Alberta, Canada. Production will supply Asia's 
fast-growing textile market. The unit combines raw material and technology 
advantages with a highly efficient distribution system.
We are also expanding through acquisitions, and through entry into related 
businesses.
     In October we announced that Carbide would enter the ethylene/ propylene 
rubber (EPDM) business with a substantial competitive advantage based on our 
UNIPOL Process technology. We expect that manufacturing costs, excluding 
monomer costs, will be about half of competitors', with investment cost well 
under half. In addition, substituting our granular product for the big blocks 
of material supplied by competitors using conventional technology will reduce 
customers' handling and processing costs several cents a pound. Production is 
scheduled to start up at our new, 200 million-pounds-per-year plant at 
Seadrift, Tex., in 1996.
     And at year-end 1994, Carbide announced its intention to acquire certain 
ethylene oxide derivatives operations in Europe from Imperial Chemical 
Industries of London. Carbide is the leading producer of oxide derivatives 
used in polyester fibers and film, paints, solvents, personal care products 
and detergents. The acquisition, completed in February 1995, establishes a 
strong presence for us in Europe, with potential for further expansion in a 
growing market. The newly acquired operations also double Carbide's brake 
fluid capacity, making us one of the world's leading suppliers.
     Carbide reduced its 50 percent interest in UCAR International, a noncore 
business, by half in January 1995.
The advances and expansions of 1994, and the hard work of the past several 
years that made them possible, have brought us measurably closer to our vision 
of Carbide as the low-cost, preferred supplier in our segment of the industry.
     Although Carbide's financial results will continue to reflect turns in 
the chemical business cycle, our performance in 1994 is solid evidence that we 
are a stronger company, better able to withstand the downturns and to profit 
from strong markets.

Summary and Outlook

     In 1994, as well as in the preceding 2 years, Union Carbide's 
profitability benefited from on-going cost reduction programs, increasing 
sales volumes (exclusive of divestitures) and improved partnership and 
corporate joint venture results. Throughout most of the 3-year period, 
however, corporate results were negatively affected by record low margins in 
ethylene oxide/glycol and in polyethylene, the corporation's two largest 
volume products. Strong U.S. and world economic demand, as well as shortages 
in ethylene, caused selling prices for these product lines to increase 
beginning in the third quarter of 1994. These price increases, coupled with 
relatively stable raw material feedstock costs, led to improved margins in the 
second half of 1994.

Highlights of 1994 included:

     Completion of the corporation's $575 million cost reduction program.
     Start up of new ethylene oxide/glycol production facilities in Alberta (a 
joint venture with Asian partners) and new surfactant manufacturing facilities 
in South Charleston, W.Va.
     Formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Elf Atochem of Paris to 
manufacture and sell specialty polyethylene compounds for the European wire 
and cable industry.
     Announcement of a 50-50 joint venture with EniChem of Italy to develop, 
manufacture and sell polyethylene resins in Europe. The venture is subject to 
European Union approval. 
Announcement of  the acquisition of certain ethylene oxide derivatives 
businesses from Imperial Chemical Industries of London. This transaction was 
finalized on Feb. 1, 1995.
     Reduction by one-half of the corporation's 50 percent interest in UCAR 
International for before-tax cash proceeds of $347 million received in January 
1995.
     Doubling the corporation's borrowing capacity to $1.2 billion through new 
lines of credit.

     The increased commodity product margins experienced in the second half of 
1994 are expected to continue through at least the first half of 1995. Whether 
these trends continue beyond that will depend on the strength of U.S. and 
global economies as well as on the availability of ethylene supplies. 
Nonethylene chain businesses should continue to perform well, although any 
slowness in the overall economy may affect their profitability. The reduction 
of the corporation's interest in UCAR International will result in a material 
nonrecurring gain to be recorded in the first quarter of 1995. However, the 
corporation's share of ongoing future earnings from UCAR will be essentially 
eliminated.
     The corporation regularly reviews its assets with the objective of 
maximizing the deployment of resources in core operations. In this regard, UCC 
continues to consider strategies and/or transactions with respect to certain 
noncore assets and other assets not essential to the operation of the business 
that, if implemented, could result in material nonrecurring gains or losses.

1994 Compared with 1993

     Sales revenues increased almost 5 percent from 1993 levels to $4.865 
billion, based on a 7 percent increase in volumes. After decreasing through 
mid-year, average selling prices increased through the third and fourth 
quarters while raw material feedstock prices remained relatively stable 
throughout the year (averaging slightly less than in 1993). Export revenues 
from domestic operations have averaged approximately $565 million in each of 
the past 3 years.
     The corporation's variable margin (sales revenues less variable 
manufacturing and distribution costs) as a percentage of sales rose to 45.8 
percent from 45.6 percent in 1993 reflecting an improvement in ethylene/glycol 
and polyethylene margins in the second half of 1994. Excluding the 
OrganoSilicon business (OSi), sold in July 1993, the 1993 variable margin 
would have been 45.0 percent. The corporation's gross margin (variable margin 
less fixed manufacturing and distribution costs) as a percentage of sales rose 
to 24.5 percent in 1994 as compared with 22.7 percent in 1993 (22.1 percent 
excluding OSi). Fixed manufacturing and distribution costs, excluding OSi, 
remained level versus 1993, notwithstanding the year-to-year increases in 
volume.
     Selling, administration and other expenses (SA&O) continued their 
downward trend as the corporation benefited from its ongoing cost 
reduction/work process improvement programs. SA&O decreased nearly 15 percent 
in 1994 (a 10 percent decline excluding OSi from the 1993 totals) and 
represented less than two-thirds of 1990 spending levels. Research and 
development expenses increased 5 percent (excluding OSi) as a result of a 
number of new developmental projects, including the ethylene/propylene rubber 
program.
     Operating profit in 1994 increased to $551 million from $297 million in 
1993. Nonrecurring gains in 1994 of $81 million on the sale of a manufacturing 
site and distribution terminal in Hong Kong and $24 million on the sale of the 
corporation's preferred stock investment in its former OSi business offset 
charges of $24 million on the write-down and sale of the corporation's 
stockholding in Union Carbide India Limited, a $12 million loss on the sale of 
interests in a uranium mill and mines, and $74 million of litigation costs and 
other costs related to divested operations.

1993 Compared with 1992

     Sales revenues fell 5 percent from 1992 levels to $4.640 billion, largely 
a result of the sale of the OSi business in midyear 1993. The impact of a 
slight improvement in overall volume, excluding the OSi business, was offset 
by weaker pricing, particularly in ethylene glycol and polyethylene.
     The corporation's variable margin as a percentage of sales rose slightly 
in 1993 to 45.6 percent, from 45.5 percent in 1992. Weaker pricing in 
commodity product lines and the absence of margins from the OSi business in 
the second half of 1993 were offset by strong licensing results as well as 
reduced feedstock costs. The corporation's gross margin as a percentage of 
sales was 22.7 percent in 1993, the same as in 1992. After excluding the 
effect of the OSi sale, fixed manufacturing costs decreased 1 percent versus 
the prior year, more than offsetting inflation.
     SA&O continued to decline as a result of ongoing cost reduction/work 
process improvement programs. In 1993 SA&O totaled $340 million, down 11 
percent compared with 1992 (a 5 percent decline excluding the OSi sale). 
Excluding OSi, research and development expenses declined modestly compared 
with 1992. In general, the corporation sought to use work process initiatives 
to improve research and development productivity rather than increasing 
expenditures.
     Operating profit fell 8 percent in 1993 to $297 million. This included a 
gain of $54 million from the sale of the OSi business and a gain of $8 million 
from the sale of a corporate aircraft, offset by a charge of $46 million from 
the shutdown of an ethylene oxide/glycol manufacturing facility at Montreal 
East, Quebec, Canada, a loss of $9 million on the sale of Vitaphore 
Corporation, a medical device company, and a loss of $9 million on the write-
down of a Canadian business.

1992 Compared with 1991

     Sales of $4.872 billion were essentially flat compared with prior year 
sales of $4.877 billion. The impact of increasing volumes in most product 
lines, including ethylene glycol and polyethylene, was more than offset by 
declining prices.
     The corporation's variable margin decreased from 46.1 percent in 1991 to 
45.5 percent in 1992 due to higher feedstock costs. Gross margin as a 
percentage of sales increased from 22.3 percent in 1991 to 22.7 percent in 
1992, due to lower fixed manufacturing costs. In addition, the corporation 
realized overhead cost savings through tight cost controls and work process 
improvements in concert with the profit improvement program.
     Operating profit for 1992 was $324 million. This included a charge of $35 
million for additional severance expense associated with the corporation's 
profit improvement program, and income of $25 million from the settlement of a 
patent infringement case. Operating profit for 1991 totaled $81 million, 
including charges of $165 million for severance and relocation costs, joint 
venture charges, legal costs and the sale and wind-down of the transformer 
retrofill service business of the Unison Transformer Services subsidiary.

Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment
     Worldwide costs relating to environmental protection continue to be 
significant, due primarily to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and 
to the corporation's commitment to industry initiatives such as RESPONSIBLE 
CARE, as well as to its own internal standards. In 1994 worldwide expenses of 
continuing operations related to environmental protection for compliance with 
Federal, state and local laws regulating solid and hazardous wastes and 
discharge of materials to air and water, as well as for waste site remedial 
activities, totaled $153 million. Expenses in 1993 and 1992 were $149 million 
and $150 million, respectively. In addition, worldwide capital expenditures 
relating to environmental protection in 1994 totaled $57 million, compared 
with $51 million and $82 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
     The corporation, like other companies in the U.S., periodically receives 
notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from state 
environmental agencies, as well as claims from other companies, alleging that 
the corporation is a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and 
equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as Superfund) for 
past and future cleanup costs at hazardous waste sites at which the 
corporation is alleged to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous 
substances. The corporation is also undertaking environmental investigation 
and remediation projects at hazardous waste sites located on property 
currently and formerly owned by the corporation pursuant to Superfund, as well 
as to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and equivalent state laws.
     There are approximately 130 hazardous waste sites at which management 
believes it is probable or reasonably possible that the corporation will incur 
liability for investigation and/or remediation costs. The corporation has 
established accruals for those hazardous waste sites where it is probable that 
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be 
estimated. The reliability and precision of the loss estimates are affected by 
numerous factors, such as the stage of site evaluation, the allocation of 
responsibility among PRPs and the assertion of additional claims. The 
corporation adjusts its accruals as new remediation requirements are defined, 
as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made, 
and to reflect new and changing facts. 
     At Dec. 31, 1994, the corporation's accruals for environmental 
remediation totaled $297 million ($265 million in 1993). Approximately 46 
percent of the accrual pertains to closure and postclosure costs for both 
operating and closed facilities. Additionally, environmental loss 
contingencies of $147 million in excess of amounts accrued existed at Dec. 31, 
1994 ($115 million in 1993).
     Estimates of future costs of environmental protection are necessarily 
imprecise, due to numerous uncertainties. These include the impact of new laws 
and regulations, the availability and application of new and diverse 
technologies, the identification of new hazardous waste sites at which the 
corporation may be a PRP and, in the case of Superfund sites, the ultimate 
allocation of costs among PRPs and the final determination of the remedial 
requirements. While estimating such future costs is inherently imprecise, 
taking into consideration the corporation's experience to date regarding 
environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known, the 
corporation estimates that worldwide expenses related to environmental 
protection, expressed in 1994 dollars, should average about $152 million 
annually over the next 5 years. 
     Worldwide capital expenditures for environmental protection, also 
expressed in 1994 dollars, are expected to average about $53 million annually 
over the same period. Management anticipates that future annual costs for 
environmental protection after 1999 will continue at levels comparable to the 
5-year average estimates.
     Subject to the inherent imprecision and uncertainties in estimating and 
predicting future costs of environmental protection, it is management's 
opinion that any future annual costs for environmental protection in excess of 
the 5-year average estimates stated here, plus those costs anticipated to 
continue thereafter, would not have a material adverse effect on the 
corporation's consolidated financial position. However, such excess costs, if 
any, could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of 
operations in a given quarter or year.

Litigation

     The corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in a 
number of legal proceedings and claims with both private and governmental 
parties. These cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, 
product liability; governmental regulatory proceedings; health, safety and 
environmental matters; employment; patents; contracts and taxes. In addition, 
the corporation is one of a number of defendants named in an increasing number 
of lawsuits, some of which have more than one plaintiff, involving silicone 
gel breast implants. The corporation supplied bulk silicone materials to 
certain companies that at various times were involved in the manufacture of 
breast implants. These cases are discussed in more detail in the Commitments 
and Contingencies note to the financial statements. In some of these legal 
proceedings and claims, the cost of remedies that may be sought or damages 
claimed is substantial. While it is impossible at this time to determine with 
certainty the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceedings and claims, 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable 
losses with respect thereto and that such ultimate outcome, after provisions 
therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated 
financial position of the corporation, but could have a material effect on 
consolidated results of operations in a given quarter or year. Should any 
losses be sustained in connection with any of such legal proceedings and 
claims, in excess of provisions therefor, they will be charged to income in 
the future.

Interest Expense

     Interest expense rose $10 million in 1994 to $80 million due to rising 
interest rates. In 1993 interest expense totaled $70 million, a decrease of 
$76 million from 1992. The decrease resulted primarily from reduction and 
refinancing of debt and benefits of lower rates from interest rate hedging 
activity. 

Partnerships and Corporate Joint Ventures 

     The corporation has for many years participated in a number of businesses 
through 50 percent-owned partnerships and corporate joint ventures. On a 
combined basis, the unconsolidated sales of these entities exceeded $2.8 
billion in 1994. The most significant of these businesses include:

Partnerships:
UOP - a worldwide supplier of process technology catalysts, molecular sieves 
and adsorbents.
Petromont - a Canadian polyolefins producer.
Union Carbide/Shell Polypropylene - a U.S.-based producer of specialty 
polypropylene and licenser of polypropylene technology.
World Ethanol - a U.S.-based supplier of ethanol.

Corporate Joint Ventures:
UCAR International - a worldwide supplier of carbon and graphite electrodes 
and carbon specialties. Effective Jan. 26, 1995, the corporation's ownership 
interest in UCAR International was reduced to 25 percent.
Nippon Unicar - a Japan-based producer of commodity and specialty polyolefins.

     Following is a summary of partnership and corporate joint venture results 
for the past 3 years.

     Partnership income increased during the 3-year period, largely due to 
improved results from the polyethylene and polypropylene partnerships. 
Earnings from UOP, our largest partnership, remained relatively stable over 
the period. The significant improvement in UCC share of net income of 
corporate ventures was largely due to improved results from UCAR.
     On Dec. 31, 1994, the corporation and Elf Atochem of Paris concluded the 
formation of a new partnership to produce and sell specialty polyolefins in 
Europe. The corporation has also announced a planned joint venture with 
Petrochemical Industries of Kuwait to produce ethylene, polyethylene and 
ethylene oxide/glycol in Kuwait, as well as approval of the formation, subject 
to European Union approval, of a joint venture with EniChem of Italy to 
produce ethylene and polyethylene in Italy, France and Germany. In addition, 
in late 1994, a new joint venture with Mitsui of Japan and Far Eastern Textile 
Limited of Taiwan started up a 660 million-pound-per-year-capacity ethylene 
glycol plant in Alberta, Canada.

Provision for Income Taxes

     The effective tax rate for 1994 decreased to 29.1 percent from 34.4 
percent in 1993 as a result of lower taxes for operations outside the U.S. 
(1993 was unusually high due to taxes provided on the sale of certain OSi 
international subsidiaries) and a reduction for state and local income taxes. 
The corporation's tax rate of 25.3 percent in 1992 reflected research and 
development credits, foreign sales corporation benefits, reduced taxes from 
joint venture partnerships and income from foreign affiliates taxed at lower 
than statutory rates.

Income from Discontinued Operations
     Income from discontinued operations for 1992 included the net income of 
Praxair for the first six months of 1992, prior to the June 30 spin-off. At 
that time Praxair became a separate public company. 

Accounting Changes
     In 1994 the corporation adopted FAS 115, "Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The effect of the adoption was 
immaterial. In 1993 the corporation recorded a noncash after-tax charge of $97 
million as a result of adopting FAS 112. The charge represents the cumulative 
effect of the accounting standard and is set forth separately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. In 1992 the corporation recorded a noncash 
after-tax charge of $360 million as a result of adopting FAS 106 and a tax 
charge of $1 million as a result of adopting FAS 109.


LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA
Cash Flow from Operations
     Cash flow from operations increased by $104 million to $561 million in 
1994, as compared with 1993, primarily due to a significant increase in 
operating earnings partially offset by working capital increases consistent 
with increased sales.

Cash Flow from (Used for) Investing
     Cash flow from (used for) investing includes capital expenditures, 
investments, proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses and net cash 
received from Praxair.
     Capital expenditures totaled $409 million in 1994, compared with $395 
million in 1993 and $359 million in 1992. Major domestic capital projects in 
1994 include the UNIPOL II unit at Taft (Star Plant), La., the butanol unit at 
Taft, La., a bulk chemicals storage facility in Bedford Park, Ill., and the 
TRITON surfactants unit at the South Charleston, W.Va., facility.
     Over the past 3 years, 34 percent of capital expenditures was directed at 
new capacity, 48 percent to cost reduction and replacement, and 18 percent to 
environmental, safety and health facilities. Of these expenditures, 90 percent 
were in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
     Investments during 1994 totaling $16 million included a $26 million 
investment in a Brazilian ethylene company and a return of investment of $30 
million from a financing affiliate. Investments during 1993 totaled $39 
million, including a $13 million investment in Petromont. Investments in 1992 
included $30 million to a financing affiliate.
     Proceeds from sale of fixed and other assets in 1994 of $138 million 
include $84 million from the sale of the Hong Kong terminal property and $13 
million from the divestiture of the corporation's specialty electronic 
materials business and its interest in a Zimbabwe mining and smelting 
operation. Proceeds from the sale of investments included $86 million from the 
sale of the corporation's preferred stock investment in OSi.
     In 1993 proceeds from the sale of fixed and other assets included $220 
million related to the sale of the OSi business and $18 million from the sale 
of a corporate aircraft. In 1992 proceeds included receipt of $50 million from 
a licensee in settlement of a receivable and $9 million relating to the sale 
of an aircraft. Proceeds from the sale of investments in 1992 included $44 
million from the sale of the corporation's investment in a casualty insurance 
company, $32 million from the sale of a Canadian investment and $17 million 
from the remaining interest in KEMET Electronics.
     At Dec. 31, 1994, the cost of completing authorized construction projects 
was estimated to be $406 million, of which $30 million is covered by firm 
commitments. Future construction expenditures are anticipated to be sourced 
through operating cash flows and borrowings.
     During 1995 the corporation will make significant investments in joint 
ventures. The cost of these investments is expected to be funded from 
operating cash flows as well as proceeds from the UCAR transaction.

Cash Flow Used for Financing
     Cash flow used for financing includes stockholder dividends, funds used 
to buy back common stock and debt reduction, offset in part by proceeds from 
sales of common stock pursuant to the corporation's dividend reinvestment plan 
and its employee savings and incentive programs.
     Cash flow used for financing in 1994 totaled $360 million compared to 
$378 million in 1993 and $1.041 billion in 1992. Over the past 3 years, cash 
totaling $1.233 billion was used to reduce debt to its present level of $946 
million. In addition, pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors, the 
corporation has periodically repurchased shares of its common stock. In 1994, 
11.6 million shares were repurchased for $337 million at an average effective 
price of $29.03 per share. In the previous year, 3.7 million shares were 
repurchased for $70 million at an average effective price of $18.87 per share.
     On Nov. 4, 1994, the corporation entered into 2 new credit agreements 
with a group of banks, replacing an existing $600 million agreement. One of 
the new agreements provides the corporation with $1 billion in credit for the 
next 5 years, and the other agreement provides $200 million for 364 days. 
Several options are available to borrow at various rates on a revolving basis. 
At Dec. 31, 1994, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit 
agreements.

a) The OrganoSilicon business was included in the results of the corporation 
until its sale in July 1993. b) Fully diluted per share amounts are not 
presented where amounts are antidilutive. c) Prices are based on New York 
Stock Exchange Composite Transactions. d) On June 30, 1992, the corporation 
completed the spin-off of Praxair, distributing to holders of common stock one 
share of Praxair common stock for each share of UCC common stock. The high and 
low presented in the table for 1992 represent the value of the common stock 
after the spin-off. The high for the year before the spin-off was $29.63; the 
low before the spin-off was $20.13. e) Return on capital is computed by 
dividing income by beginning of year capital. Income consists of income from 
continuing operations, less preferred dividends, plus after-tax interest cost 
(net of interest income received from Praxair), plus income from minority 
interests. Capital consists of the components described below, adjusted for 
the corporation's Praxair-related assets and the cumulative effect of the 
changes in accounting principles.

Total debt consists of short-term debt, long-term debt and current portion of 
long-term debt. Total capital consists of total debt plus minority 
stockholders' equity in consolidated subsidiaries and UCC stockholders' 
equity.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include 
the accounts of all significant subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 20 percent- 
to 50 percent-owned companies and partnerships are carried at equity in net 
assets. Other investments are carried generally at cost.
     On April 27, 1994, stockholders voted to approve the merger of Union 
Carbide Corporation (UCC) into Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Company 
Inc. (UCC&P). The merger was effective May 1, 1994. Immediately after the 
merger, UCC&P had the same consolidated assets, liabilities and stockholders' 
equity as the corporation. UCC&P changed its name to Union Carbide 
Corporation.

Accounting and Reporting Changes - Effective Jan. 1, 1994, the corporation 
adopted Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 115, "Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The effect of the adoption of FAS 
115 was immaterial. Effective Jan. 1, 1993, the corporation adopted FAS 112, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The cumulative effect of 
the change in the method of accounting for postemployment benefits is reported 
in the 1993 Consolidated Statement of Income. Effective Jan. 1, 1992, the 
corporation adopted FAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions," and FAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The 
cumulative effects of the changes in the method of accounting for 
postretirement benefits and income taxes are reported in the 1992 Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Foreign Currency Translation - Unrealized gains and losses resulting from 
translating foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars 
generally are accumulated in an equity account on the balance sheet until such 
time as the subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated, 
except for Latin America. Translation gains and losses relating to operations 
located in Latin American countries, where hyperinflation exists, are included 
in the income statement until hyperinflation ceases.

Financial Instruments - Financial instruments are used to hedge financial risk 
caused by fluctuating interest and currency rates. The amounts to be paid or 
received on interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements (FRAs) 
that hedge debt accrue and are recognized over the lives of the agreements. 
Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency 
options used to hedge firm commitments are deferred and recognized as part of 
the related foreign currency transactions.
     Interest rate swaps and FRAs, which are designated to offset earnings 
fluctuations due to cyclical business conditions, and foreign currency forward 
contracts, which are designated to offset earnings fluctuations from 
anticipated foreign currency cash flows, are marked to market and the results 
recognized immediately as other income or other expense.

Cash Equivalents - The corporation considers as cash equivalents all highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in 
value because of changes in interest rates.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at cost or market, whichever is lower. 
These amounts do not include depreciation and amortization, the impact of 
which is not significant to the financial statements. 
     Approximately 65 percent of inventory amounts before application of the 
LIFO method at Dec. 31, 1994 (66 percent at Dec. 31, 1993) have been valued on 
the LIFO basis; the "average cost" method is used for the balance. It is 
estimated that if inventories had been valued at current costs, they would 
have been approximately $275 million and $287 million higher than reported at 
Dec. 31, 1994, and Dec. 31, 1993, respectively. 

Fixed Assets - Fixed assets are carried at cost. Expenditures for replacements 
are capitalized, and the replaced items are retired. Gains and losses from the 
sale of property are included in income.
     Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. The corporation and 
its subsidiaries generally use accelerated depreciation methods for tax 
purposes where appropriate.

Patents, Trademarks and Goodwill - Amounts paid for purchased patents and 
newly acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the net assets of 
such businesses have been charged to patents, trademarks and goodwill. The 
portion of such amounts determined to be attributable to patents is amortized 
over their remaining lives, while trademarks and goodwill are amortized over 
the estimated period of benefit, generally 5 to 20 years.

Research and Development - Research and development costs are charged to 
expense as incurred. Depreciation expense applicable to research and 
development facilities and equipment is included in Depreciation and 
amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Income ($13 million in 1994, $12 
million in 1993 and $13 million in 1992).

Income Taxes - Provisions have been made, pursuant to FAS 109, for deferred 
income taxes based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of 
assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates and regulations.

Environmental Costs - Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized 
as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures 
relating to an existing condition caused by past operations and having no 
future economic benefits are expensed. Environmental expenditures include site 
investigation, physical remediation, operation and maintenance, and legal and 
administrative costs. Environmental accruals are established for sites where 
it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
reasonably be estimated. Where the estimate is a range and no amount within 
the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the corporation accrues 
the minimum amount in the range.

Retirement Programs - The cost of pension benefits under the U.S. Retirement 
Program is determined by an independent actuarial firm using the projected 
unit credit actuarial cost method, with an unrecognized net asset at Jan. 1, 
1986, amortized over 15 years. Contributions to this program are made in 
accordance with the regulations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974. 
     Pursuant to FAS 106, the cost of postretirement benefits are recognized 
on the accrual basis over the period in which employees become eligible for 
benefits. 

Earnings per Common Share - Primary earnings per common share is computed by 
dividing net income (loss) - common stockholders, excluding tax benefits 
related to unallocated preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding during the year and common stock 
equivalents related to dilutive stock options. Fully diluted earnings per 
common share is computed by dividing adjusted net income (loss) - common 
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, 
common stock equivalents related to dilutive stock options, and common shares 
issuable upon conversion of debentures and convertible preferred stock.


2. Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are estimated by using a method that 
indicates the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation 
sale. The fair values of the financial instruments included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet were estimated as follows: 

Cash, Short-Term Receivables and Accounts Payable - At Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, 
the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of 
these instruments. The corporation had foreign currency forward contracts of 
$67 million at Dec. 31, 1994, hedging fluctuations in short-term foreign 
currency receivables and payables by offsetting the effects of currency 
changes in these accounts. Deferred gains and losses on these contracts are 
not material.

Investments - The corporation's investments in equity companies, partnerships 
and other businesses generally involve joint ventures for which it is not 
practicable to determine fair values. The corporation purchased a currency 
option ($50 million notional amount, expiring March 1995) to hedge partially a 
committed foreign currency transaction related to an investment in a joint 
venture. 

Long-Term Receivables - The fair values of long-term receivables are 
calculated using current interest rates and consideration of underlying 
collateral where appropriate. The fair values approximate the carrying value 
of $200 million and $96 million reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 
Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 

Debt - The corporation uses various types of financial instruments to manage 
exposure to financial market risk caused by interest rate fluctuations. Such 
instruments include interest rate swaps and FRAs. See Note 10 for a discussion 
of debt instruments. 

Other Financial Instruments - Interest rate swaps and FRAs, which were 
designated to offset earnings fluctuations due to cyclical business 
conditions, were carried at fair market value. At Dec. 31, 1993, the net 
notional amount of interest rate swaps was $615 million and the net notional 
amount of related FRAs was $1.3 billion. In the first half of 1994, as the 
risk of cyclically higher interest rates increased, the corporation unwound 
its positions in these instruments, resulting in a before-tax charge to Other 
expense - net of $9 million. 
     Outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used as a means of 
offsetting earnings fluctuations from anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
totaled $182 million at Dec. 31, 1994 ($269 million at Dec. 31, 1993). During 
1994 their fair values averaged a $1 million loss. Total net losses associated 
with these contracts were $6 million.

Carrying and Fair Values - The carrying values and fair values of the 
corporation's investments, receivables and debt financial instruments at Dec. 
31, 1994 and 1993 are summarized in the table below. Fair values are based on 
quoted market values, where available, or discounted cash flows (principally 
long-term debt). Individually and in total, other derivative positions, 
interest rate swaps, FRAs and open forward currency contracts and options had 
a nominal carrying amount and fair value. Put stock options on equity 
securities are discussed in Note 12.

5. Spin-off of Praxair, Inc.
On June 30, 1992, the corporation completed the spin-off of its industrial 
gases subsidiary, Praxair, Inc. Under the terms of the spin-off, UCC 
distributed to its holders of common stock 1 share of Praxair common stock and 
an associated Praxair common stock purchase right for each share of UCC common 
stock. The conversion prices of the corporation's convertible preferred stock 
and common stock purchase rights were adjusted for the dilutive effects of the 
spin-off (see Notes 11 and 12). For the first 6 months of 1992, Praxair had 
sales of $1.315 billion, provision for income taxes of $43 million and net 
income of $67 million.

     Net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $91 million ($78 million in 
1993) are included in Deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net 
current deferred tax assets of $129 million ($170 million in 1993) are 
included in Prepaid expenses. Net noncurrent deferred tax assets of $7 million 
(none in 1993) are included in Other assets. In 1994 there were $6 million in 
non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards included in the deferred tax assets 
above. There were $8 million at Dec. 31, 1993, offset by a valuation allowance 
of $2 million. There were no alternate minimum tax credit carryforwards in 
1994 ($10 million were included in deferred tax assets in 1993). 
     Undistributed earnings of affiliates intended to be reinvested 
indefinitely amounted to approximately $374 million at Dec. 31, 1994 ($350 
million at Dec. 31, 1993). Determination of deferred taxes related to these 
earnings is not practicable.
     The consolidated effective income tax rate was 29.1 percent in 1994, 34.4

     On Nov. 4, 1994, the corporation entered into 2 new credit agreements 
with a group of banks, replacing an existing $600 million agreement. One of 
the new agreements provides the corporation with $1 billion in credit for the 
next 5 years, and the other agreement provides $200 million for 364 days. 
Several options are available to borrow at various rates on a revolving basis. 
At Dec. 31, 1994, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit 
agreements. Interest rates on credit agreements are floating interest rates 
based on LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), CD (Certificate of Deposit), 
or Bank Reference Rate. There were no borrowings under the credit agreements 
in 1994 and 1993.
     The bank credit agreements contain covenants, normal for this type of 
agreement, that place certain limits on the ability of UCC to merge with 
another entity, incur debt or create liens on assets, and that require the 
corporation to meet net worth, leverage and interest coverage tests. Other 
indentures also restrict the corporation from incurring liens to secure debt.
     Pollution control and other facility obligations represent state, 
commonwealth and local governmental bond financing of pollution control and 
other facilities, and are treated for accounting and tax purposes as debt of 
the corporation. These tax-exempt obligations mature at various dates from 
1996 through 2023, and have an average annual effective rate of 7.3 percent.
     During the first half of 1994, to reduce exposure to rising interest 
rates, the corporation terminated substantially all of its interest rate swaps 
and FRAs used as hedges to manage exposure to financial market risk caused by 
interest rate fluctuations on debt. A net charge of $19 million ($13 million 
after-tax) resulting from these terminations was deferred and is being 
amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the underlying 
instruments, which have various maturity dates through the year 2002. At Dec. 
31, 1994, $16 million of the deferred loss remained, and it will be amortized 
as follows: $7 million in 1995, $3 million in 1996, and the balance from 1997 
through 2002.
     At Dec. 31, 1994, the corporation had 2 open swap positions totaling $48 
million ($625 million at Dec. 31, 1993) for which the corporation receives a 
fixed rate and pays a floating rate. The corporation had no open FRAs at Dec. 
31, 1994 ($1.7 billion at Dec. 31, 1993). The corporation's exposure to 
counterparty creditworthiness is not material. 
     The average and effective interest rates in 1994 on the corporation's 
fixed rate debt, other than pollution control and other facility obligations, 
were 7.5 percent.
     At Dec. 31, 1994, $40 million of consolidated assets were pledged as 
security for $36 million of subsidiaries' debt.
Payments due on long-term debt in the 4 years following 1995 are: 1996, $20 
million; 1997, $5 million; 1998, $5 million; and 1999, $180 million.


11. Convertible Preferred Stock
The Union Carbide Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is an 
integral part of the Savings Program for employees. On Jan. 1, 1991, the Trust 
for the ESOP purchased 15.1 million shares of a new series of convertible 
preferred stock (ESOP stock) from the corporation for $325 million. Each share 
of ESOP stock is convertible into and has the same voting rights as 1 share of 
the corporation's common stock, and is protected from dilution. The annual 
preferred dividend is $0.794 per share.
     Prior to the spin-off of Praxair in 1992, the corporation repurchased and 
retired 7.5 million shares of unallocated ESOP stock from the ESOP's trustee 
for $202 million, and unearned employee compensation was reduced accordingly. 
Also in connection with the spin-off, approximately 1 million shares of the 
ESOP stock held by individuals who became employees of Praxair were redeemed 
for Union Carbide Corporation common stock.
     At the date of the spin-off of Praxair, the conversion price, liquidation 
price and annual preferred dividend of the ESOP stock were adjusted and a 
special ESOP stock dividend of 10.5 million shares was issued so that the 
interests of the ESOP stockholders were not diluted.
     Substantially all full-time employees in the U.S. are eligible to 
participate in the ESOP through the corporation's matching contribution of 50 
percent (75 percent beginning Jan. 1, 1995) on eligible employee 
contributions. At the corporation's option, ESOP shares may be redeemed either 
in cash or the corporation's common stock when employees make withdrawals from 
their accounts. It has been UCC's policy to redeem ESOP shares with cash.
     The cost of the ESOP is recognized as incurred and was $6 million in 1994 
($6 million in 1993 and $16 million in 1992). Reductions in ESOP costs in 1993 
were due primarily to appreciation in the corporation's common stock and to 
the spin-off of Praxair. At Dec. 31, 1994, 16.4 million preferred shares were 
outstanding, 4.8 million of which were credited to employees' accounts, 
including 0.8 million credited during 1994.


12. UCC Stockholders' Equity 
At Dec. 31, 1994, Retained earnings included $134 million ($108 million at 
Dec. 31, 1993), representing the corporation's share of undistributed earnings 
of 20 percent- to 50 percent-owned companies accounted for by the equity 
method. Dividends received from companies carried at equity aggregated $128 
million in 1994 ($92 million in 1993 and $64 million in 1992). At Dec. 31, 
1994, restrictions on the transfer of funds from consolidated subsidiaries to 
the parent were not material.
     In July 1989 the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and 
declared a dividend, payable on Aug. 31, 1989, of one Right for each 
outstanding share of common stock. Each Right entitles its holder, under 
certain circumstances, to buy a share of common stock at a purchase price of 
$37.67 (subject to adjustment).
     The Rights may not be exercised until 10 days after a person or group 
acquires 20 percent or more of UCC's common stock, or announces a tender offer 
that, if consummated, would result in 20 percent or more ownership of the 
common stock. 
     Until then, separate Rights certificates will not be issued, nor will the 
Rights be traded separately from the stock.
     Should an acquirer become the beneficial owner of 20 percent of the 
common stock, and under certain additional circumstances, Union Carbide 
Corporation stockholders (other than the acquirer) would have the right to buy 
common stock in Union Carbide Corporation, or in the surviving enterprise if 
the corporation is acquired, having a value equal to 2 times the purchase 
price of the Right then in effect.
     The Rights will expire on Aug. 31, 1999, unless redeemed prior to that 
date. The redemption price is $0.01 per Right. The corporation's independent 
directors may redeem the Rights by a majority vote during the 10-day period 
following public announcement that a person or group has acquired 20 percent 
of UCC's common stock.
On July 27, 1994, the board of directors announced that it had authorized the 
repurchase of an additional 10 million shares of UCC common stock, bringing to 
20 million shares the total number authorized for repurchase. The repurchase 
program, which began in the first quarter of 1993 with an initial 
authorization of 10 million shares, was carried out to minimize future 
earnings dilution due to common stock requirements under certain employee 
benefit plans. Through Dec. 31, 1994, the corporation had repurchased 
15,312,260 shares at an average effective price of $26.59 per share. On Feb. 
6, 1995, the board of directors increased the number of shares that may be 
repurchased under the program to an aggregate of 30 million shares. Additional 
share repurchases under the repurchase program will be made over an unlimited 
period in a manner consistent with the combination of corporate cash flow and 
market conditions.
     In conjunction with the corporation's common stock buyback program, put 
options were sold in a series of private placements entitling the holders to 
sell 4.8 million shares of common stock to UCC, at specified prices upon 
exercise of the options. Since inception of this program through Dec. 31, 
1994, options representing 3,663,800 common shares have expired unexercised, 
and options representing 986,200 shares were exercised for $30 million, or an 
average of $30.88 per share. Options representing 150,000 shares remain 
outstanding at Dec. 31, 1994. Premiums received since inception of the program 
have reduced the average price of repurchased shares to $26.59 per share from 
$26.84 per share.


13. Leases

Leases that meet the criteria for capitalization have been classified and 
accounted for as capital leases. For operating leases, primarily involving 
facilities and distribution equipment, the future minimum rental payments 
under leases with remaining noncancelable terms in excess of 1 year are:
Year ending     Millions of dollars
1995                           $ 84
1996                             68
1997                             67
1998                             55
1999                             52
Subsequent to 1999              338
Total minimum payments          664
Future sublease rentals         130
Net Minimum Rental Commitments $534

     The present value of the net minimum rental commitments amounts to $335 
million. Total lease and rental payments (net of sublease rental of $20 
million in 1994, and $10 million in 1993 and 1992) were $65 million, $98 
million and $92 million for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The corporation 
is contingently required to pay certain domestic lease obligations assigned to 
Praxair, in the event of Praxair's default, the present value of which totals 
$21 million. If such a payment is required, the corporation has a legal right 
to set off any such amounts paid against amounts it may owe to Praxair.


14. Retirement Programs
Pension Benefits
The noncontributory defined benefit retirement program of Union Carbide 
Corporation ("U.S. Retirement Program") covers substantially all U.S. 
employees and certain employees in other countries. Pension benefits are based 
primarily on years of service and compensation levels prior to retirement.
     Pension coverage for employees of the corporation's non-U.S. consolidated 
subsidiaries is provided through separate plans, to the extent deemed 
appropriate. Obligations under such plans are principally provided for by 
depositing funds with trustees.
     Worldwide Retirement Program net pension cost applicable to continuing 
operations amounted to $21 million in 1994, $20 million in 1993 and $22 
million in 1992. Net pension cost for discontinued operations amounted to $8 
million through June 30, 1992 (see Note 5).
     The components of net pension cost for the U.S. Retirement Program and 
non-U.S. plans are as follows:
Millions of dollars               1994              1993               1992(a)

The funded status of the U.S. Retirement Program and non-U.S. plans was as 
follows:

     Pension obligations are valued using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality 
Table. The actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
                                            1994      1993
Discount rate for determining projected
  benefit obligation                        8.50%     7.00%
Rate of increase in compensation levels     5.75%     4.25%
Expected long-term rate of return on 
  plan assets                               8.50%     8.25%


Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide health 
care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees and their 
eligible dependents. These benefits are provided through various insurance 
companies and health care providers. 
     FAS 106 was adopted in the fourth quarter of 1992, effective Jan. 1, 
1992, for U.S. and international employees. The standard requires employers to 
account for retiree benefit obligations on an accrual basis rather than on a 
"pay-as-you-go" basis. The cumulative effect of adopting FAS 106 as of Jan. 1, 
1992, resulted in a charge of $360 million to 1992 earnings, net of $205 
million of income taxes ($2.72 per share). 
     The obligation is determined by application of the terms of health and 
life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health 
care cost trends that are projected to increase annually at rates of 13.5 
percent in 1994, 12.5 percent in 1995, reduced incrementally to 7 percent in 
2004 and thereafter.
     The effect of a 1 percent annual increase in the assumed health care cost 
trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation 
at Dec. 31, 1994, by $15 million and the aggregate of service and interest 
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs by $2 million. 
Measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was based on 
the same assumptions used in the pension calculations referred to on page 33.
     During 1993 the corporation made changes to its health care programs, 
principally related to plan eligibility requirements for active employees. 
These changes resulted in a reduction of the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligations.
     The corporation has funded postretirement benefits for certain retirees 
who retired prior to Dec. 31, 1988. The funds are invested primarily in common 
stocks and fixed income securities. 
     The following tables provide information on the status of the plans.
     The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost are as 
follows:
Millions of dollars              1994        1993        1992

     Benefit Cost                $ 21        $ 21        $ 51

The status of the postretirement benefit obligation was as follows:
Millions of dollars at December 31,         1994     1993
Accumulated postretirement benefit 
     obligations:
  Retirees                                  $354     $347

Accrued Unfunded Postretirement 
  Benefit Obligations                       $522     $519

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for retirees is net of 
$130 million at Dec. 31, 1994 ($145 million at Dec. 31, 1993) related to all 
retirees, which is reimbursed to the corporation in part from Praxair and UCAR 
under benefit-sharing agreements.

Deferred Compensation Plan
During 1994 the board of directors approved an unfunded, nonqualified deferred 
compensation plan for certain key employees, who may defer a portion of their 
gross pay beginning Jan. 1, 1995. The corporation's obligation to employees 
will be adjusted to reflect changes in the market values of employees' 
investment choices. With limited exceptions, participants' deferred account 
balances are scheduled for payment at or after full retirement.

Postemployment Benefits
The cumulative effect of adopting FAS 112 as of Jan. 1, 1993, resulted in a 
$97 million after-tax charge to 1993 earnings ($0.64 per common share). FAS 
112 requires that postemployment benefits expected to be paid before 
retirement, principally severance, be accrued over employees' working lives. 
This charge includes postemployment benefits based on normal year-to-year 
attrition rates, giving effect to the corporation's cost reduction program as 
of Jan. 1, 1993. Prior year financial statements were not restated.


15. Incentive Plans
In 1994 stockholders approved the 1994 Union Carbide Long-Term Incentive Plan 
for key employees, which replaced the 1988 Union Carbide Long-Term Incentive 
Plan. The new incentive plan, effective until the 1997 shareholders' meeting, 
provides for granting incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock 
appreciation rights, exercise payment rights, grants of stock, including 
restricted stock, and performance awards. Holders of options may be granted 
the right to receive payments of amounts equal to the regular cash dividends 
paid to holders of the corporation's common stock during the period an option 
is outstanding. The number of shares granted or subject to options cannot 
exceed 7.5 million under the plan. Option prices are equal to the closing 
price of the corporation's common stock on the date of the grant, as listed on 
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions. Options generally become 
exercisable 2 years after such date. Options may not have a duration of more 
than 10 years. Restricted stock award shares to be issued in 1995 will be 
entitled to vote and dividends will be credited to the holder's account, but 
these shares will be nontransferable for 3 years after the grant date. These 
restricted stock awards and accumulated dividends are subject to forfeiture if 
matching employee-owned stock on deposit with the corporation is withdrawn or 
if other conditions are not met. Performance awards may be paid in common 
stock, cash or any other form of property. No stock appreciation rights or 
performance awards were granted in 1994.
     No further awards can be made under either the 1988 or 1984 plan 
programs. Options granted under both plans are still outstanding and have 
terms similar to nonqualified stock options under the 1994 plan.

Changes during 1994 in outstanding shares under option were as follows:
        Shares (in thousands)
1994                          Total
Outstanding at January 1     14,112
Granted                       1,930
Exercised                    (2,213)
Canceled or expired             (22)
Outstanding at 
     December 31             13,807

     Options outstanding at Dec. 31, 1994, ranged in price from $1.00 to 
$28.625 per share with a weighted average price of $15.702 per share, as 
adjusted for the distribution of Praxair stock in accordance with the terms of 
the plan, for options outstanding prior to July 1, 1992. At Dec. 31, 1994, 6.5 
million options were generally exercisable at prices ranging from $1.00 to 
$11.368 per share, with a weighted average price of $9.089 per share. Options 
were exercised during 1994 at prices ranging from $1.00 to $16.75 per share.


16. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Agreements - The corporation has 3 major agreements for the purchase 
of ethylene-related products and 3 other purchase agreements in the U.S. and 
Canada. The net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of 
obligations under these purchase commitments at Dec. 31, 1994 (at current 
exchange rates, where applicable) are presented in the following table.

Millions of dollars
1995                              $  80
1996                                 71
1997                                 61
1998                                 54
1999                                 47
2000 to expiration of contracts     132
Total                              $445

Environmental - The corporation is subject to loss contingencies resulting 
from environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to remove 
or mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of 
certain wastes and substances at various sites. The corporation has 
established accruals for those hazardous waste sites where it is probable that 
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be 
estimated. The reliability and precision of the loss estimates are affected by 
numerous factors, such as different stages of site evaluation, the allocation 
of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the assertion of 
additional claims. The corporation adjusts its accruals as new remediation 
requirements are defined, as information becomes available permitting 
reasonable estimates to be made, and to reflect new and changing facts. 
     At Dec. 31, 1994, the corporation had established environmental 
remediation accruals in the amount of $297 million ($265 million in 1993), of 
which $235 million is classified as Other long-term obligations ($214 million 
in 1993). Approximately 46 percent of the corporation's environmental accrual 
at Dec. 31, 1994, pertained to closure and postclosure costs for both 
operating and closed facilities. In addition, the corporation had 
environmental loss contingencies of $147 million at Dec. 31, 1994 ($115 
million at Dec. 31, 1993).

Other - The corporation sold certain receivables with recourse to various 
banks for proceeds of $101 million in 1994 ($270 million in 1993). At Dec. 31, 
1994, approximately $11 million remained due ($47 million in 1993). The fair 
value of the recourse provisions at Dec. 31, 1994, approximates the carrying 
value.
     The corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries had additional 
contingent obligations at Dec. 31, 1994, totaling $83 million, of which $35 
million related to guarantees of debt.

Litigation - The corporation's stock in Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) has 
been sold for the Indian rupee equivalent of $92 million. Of that amount the 
equivalent of approximately $15 million went to The Bhopal Hospital Trust, 
which, with other funding from unremitted dividends and UCIL, discharged the 
corporation's and UCIL's commitment for funding, in the amount of 
approximately $19 million, a hospital to be built in Bhopal by the Government 
of India. The remainder of the proceeds of the sale of the stock, after 
payment of certain expenses of the transaction, is subject to attachment in 
the pending criminal proceedings against the corporation in Bhopal, in which 
the corporation has not appeared. The corporation had earlier reduced the 
carrying value of its stock in UCIL to zero. In the opinion of counsel for the 
corporation, under generally recognized legal principles, the criminal 
proceedings in India should not have adverse financial consequences for the 
corporation outside of India.
     The corporation provisionally joined a multibillion-dollar silicone 
breast implant litigation settlement agreement. Union Carbide's contribution 
to the settlement will be $138 million over the next several years. The 
corporation has previously taken before-tax charges aggregating $35 million 
for this litigation. Although insurance coverage is subject to issues as to 
scope and application of policies, retention limits, exclusions and policy 
limits, and the insurers have reserved their right to deny coverage, the 
corporation believes that after probable insurance recoveries neither the 
settlement nor ongoing litigation outside the settlement will have a material 
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the corporation. The 
corporation was not a manufacturer of breast implants but did supply generic 
bulk silicone materials to the industry. Also, in 1990 the corporation 
acquired and in 1992 divested the stock of a small specialty silicones company 
which, among other things, supplied silicone gel intermediates and silicone 
dispersions for breast implants.
     The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court, 
Northern District of Alabama. A number of appeals have been filed that will 
delay implementation and might require settlement terms to be reconsidered. 
Both the corporation and the other companies which are parties to the 
agreement have the right to withdraw from the settlement if, among other 
factors, in their individual judgment, there are too few recipients of breast 
implants covered by the final settlement.
     In addition, the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are 
involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims with both private and 
governmental parties. These cover a wide range of matters, including, but not 
limited to: product liability; governmental regulatory proceedings; health, 
safety and environmental matters; employment; patents; contracts; and taxes. 
In some of these legal proceedings and claims, the cost of remedies that may 
be sought or damages claimed is substantial.
     While it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the 
ultimate outcome of any legal proceedings and claims referred to in this note, 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable 
losses with respect thereto and that such ultimate outcome, after provisions 
therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated 
financial position of the corporation but could have a material effect on 
consolidated results of operations in a given quarter or year. Should any 
losses be sustained in connection with any of such legal proceedings and 
claims in excess of provisions therefor, they will be charged to income in the 
future.


17. Subsequent Events
The corporation regularly reviews its assets with the objective of maximizing 
the deployment of resources in core operations. In this regard, UCC continues 
to consider strategies and/or transactions with respect to certain noncore 
assets and other assets not essential to the operation of the business that, 
if implemented, could result in material nonrecurring gains or losses. As part 
of this process, on Jan. 26, 1995, the corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation 
reached an agreement for the sale of newly issued common stock of UCAR 
International Inc. to a new company formed by Blackstone Capital Partners II 
Merchant Banking Fund L.P. and a repurchase of certain shares by UCAR that 
resulted in Blackstone acquiring a 75 percent interest in UCAR. The 
corporation received $347 million in cash proceeds and retained a 25 percent 
equity interest in UCAR. This transaction resulted in a nonrecurring material 
gain to be recorded in the first quarter of 1995 and essentially eliminates 
the corporation's share of ongoing future earnings from UCAR.
     On Feb. 1, 1995, the corporation purchased certain ethylene oxide 
derivative businesses from Imperial Chemical Industries of London.
     On Feb. 9, 1995, the corporation and EniChem of Milan, Italy, announced 
that their boards of directors had approved the formation of Polimeri Europa, 
S.r.l., a 50-50 joint venture company to produce and market polyethylene in 
Europe. The formation is subject to the approval of the European Union.


Management's Statement of Responsibility for Financial Statements
Union Carbide Corporation's financial statements are prepared by management, 
which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The 
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts 
that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this 
annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements. 
     The corporation maintains accounting systems, including internal 
accounting controls monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are 
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial 
records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is 
based on recognition that the cost of a system must not exceed the related 
benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the 
careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of 
authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business 
ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for 
coordinating the management of corporate resources and the leadership and 
commitment of top management. 
     The corporation's financial statements are audited by KPMG Peat Marwick 
LLP, independent certified public accountants, in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards. These standards provide for the auditors to 
consider the corporation's internal control structure to the extent they deem 
necessary in order to issue their opinion on the financial statements. 
     The Audit Committee of the board of directors, which consists solely of 
nonemployee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the 
accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial 
statements. The Audit Committee recommends to the board of directors the 
selection of the independent auditors, subject to the approval of 
stockholders. The Audit Committee periodically meets with the independent 
auditors, management and internal auditors to review and evaluate their 
accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities. 
The independent and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit 
Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.

Independent Auditors' Report
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Union Carbide Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Union Carbide 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended Dec. 31, 1994. These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union 
Carbide Corporation and subsidiaries at Dec. 31, 1994 and 1993, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the 
three-year period ended Dec. 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 
the company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits and 
in 1992 its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other than 
pensions and income taxes.

A Chemical Glossary
Monomer - a reactive chemical that can be converted into a polymer. For 
example, ethylene is a monomer that is made into polyethylene.

Polymer - a chain or network made up of many monomer units, such as ethylene. 
All plastics are polymers.

Ethylene - a reactive chemical made from natural gas or crude oil components. 
In Carbide's olefins units, ethylene is the starting material from which many 
of the company's chemical products are made.

Propylene - a basic chemical made from crude oil or natural gas components. It 
is used as a starting material to produce many of Carbide's chemical products.

Olefins - the generic name for ethylene, propylene and other unsaturated 
hydrocarbons made from components of crude oil or natural gas. Olefins are the 
starting material from which most of Union Carbide's chemical products are 
made.

Ethylene Oxide - a chemical made from ethylene and oxygen. It combines with 
other chemicals to produce a wide range of products, such as ethylene glycol, 
and surfactants for detergents and cleaning products.

Ethylene Glycol - a chemical made from ethylene oxide and water. It is used to 
make polyester fiber, resin and film, and automobile antifreeze and engine 
coolants.

Polyethylene - the world's most widely used plastic, made by reacting ethylene 
and other olefins to form polymers. Union Carbide uses its low-pressure UNIPOL 
Process technology to make most of its polyethylene.

Solvent - a liquid chemical used to dissolve other chemicals. For example, 
butyl alcohol and related solvents are manufactured, starting from propylene, 
using Union Carbide's low-pressure Oxo process.

Buyer will pay UCAR in cash an aggregate purchase price of not 
less than one hundred ninety-five million U.S. dollars

             (b)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth 
herein, at the Closing the Stockholders shall cause UCAR and its 
Subsidiaries to collectively borrow (the "Borrowings"), and Buyer 
shall cause certain providers of financing (the "Lenders") to 
collectively lend to UCAR and its Subsidiaries with respect to 
such Borrowings, such amount so that, when taken together with the 
Purchase Price and other cash available to UCAR and its 
Subsidiaries, UCAR has sufficient cash at the Closing (net of any

Redemption, the Dividend and the other transactions contemplated 
hereby are collectively referred to herein as the "Transactions."

specified time period, on the fifth day after the final resolution 
of any dispute detailed in such Notice of Dispute by the Buyer and 
the Stockholders, or by the Arbitrator, as the case may be.

material respect (or in any respect, in the case of the 
representations or warranties contained in Article 5.22 or 
5.29(b)) as of the Closing Date and (ii) notify Buyer of any 
event, condition or circumstance occurring from the date hereof


through the Closing Date that would, or but for Section 5.30 
would, constitute a violation or breach of any representation or 
warranty or cause such representation or warranty to be untrue as 
of the Closing Date (assuming such event, condition or 
circumstance existed on the Closing Date);

and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Foreign 
Subsidiaries, to:
                     (i)  employ the properties owned, leased or 
     used by them and conduct the Business only in the ordinary 
     course;
                    (ii)  use all reasonable efforts to retain

     shall be provided (A) to technical, financial or operating 
     books, files, papers or records (including, without 
     limitation, price and cost data on any basis other than an 
     aggregate basis) which, in the reasonable opinion of 
     Stockholders, contain information the disclosure of which to 
     competitors of UCAR or any of the Subsidiaries might be 
     detrimental to UCAR or any of the Subsidiaries (but only to 
     the extent that the lack of access of Buyer or its officers, 
     employees and other representatives thereto would not 


     materially impair the ability of Buyer to evaluate the 
     accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in 
     Articles 3, 4 and 5 hereof) or (B) to the extent that such 
     access would (1) violate the terms of any agreement to which

     law, ordinance, rule or regulation or any order, writ, 
     judgment, award, edict or decree of any court of competent

     Buyer's financing to meet with senior management of UCAR to 
     discuss the Business as presently conducted by UCAR and the 
     Subsidiaries; provided, that the Stockholders will be given 
     prior notice of all such meetings, and representatives of the 
     Stockholders will be permitted to attend all such meetings; 
     provided, further, that senior management of UCAR shall not 
     disclose during such discussions (A) any technical, financial 
     or operating information or data (including, without 
     limitation, price and cost data on any basis other than an 
     aggregate basis) the disclosure of which to competitors of 
     UCAR or any of the Subsidiaries would, in the reasonable 
     opinion of Stockholders, be detrimental to UCAR or any of the 
     Subsidiaries (but only to the extent that the non-disclosure 
     by the senior management of UCAR of such information or data 


     would not materially impair the ability of Buyer to evaluate 
     the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth 
     in Articles 3, 4 and 5 hereof) or (B) any information or data 
     the disclosure of which would (1) violate the terms of any 
     agreement to which UCAR or any of the Subsidiaries is a 
     party, any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation or 
     any order, writ, judgment, award, edict or decree of any 
     court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental or quasi-
     governmental agency, authority or instrumentality of 
     competent jurisdiction or (2) result in the loss of any

Subsidiaries taken pursuant to the request of the Buyer or that is 
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions 
(and disclosed to Buyer with reasonable promptness) shall be 
deemed a breach of any of the covenants contained in clauses (i) 
through (iv) of Article 6.3(a) hereof.
        6.4  Filings and Consents.
            (a)  Each Party shall, at its own cost and expense, 
promptly file and thereafter diligently pursue any filing required 
on its part under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act 
of 1976, as amended, and all rules and regulations adopted


thereunder (collectively, the "HSR Act") in connection with the 
Transactions. 
             (b)  Each Party shall, at its own cost and expense, 
promptly file and thereafter diligently pursue any filing required 
on its part under the European Union regulations, as amended, and 
all rules and regulations adopted thereunder (collectively, the 
"EU") in connection with the Transactions. 
             (c)  Each Party shall, at its own cost and expense,

obtain the consents, approvals or other authorizations required to 
be obtained from, make all filings required to be made with and 
give all notices required to be given to any third party 
(including, without limitation, governmental or quasi-governmental 
agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of competent 
jurisdiction) that are required on their respective parts in 
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (other than 
those contemplated by Articles 6.4(a), 6.4(b) and 6.4(c) hereof), 
in each case if (but only if) the failure to obtain, give or make 
such consent, approval, authorization or filing would have a 
Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "Required Consents").
             (e)  Each Party shall, upon request, cooperate with 
the other Parties in connection with the performance of their 
respective obligations under this Article 6.4.


        6.5  Fulfillment of Conditions.  Each party shall use all 
reasonable efforts to fulfill or cause to be fulfilled the 
conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8 hereof.  Without 
limitation of the foregoing, each of the Parties shall have the 
right to review and consult concerning the preparation by UCAR of 
the Certificate referred to in Article 8(xi).
        6.6  Supplemental Disclosure.  The Stockholders shall have 
the right from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement the 
disclosure Schedules prepared by them or UCAR, with respect to any 
matter hereafter arising which, if existing or known as of the 
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth 
or described in such Schedule.  Any such supplemental disclosure 
will be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or 
warranty made in this Agreement, but will not be deemed to have 
been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of 
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Articles 7 
and 8 hereof have been satisfied.  The Stockholders shall also 
have the right through November 23, 1994 to supplement the 
disclosure Schedules; provided, that such supplemental disclosure 
shall, in the aggregate, taken together with the Schedules 
accompanying this Agreement when first executed (the "Original 
Schedules"), not disclose any liens, claims or encumbrances which 
would materially and adversely impair the value of the Lender's 
collateral package with respect to the Borrowings or any state of 
affairs representing a Material Adverse Effect, in either case, 
not disclosed on the Original Schedules.


        6.7  Limitation of Stockholders' Liabilities.  From and 
after the Closing Date, except as expressly provided for in this 
Agreement or the agreements identified with an asterisk on 
Schedule IV, (a) the Stockholders shall have no obligations or 
liabilities whatsoever relating to the business, properties or 
assets of UCAR and the Subsidiaries as the same may exist at the 
Closing Date or arise thereafter and (b) the Buyer shall release, 
indemnify and hold the Stockholders harmless from all such 
obligations and liabilities (including the costs of defense 
thereof and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) that are 
alleged against or might otherwise be imposed on the Stockholders.  
The Buyer shall cooperate with the Stockholders, both before and 
after the Closing Date, by taking, and after Closing, by causing 
the appropriate entity to take, all actions the Stockholders shall 
reasonably request to effect the termination of any such 
Stockholders' obligation or liability.

prior to the Closing the certificate referred to in Article 8(xi).

     in any specific representation or warranty.

     covenant or agreement.

herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated:
                     (i)  at the Closing or at any time prior 
     thereto, by mutual written agreement of Stockholders and 
     Buyer;
                    (ii)  at any time after March 31, 1995 (the 
     "Termination Date") and prior to the Closing, by Buyer, if 
     (A) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before 
     the Termination Date and (B) the failure to consummate the 
     Closing on or before the Termination Date did not result from 
     the failure by Buyer to perform or comply with any covenant 
     or agreement contained in this Agreement required to be 
     performed or complied with prior to the Closing by Buyer; or


                     (iii)  at any time after the Termination Date 
     and prior to the Closing, by Union Carbide or Mitsubishi, if 
     (A) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before 
     the Termination Date and (B) the failure to consummate the 
     Closing on or before the Termination Date did not result from 
     the failure by Union Carbide or Mitsubishi to perform or 
     comply with any covenant or agreement contained in this 
     Agreement required to be performed or complied with prior to 
     the Closing by Union Carbide or Mitsubishi.
If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void and 
have no further force or effect, except as provided in Article 9.3 
hereof.
        9.3  Survival after Termination.  If this Agreement is 
terminated in accordance with Article 9.2 hereof and the

provided, however, that none of the Parties shall have any 
liability in respect of a termination of this Agreement. 

ARTICLE 10 - TAX MATTERS; POST-CLOSING COVENANTS
        10.1  Transactional Taxes and Costs.
             (a)  Stockholders shall be responsible for all sales, 
transfer, conveyance, gains, stamp, value added or gross income 
taxes (other than gross income taxes based on revenue or income of 
UCAR or Buyer) or other taxes, duties, excises or governmental 
charges, fees, imposts or assessments, and any interest or


penalties thereon, imposed by any taxing jurisdiction (the 
foregoing are hereinafter referred to as "Transactional Taxes") 
with respect to the Acquisition, the Dividend or the Redemption, 
to the extent that such Transactional Taxes would have been due if 
the Acquisition, the Dividend and the Redemption had been 
structured as a sale of 75% of the Capital Stock owned by each of 
the Stockholders (the "Stockholder Transactional Taxes").   UCAR 
shall be responsible for all Transactional Taxes relating to the 
Transactions other than the Stockholder Transactional Taxes.  Each

certificates or direct pay certificates where possible, or shall 
promptly pay and discharge any Transactional Taxes for which such 
Party is responsible pursuant to the first two sentences of this 
Article 10.1(a).  The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event any 
Party shall be required to pay any Transactional Taxes for which 
any other Party is responsible pursuant to the first two sentences 
of this Article 10.1(a), such other Party shall promptly reimburse 
such Party and hold such Party harmless from any Transactional 
Taxes paid by such Party on behalf of such other Party.  In the 
event any taxing jurisdiction subsequently determines that any 
additional Transactional Taxes (including interest or penalties 
thereon) are due, the Party responsible for such Transactional 
Taxes pursuant to the first two sentences of this Article 10.1(a) 
shall hold any other Party harmless therefrom.
             (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in this Agreement, Union Carbide's assumption of

Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated November 9, 1990, among 
Mitsubishi, Union Carbide, and UCAR Carbon Company, Inc. shall 
continue in effect pursuant to its terms. 
             (c)  Buyer will be responsible for and shall hold 
Stockholders harmless from any Tax arising from any election by 
Buyer under Section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code.
             (d)  UCAR shall be responsible for all recording fees 
and notarial fees arising out of the sale of the Acquired Shares 
or otherwise on account of this Agreement or the Transactions.  
UCAR shall promptly pay and discharge such fees and shall promptly 
reimburse Buyer for any amounts Buyer may have expended on such 
fees. 
        10.2  Records Retained by Stockholders.
             (a)  Except as otherwise provided in Articles 
10.2(b), 10.2(c) and 10.2(d) hereof or in any other agreement to 
which UCAR or any of the Subsidiaries and Stockholders or any of 
their respective subsidiaries are parties which are in each case

solely to the Business and do not contain any information 
pertaining to the Stockholders or Stockholders' Affiliates (other 
than UCAR and the Subsidiaries) and which are possessed by 
Stockholders, or their respective subsidiaries or their respective


directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or 
nominees (the "Business Records").

Stockholders or their subsidiaries or their respective directors, 
officers, employees, agents, representatives or nominees in 
connection with any pending or threatened claim, suit, action, 
proceeding or investigation or termination or (ii) subject to any 
"Hold Order" issued pursuant to the Records Retention and 
Protection Manual of Union Carbide (a complete and accurate copy 
of which has been made available to Buyer) shall be retained by 
Stockholders or such subsidiary, director, officer, employee, 
agent, representative or nominee until the final termination of 
such claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation or 
termination of such "Hold Order" as the case may be.  Prior to 
such termination, copies of such Business Records shall be 
delivered to UCAR or the Subsidiaries. After such final 
termination, such Business Records shall be delivered to UCAR or 
the Subsidiaries.
             (c)  Nothing contained herein shall obligate or 
require Stockholders to deliver or cause to be delivered to UCAR 
or the Subsidiaries any Business Records which pertain to the 
Transactions and the photocopies of Business Records contained in 
the data room for the Transactions.
             (d)  All Business Records which contain information 
relating to Stockholders or any of their respective subsidiaries 
or Affiliates shall be retained by Stockholders or such subsidiary

the Subsidiaries.

Stockholders, UCAR shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, (i) 
provide full access, during normal business hours, to Stockholders 
and their respective subsidiaries and the officers, employees, 
other representatives and counsel of Stockholders and their 
respective subsidiaries to the facilities, books, records, files, 
paper, data and information relating to UCAR, any Subsidiary or 
any of the properties owned, leased or used by UCAR or any 
Subsidiary and (ii) make their employees available to Stockholders 
and their respective subsidiaries and the officers, employees, 
other representatives and counsel of Stockholders and their 
respective subsidiaries, in each case to the extent reasonably 
necessary and within a reasonable time period in connection with 
any tax, pension or employee benefit matter pertaining to 
Stockholders or any of their respective subsidiaries or any Taxes 
for which Stockholders are responsible under this Agreement, at no 
charge to Stockholders or such subsidiaries, officers, employees, 
other representatives or counsel; provided, however, that 
Stockholders shall reimburse UCAR and the Subsidiaries for travel, 
lodging, meal and other expenses directly and reasonably incurred 
by such employees in connection with such request.
        10.4  Preservation of Records.  After the Closing, UCAR 
shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, preserve all books, 
records, files, papers, data and information which is possessed by


it or them and which relates to UCAR or the Subsidiaries for (i) a 
period of seven (7) years after the Closing and (ii) for such 
longer period as may be required (A) by an agreement, law,

cause such Subsidiary to, give written notice to that effect to 
Stockholders not more than one hundred eighty (180) and not less 
than ninety (90) days prior to such destruction.  Stockholders 
shall have the right, at their respective cost and expense, to 
take possession of such books, records, files, papers, data or 
information; provided, that Stockholders give written notice to 
that effect to UCAR within ninety (90) days after such notice 
shall have been given and takes such possession within one hundred 
eighty (180) days thereafter.  UCAR shall, and shall cause the 
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Stockholders in connection with 
taking such possession.
        10.5  Agreement Not To Compete.  (a) Neither Union Carbide 
nor Mitsubishi shall, or shall permit its Controlled Affiliates 
(as defined below) to, directly or indirectly develop, 
manufacture, service, market, sell or otherwise distribute Certain

or otherwise distribute Certain Products in the UCAR Home Markets 
if appointed by UCAR or a Subsidiary as a distributor or other

ARTICLE 11 - EMPLOYEES AND BENEFITS
     At the Closing, Buyer shall cause UCAR to continue to employ 
the employees listed in Schedule X attached hereto (collectively, 
the "Employee(s)") (i) in equivalent or greater positions, (ii) at 
the same or greater wage rates, and (iii) with benefit plans, 
compensation policies and practices which in the aggregate are 
substantially equivalent to the Benefit Plans set forth on 
Schedule XI attached hereto (the "Benefits").  Buyer agrees to 
maintain the Benefits for at least two (2) years from and after 
the Closing Date.  Buyer shall accept and credit to all Employees 
all previous service recognized by the UCAR Retirement Plan ("UCAR 
Pension Plan") and Union Carbide benefit plans and compensation


practices under all of Buyer's benefit plans, compensation 
policies and practices where such service is applicable.
               (a)  United States and Canada.  In the event any

such Employee will be provided those severance benefits listed in 
Schedule XI for which such employee is eligible in addition to any

such Employee is entitled.  The following provisions shall pertain 
to the UCAR Pension Plan and the UCAR Carbon Savings Plan ("UCAR 
Savings Plan") (collectively, the "UCAR Plans").
                    (1)  Pension Plan.  Buyer shall cause UCAR to

     recognized under the Retirement Program Plan for Employees of 
     Union Carbide Corporation and its Participating Subsidiary 
     Companies ("UCC Plan") prior to February 25, 1991.  No 
     transfer of assets from the UCC Plan to the UCAR Pension Plan 
     shall be made with respect to any Employee.  Upon each 
     Employee's retirement from UCAR, the UCC Plan shall provide 
     to such Employee the benefits to which such Employee is 
     entitled under the UCC Plan as of the Closing Date, based on 
     earnings and service with UCAR prior to the Closing Date, but 
     only to the extent any obligation to recognize such service 
     and earnings exists prior to the Closing Date.  UCAR may 


     reduce any benefit payable to such Employee under the UCAR 
     Pension Plan by the amount paid to such Employee under the 
     Union Carbide Plan.  Union Carbide shall have the right to 
     suspend payment of benefits under the UCC Plan to any 
     Employee, or to any person who was an employee of Union 
     Carbide at any time during the twelve (12) month period 
     immediately preceding February 25, 1991 ("Former Employees"), 
     for any period during which such Employee or Former Employee 
     is or was either an employee of UCAR or, unless otherwise 
     agreed to in writing by Union Carbide, an independent 
     contractor or consultant performing duties for UCAR on a 
     substantially full-time basis.  UCAR or Buyer shall notify 
     Union Carbide within ten (10) days of employment, as 
     employee, independent contractor or consultant, of any person 
     who was a Former Employee, or re-employment of any Employee 
     whose employment with UCAR terminates after the Closing Date.
                    (2)  For purposes of Buyer's and UCAR's 
     obligations with respect to Employees under this Article 11, 
     former Employees shall be deemed to be Employees as of the 
     first date of employment with UCAR.
                    (3)  Buyer shall continue to maintain the UCAR 
     Savings Plan for at least two (2) years from and after the 
     Closing Date.
               (b)  International.  Schedule XVII attached hereto 
sets forth the international benefit plans, compensation policies 
and practices provided to Employees of UCAR and certain Foreign 
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "International Plans").  Buyer


agrees to cause UCAR to maintain benefit plans, compensation 
policies and practices which in the aggregate are substantially 
equivalent to the International Plans for at least two (2) years 
from and after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 12 - SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS INDEMNIFICATION

The representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 hereof 
shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of this

eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.  Except as 
otherwise provided in the next sentence, the covenants and 
agreements of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall survive such 
execution, delivery, performance and consummation for a period of 
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. Each covenant and 
agreement of Buyer set forth in this Agreement which, by its 
terms, is not required to be fully performed or complied with 
prior to the Closing shall survive such execution, delivery, 
performance and consummation for a period of eighteen (18) months 
following the date by which such covenant or agreement is so 
required to be fully performed or complied with.  No suit, action 
or proceeding may be commenced by Stockholders or UCAR with

warranties, representations, covenants or agreements after the 
expiration of the period for which such representations, 
warranties, covenants and agreements shall survive pursuant to 
this Article 12.1 (the "Applicable Buyer Survival Period");


provided, however, that subject to this Article 12 and Article 22 
hereof, Stockholders and UCAR shall have the right to commence a 
suit, action or proceeding after the expiration of the Applicable 
Buyer Survival Period with respect to claims arising out of or 
relating to such representations, warranties, covenants or 
agreements which shall have been asserted by Stockholders or UCAR 
under Article 12.7 hereof before the expiration of the Applicable

a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.  Each 
covenant and agreement of Union Carbide set forth in this 
Agreement which, by its terms, is not required to be fully 
performed or complied with prior to the Closing shall survive such 
execution, delivery, performance and consummation for a period of 
eighteen (18) months following the date by which such covenant or


agreement is so required to be fully performed or complied with.  
No suit, action or proceeding may be commenced by Buyer with 
respect to any claim arising out of or relating to such 
warranties, representations, covenants or agreements after the 
expiration of the period for which such representations, 
warranties, covenants and agreements shall survive pursuant to 
this Article 12.2 (the "Applicable UCC Survival Period"); 
provided, however, that, subject to this Article 12 and Article 22 
hereof, Buyer shall have the right to commence a suit, action or 
proceeding after the expiration of the Applicable UCC Survival 
Period with respect to claims arising out of or relating to such 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements which shall 
have been asserted by Buyer under Article 12.7 hereof before the 
expiration of the Applicable UCC Survival Period.
        12.3  Survival of Representations and Covenants of 
Mitsubishi.  The representations and warranties set forth in 
Articles 4 and 5 hereof shall survive the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the 
Transactions for a period of eighteen (18) months following the 
Closing Date, except (i) in the case of representations and 
warranties set forth in Article 5.9 as to which the period shall 
be three years following the Closing Date and (ii) for the 
indemnity set forth in Article 12.5(a)(iii) as to which the period 
shall be ten years following the Closing Date.  Except as 
otherwise provided in the next sentence, the covenants and 
agreements of Mitsubishi set forth in this Agreement shall survive 
such execution, delivery, performance and consummation for a


period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.  Each 
covenant and agreement of Mitsubishi set forth in this Agreement 
which, by its terms, is not required to be fully performed or 
complied with prior to the Closing shall survive such execution, 
delivery, performance and consummation for a period of eighteen 
(18) months following the date by which such covenant or agreement 
is so required to be fully performed or complied with.  No suit, 
action or proceeding may be commenced by Buyer with respect to any 
claim arising out of or relating to such warranties, 
representations, covenants or agreements after the expiration of 
the period for which such representations, warranties, covenants 
and agreements shall survive pursuant to this Article 12.3 (the 
"Applicable MC Survival Period"); provided, however, that, subject 
to this Article 12 and Article 22 hereof, Buyer, shall have the 
right to commence a suit, action or proceeding after the 
expiration of the Applicable MC Survival Period with respect to 
claims arising out of or relating to such representations, 
warranties, covenants and agreements which shall have been 
asserted by Buyer under Article 12.7 hereof before the expiration 
of the Applicable MC Survival Period.
        12.4  Indemnification by Buyer.
     Subject to Articles 12.1, 12.7 and 22 hereof, Buyer shall 
indemnify Stockholders and their respective directors, officers, 
employees, affiliates, successors and assigns ("Stockholders' 
Indemnitees") for, and shall hold, Stockholders' Indemnitees 
harmless from and against, any and all damages, claims, losses, 
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, interest,


penalties and reasonable legal, accounting and other expenses) 
asserted against or incurred or sustained by Stockholders' 
Indemnitees arising out of:
                     (i)  any breach of any covenant or agreement 
     contained in Article 6,10 or 11 hereof by Buyer; or
                    (ii)  any breach of any of the warranties or 
     representations set forth in Article 2 hereof.
        12.5  Indemnification by Stockholders.
              (a)  Subject to Articles 12.2, 12.3, 12.5(d), 
12.5(e), 12.7 and 22, Stockholders shall indemnify UCAR (to the 
extent set forth below), Buyer, and Buyer's directors, officers, 
employees, affiliates, successors and assigns (to the extent set 
forth below) (collectively "Buyer's Indemnitees") for, and shall 
hold Buyer's Indemnitees harmless from and against, any and all 
damages, claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, 
without limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable legal, 
accounting and other expenses) asserted against or incurred or 
sustained by Buyer's Indemnitees arising out of:
                     (i)  any breach of any covenant or agreement 
     contained in Article 6 or 10 hereof by Stockholders (to the 
     extent such breach is not attributable to any action, delay 
     in acting or failure to act after the Closing by Buyer, UCAR 
     or their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates); 
                    (ii)  any breach of any of the warranties or 
     representations set forth in Article 5 hereof; or


                   (iii)  any liabilities for personal injury or 
     property damage alleged to arise out of emissions from UCAR's 
     facility in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.
              (b)  Subject to Articles 12.2, 12.3, 12.5(d), 
12.5(e), 12.7 and 22 hereof Union Carbide shall indemnify Buyer's 
Indemnitees for and shall hold Buyer's Indemnitees harmless from 
and against, any and all damages, claims, losses, liabilities and 
expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties and 
reasonable legal, accounting and other expenses) asserted against 
or incurred or sustained by Buyer's Indemnitees arising out of any 
breach of any of the warranties or representations set forth in 
Article 3 hereof.
              (c)  Subject to Articles 12.2, 12.3, 12.5(d), 
12.5(e), 12.7 and 22 hereof Mitsubishi shall indemnify Buyer's 
Indemnitees for and shall hold Buyer's Indemnitees harmless from 
and against, any and all damages, claims, losses, liabilities and 
expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties and 
reasonable legal, accounting and other expenses) asserted against 
or incurred or sustained by Buyer's Indemnitees arising out of any 
breach of any of the warranties or representations set forth in 
Article 4 hereof.
              (d)  Buyer's Indemnitees shall be entitled to 
indemnification (i) under Article 12.5(a)(i) or (ii) with respect 
to Taxes imposed on or measured by net income of UCAR or any 
Subsidiary thereof ("Income Taxes") only when, and only with 
respect to amounts by which, the aggregate amount of all claims, 
damages, losses, liabilities and expenses for Income Taxes with


respect to which Buyer's Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled 
to indemnification under Article 12.5(a)(i) or (ii) hereof with 
respect to Income Taxes exceeds Ten Million U.S. Dollars 
($10,000,000); (ii) under Article 12.5(a)(iii) hereof only when, 
and only with respect to amounts by which, the aggregate amount of 
all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses with respect 
to which Buyer's Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to 
indemnification under Article 12.5(a)(iii) hereof exceeds Twenty 
Million U.S. Dollars ($20,000,000); and (iii) under Articles 
12.5(a)(i) or (ii), (b) or (c) hereof with respect to items other 
than Income Taxes only when, and only with respect to amounts by 
which, the aggregate amount of all claims, damages, losses, 
liabilities and expenses with respect to which Buyer's Indemnitees 
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under Articles 
12.5(a)(i) or (ii), (b) and (c) hereof, with respect to items 
other than Income Taxes, exceeds Ten Million U.S. Dollars 
($10,000,000).  In no event shall the aggregate amount of 
indemnification to which Buyer's Indemnitees would otherwise be 
entitled under Articles 12.5(a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) and (c) hereof, 
with respect to items other than Income Taxes, hereof exceed Fifty 
Million U.S. Dollars ($50,000,000).  The limitations contained in 
this Article 12.5(d) shall not apply to indemnities relating to 
Articles 10.1(a) or 10.1(b).
              (e)  If any event shall occur or circumstance shall 
exist which would otherwise entitle Buyer's Indemnitees to 
indemnification under Articles 12.5(a), (b) or (c) hereof, no 
loss, damage, claim, liability or expense shall be deemed to have


been asserted against or incurred or sustained by Buyer's 
Indemnitees to the extent of any proceeds recovered or recoverable 
by Buyer, UCAR or any of their respective subsidiaries or 
Affiliates from any third party (including, without limitation, 
any insurance company) with respect thereto.  Buyer agrees (i) in 
good faith, to diligently seek recovery, and to cause UCAR, Buyer 
and their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates to diligently 
seek to recover, at its and their cost and expense, from all third 
parties (including, without limitation, all insurance companies) 
with respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and 
expenses with respect to which Buyer's Indemnitees make or may 
make a claim for indemnification hereunder and (ii) to keep 
Stockholders fully and promptly informed of all material matters 
related thereto.  No insurance recovery by UCAR or any of its 
Subsidiaries will reduce the limits on indemnification specified 
in Article 12.5(d); provided, that in no way shall the foregoing 
be construed to apply to any payment by a Stockholder under 
Article 12.5, including payments by a Stockholder using the 
proceeds from an insurance policy held by either of them or their 
Affiliates.
              (f)  Payments pursuant to this Article 12.5 arising 
out of any breach of any warranties or representations set forth 
in Article 5 hereof or any covenants or agreements under this 
Agreement relating to UCAR or any of its Subsidiaries shall be 
made to UCAR.  Other payments pursuant to this Article 12.5 shall 
be made as Buyer shall direct.


              (g)  The indemnities provided by Stockholders under 
this Article 12.5 with respect to Taxes shall not be diminished as 
a result of any additional disclosure provided pursuant to Article 
6.6 hereof after November 23, 1994.
              (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set 
forth in this Agreement, if any Taxes are required to be withheld 
(other than withholding Taxes under section 1445 of the Code), but 
are not withheld, from a payment made to a Stockholder pursuant to 
this Agreement, such Stockholder shall indemnify UCAR or Buyer and 
shall hold UCAR or Buyer harmless from and against, any and all 
damages, claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (including 
without limitation, interest, penalties and reasonable legal, 
accounting and other expenses) asserted against or sustained by 
UCAR or Buyer as a result of UCAR or Buyer failing to withhold any 
Taxes required to be withheld.  If UCAR fails to withhold with 
respect to the Redemption pursuant to section 1445 of the Code and 
the IRS later asserts a claim against Buyer or UCAR with respect 
to such failure to withhold, Mitsubishi shall indemnify Buyer or 
UCAR, as the case may be, for any Taxes or interest thereon (and 
associated legal, accounting and other expenses), but not for any 
penalties, additions to Tax or interest thereon (and associated 
legal, accounting and other expenses).
         12.6  Indemnification by UCAR.
               (a)  As used herein, the term "Stockholders Group" 
shall mean Mitsubishi, Union Carbide, their respective 
subsidiaries, the shareholders, partners, directors, officers, 
employees, agents, representatives and consultants of Mitsubishi,


Union Carbide and their respective subsidiaries and the 
successors, transferees and assigns of Mitsubishi, Union Carbide, 
their respective subsidiaries and the shareholders, partners, 
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and 
consultants of Mitsubishi, Union Carbide and their respective 
subsidiaries.
               (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Article 
12.6(c) hereof, after the Closing, UCAR shall, or shall cause its 
subsidiaries to, indemnify the Stockholders Group for, and shall 
hold, or shall cause its subsidiaries to hold, the Stockholders 
Group harmless from, any and all claims, demands, allegations, 
suits, actions, proceedings, investigations, liabilities, 
obligations, losses, expenses, expenditures, costs, duties, fines, 
fees, taxes, levies, imposts, charges, assessments, deficiencies, 
penalties, damages, settlements and judgments of any kind or 
nature whatsoever asserted against or incurred or sustained by any 
or all of the members of the Stockholders Group arising out of, 
related to or associated with UCAR, its subsidiaries or Affiliates 
or the conduct of the Business, regardless of whether they are 
reflected in any of the Schedules attached hereto, regardless of 
whether they arise out of, relate to or are associated with events 
occurring or circumstances existing before or after the Closing, 
regardless of whether they are asserted, incurred or sustained 
before or after the Closing, regardless of when they became fixed 
or known, regardless of whom they are asserted by or against, 
regardless of where they are asserted, incurred or sustained, and 
regardless of whether they arise out of, relate to or are


associated with health, safety, the environment, personal injury, 
contracts, property damage, employment, negligence, recklessness, 
violation of law, rule or regulation, misrepresentation, strict 
liability or product liability (collectively, the "Business 
Liabilities").
               (c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 
12.6(b) hereof, any now existing contracts, agreements or 
commitments or any agreement contemplated hereby to the contrary, 
Stockholders agree that UCAR shall not be obligated to indemnify 
or cause its or their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates to 
indemnify any member of the Stockholder Group for, or to hold or 
cause its subsidiaries or Affiliates to hold them harmless from, 
any of the Business Liabilities under Article 12.6(b) hereof (i) 
where indemnification in respect of the same Business Liabilities 
would deprive Buyer or UCAR of the benefit of indemnification to 
which it is entitled pursuant to Articles 12.5 (a), (b) and (c) 
hereof or (ii) where such Business Liabilities arise out of a 
breach by any of them of any contract, agreement or commitment 
entered into by any of them with UCAR or any of its subsidiaries 
or Affiliates after the date hereof.
         12.7  Indemnification Procedure.
               (a)  Upon obtaining knowledge thereof, a Person who 
may be entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitee") 
shall promptly give the Party who may be obligated to provide such 
indemnification (the "Indemnitor") written notice of any Loss (as 
defined in Article 12.7(b) hereof) which the Indemnitee has 
determined has given or could give rise to a claim for


indemnification hereunder (a "Notice of Claim"). A Notice of Claim 
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and all known 
particulars related to a Loss. The Indemnitor shall perform its 
indemnification obligations in respect of a Loss described in a 
Notice of Claim under Articles 12.4, 12.5, or 12.6 hereof, as the 
case may be, within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitor shall 
have received such Notice of Claim; provided, however, such 
obligation shall be suspended (i) so long as the Indemnitor is in 
good faith performing its obligations under Article 12.7(c) hereof 
with respect to such Loss and (ii) in the case of a Notice of 
Claim given by Buyer's Indemnitees, until Buyer's Indemnitees 
shall have fully performed their respective obligations under 
Article 12.5(c) hereof with respect to a Loss for which Buyer's 
Indemnitees may be entitled to recovery from a third party 
(including, without limitation, any insurance company).
               (b)  As used in this Article 12.7, the term "Loss" 
shall mean a damage, claim, suit, notice, loss, liability, 
expense, cost, tax, penalty or interest described in Articles 
12.4, 12.5(a), 12.5(b) and 12.5(c), and one of the Business 
Liabilities or a fee, commission, compensation or payment 
described in Article 15.1 hereof, as the case may be.
               (c)  Subject to Articles 12.7(d), 12.7(e) and 
12.7(f) hereof, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and exclusive 
right and obligation in good faith and at its own cost and 
expense, to cure, remediate, mitigate, remedy or otherwise handle 
any event or circumstance which gives rise to a Loss (including 
events and circumstances which can be cured, remediated, mitigated


or remedied through the expenditure of money and events and 
circumstances which give rise to a Loss which can be measured in 
terms of money), regardless of whether such Loss arises out of a 
breach of or default under any representation, warranty, covenant 
or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise.  Such right 
and obligation shall include, without limitation, (i) the right to 
investigate any such event or circumstance, (ii) the sole and 
exclusive right and obligation to cure, mitigate, remediate, 
remedy and otherwise handle any such event or circumstance on such 
terms and conditions and by such means as the Indemnitor may 
determine, in its sole discretion, and (iii) the sole and 
exclusive right to defend, contest or otherwise oppose any third 
party claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding related to such 
event or circumstance with legal counsel selected by it.  The 
Indemnitor shall promptly inform the Indemnitee of all material 
developments related to any such event or circumstance. 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein (other than Articles 
12.7(d), 12.7(e) and 12.7(f), hereof) to the contrary, the 
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to 
participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense, contest 
or other opposition of any such third party claim, demand, suit, 
action or proceeding through legal counsel selected by it and 
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert any and 
all cross-claims or counterclaims which it may have.  So long as 
the Indemnitor is in good faith performing its obligations under 
this Article 12.7(c), the Indemnitee shall, and shall cause its 
subsidiaries to, (i) at all times, at its and their own cost and


expense, cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make its and their 
relevant files and records available for inspection and copying 
by, make its and their employees reasonably available to and 
otherwise render reasonable assistance to the Indemnitor upon 
request and (ii) not compromise or settle any such claim, demand, 
suit, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of 
the Indemnitor.  If the Indemnitor fails to perform its 
obligations under this Article 12.7(c), the Indemnitee shall have 
the right, but not the obligation, to take the actions which the 
Indemnitor would have had the right to take in connection with the 
performance of such obligations and, if the Indemnitee is entitled 
to indemnification hereunder in respect of the event or 
circumstance as to which the Indemnitee takes such actions, then 
the Indemnitor shall also indemnify the Indemnitee for all of the 
legal, accounting and other costs, fees and expenses reasonably 
and actually incurred in connection therewith.  If the Indemnitor 
proposes to settle or compromise any such third party action, 
demand, claim, suit or proceeding, the Indemnitor shall give 
written notice to that effect (together with a statement in 
reasonable detail of the terms and conditions of such settlement 
or compromise) to the Indemnitee a reasonable time prior to 
effecting such settlement or compromise.  Notwithstanding anything 
contained herein (other than Article 12.7(d) hereof) to the 
contrary, the Indemnitee shall have the right (i) to object to the 
settlement or compromise of any such third party action, demand, 
claim, suit or proceeding whereupon (A) the Indemnitee will assume 
the defense, contest or other opposition of any such third party


action, demand, claim, suit or proceeding for its own account and 
as if it were the Indemnitor and (B) the Indemnitor shall be 
released from any and all liability with respect to any such third 
party action, demand, claim, suit or proceeding to the extent that 
such liability exceeds the liability which the Indemnitor would 
have had in respect of such a settlement or compromise; provided, 
however, that the Indemnitor shall not be so released if the 
reason for the Indemnitee's so objecting is that, in the 
reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, such settlement or 
compromise would have a materially adverse effect on the conduct 
of the Business by UCAR and the Subsidiaries as presently 
conducted or upon the Indemnitee, or (ii) to assume, at any time 
by giving written notice to that effect to the Indemnitor, the 
cure, mitigation, remediation, remedy or other handling of such 
event or circumstance and the defense, contest or other opposition 
of any such third party action, demand, claim, suit or proceeding 
for its own account whereupon the Indemnitor shall be released 
from any and all liability with respect to such event or 
circumstance and such third party action, demand, claim, suit or 
proceeding.
               (d)  Stockholders shall have the right, at their 
own cost and expense, to participate in the defense, contest or 
other opposition of all of the actions, claims, demands, suits or 
proceedings which involve events occurring or circumstances 
existing prior to the Closing with respect to the Business or the 
properties owned, leased or used by UCAR or any of the 
Subsidiaries and which, in the sole opinion of Stockholders, might


have an adverse impact on Stockholders or their respective 
subsidiaries or Affiliates.  Stockholders shall give prompt 
written notice to Buyer and UCAR of their election to exercise 
such right.  After the Closing, UCAR shall not, and shall not 
permit the Subsidiaries to, settle or compromise any action, 
demand, claim, suit or proceeding in respect of which Stockholders 
shall have given such a notice without the prior written consent 
of Stockholders.  If Stockholders do not consent to such a 
settlement or compromise, Stockholders will assume the defense, 
contest or other opposition of such action, demand, claim, suit or 
proceeding for their own account whereupon UCAR and the 
Subsidiaries shall be released from any liability with respect to 
such action, claim, demand, suit or proceeding to the extent that 
such liability exceeds the liability which UCAR and the 
Subsidiaries would have had in respect of such a settlement or 
compromise.  Except as otherwise provided in the preceding 
sentence, neither such right nor the exercise thereof shall be 
construed to modify, expand or enlarge the obligations or 
liabilities of Stockholders hereunder in any respect.
               (e)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its 
subsidiaries to, take all actions which may be necessary to enable 
the Indemnitor to exercise its rights and perform its obligations 
under Article 12.7(c) hereof.
               (f)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to 
the contrary, each Party shall use, and shall cause its 
subsidiaries and Affiliates to use, all reasonable efforts to


mitigate any and all Losses, in respect of which it may be 
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

ARTICLE 13 - PUBLICITY; CONFIDENTIALITY
        13.1  Publicity.  No Party shall or shall permit its 
subsidiaries to issue any publicity, release or announcement 
concerning the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the 
provisions hereof or the Transactions without the prior written 
approval of the form and content of such publicity, release or 
announcement by the other Parties hereto; provided, however, that 
no such approval shall be required when such publicity, release or 
announcement is required by (i) any applicable law, ordinance, 
rule or regulation, (ii) any applicable rules or regulations of a 
national or foreign stock exchange or the Automated Quotation 
System maintained by the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, Inc. or (iii) any order, writ, judgment, award, edict or 
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental 
or quasi-governmental agency, authority or instrumentality of 
competent jurisdiction and, provided further, that, prior to 
issuing any publicity, release or announcement without such prior 
written approval, the Party issuing or whose subsidiary is issuing 
such publicity, release or announcement shall have given 
reasonable prior notice to the other Parties of such intended 
issuance and, if requested by any of the other Parties, shall have 
used reasonable efforts at its own cost and expense to obtain a 
protective order or similar protection for the benefit of such 
other Party. 


        13.2  Confidentiality.
              (a)  All data, reports, records and other 
information of any kind received by a Party or the Affiliates, 
subsidiaries, shareholders, directors, partners, officers, 
employees, agents, representatives, consultants or lenders of a 
Party (such Party being hereinafter referred to as the "Receiving 
Party") from one of the other Parties or the Affiliates, 
subsidiaries, shareholders, partners, directors, officers, 
employees, agents, representatives, consultants or lenders of one 
of the other Parties (such other Party being hereinafter referred 
to as the "Delivering Party") under this Agreement or in 
connection with the Transactions shall be treated as confidential 
(collectively, "Confidential Information").  Except as otherwise 
provided herein, the Receiving Party shall not use (and shall not 
permit its Affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, directors, 
officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives, 
consultants or lenders to use) Confidential Information for its 
own (or their own) benefit and shall use all reasonable efforts 
(and shall cause its Affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, 
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, 
consultants and lenders to use all reasonable efforts) to maintain 
the confidentiality of Confidential Information.  If the Receiving 
Party or any of its Affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, 
directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives, 
consultants or lenders is required to disclose Confidential 
Information by or to any court of competent jurisdiction or any 
governmental or quasi-governmental agency, authority or


instrumentality of competent jurisdiction, the Receiving Party 
shall, prior to such disclosure, immediately notify the Delivering 
Party of such requirement and all particulars related to such 
requirement.  The Delivering Party shall have the right, at its 
expense, to object to such disclosure and to seek confidential 
treatment of any Confidential Information to be so disclosed on 
such terms as it shall determine.
              (b)  The restrictions set forth in Article 13.2(a) 
hereof shall not apply to the use or disclosure of Confidential 
Information to the extent, but only to the extent, (i) permitted 
or required pursuant to any other agreement between or among the 
Parties (or their respective subsidiaries and Affiliates), (ii) 
necessary by a Party (or its subsidiaries or Affiliates) in 
connection with exercising its (or their) rights or performing its 
(or their) duties or obligations under this Agreement or any other 
agreements, instruments and documents contemplated hereby or 
thereby or the other agreements described in clause (i) of this 
Article 13.2(b), (iii) contemplated by the last two (2) sentences 
of Article 13.2(a) hereof or (iv) that the Receiving Party can 
demonstrate Confidential Information (A) is or becomes generally 
available to the public through no fault or neglect of the 
Receiving Party, (B) is received in good faith on a non-
confidential basis from a third party who discloses such 
Confidential Information without violating any obligations of 
secrecy or confidentiality or (C) was already possessed at the 
time of receipt as shown by prior dated written records.  The 
restrictions set forth in Article 13.2(a) hereof shall not apply


to the use or disclosure by UCAR or any of its subsidiaries or 
Affiliates of Confidential Information which consists of data, 
reports, records and information relating to the Business or the 
ownership, leasing or use of the properties owned, leased or used 
by UCAR or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates and which is used 
or disclosed in connection with the conduct of the Business.
              (c)  For the purposes of this Article 13.2, (i) 
information which is specific shall not be deemed to be within an 
exception set forth in Article 13.2(b) hereof merely because it is 
embraced by general information which is within such an exception 
and (ii) a combination of information shall not be deemed to be 
within an exception set forth in Article 13.2(b) hereof merely 
because individual aspects of such combination are within such an 
exception unless the combination of information itself, its 
principle of operation and its value or advantages are within such 
an exception.
        13.3  Survival.  This Article 13 shall survive the 
termination of this Agreement for any reason and the consummation 
of the Transactions.

A Party may designate a new address to which notices required or 
permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall thereafter 
be transmitted by giving written notice to that effect to the 
other Parties. Each notice transmitted in the manner described in 
this Article 14 shall be deemed to have been given, received and 
become effective for all purposes at the time it shall have been 
(i) delivered to the addressee as indicated by the return receipt 
(if transmitted by mail), the affidavit of the messenger (if 
transmitted by personal delivery) or the answer back or call back 
(if transmitted by telecopier or other electronic means) or (ii) 
presented for delivery to the addressee as so indicated during 
normal business hours, if such delivery shall have been refused 
for any reason.

ARTICLE 15 - BROKERAGE FEES; CERTAIN EXPENSES
        15.1  Brokerage Fees.  Each Party agrees to indemnify the 
other Parties for, and to hold the other Parties harmless from,


any claim or liability for any fee, commission, compensation or 
other payment by any broker, finder or similar agent who claims to 
have been, or who was in fact, engaged by or on behalf of it in 
connection with the Transactions in accordance with the procedure 
set forth in Article 12.7 hereof.  Without limiting the foregoing, 
Stockholders agree to pay all fees and expenses of Goldman, Sachs 
& Co. and CS First Boston Corporation relating to the 
Transactions.
        15.2  Certain Expenses.  Except as otherwise provided in 
this Agreement and regardless of whether the Transactions are 
consummated, each Party agrees to pay all expenses, fees and costs 
(including, without limitation, legal, accounting and consulting 
expenses) incurred by it in connection with the Transactions.

ARTICLE 16 - GOVERNING LAW; FORUM
     The validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of 
this Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of New 
York (without giving effect to the laws, rules or principles of 
the State of New York regarding conflicts of laws).  Each Party 
agrees that any proceeding arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement or the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement 
shall be commenced and prosecuted in a court in the State of New 
York.  Each Party consents and submits to the non-exclusive 
personal jurisdiction of any court in the State of New York in 
respect of any such proceeding.  Each Party consents to service of 
process upon it with respect to any such proceeding by registered 
mail, return receipt requested, and by any other means permitted


by applicable laws and rules.  Each Party waives any objection 
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any 
such proceeding in any court in the State of New York and any 
claim that it may now or hereafter have that any such proceeding 
in any court in the State of New York has been brought in an 
inconvenient forum.  Each Party waives trial by jury in any such 
proceeding.

ARTICLE 17 - BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES
     This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their 
respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit 
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted 
assigns.  No Party shall assign any of its rights or delegate any 
of its duties under this Agreement (by operation of law or 
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties.  
Any assignment of rights or delegation of duties under this 
Agreement by a Party without the prior written consent of the 
other Parties if such consent is required hereby, shall be void; 
provided, that Buyer may, without such prior written consent, 
assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement on 
or prior to the Closing to one or more of its Affiliates; and 
provided further, that Buyer or UCAR may without such prior 
written consent, for collateral security purposes assign its 
rights (but not its obligations) effective on or after the Closing 
Date to providers of financing in connection with the 
Transactions.  No Person shall be, or be deemed to be, a third 
party beneficiary of this Agreement.


ARTICLE 18 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT
     This Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto 
constitute the entire contract among the Parties with respect to 
the subject matter hereof and cancel and supersede all of the 
previous or contemporaneous contracts, representations, warranties 
and understandings (whether oral or written), including without 
limitation, the Counteroffer, dated November 14, 1994 from 
Mitsubishi and Union Carbide to the Buyer, by, between or among 
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Except as 
otherwise provided in Articles 5.21(a) and 7(vi) hereof, all of 
the Schedules attached hereto shall be deemed to be dated the date 
hereof.  Except for the representations and warranties expressly 
set forth in this Agreement, Buyer disclaims reliance upon (i) any 
representations, warranties or guarantees (whether express or 
implied and whether oral or written) by Stockholders, UCAR, any of 
the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, 
employees, agents or representatives (including, without 
limitation, any projections of future sales, revenues, expenses or 
earnings and any statements regarding the prospects of the 
Business) or (ii) any other information with respect to the 
Business, UCAR or the Subsidiaries provided by or on behalf of 
them.  Buyer represents and warrants that it has relied on its own 
projections in connection with the Transactions.  Each Party 
agrees that the other Parties have the right to rely upon the 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of such 
party contained in this Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided


in Articles 20 and 21 hereof, nothing contained in any document or 
instrument of conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery 
executed or delivered at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement 
shall amend, extend, modify, renew or alter in any manner any 
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or indemnity 
contained herein.  Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any 
of the Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto shall constitute or 
be interpreted or construed as an admission by any Party or any of 
its subsidiaries or Affiliates of liability to third parties, 
whether under any foreign, federal, state or local laws, rules, 
regulations or ordinances or otherwise, or as an admission that 
any Party or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates are in 
violation of or have ever violated any such laws, rules, 
regulations or ordinances.

ARTICLE 19 - FURTHER ASSURANCES
     At any time and from time to time after the Closing, the 
Parties shall execute, deliver and acknowledge such other 
documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably 
required in order to consummate the Transactions.

ARTICLE 20 - AMENDMENTS
     No addition to, and no cancellation, renewal, extension, 
modification or amendment of, this Agreement shall be binding upon 
a Party unless such addition, cancellation, renewal, extension, 
modification or amendment is set forth in a written instrument 
which states that it adds to, amends, cancels, renews, extends or


modifies this Agreement and which is executed and delivered on 
behalf of such Party by an officer of, or attorney-in-fact for, 
such Party.  No addition to, and no cancellation, renewal, 
extension, modification or amendment of, the Tradename and 
Trademark License Agreement, dated as of November 1, 1990, (the 
"Trademark License") between Union Carbide and UCAR Carbon 
Technology Corporation ("UCAR Technology"), by UCAR or UCAR 
Technology, respectively, or to which UCAR or UCAR Technology, 
respectively, is a party shall be effective unless Buyer shall 
have given its prior written approval thereto.  [Note:  At the 
Closing Date the Trademark License will have a remaining term of 
not less than 20 years.]

ARTICLE 21 - WAIVERS
     No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding 
upon a Party unless such waiver is expressly set forth in a 
written instrument which is executed and delivered on behalf of 
such Party by an officer of, or attorney-in-fact for, such Party.  
Such waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically set 
forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time 
to time and at any time) by a Party of, nor the delay or failure 
(at any time or for any period of time) to exercise, any right, 
power or remedy shall constitute a waiver of the right to 
exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the exercise of, such 
right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any 
time and from time to time thereafter.  No waiver of any right, 
power or remedy of a Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any


other right, power or remedy of such Party or shall, except to the 
extent so waived, impair, limit or restrict the exercise of such 
right, power or remedy.

ARTICLE 22 - REMEDIES LIMITED
     The sole and exclusive rights, powers and remedies of the 
Parties, other than such injunctive or other equitable remedies as 
may be available to a Party, for a breach of or default under this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, a breach of or default 
under any of the representations, warranties, covenants or 
agreements contained in this Agreement) shall be termination under 
Article 9 hereof and indemnification under Articles 12 and 15 
hereof, in each case limited as set forth therein.  None of the 
Parties shall, for any reason or under any legal theory, be liable 
for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages 
arising out of any breach of or default under this Agreement, even 
if informed of the possibility of such damages in advance.

ARTICLE 23 - HEADINGS; COUNTERPARTS
     The headings set forth in this Agreement have been inserted 
for convenience of reference only, shall not be considered a part 
of this Agreement and shall not limit, modify or affect in any way 
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement 
may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which (when 
executed and delivered) shall constitute an original instrument, 
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same 
instrument.  This Agreement shall become effective and be deemed


to have been executed and delivered by all of the Parties at such 
time as counterparts shall have been executed and delivered by 
each of the Parties, regardless of whether each of the Parties has 
executed the same counterpart.  It shall not be necessary when 
making proof of this Agreement to account for any counterpart 
other than a sufficient number of counterparts which, when taken 
together, contain signatures of all of the Parties.

ARTICLE 24 - SEVERABILITY
     If any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be held to 
be invalid, unenforceable or illegal in whole or in part, in any 
jurisdiction under any circumstances for any reason, (i) such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to 
cause such provision to be valid, enforceable and legal while 
preserving the intent of the Parties as expressed in, and the 
benefits to the Parties provided by, this Agreement or (ii) if 
such provision cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be 
severed from this Agreement and an equitable adjustment shall be 
made to this Agreement (including, without limitation, addition of 
necessary further provisions to this Agreement) so as to give 
effect to the intent as so expressed and the benefits so provided.  
Such holding shall not affect or impair the validity, 
enforceability or legality of such provision in any other 
jurisdiction or under any other circumstances.  Neither such 
holding nor such reformation or severance shall affect or impair 
the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of 
this Agreement.
