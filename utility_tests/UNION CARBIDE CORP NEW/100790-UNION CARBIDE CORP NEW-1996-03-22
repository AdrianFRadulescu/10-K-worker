Cautionary statement for the purposes of the "safe harbor" provisions of the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: All statements in this Form 
10-K report that do not reflect historical information are forward looking 
statements. These include statements incorporated herein by reference to the 
1995 annual report to stockholders. Important factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking 
statements include: the supply/demand balance for the corporation's products, 
customer inventory levels, competitive pricing pressures, feedstock costs, 
changes in industry production capacities and operating rates, competitive 
technology positions and failure to achieve the corporation's cost reduction 
targets or complete construction projects on schedule. Some of these factors 
are discussed further in Part I, Item 1: Business.


Definition of terms: See the inside back cover page of the 1995 annual report
to stockholders. Terms defined there are used herein.

Part I

Item 1. Business

General-Union Carbide operates in two business segments of the chemicals and 
plastics industry, Specialties & Intermediates and Basic Chemicals & Polymers. 
Specialties & Intermediates converts basic and intermediate chemicals into a 
diverse portfolio of chemicals and polymers serving industrial customers in 
many markets. This segment also provides technology services, including 
licensing, to the oil and gas and petrochemicals industries. The Basic 
Chemicals & Polymers segment converts hydrocarbon feedstocks, principally 
liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha, into polyethylene, polypropylene and 
ethylene oxide/glycol for sale to third-party customers, as well as propylene, 
ethylene and ethylene oxide for consumption by the Specialties & Intermediates 
segment. The profitability of the Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment of the 
chemicals and plastics industry is highly cyclical, whereas that of the 
Specialties & Intermediates segment is less cyclical. Consequently, Union 
Carbide's results are subject to the swings of the cycle in the basic 
chemicals and polymers segment. See inside front cover, pages 6 through 8, and 
"Summary and Outlook" on pages 10 through 12 of the 1995 annual report to 
stockholders for further information about Union Carbide's businesses, and 
Note 3 on pages 26 through 27 of the 1995 annual report to stockholders for 
financial information about Union Carbide's business segments.

Union Carbide does not produce against a backlog of firm orders; production is 
geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and to projections of future 
demand. Inventories of finished products, work in process and raw materials 
are maintained to meet delivery requirements of customers and Union Carbide's 
production schedules.

At year-end 1995, 11,521 people were employed worldwide in manufacturing 
facilities, laboratories and offices around the world.

Raw Materials, Products and Markets-See information herein and in the 1995 
annual report to stockholders on pages 6 through 8. Unless otherwise 
indicated, the products of Union Carbide are sold principally by its own sales 
force, directly to customers.

Union Carbide believes it has contracts or commitments for, or readily 
available sources of, hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuel supplies to meet its 
anticipated needs in all major product areas. The corporation's operations are 
dependent upon the availability of hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuels which are 
purchased from diverse domestic and international sources, including 
independent oil and gas producers as well as integrated oil companies.

The availability and price of hydrocarbon feedstocks, energy and finished 
products are subject to plant interruptions and outages and to market and 
political conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere. Operations and products at 
times may be adversely affected by legislation, government regulations, 
shortages, or international or domestic events.

The business segments of Union Carbide are not dependent to a significant 
extent upon a single customer or a few customers.

Patents; Trademarks; Research and Development-Union Carbide owns a large 
number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide variety of 
products and processes, has pending a substantial number of patent 
applications throughout the world, and is licensed under a number of patents. 
These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. Such patents and 
patent applications in the aggregate are material to Union Carbide's 
competitive position. No one patent is considered to be material; however, the 
patent portfolio relating to the UNIPOL process technology is, in the
aggregate, considered to be material. Union Carbide also has a large number
of trademarks. The UNION CARBIDE, UCAR and UNIPOL trademarks are material;
no other single trademark is material.


Part I (Cont.)

Essentially all of Union Carbide's research and development activities are 
company-sponsored. The principal research and development facilities of Union 
Carbide are indicated in the discussion of Properties (Item 2) of this Form 
10-K report. In addition to the facilities specifically indicated there, 
product development and process technology laboratories are maintained at some 
plants. Union Carbide spent $144 million in 1995, $136 million in 1994, and 
$139 million in 1993 on company-sponsored research activities to develop new 
products, processes, or services, or to improve existing ones.

Environment-See Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment on pages 13 
through 14 of the 1995 annual report to stockholders and Note 16 on pages 36 
through 37 thereof.

Insurance-Union Carbide's policy is to obtain public liability insurance 
coverage at terms and conditions and a price that management considers fair 
and reasonable. Union Carbide's management believes Union Carbide has public 
liability insurance in an amount sufficient to meet its current needs in light 
of pending, threatened, and future litigation and claims. There is no 
assurance, however, that Union Carbide will not incur losses beyond the 
limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance. Such insurance is subject 
to substantial deductibles.

Competition-Each of the major product and service areas in which Union Carbide 
participates is highly competitive. In some instances competition comes from 
manufacturers of the same products as those produced by Union Carbide and in 
other cases from manufacturers of different products which may serve the same 
markets as those served by Union Carbide's products. Some of Union Carbide's 
competitors, such as companies principally engaged in petroleum operations, 
have more direct access to hydrocarbon feedstocks, and some have greater 
financial resources than Union Carbide.

The Specialties & Intermediates segment is characterized by differentiated 
products and is less subject to external changes in supply/demand 
relationships than the Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment. In this segment, 
competition is based on product functionality and quality, and prices are a 
function of demand for the product, with the more unique products commanding 
significant premiums.

The Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment is characterized by large volume 
commodity products and is subject to external changes in supply/demand 
relationships, including changes in the strength of the overall economy, 
customer inventory levels, industry manufacturing capacity and operating rates 
and raw material feedstock costs. Participants in this segment compete for 
business primarily on the basis of price and efficient delivery systems.

See pages 6 through 8 of the 1995 annual report to stockholders for 
information about each segment's principal products, competitive position and 
major competitors.

Union Carbide is a major marketer of petrochemical products throughout the 
world. Products that the corporation markets are largely produced in the 
United States, while products marketed by the corporation's joint ventures are 
principally produced outside the United States. Competitive products are 
produced throughout the world. In 1995, the corporation made significant 
investments in acquisitions and joint ventures outside the United States. 
During 1996, the corporation expects to continue making investments in 
acquisitions and joint ventures.

Union Carbide's international operations face competition from local producers 
and global competitors and a number of other risks inherent in carrying on 
business outside the United States, including risks of nationalization, 
expropriation, restrictive action by local governments and changes in currency 
exchange rates.


Part I (Cont.)

Item 2. Properties

In management's opinion, current facilities, together with planned expansions, 
will provide adequate production capacity to meet Union Carbide's planned 
business activities. Capital expenditures are discussed on pages 16 and 17 of 
the 1995 annual report to stockholders.

Listed below are the principal manufacturing facilities operated by Union 
Carbide worldwide. Research and engineering facilities are noted. Most of the 
domestic properties are owned in fee. Union Carbide maintains numerous 
domestic sales offices and warehouses, substantially all of which are leased 
premises under relatively short-term leases. All principal international 
manufacturing properties are owned or held under long-term leases. 
International administrative offices, technical service laboratories, sales 
offices and warehouses are owned in some instances and held under relatively 
short-term leases in other instances. The corporation's headquarters are 
located in Danbury, Connecticut, and are leased.

Principal domestic manufacturing facilities and the principal products 
manufactured there are as follows:

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Union Carbide Corporation

Under date of January 19, 1996, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets 
of Union Carbide Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 
1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity 
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 
31, 1995, as contained on pages 20 through 37 in the 1995 annual report to 
stockholders. These consolidated financial statements and our report thereon 
are incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
1995. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated 
financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement 
schedule as listed in Item 14(a)3. This financial statement schedule is the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation 
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the 
company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

                        FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE
                       UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION
                  SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN



     The Union Carbide Corporation Supplemental Retirement Income 
Plan (the "Plan") is hereby amended as follows:
     1.   The third sentence of the General Section of the Plan 
is hereby amended in its entirety as follows: 
"Specifically, the purpose of this plan is to 
provide a retirement benefit, determined 
without regard to Code Section 415 or Code 
Section 401(a)(17), equal to the excess of 
the retirement benefit which would be 
provided by (1) the Retirement Program Plan 
if (a) average monthly compensation included 
(i) deferred cash bonuses awarded under 
designated incentive compensation plans and 
(ii) base salary deferred under the 
Compensation Deferral Program, and (b) all 
cash bonuses, whether deferred or not, were 
averaged separately from base compensation, 
and (2) the Equalization Benefit Plan, over 
the retirement benefit actually provided by 
the Retirement Program Plan and the 
Equalization Benefit Plan."

     2.   A new Section 3(e) is hereby added to Article II of the 
Plan to read as follows:
"(e)  For purposes of the calculation under 
subpart (c) of this Section 3, "base salary" 
shall include any base salary deferred by an 
employee pursuant to the terms of the Union 
Carbide Compensation Deferral Program, or any 
successor plan, in the calendar year in which 
it would otherwise have been paid."

     3.     The amendment set forth herein shall be effective as 
of January 1, 1995.
                              UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION

merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the 
continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares

                           ARTICLE IV
                           ELIGIBILITY
     4.1  To be eligible to participate in this Program for a 
given year, a person must have become an Eligible Employee not 
later than the day on or before the date which an Eligible 
Employee must make the election provided for in Article V of this 
Program for that year and either be employed by the Corporation 
on the Date of Deferral for that year, or be eligible to receive 
a lump sum payment under the Equalization Plan or SRIP.




                            ARTICLE V
                            DEFERRALS
     5.1   During each of the years this Program is in effect, 
Eligible Employees shall be informed of the opportunity to 
participate in this Program.  An Eligible Employee choosing to 
participate in this Program must make an election to do so on or 
before the date designated by the Administrative Committee and 
otherwise in accordance with such procedures as may be 
established by the Administrative Committee. 
     5.2   (a) While an election to defer Variable Compensation 
under one of the Variable Compensation Plans shall be irrevocable 
when made until the next scheduled annual election period, 
participation in this Program with respect to Variable 
Compensation shall become effective only on the Date of Deferral 
and only if, on such date, the Eligible Employee receives an 
award under one of the Variable Compensation Plans (or would have 
received an award but for an election to defer under this 
Program).
       Variable Compensation awards, if any, for services 
performed in calendar years 1994 and 1995, must be deferred 
during the 1994 annual election period.  Variable Compensation 
awards, if any, for services performed in calendar years 1996 and 
beyond, must be deferred during the annual election period 
immediately preceding the calendar year in which such services 
will be performed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible 
Employee who becomes eligible to participate in this Program 
after January 1, 1995 may elect to defer a Variable Compensation 
award during the calendar year in which services will be 
performed; provided, however, he or she makes an election to 
defer within 31 days after becoming eligible to participate in 
this Program.
     (b)     An Eligible Employee must elect to defer his or her 
base salary for services performed in calendar year 1995 during 
the 1994 annual election period.  Participation in this Program 
shall become effective only on the Date of Deferral and only if, 
on such date, the Eligible Employee remains employed with the 
Corporation.  Base salary for services performed in calendar 
years 1996, and beyond, must be deferred during the annual 
election period immediately preceding the calendar year in which 
such services will be performed.  A Participant may suspend his 
or her election to defer his or her base salary (but may not 
otherwise reduce or change an election mid-year) at any time; 
provided, however, that such Eligible Employee may not resume 
deferrals of base salary until the following calendar year.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible Employee who becomes 
eligible to participate in this Program after January 1, 1995, 
may elect to defer a portion of his or her base salary during the 
calendar year in which services will be performed; provided he or 
she makes an election to defer within 31 days after becoming 
eligible to participate in this Program.
     (c)     A Participant must elect to defer lump sum payments 
that he or she would otherwise receive in accordance with the 
terms of the SRIP or Equalization Plan during the annual election 
period immediately preceding the calendar year in which such 
payments would otherwise be received. 
     5.3     (a)  On or before the date designated by the 
Administrative Committee and otherwise in accordance with such 
procedures as may be established, a Participant may elect 
voluntarily to defer (i) up to 100% of the Participant's award 
under the Variable Compensation Plans (in 10% increments), 
(ii) up to 25% of his or her base salary (in 5% increments) 
and/or (iii) up to 100% of his or her lump sum payment from the 
SRIP or  Equalization Plan.  Effective with elections made with 
respect to payments that would otherwise be received in 1996 or 
later, (i) only up to 85% of Variable Compensation may be 
deferred, and the 10% increments will apply only for the first 
80% of such deferrals, and (ii) base salary may be deferred in 
increments of 1% up to the first 5% and 5% increments thereafter.
     (b)     A Participant must elect, during any applicable 
calendar year, to defer in the aggregate a minimum of $2,000 of 
his base salary, Variable Compensation or lump sum payment from 
the SRIP or Equalization Plan in order to participate in this 
Program.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Program to the 
contrary, if a Participant fails to defer at least $2,000 of his 
base salary, Variable Compensation or lump sum payment from the 
SRIP or Equalization Plan in any calendar year, the 
Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, require 
such Participant to irrevocably elect to defer a minimum of 
$2,000 in the calendar year immediately following thereafter in 
order to participate in this Program.
     5.4  (a)  The Corporation shall credit a Participant with an 
amount equal to 75% of a Participant's deemed annual contribution 
as determined under subsection (b) of this Section 5.4.
     (b)  A Participant's deemed annual contribution shall equal 
A multiplied by B, where A and B are as follow:
     A              equals that portion of a Participant's
compensation in excess of the limits 
contained in Code Section 401(a)(17) (as 
defined in Section 1.12 of the Savings 
Program without regard to Code Section 
401(a)(17), and without regard to any 
deferrals under this Program), up to $235,840 
which is deferred under this Program.  Such 
$235,840 shall be adjusted at the same time 
and in the same manner as the limitation 
described in Code Section 415(d)(3); and

     B              equals the percentage of such Participant's
compensation (as defined under Section 1.12 
of the Savings Program) which has been 
contributed to the Savings Program for the 
applicable calendar year as a Basic Deduction 
pursuant to Section 2.7.2 of the Savings 
Program.
     (c)  The Corporation shall credit each Participant with the 
amount determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 5.4, 
in arrears, on each Deferral Date; provided that such Participant 
remains eligible to participate in this Program and is employed 
by the Corporation on the Deferral Date.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Corporation shall not credit a Participant with 
the amount determined pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 
5.4 (as of the Participant's termination of employment) if the 
Participant terminates employment with the Corporation during a 
calendar year for any reason, except if the Participant's 
employment is terminated by reason of death, Disability, 
Retirement or termination by the Corporation other than for 
cause.



                           ARTICLE VI
         PAYMENTS TO PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES     
     6.1  Time of Payment.  (a)   Subject to subsections (b), (c) 
and (d) of this Section 6.1, a Participant shall begin to receive 
payment of his or her deferrals, and any earnings accruals 
credited under Article VIII, during the January next following 
his or her date of termination of employment.
     (b)  (i) Notwithstanding any provision in this Program to 
the contrary, a Participant may elect to commence receipt of 
payments of any amounts deferred upon a specific future payment 
date which is at least five years after the Date of Deferral or 
such shorter schedule as the Compensation Committee may 
determine.  Such payments must begin no later than the calendar 
year in which the Participant attains age 70 1/2.  A Participant 
making such an election shall receive his or her lump sum payment 
in the January next following his or her future payment date or, 
if applicable, such Participant shall receive installment 
payments in accordance with Section 6.2.
     (ii)  With respect to a Participant who has attained age 55 
at the time of the election of his or her deferral, the five year 
period described in subsection (i) shall instead be one year with 
respect to deferrals of base salary or Variable Compensation.
     (iii)  A Participant is limited to two future fixed year 
payments.  The amounts paid out in such fixed year payments (if 
prior to termination of employment) may not exceed the sum of a 
Participant's deferral of base salary or Variable Compensation 
under this Program.  Effective for elections made in November, 
1995 or later, up to four such fixed payment dates may be 
elected.
     (c)  A Participant who has not yet terminated employment, 
but has an Unforeseen Emergency, may receive any or all of his or 
her Variable Compensation and base salary deferrals, excluding 
any earning accruals credited to him or her pursuant to Article 
VIII of this Program; provided that the Participant may not 
receive an amount greater than the amount necessary to meet the 
Unforeseen Emergency and any amounts necessary to pay federal, 
state and local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated 
to result from a withdrawal under this Section 6.1.  Earning 
accruals will remain in the Program and continue to accrue 
earnings under Article VIII until the payment date or dates 
described in Article VI.
     (d)     Notwithstanding any provision in this Program to the 
contrary, a Participant may, on the applicable Date of Deferral 
or at any time thereafter prior to a Change in Control, elect to 
receive payment of his or her entire account balance under this 
Program at such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation 
determines that a Change in Control has occurred.  Such payment 
shall be made in a lump sum within 45 days after the Change in 
Control.
     6.2       Form of Payments.  (a)   A Participant may elect 
to receive payments under this Program in annual or quarterly 
installments.  Such installments must commence as described in 
Section 6.1, and must be completed by the calendar year in which 
the Participant attains age 85. 
     (b)   A Participant may elect to receive installment 
payments either (i) annually during each January or 
(ii) quarterly, commencing in the January that payment was 
otherwise due in accordance with Section 6.1.  If a Participant 
does not elect the form of his or her installment payments, such 
installment payments shall be made annually during each January.
     (c)  If a Participant does not elect the form of his or her 
payments, such payments shall be made in a lump sum payment.
     (d)  A Participant may change the form of payment previously 
elected only one time and subject to the following restrictions:
(i)  such election is made in the calendar 
year that the Participant terminates 
employment, to be effective no earlier than 
the following calendar year;
(ii) the election is subject to the consent 
of the Administrative Committee.
     (e)  1.  If a Participant dies at any time prior to 
receiving any portion of his or her account balance under this 
Program, payment shall be made to the Participant's Beneficiary 
as follows:
          (A)  If the Participant's Beneficiary is his or her 
surviving spouse, such Participant's entire account balance under 
this Program shall be paid as follows: 
(i) ten  annual installments or a shorter 
schedule, if so elected by the surviving 
spouse, or
(ii) a lump sum payment payable on or about 
the January 1st following the Participant's 
death.
          (B)  If the Participant's Beneficiary is someone other 
than his or her surviving spouse, such Participant's entire 
account balance under this Program shall be paid in a lump sum 
payment as soon as practical following the Participant's death.
          2.   If a Participant dies at any time after payment of 
his or her account balance under this Program has begun, such 
Participant's Beneficiary shall continue to receive payment of 
the Participant's account in the same manner as the Participant 
elected, or such shorter payment schedule as elected by the 
Beneficiary.
     (f)  If any lump sum distribution otherwise payable under 
this Program would be disallowed in any part as a deduction to 
the Corporation in accordance with Section 162(m) (or a successor 
Section) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Compensation Committee 
may determine to distribute the amount of such benefit in 
installments such that the Participant or Beneficiary shall 
receive the maximum amount permissible in each installment and 
still preserve the Corporation's full tax deduction.
     6.3     Amount of Payment   (a)  If a Participant is 
terminated by the Corporation for cause, he or she shall receive 
the lesser of (A) any amounts he or she actually deferred under 
Article V, less any previous payments made or (B) his or her 
account balance under this Program.  Such payment shall be made 
in a lump sum payment as soon as administratively practical 
following the Participant's termination of employment; provided, 
however, that such Participant will forfeit all Earnings Accruals 
credited to him or her pursuant to Article VIII.
     (b)  If a Participant voluntarily separates from employment 
with the Corporation or retires under the Retirement Program with 
an actuarially reduced pension, he or she shall receive, (i) with 
respect to deferral elections made before 1995, a lump sum 
payment equal to the lesser of (A) any amounts he or she actually 
deferred under this Program, plus credits to his or her account 
at the Fixed Income Rate from his or her Date of Deferral less 
any previous payments made or (B) his or her account balance 
under this Program, and (ii) with respect to deferral elections 
made in 1995 and later, his or her account balance.  Such 
payments will be made as soon as administratively practical after 
the Participant's termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, a Participant who retires under the Retirement Program 
with an actuarially reduced pension may elect to receive his or 
her payments in any form described in Section 6.2.
     (c) If a Participant terminates employment on account of 
Retirement, Disability, death, or through action of the 
Corporation taken without cause, such Participant (or 
Beneficiary) shall be entitled to receive the full amount of his 
or her account balance.
     6.4     Payment in U.S. Dollars.  All payments under this 
Program shall be made in U.S. dollars.
     6.5     Reduction of Payments.  All payments under this 
Program shall be reduced by any and all tax payments that the 
Corporation is required to withhold pursuant to applicable law. 


                           ARTICLE VII
                          BENEFICIARIES

     7.1  A Participant may at any time, and from time to time, 
prior to his or her death designate one or more Beneficiaries to 
receive any payments to be made following the Participant's 
death.  If no such designation is on file with the Corporation at 
the time of a Participant's death, the Participant's Beneficiary 
shall be the beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the 
beneficiary designation most recently filed by the Participant 
under the Corporation's Savings Program.  If a Participant has 
not effectively designated a beneficiary under the Savings 
Program, or if no designated beneficiary has survived the 
Participant, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be the 
Participant's surviving spouse, or, if no spouse has survived the 
Participant, the estate of the deceased Participant.  If an 
individual Beneficiary cannot be located for a period of one year 
following the Participant's death, despite mail notification to 
the Beneficiary's last known address, and if the Beneficiary has 
not made a written claim for benefits within such period to the 
Administrative Committee, the Beneficiary shall be treated as 
having predeceased the Participant.  The Administrative Committee 
may require such proof of death and such evidence of the right of 
any person to receive all or part of a deceased Participant 
account balance, as the Administrative Committee may consider 
appropriate.  The Administrative Committee may rely upon any 
direction by the legal representatives of the estate of a 
deceased Participant, without liability to any other person.



                          ARTICLE VIII
                        EARNINGS ACCRUALS
     8.1   Each Participant's account balance under this Program 
shall be credited with earnings from the Date of Deferral through 
the date such deferral is paid out or withdrawn pursuant to 
Article VI.  Earnings under this Section 8.1 shall accrue at the 
rate elected in accordance with Section 8.2.
     8.2  (a)       Earnings accruing in accordance with Section 
8.1 shall accrue at (i) the Fixed Income Rate, (ii) the UCC Stock 
Value Rate, (iii) the UCC Discounted Stock Value Rate, (iv) the 
Applicable Equity Investment Fund Rate or (v) a combination of 
the four rates.  An election to use the UCC Discounted Stock 
Value Rate shall be effective for not less than one (1) year.  
Amounts deferred pursuant to Section 5.2(c) cannot accrue at the 
UCC Discounted Stock Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a 
Participant has elected under Section 6.1 to receive payment of 
his or her account balance upon termination of employment, and 
such Participant's employment is terminated by the Corporation 
without cause, such Participant may then receive a distribution 
based on the UCC Discounted Stock Value Rate even if one (1) year 
has not yet passed since the relevant Date of Deferral.
     (b)  Subject to subparagraph (c), a Participant shall 
designate at the time of his or her election to defer any amounts 
under this Program which accrual rate or rates shall apply to his 
or her deferrals (deferrals of matching contributions made 
pursuant to Section 5.4 shall be allocated to the same accrual 
rates as those selected for base salary deferrals for the same 
year); provided such elections must be in whole percentage 
points.  Such elections shall be effective as of the Date of 
Deferral through the date such deferral is paid out or withdrawn 
pursuant to Article VI. 
     (c)  A Participant may, one time each calendar month, elect 
to change the accrual rate under this Section 8.2 with respect to 
any or all previous deferrals under this Program; provided, 
however, that Participants may elect to utilize the UCC 
Discounted Stock Value Rate with respect to future deferrals 
only, and not for the reallocation of any prior deferrals.  
Participants may utilize the UCC Stock Value Rate only for 
reallocation of previous deferrals.



                           ARTICLE IX
                     GENERAL PROVISIONS     
     9.1     Prohibition of Assignment of Transfer.  Any 
assignment, hypothecation, pledge or transfer of a Participant's 
or Beneficiary's right to receive payments under this Program 
shall be null and void and shall be disregarded, except to the 
extent required by law.
     9.2     Program Not to Be Funded.  The Corporation is not 
required, for the purpose of funding this Program, to segregate 
any monies from its general funds, create any trusts, or make any 
special deposits, and the right of a Participant or Beneficiary 
to receive a payment under this Program shall be no greater than 
the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. 
     9.3     Effect of Participation.  Neither selection as a 
Participant, nor an election to participate or participation in 
this Program, shall entitle a Participant to receive awards under 
the Variable Compensation Plans, SRIP or Equalization Plan or a 
matching contribution under the Savings Program, or affect the 
Corporation's right to discharge a Participant.
     9.4     Communications To Be in Writing.  All elections, 
requests and communications to the Corporation or its designated 
agent from Participants and Beneficiaries, and all communications 
to such persons from the Corporation, shall be in writing, and in 
such form and manner, and within such time, as the Corporation 
shall determine.  In lieu of the foregoing, the Corporation may 
install a telephonic voice response system for such elections, 
requests and communications. 
     9.5     Absence of Liability.  No officer, director or 
employee of the Corporation shall be personally liable for any 
acts or omission to act under this Program or, except in 
circumstances involving bad faith, for such officer's, director's 
or employee's own act or omission to act. 
     9.6     Titles for Reference Only.  The titles given herein 
to sections and subsections are for reference only and are not to 
be used to interpret the provisions of this Program. 
     9.7     New York Law To Govern.  All questions pertaining to 
the construction, regulation, validity and effect of the 
provisions of this Program shall be determined in accordance with 
New York law. 
     9.8     Amendment.  The Compensation Committee may amend 
this Program at any time, but no amendment may be adopted which 
alters the payments due Participants or Beneficiaries, as of the 
date of the amendment, or the times at which payments are due, 
without the consent of each Participant affected by the amendment 
and of each Beneficiary (of a then deceased Participant) affected 
by the amendment.  In addition, any amendment which does not 
increase the Corporation's annual cost of any past or future 
benefits under this Program by more than $500,000, change the 
eligibility requirements, or impact the ability of officers to 
utilize the UCC Discounted Stock Value Rate or the UCC Stock 
Value Rate, may be authorized by the Administrative Committee.
     9.9     Program Termination.  The Compensation Committee may 
terminate this Program for any reason and at any time.  In the 
event of such termination, the accounts of each Participant or 
Beneficiary under this Program shall become immediately payable 
in accordance with Section 6.1; provided that the Compensation 
Committee, in its sole discretion, upon Program termination or at 
any time thereafter, may decide to make lump sum payments in lieu 
of annual payments.

At a Glance

Union Carbide Corporation is a worldwide chemicals and polymers company with 
sales of nearly $5.9 billion. The company possesses many of the industry's 
most advanced process and catalyst technologies and some of the most cost-
efficient, large-scale production facilities in the world. In addition to its 
consolidated operations, the corporation participates in 50 percent-owned 
joint ventures whose combined revenues totaled more than $3.5 billion in 1995.

  Union Carbide operates two business segments, Specialties & Intermediates 
and Basic Chemicals & Polymers.

  Specialties & Intermediates converts basic and intermediate chemicals such 
as propylene, ethylene and ethylene oxide into thousands of products sold to 
industrial customers in many markets, including paints and coatings, wire and 
cable, household and personal care products, agriculture, food and oil and 
gas. In addition, the Specialties & Intermediates segment licenses olefins-
based technologies and offers other specialized technology licensing and 
services. Revenues of the Specialties & Intermediates segment have averaged 73 
percent of total consolidated results over the past three years, and sales 
volumes 55 percent.

  Basic Chemicals & Polymers converts various hydrocarbon feedstocks, 
including liquefied petroleum products and naphtha, into the basic building-
block chemicals ethylene and propylene (also known as olefins). The segment 
then uses state-of-the-art process technologies to convert manufactured and 
purchased olefins into polyethylene (the world's most widely used plastic), 
and polypropylene (one of the world's fastest-growing, large-volume plastics). 
UCC also converts ethylene into ethylene oxide, which is used to make ethylene 
glycol (for polyester fiber, film and resin, and automotive antifreeze) and 
many other products. Basic Chemicals & Polymers also provides ethylene, 
propylene, and ethylene oxide as raw materials to the Specialties & 
Intermediates segment.

  The leading Union Carbide end markets as a percentage of sales are:
     o Paints, coatings and adhesives                    23%
     o Packaging and consumer plastics                   18%
     o Wire and cable                                    13%
     o Textile                                           11%
     o Household and personal care                        7%
     o Automotive, including antifreeze                   5%
     o Agricultural and food                              3%
     o Oil and gas                                        2%
     o Industrial cleaners                                2%

Growing Stronger in Specialties & Intermediates

(Contained within this section is a picture of William H. Joyce, Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer.)

It's a pleasure in my first letter to shareholders as chairman and CEO to 
report that Carbide had a banner year in 1995, posting record earnings, 
launching joint ventures in key overseas markets, introducing new products and 
expanding profitable businesses.

  The year just ended was the first full year after completing our four-year 
profit improvement program, which eliminated $575 million of costs. The 
program produced benefits almost from the start, but our 1995 performance 
confirmed the full effect.

  Net income of $915 million rose 141 percent compared to the prior year, on 
sales of $5.9 billion, up 21 percent compared to 1994. Fully diluted earnings 
per share rose 157 percent to $5.83. 

  Carbide also generated sufficient cash flow to buy back stock, reducing 
outstanding shares by 9.3 million during the year (16.9 million since the 
beginning of 1993), to fund ambitious growth plans and to do both while 
maintaining a comfortably low 39 percent debt-to-capital ratio.

  We also sharpened our focus on Carbide's core chemicals and plastics 
operations by selling our remaining interest in UCAR International, a 
manufacturer of carbon and graphite electrodes, for net proceeds of $542 
million.

  So when Carbide people talk about unlocking shareholder value, we mean what 
we say. Our stock price of $37.50 at year-end 1995 was 28 percent ahead of 
where it closed at the end of 1994, and 230 percent ahead of where it was in 
mid-1992, when we started operations as a company committed solely to the 
chemical industry.

  If you owned Carbide stock in January of 1991 and reinvested the dividends 
and the July 1992 special distribution, the value of your investment would 
have appreciated 563 percent by year-end 1995, an average annualized return of 
46 percent. 

  The remarkable gains of the past several years may be tough to repeat, but 
Carbiders everywhere, nearly all of whom are shareholders, will be giving it 
all we have.

  At this writing there is still a good deal of uncertainty about chemical 
markets in 1996. If customers begin rebuilding their depleted inventories, and 
if the number and duration of ethylene plant shutdowns is about normal during 
the year, we think supplies will be tighter and markets stronger than many 
expect. That would mean firmer prices, possibly moving up as 1996 progresses. 

  We also believe that with our new cost structure and streamlined work 
processes, and with our Specialties & Intermediates segment now contributing 
more to total sales and income, Carbide can post competitive results in any 
1996 scenario.

  Indeed, the role of these less cyclical businesses has become so important 
to understanding Carbide's prospects that we began in the third quarter of 
1995 to report separately the sales, operating profit and other financial data 
of our Specialties & Intermediates (S&I) segment and our more cyclical Basic 
Chemicals & Polymers (BC&P) segment.

  We think there's a lot of room to grow profitably in Basic Chemicals & 
Polymers, but our stake in the less cyclical Specialties & Intermediates is 
even larger. The S&I segment accounted for 70 percent of our total sales 
revenue in 1995 and, excluding special items, 62 percent of our operating 
profit. And we supported the segment with $392 million, 72 percent of our 1995 
capital program of $542 million.

  The S&I segment also demonstrated its growing competitive strength in 1995. 
For example:

o Unipol Systems began preparations for an early 1996 commercial-scale trial 
of new proprietary metallocene catalyst-based Unipol Process technology. 
Successful development will mean that Carbide can continue to offer customers 
the widest range of polyethylene products.  Manufacturers of film for such 
high-volume markets as shrink-wrap and packaging will be the first customers 
for the new resins, which offer outstanding toughness and clarity.

o Unipol Systems also added five new licensees during the year for Unipol 
Process technology, bringing the worldwide total to 72, and sold three more 
licenses to existing licensees for expansions.

o Specialty Polymers and Products increased sales volume by 9.7 percent during 
1995 and reduced its cost per pound of product sold by 5.7 percent.

o Specialty Polyolefins' concentration on Asian and other overseas markets for 
its wire and cable insulation and jacketing led to 11 percent volume growth in 
those markets in the face of weaker U.S. demand.

o Industrial Performance Chemicals (IPC) boosted its share of the U.S. market 
for aircraft anti-icing fluids by about 50 percent during the year, to an 
estimated 75 percent, with a new fluid that provides longer-lasting anti-icing 
protection. IPC also is seeking independent lab certification of a new, dual-
purpose fluid that airline customers can use either for deicing aircraft or as 
an anti-icer, to keep ice from forming.

  Moreover, continuing cost reductions will benefit both the S&I and BC&P 
segments. In October we announced an annual net savings target of $637 million 
by year-end 2000 (in then-current dollars) compared to costs in 1993, the 
bottom of the last chemical business cycle. Of that total, $96 million of 
reductions is targeted for the S&I segment, and $282 million of reductions for 
the BC&P segment to help it achieve, before the end of the decade, the goal of 
at least break-even performance at the bottom of the chemical business cycle. 

  Both segments also will benefit from most of the other elements of the cost-
reduction program, including a targeted $156 million of savings from a massive 
information technology (IT) program under way throughout the company. The IT 
program will integrate and dramatically improve the speed and efficiency of 
virtually every business activity that depends on data, from accounting to 
order processing to research and development to environmental reporting. 

  Other major initiatives target savings from new manufacturing efficiencies, 
reduced distribution costs and more cost-efficient engineering support and 
project installation.

As for 1995, our performance not only made for a great year, but also 
reaffirmed our belief in Carbide's long-term growth and profit potential. 

  For example, our 39.2 percent return on capital (ROC) - profit after-tax but 
before interest charges, divided by total invested capital - was well above 
the 32 percent that was our goal for the peak of the chemical business cycle. 
We also believe that reaching our 1993 to 2000 cost-savings target would 
enable Carbide to exceed the 8 percent ROC goal we thought we could earn at 
the bottom of the chemical business cycle. 

  We had said at the start of our profit improvement program that we believed 
Carbide should earn an average 15 percent ROC over the full cycle, about 
double our ROC over the last full chemical cycle. But our performance in the 
1993 bottom, and then in the upturn that began in mid-1994 (but never reached 
the peak margins of 1988-89), suggests that we can do even better.

  And there were other welcome surprises. Not only have cost reductions 
substantially improved the performance and prospects of our larger businesses, 
but a number of smaller businesses that had been steady but unremarkable 
performers are now posting returns that support investment for growth.

  For example, we're investing in new capacity for propionic acid, an integral 
part of our oxo chemical business that is recognized as a world leader in 
technology. Major markets for propionic acid include feed and food additives, 
herbicides and chemical intermediates.

  We're also adding capacity at our South Charleston, W.Va., plant for 
synthetic base resin for chewing gum, another of our less-cyclical specialty 
businesses with new luster. Demand for chewing gum has taken off with the move 
to smoke-free workplaces and the rapid growth of Asian and East European 
markets.

Whether in our smaller businesses or our largest, we continue to concentrate 
efforts and resources where Carbide has a clear competitive advantage. 

  Our solvents and intermediates business, the leading North American supplier 
of these materials to the paint and coatings industry, has just completed a 
300 million-pound-capacity butanol expansion at our Taft, La., plant using our 
advanced proprietary technologies. We're planning another facility of similar 
size at Taft, slated for 1998 start-up. 

  Our Taft plant will also increase capacity of acrolein by one third over the 
next two years. Acrolein is used mainly as an intermediate to produce biocides 
and in a product of ours that is sold for use in the production of animal 
nutritional supplements - primarily for poultry feed. We are increasing 
capacity for this acrolein-based intermediate by 40 percent at Taft.

  And Taft is boosting capacity for acrylate esters by 80 million pounds, to 
365 million pounds, and adding 50 million pounds of capacity for the acrylic 
acid from which the esters are derived. The esters are building-block 
chemicals for polymers used in paints and coatings, inks, textiles, adhesives 
and plastic products. 

  Our Texas City, Tex., plant completed a vinyl acetate expansion, boosting 
capacity to 720 million pounds. Vinyl acetate is used in adhesives and 
architectural coatings and for the emulsion resins in paper coatings and 
construction products.

  A key competitive advantage in these growing markets stems from Carbide's 
low-cost, low-pressure process for making oxo alcohols, the principal raw 
materials in the manufacture of esters.

  The Unipol II facility at our Star plant in Taft, La., started up at midyear 
1995. Although equipment problems will delay production of our new high-
strength, easy-processing, linear low-density polyethylene resins, the plant 
has been operating at full capacity, producing other polyethylene film resins.

  And we expect our new ethylene propylene rubber business to begin 
commercial-scale operations in the fourth quarter of 1996. A 200 million-
pound-capacity reactor nearing completion at our Seadrift, Tex., plant will 
supply the new materials. After several years of lab and production line 
trials, they are near full qualification for commercial production at some of 
the world's largest manufacturers of hose and tubing, construction materials 
and automotive trim.

  Several joint ventures and acquisitions completed in '95 also reflect 
Carbide's strategy of putting our chips on businesses that can benefit from 
our technology and other competitive advantages. 

  Aspell Polymeres, our French joint venture with Elf Atochem, will use Unipol 
Process technology and other proprietary Union Carbide technologies to 
manufacture polyethylene resins and compounds at very competitive costs for 
the European market. Carbide will market all the wire and cable compounds 
manufactured by the venture.

  Polimeri Europa, the joint venture formed last year with EniChem of Milan, a 
major European polyethylene producer, will use Unipol Process technology to 
attain a low-cost position in European commodity polyethylene markets. With 
2.9 billion pounds of product, the venture is one of Europe's leading 
suppliers of these resins.

  We also formed a joint venture in Korea with BP Chemicals and Samsung Fine 
Chemicals to manufacture vinyl acetate monomer for the Asia-Pacific market. 
The new capacity will help us keep abreast of customer needs and also support 
the rapid growth of Carbide's latex business in the Asia-Pacific region.

  The acquisition in 1995 of certain ethylene oxide derivatives businesses 
from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) of London greatly strengthens 
Carbide's competitive position in the U.K. and continental Europe. It also 
strengthens our position as worldwide market leader in ethylene glycol, 
ethanolamines and glycol ethers, as well as our solid position in brake 
fluids. The former ICI businesses performed well in their first year in the 
Carbide fold, setting a slate of production records.

  Carbide also signed an agreement to acquire the polypropylene assets and 
business of Shell Oil Company. Polypropylene is one of the world's fastest-
growing, large-volume plastics and a natural fit with Carbide's other 
polyolefin product lines. We completed the purchase in January 1996.

  Carbide's Unipol polypropylene process is among the most widely used in the 
world, with 26 licensees accounting for 3.8 billion pounds of world capacity. 
The Shell acquisition, combined with our own expansion activities, will bring 
Carbide's total polypropylene production capacity to 800 million pounds a 
year.

  And in July we finalized the agreement with Petrochemical Industries Company 
and Boubyan Petrochemical Company of Kuwait to establish Equate Petrochemical 
Company, a joint venture that will build and operate a world-scale 
petrochemicals complex in Kuwait. 

  Construction is moving ahead on schedule toward the mid-1997 target date for 
completion. We have high hopes for Equate, whose raw material and technology 
advantages will make this venture a formidable world-scale competitor in 
polyethylene and ethylene glycol markets.

As in any year, no matter how good, there are bound to be disappointments, and 
1995 was no exception.

  We set an ambitious annual volume growth target that we failed to meet in 
1995, mainly due to operating problems that slowed production at some key 
units in the first half and to customer inventory destocking of certain 
product lines that reduced demand in the second half. 

  But we used the downtime to replace aging equipment, tighten inspection 
routines, beef up training and implement other programs that should result in 
marked improvement in equipment reliability. Growth and cost control are the 
twin routes to improved productivity, and Carbiders are well aware that we 
must do better in 1996. 

  With respect to our health, safety and environmental performance, we were 
gratified that for the fourth year in a row there were no fatalities at any 
Carbide location and that our employee injury and illness rates were down by 
28 percent compared to 1994. We had no major process incidents in 1995, but we 
can do a better job of preventing spills. We are determined to rank with the 
best companies in our industry when it comes to preventing spills, and I 
believe we are doing what it takes to get there.

(For more information about our environmental performance and the progress 
made in implementing the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care 
codes of management practice - the main drivers of industry performance 
improvement - write to Carbide's Public Affairs Department for our Responsible 
Care progress report.)

  On a personal note, James M. Hester, who has served on Carbide's board with 
great distinction since 1963, will not stand for reelection, in accordance 
with the board's retirement policy. We will miss his support, experience and 
wise counsel.

  Finally, I want to use this space to note the debt of gratitude that all of 
us at Carbide owe to Bob Kennedy, who retired as chairman at the end of 1995.

  It was Bob who championed the separation of Union Carbide into several 
sharply focused companies. He could see what others missed - that the parts 
would be viable and vibrant on their own, and that their accomplishments as 
individual companies would surpass anything they achieved together in what we 
now call "the old Carbide."

  He also knew that shareholders and employees alike would benefit from the 
change. Bob is a gentleman and a friend. He will be sorely missed by all of 
us.

Summary and Outlook
Union Carbide operates two business segments, Specialties & Intermediates and 
Basic Chemicals & Polymers. Specialties & Intermediates converts basic and 
intermediate chemicals into a diverse portfolio of chemicals and polymers 
serving industrial customers in many markets. This segment also provides 
technology services, including licensing, to the oil and petrochemicals 
industries. The Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment converts hydrocarbon 
feedstocks, principally liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha, into polyethylene 
and ethylene oxide/glycol for sale to third-party customers, as well as 
propylene, ethylene and ethylene oxide for consumption by the Specialties & 
Intermediates segment. In contrast to those of the Specialties & Intermediates 
segment, the revenues and operating profit of Basic Chemicals & Polymers tend 
to be more cyclical and very sensitive to a number of external variables, 
including overall economic demand, hydrocarbon feedstock costs and plant 
operating rates.
    In 1995 the corporation's profitability benefited from improved pricing in 
virtually all product groups, with particular strength in polyethylene through 
midyear and in ethylene oxide/glycol throughout the year. This improvement, 
coupled with modest volume increases, lower average feedstock costs, continued 
benefits from ongoing productivity improvement programs and strong partnership 
earnings, contributed to the year's very strong operating profits in both the 
Specialties & Intermediates and Basic Chemicals & Polymers segments. In 
addition, net income was enhanced by a nonrecurring after-tax gain associated 
with the sales of the corporation's investment in UCAR International Inc., 
only partially offset by a number of nonrecurring after-tax losses. During 
most of the preceding two-year period, corporate results were negatively 
affected by low margins in ethylene oxide/glycol and polyethylene, leading, in 
turn, to operating losses in the Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment. 
Specialties & Intermediates reported increased operating profit in each of the 
past three years, reflecting the benefits of improved volumes, cost reduction 
programs and good partnership results. 

    Highlights of 1995 included:
    o  Start-up of a new Unipol II polyethylene facility and a 300 million-
       pound-capacity butanol unit at Taft, La.; incremental expansion of 
       certain Specialties & Intermediates production facilities, and 
       completion of significant infrastructure projects.

    o  Acquisition of certain ethylene oxide derivative businesses from 
       Imperial Chemical Industries of London.

    o  Commencement of operations of Polimeri Europa, a joint venture with 
       EniChem of Milan, to develop, manufacture and sell polyethylene resins 
       in Europe.

    o  Commencement of operations of Aspell Polymeres, a joint venture with 
       Elf Atochem of Paris, to manufacture polyethylene resins and compounds 
       for the European wire and cable industries and other markets.

    o  Formation of Equate, a joint venture with two Kuwaiti companies,

    Lower average polyethylene pricing is expected to negatively affect Basic 
Chemicals & Polymers operating profits, as well as earnings of partnerships 
and companies carried at equity, at least through the first half of 1996. 
Whether this trend will continue beyond that will depend on the strength of 
U.S. and global economies as well as on the availability of ethylene supplies 
and customer demand for polyethylene. Specialties & Intermediates should 
continue to perform well, although any weakness in the overall economy will 
affect its results.

1995 Compared with 1994
Sales revenues of the Specialties & Intermediates segment increased 13.4 
percent, almost entirely because of increased average selling prices, 
primarily in the solvents and intermediates area. Volumes increased slightly. 
Although variable margin (sales revenues less variable manufacturing and 
distribution costs) increased by 9 percent from 1994 to 1995, it declined as a 
percentage of sales, from 48.1 percent to 46.2 percent, because of increased 
raw material costs. Gross margin (variable margin less fixed manufacturing and 
distribution costs) as a percentage of sales remained stable at 27.8 percent 
in 1995 compared to 27.9 percent in 1994. Fixed manufacturing and distribution 
costs rose $23 million, or 3.1 percent, compared to 1994, because of expenses 
related to new growth projects, start-up costs related to new manufacturing 
facilities and increased profit sharing.
    The segment's 1995 selling, administration and other expenses (SA&O) 
included a charge of $48 million for postemployment benefits, including 
severance. Excluding this charge, SA&O increased by $27 million, or 12.1 
percent, reflecting increased profit sharing, as well as the costs of new 
ventures and currency effects. Research and development expenditures increased 
by $6 million to $114 million.
    Operating profit increased in 1995 to $709 million from $634 million in 
1994. In addition to the postemployment benefit charge, operating profit in 
1995 included an increase in depreciation expense of $12 million representing 
the cumulative effect of a reduction in the lives of certain computer 
equipment.

1994 Compared with 1993
The segment's sales revenues increased 4.3 percent, as a result of a 9.9 
percent increase in volume partially offset by a 5.0 percent decline in 
average selling prices. Although variable margin remained stable, it declined 
as a percentage of sales from 50.3 percent in 1993 to 48.1 percent in 1994. 
Excluding the OrganoSilicon business (OSi), sold in July 1993, the 1993 
variable margin would have been 49.9 percent. Gross margin as a percentage of 
sales declined to 27.9 percent in 1994 from 29.0 percent in 1993 (28.6 percent 
excluding OSi). Fixed manufacturing and distribution costs, excluding OSi, 
increased 4.4 percent versus 1993, notwithstanding the even greater year-to-
year increase in volume.
    SA&O declined 19.0 percent to $224 million (a 12.7 percent decline 
excluding OSi from the 1993 totals) as the segment benefited from the 
corporation's ongoing cost reduction/work process improvement programs. 
Research and development expenditures remained stable on a year-to-year basis 
(increased 8 percent excluding OSi, as a result of new developmental 
projects).
    Operating profit in 1994 increased to $634 million from $526 million in 
1993. Included in 1994 operating profit were nonrecurring gains of $81 million 
on the sale of a manufacturing site and distribution terminal in Hong Kong and 
$24 million on the sale of the corporation's preferred stock investment in the 
segment's former OSi business, and a nonrecurring charge of $68 million for 
litigation costs and other costs related to divested operations. The 1993 
operating profit included a gain of $54 million from the sale of the OSi 
business and a loss of $9 million on the sale of a medical device company.

Identifiable assets               2,095     1,511     1,363

1995 Compared with 1994
Sales revenues of the Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment increased 47.4 
percent, primarily due to a 38.9 percent increase in average customer selling 
prices and 3.5 percent higher volumes. Variable margin as a percentage of 
sales rose to 46.4 percent in 1995 from 34.0 percent in 1994. Ethylene 
oxide/glycol margins improved through the third quarter of 1995 and remained 
stable thereafter, while polyethylene margins improved in the first half of 
the year and declined thereafter due to falling prices. Gross margin as a 
percentage of sales rose to 30.8 percent in 1995 as compared to 12.7 percent 
in 1994. Fixed manufacturing and distribution costs increased by $24 million, 
or 8.0 percent, compared to 1994, due to acquired businesses, start-up costs 
related to new facilities and profit sharing.
    SA&O included a charge of $20 million for postemployment benefits, 
including severance. Excluding this charge, SA&O increased by 1.7 percent to 
$67 million from 1994 to 1995 after absorbing the cost of increased profit 
sharing and acquired businesses. Research and development expenditures 
remained stable on a year-to-year basis.
    Operating profit in 1995, including the $20 million postemployment benefit 
charge, was $444 million, compared to an operating loss of $22 million in 
1994. 

1994 Compared with 1993
The segment's sales revenues increased 6.6 percent, reflecting a 3.2 percent 
increase in volume and a 2.9 percent increase in average customer selling 
prices. After falling through midyear, average selling prices rose through the 
third and fourth quarters, while raw material feedstock prices declined 
slightly from 1993. Variable margin as a percentage of sales was 34.0 percent 
in 1994, in comparison to 27.3 percent in 1993. Gross margin as a percentage 
of sales rose to 12.7 percent in 1994, as compared to 3.0 percent in 1993. 
Fixed manufacturing and distribution costs decreased $21 million, or 6.5 
percent, versus 1993, notwithstanding the year-to-year increase in volumes.
    SA&O remained relatively stable on a year-to-year basis, as did research 
and development expenditures.
    Operating losses declined 89.4 percent, to $22 million in 1994 from $208 
million in 1993. Included in the 1993 operating loss was a $46 million charge 
from the shutdown of an ethylene oxide/glycol manufacturing facility in Canada 
and a loss of $9 million on the write-down of a Canadian business.

    The Other segment includes the operating profit (loss) of noncore 
activities and financial transactions. Over the past three years, the 
corporation has pursued programs to minimize investments in noncore assets. 
With the sales of its remaining interest in UCAR International in 1995, these 
programs have been substantially completed. Sale of the UCAR International 
investment resulted in a nonrecurring pre-tax gain of $381 million, included 
in 1995 operating profit. This gain was partially offset by a $191 million 
charge for unused office space at the corporation's headquarters. The 1994 
operating loss included a $24 million charge on the write-down and sale of the 
corporation's stockholding in Union Carbide India Limited and a $12 million 
loss on the sale of interests in a uranium mill and mines. In 1993 the 
operating loss included a gain of $8 million from the sale of a corporate 
aircraft.

Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment
Worldwide costs relating to environmental protection continue to be 
significant, due primarily to stringent laws and regulations and to the 
corporation's commitment to industry initiatives such as Responsible Care, as 
well as to its own internal standards. In 1995 worldwide expenses of 
continuing operations related to environmental protection for compliance with 
Federal, state and local laws regulating solid and hazardous wastes and 
discharge of materials to air and water, as well as for waste site remedial 
activities, totaled $138 million. Expenses in 1994 and 1993 were $153 million 
and $149 million, respectively. In addition, worldwide capital expenditures 
relating to environmental protection in 1995 totaled $49 million, compared 
with $57 million and $51 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     The corporation, like other companies in the U.S., periodically receives 
notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from state 
environmental agencies, as well as claims from other companies, alleging that 
the corporation is a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and 
equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as Superfund) for 
past and future cleanup costs at hazardous waste sites at which the 
corporation is alleged to have disposed of, or arranged for treatment or 
disposal of, hazardous substances. The corporation is also undertaking 
environmental investigation and remediation projects at hazardous waste sites 
located on property currently and formerly owned by the corporation pursuant 
to Superfund, as well as to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and 
equivalent state laws.
    There are approximately 136 hazardous waste sites at which management 
believes it is probable or reasonably possible that the corporation will incur 
liability for investigation and/or remediation costs. The corporation has 
established accruals for those hazardous waste sites where it is probable that 
a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be 
estimated. The reliability and precision of the loss estimates are affected by 
numerous factors, such as the stage of site evaluation, the allocation of 
responsibility among PRPs and the assertion of additional claims. The 
corporation adjusts its accruals as new remediation requirements are defined, 
as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made, 
and to reflect new and changing facts.
     At Dec. 31, 1995, the corporation's accruals for environmental 
remediation totaled $327 million ($297 million in 1994). Approximately 59 
percent of the accrual (54 percent in 1994) pertains to estimated future 
expenditures for site investigation and cleanup, and approximately 41 percent 
(46 percent in 1994) pertains to estimated expenditures for closure and 
postclosure activities. See Note 16 to the financial statements for a 
discussion of the environmental sites for which the corporation has 
remediation responsibility. In addition, the corporation had environmental 
loss contingencies of $163 million at Dec. 31, 1995.
    Estimates of future costs of environmental protection are necessarily 
imprecise, due to numerous uncertainties. These include the impact of new laws 
and regulations, the availability and application of new and diverse 
technologies, the identification of new hazardous waste sites at which the 
corporation may be a PRP and, in the case of Superfund sites, the ultimate 
allocation of costs among PRPs and the final determination of the remedial 
requirements. While estimating such future costs is inherently imprecise, 
taking into consideration the corporation's experience to date regarding 
environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known, the 
corporation estimates that worldwide expenses related to environmental 
protection, expressed in 1995 dollars, should average about $140 million 
annually over the next five years.
    Worldwide capital expenditures for environmental protection, also 
expressed in 1995 dollars, are expected to average about $46 million annually 
over the same period. Management anticipates that future annual costs for 
environmental protection after 2000 will continue at levels comparable to the 
five-year average estimates.
    Subject to the inherent imprecision and uncertainties in estimating and 
predicting future costs of environmental protection, it is management's 
opinion that any future annual costs for environmental protection in excess of 
the five-year average estimates stated here, plus those costs anticipated to 
continue thereafter, would not have a material adverse effect on the 
corporation's consolidated financial position. Such excess costs, if any, 
could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations in 
a given quarter or year.

Litigation
The corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in a number of 
legal proceedings and claims with both private and governmental parties. These 
cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, product 
liability; governmental regulatory proceedings; health, safety and 
environmental matters; employment; patents; contracts, and taxes. In addition, 
the corporation continues to be named as one of a number of defendants in 
lawsuits, some of which have more than one plaintiff, involving silicone gel 
breast implants. The corporation supplied bulk silicone materials to certain 
companies that at various times were involved in the manufacture of breast 
implants. These cases are discussed in more detail in the Commitments and 
Contingencies note to the financial statements. In some of these legal 
proceedings and claims, the cost of remedies that may be sought or damages 
claimed is substantial. While it is impossible at this time to determine with 
certainty the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceedings and claims, 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable 
losses with respect thereto and that such ultimate outcome, after provisions 
therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated 
financial position of the corporation but could have a material effect on 
consolidated results of operations in a given quarter or year. Should any 
losses be sustained in connection with any of such legal proceedings and 
claims in excess of provisions therefor, they will be charged to income in the 
future.

Partnerships and Corporate Joint Ventures 
The corporation has for many years participated in a number of businesses 
through 50 percent-owned partnerships and corporate joint ventures. On a 
combined basis, the unconsolidated sales of these entities totaled $3.9 
billion in 1995, compared to $2.8 billion in 1994. The most significant of 
these businesses include:

    Partnerships:

    UOP - a worldwide supplier of process technology, catalysts, molecular 
    sieves and adsorbents (see page 8 for manufacturing sites).

    Petromont - a Canada-based polyethylene resins producer with a facility at 
    Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

    Union Carbide/Shell Polypropylene - a U.S.-based producer of specialty 
    polypropylene and licensor of polypropylene technology. In January 1996 
    the corporation acquired Shell Oil Company's interest in this partnership.

    World Ethanol - a U.S.-based supplier of ethanol.

    Aspell Polymeres - a French producer of polyolefins, with a facility at 
    Gonfreville, France.

    Corporate Joint Ventures:

    Polimeri Europa - a Europe-based producer of ethylene and polyethylene 
    resins, with facilities at Dunkirk, France; Oberhausen, Germany, and 
    Brindisi, Ferrara, Gela, Priolo and Ragusa, Italy.

    Nippon Unicar - a Japan-based producer of commodity and specialty 
    polyolefins resins, with a facility at Kawasaki, Japan.

    Alberta & Orient Glycol - a Canada-based producer of ethylene glycol, with 
    a facility at Prentiss, Alberta, Canada.

    UCAR International - UCC's interest sold in 1995. 

    Following is a summary of partnership and corporate joint venture results 
for the past three years.

    Partnership income increased in 1995, primarily due to increased earnings 
from UOP and Petromont. In 1994 the increase was largely due to improved 
results from Petromont and the polypropylene partnership. The 1995 decline in 
the UCC share of net income of corporate joint ventures was due to the sales 
of the corporation's interest in UCAR International, partially offset by the 
addition of the Polimeri Europa joint venture. UCC share of net income of 
corporate joint ventures improved in 1994, largely due to improved results 
from UCAR International.
    In July 1995 the corporation and two Kuwaiti corporations formed a joint 
venture, Equate Petrochemical Company, to design, construct, operate and 
market products from a 650,000 metric-tons-per-year ethylene plant, a 450,000 
metric-tons-per-year Unipol polyethylene unit and 340,000 metric-tons-per-year 
ethylene glycol facility in Shuaiba, Kuwait. The complex is expected to cost 
approximately $2 billion, including working capital requirements, by mid-1997, 
its planned start-up date. The corporation has obtained insurance for 
political risk on its 45 percent equity interest in the venture.
    The corporation invested $134 million in Equate in 1995. In January 1996 
the corporation severally guaranteed $225 million of Equate debt. The 
remaining debt financing for the venture is expected to be in place during the 
latter part of 1996. UCC expects its several guarantees of Equate debt to 
approximate $600 million during the period of the facility's construction. 
These guarantees will end once certain completion tests are met, which is 
expected to occur by 2000.
    In January 1996 the corporation acquired the polypropylene assets and 
business of Shell Oil Company. Included are Shell's polypropylene technology 
and manufacturing facilities, as well as polypropylene assets previously held 
jointly by Union Carbide and Shell Oil.

Interest Expense
Interest expense rose $9 million to $89 million in 1995 as a result of 
increased borrowings, partially offset by increased capitalized interest and 
lower interest rates. The 1994 increase of $10 million to $80 million was due 
to rising interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 30.2 percent in 1995 as compared to 29.1 percent 
and 34.4 percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively. In each of these years the 
corporation's effective tax rate was reduced as a result of foreign sales 
corporation income taxed at a preferential rate and research and development 
tax credits. The effective tax rates in 1995 and 1993 were increased as a 
result of taxes provided on the sale of businesses (UCAR International in 1995 
and OSi in 1993).

Accounting Change
In 1995 the corporation adopted FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of 
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The effect of 
the adoption was not material. In 1994 the corporation adopted FAS 115, 
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The effect 
of the adoption was not material. In 1993 the corporation recorded a noncash 
after-tax charge of $97 million as a result of adopting FAS 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The charge represents the cumulative 
effect of the accounting standard and is set forth separately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation," effective for years beginning after Dec. 15, 1995, 
permits companies either to adopt a new method of accounting for employee 
stock options and similar equity instruments or to continue following the 
historical accounting method with supplemental pro forma disclosures. The 
corporation will continue its historical practice, and provide the necessary 
pro forma information when it adopts the standard in 1996.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA

Cash Flow from Operations
Cash flow from operations increased by $202 million to $763 million in 1995, 
as compared with 1994, due to increased earnings partially offset by an 
increase of working capital. Other noncash charges include a $191 million 
charge for future minimum lease payments on unused office space. Net gains on 
investing transactions include a $381 million gain on the sales of the 
corporation's remaining investment in UCAR International.

Cash Flow Used for Investing
Cash flow used for investing includes capital expenditures, investments and 
proceeds from the sales of investments and assets.
     Capital expenditures increased to $542 million in 1995, from $409 million 
in 1994 and $395 million in 1993. Major projects include, within the 
Specialties & Intermediates segment, a butanol unit and a cogeneration 
facility at Taft, La.; an ethylene propylene rubber project at Seadrift, Tex., 
and an energy systems renewal project at Texas City, Tex., and, within the 
Basic Chemicals & Polymers segment, a Unipol II polyethylene facility at Taft, 
La. (Star plant). An upgrade to the information technology infrastructure in 
preparation for the installation of integrated information technology systems 
throughout the company is a major project involving all segments.
    Over the past three years 44 percent of capital expenditures was directed 
at new capacity, 47 percent to cost reduction and replacement, and 9 percent 
to environmental, safety and health facilities. Of these expenditures, 93 
percent was in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
    Investments during 1995 included the $216 million acquisition of a 50 
percent interest in Polimeri Europa and a $134 million investment in the 
Equate joint venture. Investments during 1994, totaling $16 million, included 
a $26 million investment in a Brazilian ethylene company and a return of 
investment of $30 million from a financing affiliate. Investments during 1993 
totaled $39 million, including a $13 million investment in Petromont.
    Net proceeds from the sale of investments in 1995 included $542 million 
from the sales of the corporation's remaining interest in UCAR International. 
In 1994 proceeds from the sale of investments included $86 million from the 
sale of the corporation's preferred stock investment in OSi.
    The purchase of fixed and other assets in 1995 included the $71 million 
purchase of certain ethylene oxide derivative businesses in the U.K. Proceeds 
from the sale of fixed and other assets of $138 million in 1994 included $84 
million from the sale of a manufacturing facility and distribution terminal in 
Hong Kong and $13 million from the divestiture of the corporation's specialty 
electronic materials business and its interest in a Zimbabwe mining and 
smelting operation. In 1993 proceeds from the sale of fixed and other assets 
included $220 million related to the sale of the OSi business and $18 million 
from the sale of a corporate aircraft.
    At Dec. 31, 1995, the cost of completing authorized construction projects 
was estimated to be $921 million, of which $17 million is covered by firm 
commitments. Future construction expenditures are anticipated to be sourced 
through operating cash flows and borrowings.
    During 1996 the corporation expects to continue making investments in 
acquisitions and joint ventures. The cost of these investments is expected to 
be funded from operating cash flows and borrowings. In January 1996 the 
corporation completed the purchase of the polypropylene assets and business of 
Shell Oil Company, and in February 1996 the corporation announced its planned 
acquisition of a Brazilian vinyl acetate monomer manufacturer.

Cash Flow Used for Financing
Cash flow used for financing includes stockholder dividends and funds used to 
buy back common stock and for debt reduction, offset in part by proceeds from 
long-term debt and sales of common stock pursuant to the corporation's 
dividend reinvestment plan and its employee savings and investment programs.
    Cash flow used for financing in 1995 totaled $57 million, compared to $360 
million in 1994 and $378 million in 1993. In June 1995 the corporation 
completed a $400 million, two-part public offering of debt securities, which 
was used in part to refinance existing short-term debt. During 1995, pursuant 
to a share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors, the 
corporation repurchased 14.1 million shares of its common stock for $425 
million, at an average effective price of $30.06 per share, bringing the total 
amount repurchased since the beginning of 1993 to 29.4 million shares for $829 
million, at an average effective price of $28.18 per share.
    In 1995 the corporation extended its 1994 bank credit agreement to Nov. 3, 
2000, providing the corporation with $1 billion in credit through that date. 
Several options are available to borrow at various rates on a revolving basis. 
At Dec. 31, 1995, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit 
agreement.

Debt Ratios
Total debt outstanding at year-end for the past three years was:

Millions of dollars        1995     1994     1993
Domestic                 $1,254     $862     $895

Total                    $1,323     $946     $966

Year-end ratios of total debt to total capital were:
                           1995     1994     1993
Debt ratio                39.0%    38.2%    40.3%

    Total debt consists of short-term debt, long-term debt and the current 
portion of long-term debt. Total capital consists of total debt plus minority 
stockholders' equity in consolidated subsidiaries and UCC stockholders' 
equity.

    changes in accounting principles. Total debt consists of short-term debt,
    long-term debt and current portion of long-term debt. Total capital
    consists of total debt plus minority stockholders' equity in consolidated
    subsidiaries and UCC stockholders' equity.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations - Union Carbide Corporation is engaged in two segments of 
the chemicals and plastics industry, Specialties & Intermediates and Basic 
Chemicals & Polymers. See Note 3. 

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include 
the accounts of all significant subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 20 percent- 
to 50 percent-owned companies and partnerships are carried at equity in net 
assets. Other investments are carried generally at cost.
    The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the corporation 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

Accounting Changes - The corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard 
(FAS) 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" in 1995. The effect of the adoption of FAS 121 
was not material. Effective Jan. 1, 1994, the corporation adopted FAS 115, 
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The effect 
of the adoption of FAS 115 was not material. Effective Jan. 1, 1993, the 
corporation adopted FAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits." The cumulative effect of the change in the method of accounting for 
postemployment benefits is reported in the 1993 Consolidated Statement of 
Income. 

Foreign Currency Translation - Unrealized gains and losses resulting from 
translating foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars 
generally are accumulated in an equity account on the balance sheet until such 
time as the subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated. 
Translation gains and losses relating to operations located in Latin American 
countries, where hyperinflation exists, are included in the income statement.

Financial Instruments - Financial instruments are used to hedge financial risk 
caused by fluctuating interest and currency rates. The amounts to be paid or 
received on interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements (FRAs) 
that hedge debt accrue and are recognized over the lives of the agreements. 
Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency 
options used to hedge firm commitments are deferred and recognized as part of 
the related foreign currency transactions.
    Foreign currency forward contracts and options that are designated to 
offset earnings fluctuations from anticipated foreign currency cash flows are 
marked to market and the results recognized immediately as other income or 
other expense.

Cash Equivalents - The corporation considers as cash equivalents all highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in 
value because of changes in interest rates.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at cost or market, whichever is lower. 
These amounts do not include depreciation and amortization, the impact of 
which is not significant to the financial statements.
     Approximately 59 percent of inventory amounts before application of the 
LIFO method at Dec. 31, 1995 (65 percent at Dec. 31, 1994) have been valued on 
the LIFO basis; the "average cost" method is used for the balance. It is 
estimated that if inventories had been valued at current costs, they would 
have been approximately $276 million and $275 million higher than reported at 
Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. 

Fixed Assets - Fixed assets are carried at cost. Expenditures for replacements 
are capitalized, and the replaced items are retired. Gains and losses from the 
sale of property are included in income.
    Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. During 1995, the 
corporation reduced the depreciable lives of certain computer equipment, 
resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $12 million ($8 million 
after-tax). The corporation and its subsidiaries generally use accelerated 
depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate.

Patents, Trademarks and Goodwill - Amounts paid for purchased patents and 
newly acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the net assets of 
such businesses have been charged to patents, trademarks and goodwill. The 
portion of such amounts determined to be attributable to patents is amortized 
over their remaining lives, while trademarks and goodwill are amortized over 
the estimated period of benefit, generally 5 to 20 years.

Research and Development - Research and development costs are charged to 
expense as incurred. Depreciation expense applicable to research and 
development facilities and equipment is included in Depreciation and 
amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Income ($14 million in 1995, $13 
million in 1994 and $12 million in 1993).

Income Taxes - Provisions have been made for deferred income taxes based on 
differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities using currently enacted tax rates and regulations.

Environmental Costs - Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized 
as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures 
relating to an existing condition caused by past operations and having no 
future economic benefits are expensed. Environmental expenditures include site 
investigation, physical remediation, operation and maintenance, and legal and 
administrative costs. Environmental accruals are established for sites where 
it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can 
reasonably be estimated. Where the estimate is a range and no amount within 
the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the corporation accrues 
the minimum amount in the range and includes the balance of the range in its 
reported contingencies.

Retirement Programs - The cost of pension benefits under the U.S. Retirement 
Program is determined by an independent actuarial firm using the projected 
unit credit actuarial cost method, with an unrecognized net asset at Jan. 1, 
1986, amortized over 15 years. Contributions to this program are made in 
accordance with the regulations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974.
    The cost of postretirement benefits is recognized on the accrual basis 
over the period in which employees become eligible for benefits. 

Earnings per Common Share - Primary earnings per common share is computed by 
dividing net income - common stockholders, excluding tax benefits related to 
unallocated preferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding during the year and common stock equivalents related 
to dilutive stock options. Fully diluted earnings per common share is computed 
by dividing adjusted net income - common stockholders by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding, common stock equivalents related to 
dilutive stock options and common shares issuable upon conversion of 
debentures and convertible preferred stock.
    The number of common shares used to compute earnings per share amounts was 
as follows:
                                  1995           1994           1993
Primary                    141,663,656    154,174,788    151,371,160
Fully diluted              158,380,545    170,886,405    173,345,161

2. Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are estimated by using a method that 
indicates the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation 
sale. The fair values of the financial instruments included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet were estimated as follows: 

Cash, Short-Term Receivables and Accounts Payable - At Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, 
the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of 
these instruments. The corporation had foreign currency forward contracts of 
$32 million at Dec. 31, 1995 ($67 million at Dec. 31, 1994) to hedge 
fluctuations in the dollar value of short-term foreign currency receivables 
and payables. Deferred gains and losses on these contracts are not material.

Investments - The corporation's investments in equity companies, partnerships 
and other businesses generally involve joint ventures for which it is not 
practicable to determine fair values. 

Long-Term Receivables - The fair values of long-term and insurance recovery 
receivables are calculated using current interest rates and consideration of 
underlying collateral where appropriate. The fair values approximate the 
carrying value of $200 million included in Other assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994. 

Debt - The corporation uses various types of financial instruments, including 
interest rate swaps and FRAs, to manage exposure to financial market risk 
caused by interest rate fluctuations. See Note 10 for a discussion of debt 
instruments. 

Other Financial Instruments - In the first half of 1994, as the risk of 
cyclically higher interest rates increased, the corporation unwound its 
positions in interest rate swaps and FRAs designated to offset earnings 
fluctuations due to cyclical business conditions, resulting in a before-tax 
charge to Other expense (income) - net of $9 million.
     Outstanding foreign currency forward contracts and options used as a 
means of offsetting earnings fluctuations from anticipated foreign currency 
cash flows totaled $173 million at Dec. 31, 1995 ($182 million at Dec. 31, 
1994). During 1995 and 1994 their average fair values were nominal. These 
contracts resulted in a nominal gain in 1995 ($6 million net loss in 1994).

Carrying and Fair Values - The carrying values and fair values of the 
corporation's investments, receivables and debt financial instruments at Dec. 
31, 1995 and 1994, are summarized in the table below. Fair values are based on 
quoted market values, where available, or discounted cash flows (principally 
long-term debt). An interest rate swap held at Dec. 31, 1995 (see Note 10) had 
a nominal carrying amount and fair value. Put options on equity securities are 
discussed in Note 12.

sale of newly issued common stock of UCAR International Inc. to a new company 
formed by Blackstone Capital Partners II Merchant Banking Fund L.P. and a 
repurchase of certain shares by UCAR that resulted in Blackstone acquiring a 
75 percent interest in UCAR. The corporation received $343 million in net cash 
proceeds and retained a 25 percent equity interest in UCAR. This transaction 
resulted in a gain of $220 million ($154 million after-tax) and eliminated the 
corporation's share of ongoing future earnings from UCAR. On Aug. 9, 1995, the 
corporation joined in UCAR's initial public offering to sell its remaining 
equity interest in UCAR for net cash proceeds of $199 million. This sale 
resulted in a gain of $161 million ($99 million after-tax). If these 
transactions had occurred effective Jan. 1, 1995, the corporation's income 
from corporate investments carried at equity and net income - common 
stockholders for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995, would have been reduced by $4 
million, and earnings per share would have decreased $0.03 per share, primary 
and fully diluted. If these transactions had occurred effective Jan. 1, 1994, 
the corporation's income from corporate investments carried at equity and net 
income - common stockholders for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, would have been 
reduced by $54 million, and earnings per share would have decreased $0.35 per 
share, primary, or $0.32 per share, fully diluted.
    On March 31, 1995, the corporation acquired 50 percent of the equity of 
Polimeri Europa S.r.l., from EniChem S.p.A. EniChem retained the other 50 
percent. In anticipation of the corporation's acquisition, EniChem had 
transferred to Polimeri Europa all of its polyethylene business, excluding its 
wire and cable compounds business. The purchase price for the corporation's 50 
percent of the joint venture's equity was 323 million German Deutschemarks 
($216 million). If this acquisition had occurred effective Jan. 1, 1995, the 
corporation's income from corporate investments carried at equity and net 
income - common stockholders for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995, would have 
increased by $27 million, and earnings per share would have increased $0.19 
per share, primary, or $0.17 per share, fully diluted. If this acquisition had 
occurred effective Jan. 1, 1994, the corporation's income from corporate 
investments carried at equity, net income - common stockholders and earnings 
per share for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, would not have been affected.
    If both the Polimeri Europa equity acquisition and the UCAR 
recapitalization and sale transactions had occurred effective Jan. 1, 1995, 
the corporation's income from corporate investments carried at equity and net 
income - common stockholders for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995, would have 
increased by $23 million, or $0.16 per share, primary, or $0.14 per share, 
fully diluted. If these transactions had occurred effective Jan. 1, 1994, the 
corporation's income from corporate investments carried at equity and net 
income - common stockholders for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994, would have 
decreased by $54 million, or $0.35 per share, primary, or $0.32 per share, 
fully diluted. The weighted average number of common shares used for the pro 
forma earnings per share calculations for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995 and 
1994, is 141,663,656 and 154,174,788 primary, respectively, and 158,380,545 
and 170,886,405 fully diluted, respectively.
    On Feb. 1, 1995, the corporation purchased certain ethylene oxide 
derivative businesses from Imperial Chemical Industries of London for $71 
million.
    On July 15, 1995, the corporation and two Kuwaiti corporations, 
Petrochemical Industries Company and Boubyan Petrochemical Company, formed 
Equate Petrochemical Company, their joint venture for development of a world-
scale petrochemicals complex in Kuwait. Construction of the facility is 
targeted for a mid-1997 completion date. At Dec. 31, 1995, the corporation had 
invested $134 million in Equate. In January 1996 the corporation severally 
guaranteed $225 million of Equate debt.
    In January 1996 the corporation completed the purchase of the 
polypropylene assets and business of Shell Oil Company. The purchased assets, 
located in the U.S., comprise Shell's polypropylene technology and 
manufacturing facilities and polypropylene assets previously held jointly by 
both companies.

    Net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $62 million ($91 million in 
1994) are included in Deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net 
current deferred tax assets of $132 million ($129 million in 1994) are 
included in Other current assets. Net noncurrent deferred tax assets of $5 
million ($7 million in 1994) are included in Other assets. In 1995 and 1994 
there were $6 million in non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards included in

indefinitely amounted to approximately $393 million at Dec. 31, 1995 ($374 
million at Dec. 31, 1994). Determination of deferred taxes related to these 
earnings is not practicable.

    On June 1, 1995, the corporation completed a $400 million, two-part public 
offering of debt securities.  It consisted of $150 million principal amount of 
7.5 percent 30-year debentures due June 1, 2025, and $250 million principal 
amount of 6.79 percent 30-year debentures due June 1, 2025, with a one-time 
option for investors to redeem the bonds on June 1, 2005.
    The corporation has a credit agreement with a group of banks, providing 
the corporation with $1 billion in credit through Nov. 3, 2000. Several 
options are available to borrow at floating interest rates based on LIBOR 
(London Interbank Offered Rate) or CD (Certificate of Deposit Rate) on a 
revolving basis. At Dec. 31, 1995, there were no outstanding borrowings under 
the credit agreement.
     The credit agreement and other indentures contain covenants, normal for 
these types of instruments, that place certain limits on the ability of UCC to 
merge with another entity, incur debt or create liens on assets. In addition, 
the credit agreement requires the corporation to meet net worth, leverage and 
interest coverage tests.
     Pollution control and other facility obligations represent state, 
commonwealth and local governmental bond financing of pollution control and 
other facilities, and are treated for accounting and tax purposes as debt of 
the corporation. These tax-exempt obligations mature at various dates from 
1996 through 2023 and have an average annual effective rate of 7.3 percent.
    At Dec. 31, 1995, the corporation had one open swap position in the 
notional amount of $23 million ($48 million at Dec. 31, 1994), for which the 
corporation receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate. The corporation's 
exposure to counterparty creditworthiness is not material.
     The average and effective interest rates in 1995 on the corporation's 
fixed-rate debt, other than pollution control and other facility obligations, 
were 7.4 percent. The corporation's weighted average interest rate on short-
term borrowings outstanding as of Dec. 31, 1995, was 4.0 percent (6.2 percent 
as of Dec. 31, 1994).
    Payments due on long-term debt in the four years following 1996 are: 1997, 
$7 million; 1998, $7 million; 1999, $180 million; and 2000, $4 million.

11. Convertible Preferred Stock - ESOP
The Union Carbide Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is an 
integral part of the Savings Program for employees. Each share of ESOP stock 
is convertible into and has the same voting rights as one share of the 
corporation's common stock, and is protected from dilution. The annual 
preferred dividend is $0.794 per share.
    Substantially all full-time employees in the U.S. are eligible to 
participate in the ESOP through the corporation's matching contribution of 75 
percent (50 percent in 1994 and 1993) on eligible employee contributions. At 
the corporation's option, ESOP shares may be redeemed either in cash or the 
corporation's common stock when employees make withdrawals from their 
accounts. It has been UCC's policy to redeem ESOP shares with cash.
    The cost of the ESOP is recognized as incurred and was $4 million in 1995 
($6 million in 1994 and 1993). Reductions in ESOP costs in 1995 were due 
primarily to appreciation in the corporation's common stock. At Dec. 31, 1995, 
16.2 million preferred shares were outstanding, 5.4 million of which were 
credited to employees' accounts, including 0.6 million credited during 1995.

12. UCC Stockholders' Equity 
In 1989 the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared 
a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock. Each Right 
entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to buy a share of common 
stock at a purchase price of $37.67 (subject to adjustment).
    The Rights may not be exercised until 10 days after a person or group 
acquires 20 percent or more of UCC's common stock, or announces a tender offer 
that, if consummated, would result in 20 percent or more ownership of the 
common stock.
     Until then, separate Rights certificates will not be issued, nor will the 
Rights be traded separately from the stock.
    Should an acquirer become the beneficial owner of 20 percent of the common 
stock, and under certain additional circumstances, Union Carbide Corporation 
stockholders (other than the acquirer) would have the right to buy common 
stock in Union Carbide Corporation, or in the surviving enterprise if the 
corporation is acquired, having a value equal to two times the purchase price 
of the Right then in effect.
    The Rights will expire on Aug. 31, 1999, unless redeemed prior to that 
date. The redemption price is $0.01 per Right. The corporation's independent 
directors may redeem the Rights by a majority vote during the 10-day period 
following public announcement that a person or group has acquired 20 percent 
of UCC's common stock.
    On July 26, 1995, the board of directors of the corporation increased the 
number of shares that may be repurchased under the existing common stock 
repurchase program to 40 million shares. Through Dec. 31, 1995, the 
corporation had repurchased 29,439,478 shares since inception of the program 
in 1993 (14,127,218 during 1995) at an average effective price of $28.18 per 
share. The corporation will continue to acquire additional shares from time to 
time at prevailing market prices, at a rate consistent with the combination of 
corporate cash flow and market conditions.
    In conjunction with the corporation's common stock buyback program, put 
options were sold in a series of private placements entitling the holders to 
sell 6.4 million shares of common stock to UCC, at specified prices upon 
exercise of the options. Since inception of this program through Dec. 31, 
1995, options representing 4,563,800 common shares have expired unexercised, 
while options representing 1,136,200 shares were exercised for $35 million, or 
an average price of $30.86 per share. Options representing 700,000 shares 
remain outstanding at Dec. 31, 1995. Premiums received since inception of the 
program have reduced the average price of repurchased shares to $28.18 per 
share from $28.36.

13. Leases
Leases that meet the criteria for capitalization have been classified and 
accounted for as capital leases. For operating leases, primarily involving 
facilities and distribution equipment, the future minimum rental payments 
under leases with remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year are:

Year ending                     Millions of dollars
1996                                    $ 73
1997                                      71
1998                                      56
1999                                      53
2000                                      50
Subsequent to 2000                       291
Total minimum payments                   594
Future sublease rentals                  115
Net Minimum Rental Commitments          $479

    The present value of the net minimum rental payments amounts to $349 
million, of which $301 million pertains to the Danbury headquarters lease. 
Total lease and rental payments (net of sublease rental of $20 million in 
1995, $20 million in 1994 and $10 million in 1993) were $67 million, $65 
million and $98 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The corporation 
is contingently required to pay certain domestic lease obligations assigned to 
Praxair Inc. in the event of Praxair's default, the present value of which 
totals $23 million. If such a payment is required, the corporation has a legal 
right to set off any such amounts paid against amounts it may owe to Praxair.
    During 1995 the corporation recognized a nonrecurring, noncash charge of 
$191 million ($134 million after-tax) for future minimum lease payments on 
unused office space, primarily at the corporation's Danbury headquarters. The 
headquarters charge reflects the pro rata costs of unused office space over 
the remaining term of the lease, which runs to 2006, less anticipated net 
sublease income. Neither the expected future costs nor expected net sublease 
revenues were discounted. 

14. Retirement Programs
Pension Benefits
The noncontributory defined benefit retirement program of Union Carbide 
Corporation ("U.S. Retirement Program") covers substantially all U.S. 
employees and certain employees in other countries. Pension benefits are based 
primarily on years of service and compensation levels prior to retirement.
    Pension coverage for employees of the corporation's non-U.S. consolidated 
subsidiaries is provided through separate plans, to the extent deemed 
appropriate. Obligations under such plans are principally provided for by 
depositing funds with trustees.
    The components of net periodic pension cost for the plans combined are as 
follows:
Millions of dollars                 1995            1994            1993

    The funded status of the plans combined was as follows:

Prepaid (Accrued) Pension Cost                   $    29         $    (4) 

    Pension obligations are valued using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality 
Table. The actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

At December 31,                                     1995            1994
Discount rate for determining projected 
  benefit obligation                                6.75%           8.50%
Rate of increase in compensation levels             4.00%           5.75%
Expected long-term rate of return on 
  plan assets                                       8.25%           8.50%

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide health 
care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees and their 
eligible dependents. These benefits are provided through various insurance 
companies and health care providers. 
    The obligation is determined by application of the terms of health and 
life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health 
care cost trends projected to increase annually at rates of 12.50 percent in 
1995, 9.75 percent in 1996, 8.75 percent in 1997, falling incrementally to a 
5.25 percent annual increase in 2004 and thereafter.
    The effect of a 1 percent annual increase in the assumed health care cost 
trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation 
at Dec. 31, 1995, by $26 million and the aggregate of service and interest 
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs by $2 million. 
Measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was based on 
the same actuarial assumptions used in the pension calculations.
    The corporation has funded postretirement benefits for certain retirees 
who retired prior to Dec. 31, 1988. The funds are invested primarily in common 
stocks and fixed-income securities.
     The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost are as 
follows:
Millions of dollars                 1995            1994            1993

Accrued Unfunded Postretirement
  Benefit Obligations                               $508            $522

    The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for retirees is net of 
$134 million at Dec. 31, 1995 ($130 million at Dec. 31, 1994), which is 
reimbursed to the corporation in part by previously owned businesses under 
ongoing benefit-sharing agreements.

Deferred Compensation Plan
During 1994 the board of directors approved an unfunded, nonqualified deferred 
compensation plan for certain key employees, offering them an election to 
defer a portion of their gross pay beginning Jan. 1, 1995. The corporation's 
obligation to employees is adjusted to reflect changes in the market values of 
employees' investment choices. With limited exceptions, participants' deferred 
account balances are scheduled for payment at or after full retirement.

Postemployment Benefits
During 1995 the corporation recorded a charge of $68 million ($49 million 
after-tax) for postemployment benefits. The charge includes severance costs 
relating to future staff reductions associated with work process 
simplification efforts and changes in the corporation's severance benefits.
    The cumulative effect of adopting FAS 112 as of Jan. 1, 1993, resulted in 
a $97 million after-tax charge to 1993 earnings ($0.64 per common share). FAS 
112 requires that postemployment benefits expected to be paid before 
retirement, principally severance, be accrued over employees' working lives. 
This charge includes postemployment benefits based on normal year-to-year 
attrition rates, giving effect to the corporation's cost reduction program as 
of Jan. 1, 1993.

15. Incentive Plans
In 1994 stockholders approved the 1994 Union Carbide Long-Term Incentive Plan 
for key employees, which replaced the 1988 Union Carbide Long-Term Incentive 
Plan. The 1994 plan, effective until the 1997 shareholders' meeting, provides 
for granting incentive and nonqualified stock options; stock appreciation 
rights; exercise payment rights; grants of stock, including restricted stock, 
and performance awards. Holders of options may be granted the right to receive 
payments of amounts equal to the regular cash dividends paid to holders of the 
corporation's common stock during the period an option is outstanding. The 
number of shares granted or subject to options cannot exceed 7.5 million under 
the plan. Option prices are equal to the closing price of the corporation's 
common stock on the date of the grant, as listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange Composite Transactions. Options generally become exercisable two 
years after such date. Options may not have a duration of more than 10 years. 
Restricted stock award shares are entitled to vote and dividends are credited 
to the holder's account, but these shares are generally nontransferable for 
three years after the grant date. These restricted stock awards and 
accumulated dividends are generally subject to forfeiture if matching 
employee-owned stock on deposit with the corporation is withdrawn or if other 
conditions are not met. Performance awards may be paid in common stock, cash 
or any other form of property. No stock appreciation rights or performance 
awards were granted in 1995.
    No further awards can be made under either the 1988 or 1984 plan programs. 
Options granted under both plans are still outstanding and have terms similar 
to nonqualified stock options under the 1994 plan.
    Changes during 1995 in outstanding shares under option were as follows:

16. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Agreements - The corporation has three major agreements for the 
purchase of ethylene-related products and two other purchase agreements in the 
U.S. and Canada. The net present value of the fixed and determinable portion 
of obligations under these purchase commitments at Dec. 31, 1995 (at current 
exchange rates, where applicable), are presented in the following table.

Millions of dollars
1996                             $ 72
1997                               65
1998                               56
1999                               49
2000                               25
2001 to expiration of contracts   107
Total                            $374

Environmental - The corporation is subject to loss contingencies resulting 
from environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to remove 
or mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of 
certain wastes and substances at various sites. The corporation has 
established accruals in current dollars for those hazardous waste sites where 
it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated. The reliability and precision of the loss estimates are 
affected by numerous factors, such as different stages of site evaluation, the 
allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the 
assertion of additional claims. The corporation adjusts its accruals as new 
remediation requirements are defined, as information becomes available 
permitting reasonable estimates to be made, and to reflect new and changing 
facts.
    At Dec. 31, 1995, the corporation had established environmental 
remediation accruals in the amount of $327 million ($297 million in 1994), of 
which $262 million is classified as Other long-term obligations ($235 million 
in 1994). These accruals have two components, estimated future expenditures 
for site investigation and cleanup and estimated expenditures for closure and 
postclosure activities. In addition, the corporation had environmental loss 
contingencies of $163 million at Dec. 31, 1995.
    The corporation has sole responsibility for the remediation of 
approximately half of its environmental sites for which accruals have been 
established. These sites are well advanced in the investigation and cleanup 
stage. The corporation's environmental accruals at Dec. 31, 1995, included 
$245 million for these sites ($233 million at Dec. 31, 1994), of which $109 
million ($97 million at Dec. 31, 1994) was for estimated future expenditures 
for site investigation and cleanup and $136 million ($136 million at Dec. 31, 
1994) was for estimated future expenditures for closure and postclosure 
activities. In addition, $82 million of the corporation's environmental loss 
contingencies at Dec. 31, 1995, related to these sites. The site with the 
largest total potential cost to the corporation is a nonoperating site. Of the 
above accruals, this site accounted for $47 million ($49 million at Dec. 31, 
1994), of which $26 million ($26 million at Dec. 31, 1994) was for estimated 
future expenditures for site investigation and cleanup and $21 million ($23 
million at Dec. 31, 1994) was for estimated future expenditures for closure 
and postclosure activities. In addition, $15 million of the above 
environmental loss contingencies related to this site.
    The corporation does not have sole responsibility at the remainder of its 
environmental sites for which accruals have been established. All of these 
sites are in the investigation and cleanup stage. The corporation's 
environmental accruals at Dec. 31, 1995, included $82 million for estimated 
future expenditures for site investigation and cleanup at these sites ($63 
million at Dec. 31, 1994). In addition, $81 million of the corporation's 
environmental loss contingencies related to these sites. The largest of these 
sites is also a nonoperating site. Of the above accruals, this site accounted 
for $16 million ($21 million at Dec. 31, 1994) for estimated future 
expenditures for site investigation and cleanup. In addition, $6 million of 
the above environmental loss contingencies related to this site.
    Worldwide expenses of continuing operations related to environmental 
protection for compliance with Federal, state and local laws regulating solid 
and hazardous wastes and discharge of materials to air and water, as well as 
for waste site remedial activities, totaled $138 million in 1995, $153 million 
in 1994 and $149 million in 1993. 

Other - The corporation sold certain receivables with recourse to various 
banks for proceeds of $63 million in 1995 ($101 million in 1994). At Dec. 31, 
1995, approximately $7 million remained due ($11 million in 1994). The fair 
value of the recourse provisions at Dec. 31, 1995, approximates the carrying 
value.
    The corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries had additional 
contingent obligations at Dec. 31, 1995, totaling $58 million, of which $34 
million related to guarantees of debt.

Litigation - The corporation is one of a number of defendants named in 
approximately 4,600 lawsuits, some of which have more than one plaintiff, 
involving silicone breast implants. The corporation was not a manufacturer of 
breast implants but did supply generic bulk silicone materials to certain 
manufacturers. Also, the corporation in 1990 acquired and in 1992 divested the 
stock of a small specialty silicones company that, among other things, 
supplied silicone gel intermediates and silicone dispersions for breast 
implants. In 1993 most of the suits that were brought in Federal courts were 
consolidated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court, 
Northern District of Alabama. In 1994 the corporation provisionally joined a 
multibillion-dollar settlement of the claims consolidated in that court.
    Subsequently, the District Court determined that the total amount of 
current claims likely to be approved for payment under the original settlement 
schedule would substantially exceed the funds available. Consequently, the 
defendants and the Plaintiffs' Negotiating Committee, at the request of the 
court, initiated negotiations to reconsider the structure and funding of the 
settlement. Recently certain defendants, including the corporation, proposed, 
and the court approved, a revised settlement program. While the corporation 
cannot predict the number of claimants who will participate in the settlement, 
based on sample data prepared under supervision of the court, the corporation 
estimates that its maximum expenditures under the revised agreement should not 
exceed $100 million prior to insurance recovery. Although insurance coverage 
is subject to issues as to scope and application of policies, retention 
limits, exclusions and policy limits, and the insurers have reserved their 
right to deny coverage, the corporation believes that after probable insurance 
recoveries neither the settlement nor litigation outside the settlement will 
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the 
corporation.
    In addition, the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are 
involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims with both private and 
governmental parties. These cover a wide range of matters, including, but not 
limited to: product liability; governmental regulatory proceedings; health, 
safety and environmental matters; employment; patents; contracts, and taxes. 
In some of these legal proceedings and claims, the cost of remedies that may 
be sought or damages claimed is substantial.
    The corporation has recorded nonenvironmental litigation accruals of $244 
million, and related insurance recovery receivables of $145 million, resulting 
in net before-tax charges of $99 million for nonenvironmental litigation. At 
December 31, 1995, the corporation had nonenvironmental litigation loss 
contingencies of $38 million.
    Criminal proceedings continue in India, arising out of the 1984 gas 
release from the Bhopal plant of Union Carbide India Limited. The corporation 
has not appeared in those proceedings. In the opinion of counsel for the 
corporation, under generally recognized legal principles, the criminal 
proceedings should not have adverse financial consequences for the corporation 
outside of India. The carrying value of the remaining proceeds from sale of 
the corporation's stock in Union Carbide India Limited, which remain subject 
to the attachment order of the Bhopal criminal court, is zero.
    While it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the 
ultimate outcome of any legal proceedings and claims referred to in this note, 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable 
losses with respect thereto and that such ultimate outcome, after provisions 
therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated 
financial position of the corporation, but could have a material effect on 
consolidated results of operations in a given quarter or year. Should any 
losses be sustained in connection with any of such legal proceedings and 
claims in excess of provisions therefor, they will be charged to income in the 
future.

Management's Statement of Responsibility
for Financial Statements

Union Carbide Corporation's financial statements are prepared by management, 
which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The 
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts 
that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in this 
annual report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements.
    The corporation maintains accounting systems, including internal 
accounting controls monitored by a staff of internal auditors, that are 
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial 
records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is 
based on recognition that the cost of a system must not exceed the related 
benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the 
careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of 
authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business 
ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for 
coordinating the management of corporate resources and the leadership and 
commitment of top management.
    The corporation's financial statements are audited by KPMG Peat Marwick 
LLP, independent certified public accountants, in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards. These standards provide for the auditors to 
consider the corporation's internal control structure to the extent they deem 
necessary in order to issue their opinion on the financial statements. 
    The Audit Committee of the board of directors, which consists solely of 
nonemployee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the 
accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial 
statements. The Audit Committee recommends to the board of directors the 
selection of the independent auditors, subject to the approval of 
stockholders. The Audit Committee periodically meets with the independent 
auditors, management and internal auditors to review and evaluate their 
accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities. 
The independent and internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit 
Committee and meet with the committee, with and without management present.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
Union Carbide Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Union Carbide 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended Dec. 31, 1995. These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union 
Carbide Corporation and subsidiaries at Dec. 31, 1995 and 1994, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the 
three-year period ended Dec. 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
    As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 
the company changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits.

A Chemical Glossary
Monomer - a reactive chemical that can be converted into a polymer. For 
example, ethylene is a monomer that is made into polyethylene.

Polymer - a chain or network made up of many monomer units, such as ethylene. 
All plastics are polymers.

Ethylene - a reactive chemical made from natural gas or crude oil components. 
In Carbide's olefins units, ethylene is the starting material from which many 
of the company's chemical products are made.

Propylene - a basic chemical made from crude oil and natural gas components. 
It is used as a starting material to produce many of Carbide's chemical 
products.

Olefins - the generic name for ethylene, propylene and other unsaturated 
hydrocarbons made from components of crude oil or natural gas. Olefins are the 
starting materials from which most of Union Carbide's chemical products are 
made.

Ethylene Oxide - a chemical made from ethylene and oxygen. It combines with 
other chemicals to produce a wide range of products, such as ethylene glycol, 
and surfactants for detergents and cleaning products.

Ethylene Glycol - a chemical made from ethylene oxide and water. It is used to 
make polyester fiber, resin and film, and automotive antifreeze and engine 
coolants.

Polyethylene - the world's most widely used plastic, made by reacting ethylene 
and other olefins to form polymers. Union Carbide uses its low-pressure Unipol 
Process technology to make most of its polyethylene.

Polypropylene - one of the world's fastest-growing, large-volume plastics, 
made by reacting propylene with itself or with other olefins to form polymers. 
Union Carbide uses its low-pressure Unipol Process and other processes to make 
polypropylene.

Solvent - a liquid chemical used to dissolve other chemicals. For example, 
butyl alcohol and related solvents are manufactured, starting from propylene, 
using Union Carbide's low-pressure Oxo process.
