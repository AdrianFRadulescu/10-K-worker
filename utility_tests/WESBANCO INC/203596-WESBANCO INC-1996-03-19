PART I

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

General
- -------
     
     As of December 31, 1995, the Corporation had five banking affiliates 
located in Wheeling, Charleston, Parkersburg, Kingwood, and Fairmont, West 
Virginia.  The Registrant had one banking affiliate in Barnesville, Ohio.  
WesBanco Wheeling has twelve offices, all in West Virginia, five located in 
Wheeling, two located in Follansbee, three in New Martinsville, one in
Sistersville, and one in Wellsburg.  WesBanco Kingwood has two full-service 
branch offices located in Masontown and Bruceton Mills.  WesBanco Barnesville 
has five offices, two located in Barnesville and one each in Bethesda, 
Woodsfield and Beallsville, Ohio.  WesBanco Fairmont has four offices located 
in Fairmont, two offices located in Morgantown, three offices located in
Bridgeport, two in Shinnston and one in Nutter Fort, West Virginia.  There are 
approximately 755 full time equivalent employees employed by all affiliates 
as of December 31, 1995.

     WesBanco, Inc., through its subsidiaries, conducts a general banking, 
commercial and trust business.  Its full service banks offer a wide range of 
services to commercial, consumer and government bodies, including but not 
limited to, retail banking services, such as demand, savings and time deposits; 
commercial, mortgage, and consumer installment loans; credit card services
through VISA and MasterCard; personal and corporate trust services; discount 
brokerage services; and travel services.  Most affiliates are participating 
in local partnerships which operate banking machines in those local regions 
primarily under the name of MAC.  The banking machines are linked to CIRRUS, 
a nationwide banking network.

     The Corporation has reported to its shareholders that it may engage in 
other activities of a finanical nature authorized by the Federal Reserve Board 
through a subsidiary, or through acquisition of established companies.

     As of December 31, 1995, none of the affiliates were engaged in any 
operation in foreign countries and none has had transactions with customers 
in foreign countries.

Competition
- -----------
     
     Each affiliate bank faces strong competition for local business in their 
respective market areas.  Competition exists for new deposits, in the scope 
and types of services offered, and the interest rates paid on time deposits 
and charged on loans, and in other aspects of banking.  The affiliate banks 
encounter substantial competition not only from other commercial banks but
also from other financial institutions.  Savings banks, savings and loan 
associations, brokerage business and credit unions actively compete for 
deposits.  Such institutions, as well as consumer finance companies, 
insurance companies and other enterprises, are important competitors for 
various types of lending business.  In addition, personal and corporate trust
services and investment counseling services are offered by insurance companies, 
investment counseling firms and other business firms and individuals.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
Supervision and Regulation
- --------------------------
     
     As a registered bank holding company, WesBanco is subject to the 
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file with the 
Federal Reserve Board reports and other information regarding its business 
operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries.  WesBanco is also 
subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to obtain 
Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly,
ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, 
it would own or control more than 5% of the voting stock of such bank.  In 
addition, pursuant to federal law and regulations promulgated by the Federal 
Reserve Board, WesBanco may only engage in, or own or control companies that 
engage in, activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely
related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.  Prior to engaging in 
most new business activities, WesBanco must obtain approval from the Federal 
Reserve Board.

     WesBanco's banking subsidiaries have deposits insured by the Bank 
Insurance Fund ("BIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the 
"FDIC"), and are subject to supervision, examination, and regulation by state 
banking authorities and either the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board.  In 
addition to the impact of federal and state supervision and regulation, the
banking subsidiaries of WesBanco are affected significantly by the actions of 
the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and 
credit availability in order to influence the economy.

     WesBanco's depository institution subsidiaries are subject to affiliate 
transaction restrictions under federal law which limit the transfer of funds 
by the subsidiary banks to their parent and any nonbanking subsidiaries, 
whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset 
purchases.  Such transfers by any subsidiary bank to its parent corporation
or to any nonbanking subsidiary are limited in amount to 10% of the 
institution's capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent and all 
such nonbanking subsidiaries, to an aggregate 20% of any such institution's 
capital and surplus.  Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are 
required to be secured in specified amounts.

     The Federal Reserve Board has a policy to the effect that a bank holding 
company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to 
each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such 
subsidiary bank.  Under the source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve 
Board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a
troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging 
in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a 
subsidiary bank.  This capital injection may be required at times when WesBanco 
may not have the resources to provide it.  Any capital loans by a holding 
company to any of the subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to 
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank.  Moreover, 
in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by such 
holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital 
of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to 
a priority of payment.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
     
     In 1989, the United States Congress passed comprehensive financial 
institutions legislation known as the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, 
and Enforcement Act ("FIRREA").  FIRREA established a new principal of 
liability on the part of depository institutions insured by the FDIC for any 
losses incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC after 
August 9, 1989, in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled 
FDIC-insured depository institution, or (ii) any assistance provided by the 
FDIC to a commonly controled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of 
default.  "Default" is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator 
or receiver and "in danger of default" is defined generally as the existence 
of certain conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to occur in the 
absence of regulatory assistance.  Accordingly, in the event that any insured 
bank subsidiary of WesBanco causes a loss to the FDIC, other bank subsidiaries 
of WesBanco could be required to compensate the FDIC by reimbursing to it the 
amount of such loss.

     Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of 
shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired, 
by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national bank's 
capital stock.  This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such 
pro rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such 
impairment of capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital 
stock of any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment.  Similarly,
the laws of certain states provide for such assessment and sale with respect 
to the subsidiary banks chartered by such states.  WesBanco, as the sole 
shareholder of its subsidiary banks, is subject to such provisions.

Dividend Restrictions
- ---------------------
     
     There are statutory limits on the amount of dividends WesBanco's 
depository institution subsidiaires can pay to their parent corporation 
without regulatory approval.  Under applicable federal regulations, 
appropriate bank regulatory agency approval is required if the total of all 
dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the available 
retained earnings and exceeds the aggregate of the bank's net profits (as 
defined by regulatory agencies) for that year and its retained net profits
for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund 
for the retirement of any preferred stock.

FDIC Insurance
- --------------
     
     The FDIC has the authority to raise the insurance premiums for 
institutions in the BIF to a level necessary to achieve a target reserve 
level of 1.25% of insured deposits within not more than 15 years.  In 
addition, the FDIC has the authority to impose special assessments in certain 
circumstances.  The level of deposit premiums affects the profitability of 
subsidiary banks and thus the potential flow of dividends to parent companies.

     Under the risk-based insurance assessment system that became effective 
January 1, 1994, the FDIC places each insured depository institution in one of 
nine risk categories based on its level of capital and other relevant 
information (such as supervisory evaluations).  The assessment rates under 
the new system range from 0% to 0.27% depending upon the assessment category 
into which the insured institution is placed.  As of January 1, 1996, all 
WesBanco banks will pay the statutory annual minimum of $2,000.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
- -------------------------------------------------------------
     
     In December 1991, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), which substantially revised 
the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act and makes revisions to several other federal banking statutes.

     Among other things, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory authorities 
to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to depository institutions 
that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  For these purposes, FDICIA 
establishes five capital tiers:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically 
undercapitalized.

     Rules adopted by the Federal banking agencies under FDICIA provide that 
an institution is deemed to be:  "well capitalized" if the institution has a 
Total (Tier 1 plus Tier II) risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a 
Tier I risk-based ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or 
greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement,
capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain 
a specific level for any capital measure; "adequately capitalized" if the 
institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier I 
risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or
greater (or a leverage ratio of 3.0% or greater if the institution is rated 
composite 1 in its most recent report of examination, subject to appropriate 
Federal banking agency guidelines), and the institution does not meet the 
definition of a well-capitalized institution; "undercapitalized" if the
institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a 
Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio 
that is less than 4.0% (or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% if the 
institution is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of examination, 
subject to appropriate Federal banking agency guidelines) and the institution 
does not meet the definition of a significantly undercapitalized or critically 
undercapitalized institution; "significantly undercapitalized" if the 
institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a 
Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio
that is less than 3.0% and the institution does not meet the definition of a 
critically undercapitalized institution; and "critically undercapitalized" if 
the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal 
to or less than 2%.

     At December 31, 1995, WesBanco and all of its bank subsidiaries qualified 
as well-capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted above.  A bank's 
capital category, however, is determined solely for the purpose of applying 
the prompt corrective actions rules and may not constitute an accurate
representation of that bank's overall financial condition or prospects.

     The appropriate Federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, 
reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately 
capitalized.  The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately 
capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory
provisions as if the institutions were in the next lower category


                                     6

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------

(but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically 
undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital 
levels of the institution.

     The statute provides that an institution may be reclassified if the 
appropriate Federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity 
for bearing) that the institution is in an unsafe and unsound condition or 
deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.

     FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any 
capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any 
management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would 
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions 
are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital 
restoration plan.  The Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital
restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is 
based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the 
depository institution's capital.  In addition, for a capital restoration 
plan to be acceptable, the depository institution's parent holding company 
must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration
plan.  The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the 
lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the depository institution's total 
assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount which is 
necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into
compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such 
institution as of the time it fails to compy with the plan. If a depository 
institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is 
significantly undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to 
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient 
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total 
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.  
Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a 
receiver or conservator.

     FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the 
operation of WesBanco, including new reporting requirements, regulatory 
standards for real estate lending, "truth in savings" provisions, and the 
requirement that a depository institution give 90 days' prior notice to 
customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch.  

Capital Requirements
- --------------------
     
     The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks 
adopted by the Federal banking agencies were phased in at the end of 1992.  
The minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets 
(including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) 
under the fully phased-in guidelines is 8%.  At least half of the total 
capital is to be comprised of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative 
perpetual preferred stocks, minority interests and, for bank holding companies, 
a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less 
goodwill and certain other intangibles ("Tier I capital").  The 

                                  7

<PAGE>    8


remainder ("Tier II capital") may consist of other preferred stock, certain 
other instruments, and limited amounts of subordinated debt and the reserve 
for credit losses.



Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
     
     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage 
ratio (Tier I capital to total average assets less goodwill and certain other 
intangibles) guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.  These guidelines 
provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for bank holding companies and
banks that meet certain specified criteria, including that they have the 
highest regulatory rating.  All other banking organizations are required to 
maintain a leverage ratio of 3.0% plus an additional cushion of at least 100 
to 200 basis points.  The guidelines also provide that banking organizations
experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to 
maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory 
levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the 
guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider 
a "tangible Tier I leverage ratio" in evaluating proposals for expansion or 
new activities.  The tangible Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier I 
capital, less intangibles not deducted from Tier I capital, to total assets, 
less all intangibles.  Neither WesBanco nor any of its bank subsidiaries has 
been advised of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to it.

     As of December 31, 1995, all of WesBanco's banking subsidiaries had 
capital in excess of all applicable requirements.

Interstate Banking Act
- ----------------------
      
      The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 
(hereinafter called "Interstate Banking Act") was signed into law by 
President Clinton on September 29, 1994.  The Act generally allows adequately 
capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state 
starting one year after enactment.  The Act also permits interstate merger
transactions beginning June 1, 1997.  States are permitted, however, to pass 
legislation providing for either earlier approval of mergers with out-of-state 
banks or "opting-out" of interestate mergers entirely.  The Act would permit 
banks to acquire branches of out-of-state banks by converting their office
into branches of the resulting bank.  The Act would also permit banks to 
establish and operate "de novo branches" in any state that "opts-in" to de 
novo branching.  The Act also requires each Federal banking agency to 
prescribe uniform regulations, including guidelines insuring that interstate 
branches operated by out-of-state banks are reasonably helping to meet the 
credit needs of communities where they operate.  WesBanco is incorporated 
under the laws of the State of West Virginia and the West Virginia Legislature 
has not yet adopted any legislation which would specifically "opt-in" or 
"opt-out" of any of these specific provisions of the Interstate Banking Act.

Statistical Information
- -----------------------
     
     Except as noted, the following statistical data averages included in 
Item I - Business were computed using daily averages for the years ended 
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Statistical data not included in Item I - 
Business have been omitted because they are included in the 1995 Annual Report 
to Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference, or are not applicable.

     The effect on interest income and interest expense for the years ended 
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, due to changes in average volume and rate 
from the prior year, is presented below. The average volumes and rates are 
shown in the 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders.  The effect of a change in 
average volume has been determined by applying the average rate in the earlier 
year to the change in volume.  The change in rate has been determined by 
applying the average volume in the earlier year to the change in rate.  The 
change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to volume 
and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar 
amounts of change in each. (in thousands):

     WesBanco Bank Wheeling, which has approximately 41% of consolidated gross 
loans have a practice of originating most commercial loans and real estate 
construction loans on a demand basis.  Most of these loans do not require 
formal repayment terms other than monthly interest payments.  There is no 
significant impact on cash flows since these loans are monitored on a regular 
basis and principal repayments, if not made by borrowers, are requested.  
WesBanco banks follow lending policies which require substantial down payments 
along with current market appraisals on the collateral when the loans are 
originated.  The majority of their loans are either secured by deeds of trust 
on real property, security agreements on personal property, insurance contracts 
from independent insurance companies or through marketable securities.

     All affiliate banks generally recognize interest income on the accrual 
basis, except for certain loans which are placed on a nonaccrual status, when 
in the opinion of management, doubt exists as to collectability.  All banks 
must conform to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 
Office of the Comptroller of Currency Policy which states that banks may not
accrue interest on any loan on which either the principal or interest is past 
due 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of 
collection.  When a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status, interest income may 
be recognized as cash payments are received.

     On January 1, 1995, WesBanco adopted FAS No. 114 (as amended by FAS No. 
118), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."  A loan is 
considered impaired when it is probable that the lender will be unable to 
collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual 
terms of the loan agreement.  At December 31, 1995, impaired loans totaled
$7,291,000, which included all nonperforming loans.

     Nonaccrual loans decreased by $2,880,000 to $5,199,000 as of December 31, 
1995, compared to the same period in 1994, primarily due to the reclassification
of a commercial real estate loan to other real estate owned.  The action was 
taken on November 1, 1995 by an affiliate through a transfer by deed 
in-lieu of foreclosed commercial property.  Contributing to the increase
in renegotiated loans during 1995 were certain performing loans classified as

impaired, in accordance with FAS No. 114.  The 1994 decline in nonaccrual 
loans was the result of a commercial real estate loan which was taken off of 
nonaccrual status.  During 1993, nonaccrual loans increased by $3,494,000 to 
$11,066,000, while renegotiated loans declined by $3,878,000 to $168,000.  
The change between these categories was caused by a reclassification of a 
renegotiated loan totaling $3,823,000 to nonaccrual status during 1993.  
Nonaccrual and renegotiated loans declined $3,830,000 during 1992, primarily 
due to a borrower's improved business operation and increased debt service 
ability, justifying a renewed extension of credit at market terms and 
condition.  Nonaccrual loans are generally secured by collateral believed to 
have adequate market values to protect the Corporation from significant losses.

     In accordance with FAS No. 114, a loan is classified as an in-substance 
foreclosure when the Corporation has taken possession of the collateral.  Loans 
previously classified as in-substance foreclosure but for which the Corporation 
has not takenpossession of the collateral have been reclassified to loans.  The 
reclassifications have not significantly impacted the Corporation's financial 
condition.  Management continues to monitor non-performing assets to ensure 
against deterioration in collateral values.

     WesBanco has allocated the reserve for possible loan losses to specific 
portfolio segments based upon historical net charge-off experience, changes 
in the level of non-performing loans, local economic conditions and management 
experience.

     Management deems the reserve for loan losses at December 31, 1995 to be 
adequate.

Risk Elements
- -------------
     
     The Corporation has historically maintained a reserve for possible loan 
losses which is greater than actual charge-offs. Charge-offs for the year 1996 
are anticipated to be within the historical ranges as detailed in the summary 
of loan loss experience.

     Management maintains loan quality through monthly reviews of past due 
loans, and a quarterly review of significant loans which are considered by 
affiliate bank personnel to be potential problem loans.  Periodic review of 
other significant loans are completed by personnel independent of the loan 
function.

     There are no significant loans made to customers outside the general 
market area of each affiliate bank.  At times, in order to maintain loan 
volumes, loans are purchased from correspondent banks.  These loans aggregate 
less than $9,000,000 as of December 31, 1995.  Each bank within the 
Corporation follows its usual loan analysis procedures before a determination
is made to purchase loans from correspondent banks.

     Management's review of the loan portfolio has not indicated any material 
amount of loans, not disclosed in the accompanying tables and discussions 
which are known to have possible credit problems which cause management to 
have serious doubts as to the ability of each borrower to comply with their 
present loan repayment terms.  

     There were no loan concentrations in excess of 10% of total consolidated
loans.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------
     
     WesBanco, Inc. and its affiliates are involved in various legal proceedings
presently pending which are incidental to the business of banking in which they 
are engaged.  These proceedings are pending in various jurisdictions in which 
WesBanco, Inc. and its subsidiaries are engaged in business.  Based on the
information which has been developed in such proceedings as of the date hereof,
and available to the Corporation, management does not believe that any of 
such proceedings involve claims for damages expose it to a material liability
on a consolidated basis.

     In addition to the foregoing, the Corporation has recently been advised
of a newly filed matter.  On February 23, 1996, WesBanco Bank Wheeling, a 
subsidiary banking corporation, was served with a Complaint filed in the 
Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia, styled Joseph Tankovits III v. 
Lee J. Glessner, et al., under Civil Action No. 96-C-59(W).  This suit was 
filed by a beneficiary of a testamentary trust and an inter vivos trust 
against the Bank in its capacity as Co-Trustee of two trusts.  The Complaint 
alleges numerous counts against the bank and two Co-Executors of an estate, 
including breach of fiduciary duty of care, self-dealing and breach of 
fiduciary duty of loyalty, negligence and a punitive damage claim based on an
undefined theory of an intentional tort.  The Complaint also asserts 
additional counts against the two Co-Executors, including intentional 
interference with a testamentary bequest, conversion and fraud in which the 
Bank is not a named defendant.  The prayer of the Complaint seeks 
compensatory and punitive damages against the defendants in the amount of 
$10,000,000, among other relief sought.

     The case arises from the administration of an estate and the funding of 
certain trusts, an inter vivos trust and a testamentary trust, which were to 
be funded from the distribution of the assets of the estate upon the 
termination of the administration of the estate.  Since the estate consists
primarily of closely held stock, the Co-Executors of the estate elected a 
deferred and installment payment of the Federal Estate Tax liabilities which 
are being paid over a combined 15 year period.  This 15 year period continues 
to run.  While the estate is in administration, no assets have been 
distributed by the Co-Executors to the Bank and, accordingly, the Bank has 
undertaken no fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the testamentary
trust or the inter vivos trust, other than to receive certain life insurance 
proceeds which were paid to it at the time of the death of the decedent.  No 
claim has been asserted against the Bank with respect to its administration of 
the life insurance proceeds received and subsequently administered by the Bank.

     It is uncertain as to how the Plaintiff can successfully argue that the 
Bank has a fidicuary duty with respect to assets which have not yet been 
distributed to it.  It is also uncertain at this time as to how the Plaintiff 
can assert a breach of a fiduciary duty in the administration of the estate 
since the bank was neither a named fiduciary, nor has the bank subsequently
qualified as a fiduciary with respect to the administration of the estate.  
Based on the allegations of the Complaint, the Bank is unable to determine the 
source of the Bank's legal duty to the Plaintiff which is alleged in the 
Complaint.  The Bank intends to vigorously defend the action.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

January 25, 1996, except as to Note 19, which is as of February 9, 1996


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of WesBanco, Inc.

     In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated 
statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WesBanco, 
Inc., and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 3 
years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Corporation's management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We did 
not audit the financial statements of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc., for 1993, 
which statements reflect net interest income of $13,913,000 for the year 
ended December 31, 1993.  Those statements were audited by other auditors 
whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed 
herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for First Fidelity 
Bancorp, Inc., for 1993, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.  
We conducted our audits of the consolidated statements in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards, which require that we plan and perform 
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation.  We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors 
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

     As discussed in Note 1 and Note 5, the Corporation adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114 (as amended by SFAS No. 118), 
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS No. 115, 
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," during 
1995 and 1994, respectively.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors and Shareholders
First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc.


We have audited the consolidated statement of condition of First Fidelity 
Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and the related 
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and 
cash flows for the year then ended.  These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluting the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of First Fidelity 
Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and the consolidated 
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended 
December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          NOTE 1:  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     WesBanco, Inc. and its subsidiary banks provide banking and trust services
primarily in the West Virginia and Eastern Ohio markets.  The significant 
accounting principles employed in the preparation of the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements are summarized below:
Principles of consolidation:
- ----------------------------     
     The Consolidated Financial Statements of WesBanco, Inc. (the "Corporation")
include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  
Material intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
Use of estimates:
- -----------------     
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Investment securities:
- ----------------------  
  Investments Held to Maturity:
     Investment securities consisting principally of debt securities, which 
are generally held to maturity, are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization 
of premiums and accretion of discounts.  These securities are purchased with 
the intent and ability to hold until their maturity.
  Investments Available for Sale:
     U. S. Treasury and Agency debt securities with a maturity date extending
beyond three years of the purchase date, mortgage backed securities, corporate
securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions held by the parent 
company and marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale.  
These securities may be sold at any time based upon management's assessment of
changes in economic or financial market conditions, interest rate or prepayment
risks, liquidity considerations, and other factors.  These securities are 
stated at market value, with the market value adjustment, net of tax, reported 
as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  No permanent writedowns on 
these securities have been required.
  Investments Available for Trading:
     The Corporation did not have a trading portfolio during either of the two 
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.
  Gains and Losses:
     Net realized gains and losses on sale of investment securities are 
included in the statement of income.  The cost of these securities sold is 
based on the specific identification method.
Amortization and Accretion:
     Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are included in 
interest on investment securities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Loans:
- ------     
     Interest is accrued as earned on loans except where doubt exists as to
collectability, in which case recognition of income is discontinued.  Net loan 
fees and deferrable costs are not material.
     The Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 114 (as
amended by FAS No. 118), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," 
on January 1, 1995.  Under the new standard, a loan is considered impaired, 
based on current information and events, if it is probable that the 
Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and 
interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
Reserve for possible loan losses:
- ---------------------------------     
     The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a level considered 
adequate by mnagement to provide for potential loan losses.  The reserve is 
increased by provisions charged to operating expenses and reduced by loan 
losses net of recoveries. The amount of reserve is based on management's 
evaluation of the loan portfolio, as well as prevailing and anticipated 
economic conditions, past loan loss experience, current delinquency factors, 
changes in the character of the loan portfolio, specific problem loans and 
other relevant factors.
     The reserve for possible loan losses related to loans that are identified 
for evaluation, in accordance with FAS No. 114, is based on discounted cash 
flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of 
the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans.  If the valuation is 
less than the recorded value of the loan, an impairment reserve must be 
established for the difference.
Bank premises and equipment:
- ----------------------------     
     Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation.  Bank premises and equipment are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives using either the straight-line or an accelerated method.
Useful lives are revised when a change in life expectancy becomes apparent.
     Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense and betterments are 
capitalized. Gains and losses on bank premises and equipment retired or 
otherwise disposed of are charged to expense when incurred.

<PAGE>  6 


                     NOTE 1:  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Income taxes:
- -------------     
     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future 
tax consequences attributable  to temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In addition, such 
deferred tax asset and liability amounts are adjusted for the effects of 
enacted changes in tax laws or rates.
Earnings per share:
     Earnings per share are calculated based upon dividing net income, less
preferred stock dividends and accretion, by the weighted average number of 
shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Trust assets and income:
- ------------------------     
     Assets held by the subsidiary banks in fiduciary or agency capacities for 
their customers are not included as assets in the accompanying Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.  Trust fees are reported on the cash basis of accounting in 
accordance with customary banking practice.  Reporting of trust income on an 
accrual basis would not materially affect net income.  Certain trust assets 
are held on deposit at subsidiary banks.
Statement of cash flows:
- ------------------------     
     For the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash and due from banks, and federal funds sold. Generally, federal 
funds are sold for one day periods.
Reclassification:
- -----------------     
     Certain prior year amounts in loans and other assets have been reclassified
under FAS No. 114 for comparative purposes.      
New accounting standards to be adopted:
- ---------------------------------------     
     FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," requires an entity to review an asset 
for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is to be recognized when the sum of 
expected future cash flows from the asset, on an undiscounted basis, is less 
than the asset's carrying amount.  The amount of the loss is measured based 
on the fair value of the asset which contemplates the time value of money.  
Subsequent restoration of previously recognized impairment losses is 
prohibited.  FAS No. 121 is effective for calendar year 1996 financial 
statements. Management does not anticipate that the adoption of this 
statement will have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated 
financial statements.



                      NOTE 2:  ACQUISITIONS  AND MERGERS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     On February 28, 1994, WesBanco, Inc. acquired First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. 
which had total assets as of the acquisition date of approximately 
$309,911,000.  In accordance with terms of the merger, WesBanco issued 
2,093,815 shares of common stock and 10,000 shares of redeemable preferred 
stock.  WesBanco retired and used as part of the transaction 40,000 shares of 
treasury stock.  The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests 
and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts 
of First Fidelity Bancorp for all periods presented.  First Fidelity's 
dividend reinvestment plan was replaced by the WesBanco plan following the 
merger.



                        NOTE 3:  RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain 
cash reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amounts of required 
reserve balances were approximately $6,955,000 and $6,519,000 during 1995 and 
1994, respectively.

                          NOTE 4:  LOANS (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Most lending is with customers who are located within the state of West 
Virginia and Eastern Ohio.  There is no significant concentration of credit 
risk by industry or by individual borrowers, no significant exposure to highly 
leveraged loan transactions, nor any foreign loans.  At December 31, 1995, 
loans that are considered to be impaired under FAS No. 114 were $7,291,000 
(of which $5,199,000 were on a nonaccrual basis).  Included in this amount was 
$1,999,000 of impaired loans for which the related reserve for possible loan 
losses was $334,000 and $5,292,000 of impaired loans that, as a result of 
collateral values, did not require a reserve for loan losses.  The average
balance of impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 1995 was
approximately $6,773,000.  For the purpose of this standard, impaired loans 
include all nonperforming loans.  For the period ended December 31, 1995, the 
interest income recognized on impaired loans did not have a material effect 
on the results of operations. Loans aggregating $8,183,000, were classified as 
renegotiated or nonaccrual as of December 31, 1994.
     Interest and fees on loans would have been increased by approximately 
$565,000, $715,000 and $593,000 for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively, if renegotiated and nonaccrual loans had earned their stated 
interest for the entire year.  The amount of interest included in net 
interest income from renegotiated and nonaccrual loans was $142,000, 
$284,000, and $629,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.
     The subsidiary banks, in the ordinary course of business, grant loans to 
related parties at terms which do not vary from terms that would have been 
required if the transactions had been with unrelated parties.  Indebtedness of 
related parties aggregated approximately $42,826,000, $42,925,000 and 
$39,934,000 as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Activity 
for the year ended December 31, 1995 is summarized as follows:

     Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS
No. 115.  Under the new rules, debt securities for which the company has both
the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized 
cost.  Debt securities that the company does not have the positive intent and 
ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified 
as available for sale and carried at fair value. The market value adjustment 
on securities classified as available for sale is carried as a separate 
component of shareholders' equity.   The following tables summarize amortized 
cost and fair values of held to maturity and available for sale securities:

Mortgage-backed securities are assigned to maturity categories based on 
estimated average lives.  Available for sale securities in the after 10 
year category include securities with no stated maturity.  Securities with
prepayment provisions are categorized based on contractual maturity.



     In accordance with the FASB's Special Report, "A Guide to Implementation 
of Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities," on December 29, 1995 obligations of states and political 
subdivisions held by the Parent Company with a book value of $5,698,000 and a 
market value of $5,667,000 were transferred from the held to maturity category 
to the available for sale category.
     Investment securities with par values aggregating $155,105,000 at 
December 31, 1995 and $142,077,000 at December 31, 1994 were pledged to secure 
public and trust funds.   Gross gains of $513,000, $403,000 and $252,000 and 
gross losses of $76,000, $37,000 and $88,000 were realized for the years ended 
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.



                      NOTE 6:  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Some officers and directors (including their affiliates, families and 
entities in which they are principal owners) of the Corporation and its 
subsidiaries are customers of those subsidiaries and have had, and are 
expected to have, transactions with the subsidiaries in the ordinary course
of business.  In addition, some officers and directors are also officers and 
directors of corporations which are customers of the banks and have had, and 
are expected to have, transactions with the banks in the ordinary course of
business.  In the opinion of management, such transactions are consistent with
prudent banking practices and are within applicable banking regulations.

                NOTE 6:  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The amount of transactions with related parties including loans and legal 
fees aggregated approximately $43,125,000 at December 31, 1995.  These related 
party transactions equal 25% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 1995.




           NOTE 7:  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Individual banks within the Corporation incur off-balance-sheet risks in 
the normal course of business in order to meet financing needs of their 
customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
and standby letters of credit.  Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, 
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized 
in the financial statements.
     In the normal course of business, there are outstanding various 
commitments to extend credit approximating $63,307,000 and standby letters of 
credit of $10,196,000 as of December 31, 1995.  The banks' exposure to credit 
loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial 
instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit
is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The banks use 
the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional 
obligations as for all other lending.  Collateral which secures these types of 
commitments is the same type as collateral for other types of lending, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets.
     Commitments to extend credit are commitments to lend to a customer as 
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan 
agreement.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other 
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since many of the 
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total 
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
The banks evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.
     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks 
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those guarantees 
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, 
including normal business activities, bond financing and similar transactions.  
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same 
as that involved in extending loans to customers.  Collateral securing these 
types of transactions is similar to collateral securing the banks' commercial 
loans.

      Other Assets includes property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding,
acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loans classified as 
in-substance foreclosures.  In accordance with FAS No. 114, a loan is 
classified as an in-substance foreclosure when the Corporation has taken
possession of the collateral.  Loans previously classified as in-substance
foreclosures, which the Corporation had not taken possession of the 
collateral, have been reclassified to loans.  This reclassification did not 
significantly impact the Corporation's financial condition.  Other Real Estate 
Owned, included in other assets, is carried at the lower of cost or fair
market value.

                   NOTE 12:  ESOP AND LONG TERM BORROWINGS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Corporation has a qualified noncontributory Employee Stock Ownership
Plan (ESOP) and Trust Agreement for the purpose of investing in the common 
stock of WesBanco on behalf of its employees. Substantially all employees were 
included in the ESOP plan as of January 1, 1995. Currently, the ESOP Trust holds
105,936 shares of WesBanco common stock.   Approximately 75,103 shares of 
stock were allocated to specific employee accounts as of December 31, 1995.
     During November 1995, the WesBanco ESOP Trust renegotiated its existing 
line of credit with an affiliated lender.  Conditions in the loan agreement 
remain the same, providing for a line of credit in the aggregate amount of 
$1,000,000 to facilitate purchases of WesBanco common stock in the open 
market.  The ESOP Trust utilized the line of credit during the year to 
purchase an additional 5,000 shares of stock for $128,750, pledging those 
shares as collateral.  The loan bears interest at a rate equal to the 
lender's base rate and requires annual repayments of principal equal to 20% 
of the balance at January 1 of each year.  The loan has a final maturity date
of 5 years from date of inception.  The $1,000,000 revolving line of credit 
has a balance of $777,000 and $849,000 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, 
respectively.
     Total contributions to the ESOP during 1995 were $350,012, which included 
cash contributions of $254,200 and an additional stock contribution valued at 
$95,812. Contributions during 1994 and 1993 were $231,956 and $246,000, 
respectively.
     Effective January 1, 1996, WesBanco expanded the existing ESOP to include
401(k) provisions.  Under the 401(k) provisions, substantially all employees 
are eligible to participate.  The Corporation makes matching contributions to 
the 401(k), up to a maximum of 1.5% of employees' compensation, subject to 
regulatory limitations.



      NOTE 13:  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Fair value estimates of financial instruments are based on present value 
of expected future cash flows, quoted market prices of similar financial 
instruments, if available, and other valuation techniques. These valuations are 
significantly affected by the discount rates, cash flow assumptions, and risk 
assumptions used.  Therefore, the fair value estimates may not be substantiated 
by comparison to independent markets and are not intended to reflect the 
proceeds that may be realizable in an immediate settlement of the instruments.
     The aggregate fair value of amounts presented do not represent the 
underlying value of the Corporation.  Management does not have the intention 
to dispose of a significant portion of its financial instruments and, 
therefore, the unrealized gains or losses should not be interpreted as a 
forecast of future earnings and cash flows.

=========================================================================================
</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of 
like kinds of financial instruments:

Cash and Short-Term Investments:
     The carrying amount for cash and short-term investments is a reasonable 
estimate of fair value.  Short-term investments consist of federal funds sold.
Investment Securities:
     Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, 
if available. If market prices are not available, then quoted market prices of 
similar instruments are used.
Net Loans:
     Fair values for loans with interest rates that fluctuate as current rates 
change are generally valued at carrying amounts.  The fair values for 
residential mortgage loans are based on quoted market prices of securitized 
financial instruments, adjusted for remaining maturity and differences in
loan characteristics.  Fair values of commercial real estate, construction and
consumer loans are based on a discounted value of the estimated future cash 
flows expected to be received.  The current interest rates applied in the 
discounted cash flow method reflect rates used to price new loans of similar 
type, adjusted for relative risk and remaining maturity.  The fair value of 
credit cards is estimated based on the anticipated average cost of soliciting 
a new account and the present credit quality of the outstanding balances.  For 
nonaccrual loans, fair value is estimated by discounting expected future 
principal cash flows only.
Deposits:
     The carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value for
demand and savings deposits and other variable rate deposit accounts.  The fair
value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by a discounted 
cash flow method using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar 
remaining maturities.
Short-Term Borrowings:
     For short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, 
repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, the carrying amount 
is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Redeemable Preferred Stock:
     The fair value of redeemable preferred stock is estimated using discounted 
cash flow analyses based on estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of arrangements.
Off-Balance Sheet Instruments:
     The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently 
charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining 
terms of the agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties.  
The amount of fees currently charged on commitments is determined to be 
insignificant and therefore the fair value and carrying value of off-balance 
sheet instruments are not shown.




                   NOTE 14:  RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1995, substantially all employees are participants in the
WesBanco defined benefit pension plan.  The plan covers those employees who
satisfy minimum age and length of service requirements.  Benefits of the 
WesBanco defined benefit plan are generally based on the years of service and 
the employee's compensation during the last five years of employment.  The 
WesBanco plan's funding policy has been to contribute annually the maximum 
amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.  Contributions 
are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, 
but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

              NOTE 14:  RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     During 1995, all assets and liabilities of the First Fidelity Bancorp 
defined benefit pension plan were merged into the WesBanco plan.  Prior to the 
merger, First Fidelity Bancorp's defined benefit plan formula used length of 
service and the employee's compensation to determine benefits.  Contributions 
provided for benefits attributed to employee service to date and for those 
benefits expected to be earned in the future.
     Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans in 1995, 1994 and 
1993 include the following components:

     WesBanco currently provides a death benefit and a contributory health 
insurance plan for all retirees.  WesBanco's contribution toward health 
insurance is a fixed amount which may be changed at its sole discretion.  
During 1995, the Corporation increased its health insurance benefit from $70 
to $90 per month, or 28.6%, and its death benefit from $5,000 to $7,500, or 50%.
     Effective January 1, 1995, First Fidelity Bancorp was included in the 
WesBanco postretirement medical and death benefit programs.  First Fidelity 
had no significant nonpension postretirement benefits for the years 1994 and 
1993.

     The Corporation's portion of the cost of health care benefits is expected 
to increase during 1996.  An assumption of a 1% per year increase in the 
benefit level would increase the expense in health care benefits by $79,829 or
28% for the year ended 1995 and increase the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation by $445,552 or 21% as of December 31, 1995.

                      NOTE 17:  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     On February 28, 1994, in connection with the acquisition of First Fidelity 
Bancorp, Inc., WesBanco issued 10,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock.  
During 1994, 75 shares were purchased and retired.
     Effective November 15, 1995, WesBanco redeemed its Series A 8% Cumulative 
Preferred Stock.  The holders of the preferred stock had the right to elect to
convert the preferred stock to common stock, $2.0833 par value, at the 
conversion ratio of 11.43 shares of common stock for each share of preferred 
stock or cash in the amount of $190 per share.  Periodic accretion using the 
straight-line method increased the value of the stock to the redemption price 
of $190 per share.  The accretion was charged against retained earnings.  The 
holders of 9,723 shares elected to convert their preferred shares to common 
shares resulting in the issuance of 111,111 shares held in treasury.  A total 
of 202 shares were redeemed for cash.

During 1995 there were 9,925 shares of Preferred Stock redeemed.  Of these 
shares, 9,723 shares were exchanged for 111,111 shares of WesBanco common 
stock in a non-cash transaction.  The remaining 202 shares were redeemed for 
cash at $190 per share and are included in other financing activities.



     The operations of the subsidiary banks are subject to Federal and state 
statutes which limit the banks' ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer 
funds to the Parent Company.  At December 31, 1995 the banks, without prior

                   NOTE 19:  SUBSEQUENT EVENT - AGREEMENT TO MERGE
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On February 9, 1996, WesBanco, Inc. announced the signing of a definitive
Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the merger of Bank of Weirton with
WesBanco Bank Wheeling, an affiliate of WesBanco, Inc.  Under the terms of the
definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, WesBanco will exchange 130 shares of
WesBanco's common stock for each share of Weirton's common stock outstanding in 
a tax free exchange.  A total of 1,690,000 common shares will be issued in the

appropriate regulatory authorities and the stockholders of Bank of Weirton, is
expected to be completed during the third quarter of 1996.

                 MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The financial statements and the information pertaining to those 
statements are the responsibility of management.  The financial statements 
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles, applied on a consistent basis.
     The accounting systems of the Corporation and its subsidiaries include 
internal controls and procedures which provide reasonable assurance as to the
reliability of the financial records.  Internal control systems are generally 
supported by written policies and procedures.  The internal auditing staff 
systematically performs audits of operations, reviews procedures, monitors 
adherence to bank policies and submits written audit reports to the Audit 
Committee.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of only 
outside directors.  The Audit Committee meets regularly with management, 
internal audit and our independent accountants to review accounting, auditing 
and financial matters.  The internal auditors, Federal and State examiners, 
and Price Waterhouse LLP have full access to the Audit Committee to discuss 
any appropriate matters.
     Independent accountants provide an objective review of management's 
discharge of its financial responsibilities relating to the preparation of the 
financial statements. The independent accountant's report is based on an audit 
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  This report 
expresses an informed judgement as to whether management's financial 
statements present fairly, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles, the Corporation's financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WESBANCO, INC.

     In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors, 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated 
statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WesBanco,
Inc., and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) at December 31, 1995, and 1994, 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 3 years 
in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Corporation's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the financial 
statements of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. for 1993, which statements reflect 
net interest income of $13,913,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.  
Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to 
the amounts included for First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc., for 1993, is based 
solely on the report of the other auditors.   We conducted our audits of the
consolidated statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We 
believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable 
basis for the opinion expressed above.
     As discussed in Note 1 and Note 5, the Corporation adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, (as amended by SFAS No. 118), 
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS No. 115, 
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," during 1995 
and 1994, respectively.

     WesBanco's net income rose 15.9% to $18,189,000 for the year ended 
December 31, 1995 as compared to $15,697,000 and $17,842,000 for the years 
ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The 1995 increase reflects 
a reduction in both the provision for loan losses and non-interest expense.  
The decrease in 1994 net income was primarily due to an increase of $2,826,000 
in the provision for loan losses relating to a writedown on a commercial loan.  
Profitability measures improved with return on assets (ROA) increasing to 1.35%
from 1.17% in 1994 and return on equity (ROE) increasing to 11.12% from 9.99% 
in 1994.  For 1993, ROA and ROE were 1.34% and 11.70%, respectively.
     The following table presents a comparative average balance sheet and
interest rate analysis.

Nonaccrual loans were included in the average volume for the entire year.  
Loan fees included in interest on loans are not material.  Average yields 
on investment securities available for sale have been calculated based on 
amortized cost.  Taxable equivalent basis is calculated on non-taxable
securities using a tax rate of 35% for 1995, 34.3% for 1994 and 1993.

                           NET INTEREST INCOME
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


     In 1995, net interest income was $56,029,000, a decrease of $367,000 or 
 .06% from 1994, following a slight increase in 1994 over 1993.  The 1995 
decrease resulted from a lower net yield on earning assets.  The net yield 
declined to 4.4% for 1995, from 4.5% for 1994 and 1993.
     Interest income growth for 1995 was caused primarily by an increase in 
loan balances coupled with higher loan yields and changes in the mix of 
assets.  The average yield on earning assets increased 0.5% to 7.8% in 1995.  
Loan yields increased 0.5% to 9.0%, while investment yields decreased slightly. 
The 1995 nationwide bank base lending rate averaged 8.6%, up from 7% in 1994 
and 6% in 1993.
     Interest expense increased in 1995 due to rising interest rates in late 
1994 and early 1995, customers' preference for certificates of deposits, and 
pricing pressure to compete for funds in the marketplace.  These factors led 
to an increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of 0.6% 
to 4.0% during 1995.
     The decline in interest rates during 1993 and early 1994 caused the 
average earning asset yield to decrease to 7.3% during 1994 from 7.7% for 
1993.  During the same period the average rate paid on interest bearing 
liabilities decreased to 3.4% in 1994 from 3.7% in 1993.



                                 INVESTMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Taxable investment securities averaged $325,808,000 during 1995, a 
decrease of 14% over 1994.  Non-taxable securities decreased 3% to 
$121,093,000 over the same period.  During 1994, average taxable securities 
decreased $17,010,000 or 4% over 1993, while average non-taxable securities 
increased $12,713,000 or 11% over the same period.  For 1995 and 1994, the 
decreases in total average investment securities were required to fund loan
growth.
     WesBanco's available for sale portfolio at fair market value was 
$172,137,000 or 41% of total investment securities as of December 31, 1995, 
compared to $202,705,000 or 42% of investment securities for the same period 
in 1994.  The general decline in interest rates during 1995 led to an increase 
in the market value of the available for sale portfolio.  The market value 
adjustment as of December 31, 1995 reflected an unrealized gain, net of tax of
$849,000, recorded as an adjustment to shareholders' equity.  As of December 
31, 1994, securities available for sale had an unrealized loss, net of tax, of 
$4,482,000.  These market value adjustments represent temporary market value 
fluctuations which depend upon general changes in market rates.  WesBanco can 
adjust the volatility of the market value adjustment by managing both the 
volume of securities classified as available for sale and average maturities.  
If securities are held to their maturity dates, no net gain or loss would be 
realized.  At December 31, 1995, the available for sale portfolio had an 
average yield of  5.7% and an average maturity of 3.1 years.
     Held to maturity securities, at cost, totaled $251,016,000 or 59% of total
investment securities as of December 31, 1995, compared to $274,173,000 or 58%
for the same period in 1994.  At December 31, 1995, the held to maturity 
portfolio had an average yield of 5.5% and an average maturity of 2.8 years.
     In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Special Report
allowing for a one-time transfer of securities, WesBanco reclassified 
securities held by the Parent Company with a market value of $5,667,000 from 
the held to maturity category to available for sale during the fourth quarter 
of 1995.
     During 1995 and 1994, as loan demand exceeded deposit growth, matured, 
called or sold investment securities represented a primary source of 
liquidity.  Investment securities with a total carrying value of $106,960,000
either matured or were called during 1995 as compared to $98,939,000 during 
1994.  Investment securities of $59,291,000 and $67,002,000 were sold during 
1995 and 1994, respectively.  The average maturity of total investment 
securities at December 31, 1995 was 2.9 years as compared to 3.1 years and 
3.6 years as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During 1996, 
securities totaling $122,831,000 or 29% of total securities are expected to 
mature, providing for potential liquidity needs.
    Investment income declined by $3,298,000 during 1995 after declining by
$2,439,000 during 1994. The 1995 decline was primarily due to a decrease in 
average investment balances of $54,692,000 or 11%.  The average yield on 
taxable securities, excluding the effects of the market value adjustment on 
available for sale securities, remained stable at 5.8% for 1995 and 1994, down 
from 6.2% for 1993.  The average yield on non-taxable securities, not adjusted 
for tax equivalency, was 5.5% for 1995 and 1994, down from 5.9% for 1993.
     Net realized securities gains totaled $437,000 in 1995 compared to 
$366,000 and $164,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During 1995, net gains 
of $126,000 were realized through a decision to divest of an equity position 
which no longer had a strategic value to the Corporation.  Gains and losses 
on securities are dependent upon the changing bond market conditions and the
composition of the securities.

                                  LOANS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     At December 31, 1995, loans outstanding were $850,568,000, representing 
an increase of 9.5% from December 31, 1994. This follows a 3.9% increase in 
loans for the corresponding period in 1994.  The strong growth can be 
attributed to mortgage and consumer loans, which had individual portfolio 
increases of 9.5% and 15.1%, respectively.  The increase in mortgage loans 
was largely due to refinancing activity caused by a declining interest rate 
environment during 1995.  Consumer loans increased as a result of offering 
attractive rates on automobile loans originated through dealers.  However, 
the increase was partially offset by the sale of student loans.  During 1995 
and 1994, the Corporation sold substantially all of its student loan portfolio, 
which totaled approximately $9,000,000.  Commercial loans increased 6.6% during 
1995, after a decrease of 2% during 1994.  As of December 31, 1995, commercial 
loans comprised 20% of total loans outstanding, real estate secured loans 
comprise 47.5%, and consumer-type loans comprise 32.5%.  WesBanco's lending 
limit to a single customer was $24,839,000 as of December 31, 1995.
     Interest on loans increased $8,773,000 or 14% during 1995, after a 
decrease of $1,090,000 during 1994.  The 1995 increase was due to growth in 
average loans of $57,953,000 or 7.8%, combined with an increase in the 
average loan yield of 0.5% to 9.0%.  Average loan yields for 1994 and 1993 
were 8.5% and 8.9%, respectively.  Rates offered on loan products generally 
increased during the second half of 1994 into early 1995, causing an increase 
in loan yields during 1995.  The majority of commercial and mortgage loans 
reprice monthly or annually based on changes in national indices such as prime 
rate or the U.S. Treasury Bill rate.
     On January 1, 1995, WesBanco adopted FAS No. 114 "Accounting by Creditors 
for Impairment of a Loan."  A loan is considered impaired when it is probable
that the lender will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts 
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  At December 31, 
1995 impaired loans included all nonperforming loans.
     Loans classified as nonperforming declined to $7,291,000 or .9% of loans
outstanding as of December 31, 1995 as compared to $8,183,000 or 1.1% as of
December 31, 1994.  The decline in 1995 was primarily due to the 
reclassification of a nonaccrual commercial loan to other assets, where the 
property is recorded at fair market value.  Nonaccrual loans are generally 
secured by collateral believed to have adequate market values to protect
against significant losses.  The Corporation continues to monitor the 
nonperforming assets to ensure against deterioration in collateral values.
     Net charge-offs and the provision for possible loan losses in 1995 
decreased primarily due to a 1994 writeoff of a commercial real estate loan 
approximating $4,000,000.  Net loan charge-offs were $2,340,000 in 1995 as 
compared to $5,589,000 in 1994 and $2,016,000 in 1993.  The provision for 
possible loan losses decreased to $2,770,000 in 1995 from $6,055,000 and 
$3,229,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  
     The reserve for possible loan losses is considered adequate to provide 
for future losses in the loan portfolio.  In determining the adequacy of 
the reserve for possible loan losses, the Corporation exceeds the minimum 
guidelines as set forth by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  
Amounts charged to earnings were based on periodic management evaluations 
of the loan portfolio, specific problem loans and other factors.



                                 DEPOSITS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     As of December 31, 1995 total deposits increased to $1,115,473,000 from
$1,109,219,000 as of December 31, 1994.  The increase can be attributed to 
fourth quarter deposit growth related to the introduction of a new retail 
banking program called Good Neighbor Banking.  The program offers a series of 
pricing bonuses which vary according to the customer's service relationship.
     Average deposits decreased $6,279,000 or .5% to $1,108,914 in 1995, after 
an increase of $10,078,000 or 1% between 1994 and 1993.  The decrease in
average deposits during 1995 and the slight growth in 1994 can be attributed 
to the competition for funds in the local market and consumers seeking 
nonbank investment alternatives.  Certificates of deposit increased $38,584,000 
or 9.7% during 1995, reflecting a change in deposit mix as customers moved from 
demand and savings products into certificates of deposit. As interest rates 
rose during late 1994 and early 1995, customers were attracted to the
higher-yielding certificate of deposit products during 1995.
     Interest expense on deposits increased $5,031,000 or 14.9% during 1995 as
compared to a decrease of $3,764,000 during 1994.  The 1995 increase is 
reflected in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits which rose to 
4.0% during 1995 as compared to 3.4% in 1994 and 3.8% in 1993, due primarily 
to the rising interest rate environment during late 1994, coupled with a shift 
in deposit mix from demand and savings balances to the higher-yielding
certificates of deposit.  During 1995, certificates of deposit comprised 39% of
average deposits, up from 35% in 1994.

                             CAPITAL ADEQUACY
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     On December 31, 1995 shareholders' equity totaled $170,040,000, an 
increase of $13,410,000 from 1994.  The increase can be attributed to 
earnings growth in 1995 combined with a change in the market value adjustment
on investments available for sale of $5,331,000, from a net unrealized loss 
of $4,482,000 at December 31, 1994 to a net unrealized gain of $849,000 at 
December 31, 1995.
     During the third quarter 1995 the Corporation completed a $7,000,000
common stock repurchase plan that began in April 1994, and announced the start 
of a $10,000,000 common stock repurchase plan.  The plan, which may be 
discontinued or suspended at any time, will provide shares for general 
corporate purposes.  At December 31, 1995, approximately $971,882 of the stock 
repurchase plan had been utilized.
     During the fourth quarter 1995, WesBanco redeemed its Series A 8% 
Cumulative Preferred Stock.  The holders of 9,723 shares elected to convert 
their preferred shares into common shares, resulting in the issuance of 
111,111 shares previously held in treasury.
     Effective April 1, 1995 the quarterly per share dividend rate was 
increased to $.23 from $.22 and on October 1, 1995 was increased to $.25.  
The dividend payout ratio for 1995 was 45%, down slightly from 47% in 1994.  
The decrease in the ratio was due to the increased level of earnings during 
1995.
     WesBanco is subject to risk-based capital guidelines that measure capital
relative to risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.  
The Corporation's Tier 1, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios are well 
above the required minimum levels of 4%, 8%, and 3%, respectively.  At 
December 31, 1995, all of WesBanco's affiliate banks exceeded the minimum 
regulatory levels.  Capital adequacy ratios are summarized as follows:

                   INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Interest rate management measures the sensitivity of net interest earnings 
to changes in the level of interest rates.  As interest rates change in the 
market, rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest-
bearing liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently.  Differing rate 
sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have 
the same maturities or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in 
the timing of rate changes.
     The affiliate banks review their interest rate sensitivity on a periodic 
basis.  The analysis presented below classifies interest earning assets and 
interest bearing liabilities into maturity categories and measures the 
differences between maturing assets and liabilities in each category (interest 
sensitivity gap).  At December 31, 1995, the Corporation was in a liability
sensitive position as summarized in the table below (in thousands):

             INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The changing interest rate environment can substantially impact the 
Corporation's net interest income and profitability.   The Asset/Liability 
Committee believes the Corporation's interest sensitivity position provides 
for a changing interest rate environment.  During the next twelve months, the 
Corporation's net interest sensitivity position is $(457,325,000), $7,996,000, 
$39,814,000 and $63,256,000 during the periods under three months, three to 
six months, six to nine months and nine months to one year, respectively.  The
liability sensitive position in the under three month time period is caused by 
savings and NOW deposits.  Interest rates on these deposit instruments are 
subject to periodic adjustment at management's discretion.  Rates on savings 
and NOW deposits ranged from 2.0% to 3.0% during 1995 as compared to 2.5% to 
3.0% during 1994.
     The Corporation's short-term liability sensitive position would suggest 
exposure of the net interest margin to changing interest rates.  An increase 
in interest rates may cause a decline in the net interest margin while 
decreasing interest rates may have the opposite effect. The Corporation may 
reduce its short-term liability sensitive position making its net interest 
margin less vulnerable to rising interest rates by shortening asset maturities, 
primarily through federal funds and investment maturities.  In addition, 
management may emphasize attracting longer-term deposits by not increasing 
the rates paid on savings and NOW accounts, while increasing rates on term 
certificates of deposit.
     The Corporation manages its liquidity position to ensure that sufficient 
funds are available to meet customer needs for borrowing and deposit 
withdrawals.  The Corporation's primary source of liquidity is its strong 
core deposit base.  The growth in deposits is somewhat dependent upon interest 
rates of competitive financial instruments.  Short-term liquidity is maintained 
through the use of federal funds sold, which represents one day investments
and cash balances.  As of December 31, 1995, federal funds sold and cash 
balances were $63,539,000 or 4.6% of total assets as compared to $65,310,000 
or 4.8% of total assets as of December 31, 1994.  Additional short-term 
liquidity is maintained through investments with expected maturities of less 
than one year which, during 1996, approximate $122,831,000 or 9.0% of total 
assets.  During 1995 investment maturities and calls of $106,960,000 became 
available for reinvestment.
     As of December 31, 1995 the Corporation had outstanding commitments to 
extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating $63,307,000.  
On a historical basis only a small portion of these commitments result in 
expended funds.
     The  Corporation has commitments for planned additions to fixed assets 
of approximately $2,000,000 during 1996, which includes the construction of a 
new branch facility, new integrated banking software, and the phase-in of a 
local and wide area networking system.



                                OTHER INCOME
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Other income, excluding securities transactions, increased $277,000 or 
2.7% over 1994, due primarily to an increase in trust fee revenue.  Trust 
fee revenue was $4,716,000 for 1995, an increase of $291,000 or 6.6% over 
1994.  Trust fee revenue increased $265,000 or 6.4% between 1994 and 1993.  
This steady increase in trust fees can be attributed to the increased number 
of accounts under administration and increased market values.  The market 
value of trust assets at December 31, 1995 approximated $1,283,218,000 as 
compared to $1,113,416,000 at December 31, 1994.  Service charges and other 
income totaled $4,906,000 for 1995, a decrease of $131,000 over 1994.  
Contributing to the decrease were fee discounts associated with Good Neighbor 
Banking.  Service charges and other income increased $224,000 between 1994 and 
1993 due to increases in the fees associated with deposit accounts.



                             OTHER EXPENSES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Other expenses decreased $626,000 or 1.6% in 1995 to $38,988,000.  The 
decline from last year was primarily due to a reduction in the FDIC insurance 
rate.  During 1994 other expenses increased $903,000 or 2.3% from 1993, 
primarily due to increased personnel costs.  Increases in health insurance, 
pension costs, and the recognition of employment contracts for two First 
Fidelity executive officers contributed to the increase during 1994.
     Salaries and benefits for 1995 remained at approximately the same level 
as 1994, decreasing $90,000 or .4% as compared to an increase of $1,239,000 
or 6.1% in 1994.  During 1995, the number of full-time equivalent employees 
decreased to 755 from 775, causing a 2.4% reduction in salary expenses.  
Internal bank consolidations have reduced staffing levels in different areas 
of the Corporation.  The reduction in salary expenses was partially offset by 
an

<PAGE>   25

                        OTHER EXPENSES (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

increase in benefits, primarily in employer expenses for health care and 
retirement benefits.
     The Corporation expects employee benefits to continue to rise in 1996.  
In addition to anticipated increases in health insurance costs, effective 
January 1, 1996 WesBanco expanded its existing ESOP to include 401(k) 
provisions.  The Corporation will make matching contributions on behalf of each 
participant, up to a maximum of 1.5% of the employee's pay, subject to
regulatory limitations.
     Occupancy and equipment expenses increased approximately 2.5% in 1995 and
1994.  The increases can be attributed to the construction of a new branch 
facility in Bridgeport, WV and technological advancements to enhance customer 
service through the phase-in of a local area network and loan platform 
automation.
     Other operating expenses decreased $644,000 or 4.7%, after decreasing
$228,000 or 1.7% during 1994.  The 1995 decrease was primarily due to a 
reduction in FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by increases in 
marketing expenses associated with the introduction of the Good Neighbor 
Banking Program.   In addition, the Corporation has experienced improved
operating efficiencies through internal consolidations of affiliate banks.  
Internal consolidations reduced the number of affiliate banks to six in 1995 
from thirteen in early 1994.  Affiliate bank consolidations are planned 
throughout 1996.


                              INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Federal income tax expense increased $1,132,000 to $6,072,000 during 1995, 
after decreasing $567,000 to $4,940,000 during 1994.  In 1995, the tax expense 
increased due to increased pretax earnings.  The decrease in tax expense for 
1994 was affected primarily by the decrease in pretax earnings and the level 
of nontaxable income.
     The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 28% for 1995, 27% for
1994 and 1993.  The changes in the effective tax rate are representative of 
the change in the level of taxable income and to a lesser extent the changing 
state tax rates.  The alternative minimum tax will affect WesBanco only if a 
significant amount of non-taxable income exists when compared to taxable 
income.
     During 1993, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1993 which included increasing certain corporate income tax rates retroactive 
to January 1, 1993.  The change in the corporate tax rate was increased to 35% 
from 34% for corporations with income over $15,000,000.
     The State of West Virginia has a corporate net income tax based upon
federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items not subject to state 
taxation.  The state tax rate for 1995 was 9.0%.  State income tax included 
in the provision for income taxes was $1,108,000 for 1995 as compared to 
$840,000 and $1,080,000 for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The State of Ohio 
does not have a corporate income tax, but rather, businesses are subject to 
an Ohio corporate franchise tax which is included in other operating expenses.






                                 ACQUISITIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     During February 1994, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding 
stock of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. (Fidelity). The acquisition was 
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests which requires that all amounts
included in the proforma financial statements be restated as if the acquisition
had occurred on the first day of each year presented.  Fidelity had net income 
of $3,179,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.  On a proforma basis, the
acquisition of Fidelity caused dilution in earnings per share of $.18 for the
year ended December 31, 1993.  Book value was diluted by $.87 for 1993.
     On February 9, 1996, WesBanco, Inc. announced the signing of a definitive
Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the merger of the Bank of Weirton 
with WesBanco Bank Wheeling, an affiliate of WesBanco, Inc.  The transaction, 
which is subject to, among other things, approval by the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and the stockholders of Bank of Weirton, is expected to be 
completed during the third quarter of 1996.  See Note 19 in the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information associated with 
the merger agreement.
