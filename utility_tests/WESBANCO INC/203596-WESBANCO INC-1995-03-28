PART I

Item 1.  Business
- -----------------
General
- -------
     As of December 31, 1994, the Corporation had eight banking
affiliates located in Wheeling, Charleston, Elizabeth, Sissonville,
Parkersburg, Kingwood, Fairmont and Bridgeport, West Virginia.  The
Registrant has one banking affiliate in Barnesville, Ohio.  WesBanco
Wheeling has ten offices, all in West Virginia, three located in
Wheeling, two located in Follansbee, three in New Martinsville, one in
Sistersville, and one in Wellsburg.  WesBanco Elm Grove has two offices
located in the Elm Grove section of Wheeling.  WesBanco Kingwood has two
full-service branch offices located in Masontown and Bruceton Mills. 
WesBanco Barnesville has five offices, two located in Barnesville and one
each in Bethesda, Woodsfield and Beallsville, Ohio.  WesBanco Fairmont
has four offices located in Fairmont and two offices located in
Morgantown.  WesBanco Bridgeport has seven offices, four located in
Bridgeport, two in Shinnston and one in Nutter Fort, West Virginia. 
There are approximately 775 full time equivalent employees employed by
all affiliates as of December 31, 1994.

     WesBanco, Inc., through its subsidiaries, conducts a general
banking, commercial and trust business.  Its full service banks offer a
wide range of services to commercial, consumer and government bodies,
including but not limited to, retail banking services, such as demand,
savings and time deposits; commercial, mortgage, and consumer installment
loans; credit card services through VISA and MasterCard; personal and
corporate trust services; discount brokerage services; and travel
services.  Most affiliates are participating in local partnerships which
operate banking machines in those local regions primarily under the name
of MAC.  The banking machines are linked to CIRRUS, a nationwide banking
network.

     The Corporation has reported to its shareholders that it may engage
in other activities of a financial nature authorized by the Federal
Reserve Board through a subsidiary, or through acquisition of established
companies.

     As of December 31, 1994, none of the affiliates were engaged in any
operation in foreign countries and none has had transactions with
customers in foreign countries.

Competition
- -----------
     Each affiliate bank faces strong competition for local business in
their respective market areas.  Competition exists for new deposits, in
the scope and types of services offered, and the interest rates paid on
time deposits and charged on loans, and in other aspects of banking.  The
affiliate banks encounter substantial competition not only from other
commercial banks but also from other financial institutions.  Savings
banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage business and credit
unions actively compete for deposits.  Such institutions, as well as
consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other enterprises,
are important competitors for various types of lending business.  In
addition, personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling
services are offered by insurance companies, investment counseling firms
and other business firms and individuals.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
Supervision and Regulation
- --------------------------
     As a registered bank holding company, WesBanco is subject to the
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file with the
Federal Reserve Board reports and other information regarding its
business operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries. 
WesBanco is also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and
is required to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring,
directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any
bank, if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5%
of the voting stock of such bank.  In addition, pursuant to federal law
and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, WesBanco may
only engage in, or own or control companies that engage in, activities
deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking
as to be a proper incident thereto.  Prior to engaging in most new
business activities, WesBanco must obtain approval from the Federal
Reserve Board.

     WesBanco's banking subsidiaries have deposits insured by the Bank
Insurance Fund ("BIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC"), and are subject to supervision, examination, and regulation by
state banking authorities and either the FDIC or the Federal Reserve
Board.  In addition to the impact of federal and state supervision and
regulation, the banking subsidiaries of WesBanco are affected
significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts
to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence
the economy.

     WesBanco's depository institution subsidiaries are subject to
affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law which limit the
transfer of funds by the subsidiary banks to their parent and any
nonbanking subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, extensions of
credit, investments or asset purchases.  Such transfers by any subsidiary
bank to its parent corporation or to any nonbanking subsidiary are
limited in amount to 10% of the institution's capital and surplus and,
with respect to such parent and all such nonbanking subsidiaries, to an
aggregage 20% of any such institution's capital and surplus. 
Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required to be
secured in specified amounts.

     The Federal Reserve Board has a policy to the effect that a bank
holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and
managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit
resources to support each such subsidiary bank.  Under the source of
strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding
company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and
may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound
practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. 
This capital injection may be required at times when WesBanco may not
have the resources to provide it.  Any capital loans by a holding company
to any of the subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. 
Moreover, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any
commitment by such holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency
to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
     In 1989, the United States Congress passed comprehensive financial
institutions legislation known as the Financial Institution Reform,
Recovery, and Enforcement Act ("FIRREA").  FIRREA established a new
principle of liability on the part of depository institutions insured by
the FDIC for any losses incurred by, or reasonably expected to be
incurred by, the FDIC after August 9, 1989, in connection with (i) the 
default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution, or
(ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-
insured depository institution in danger of default.  "Default" is
defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in
danger of default" is defined generally as the existence of certain
conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to occur in the absence
of regulatory assistance.  Accordingly, in the event that any insured
bank subsidiary of WesBanco causes a loss to the FDIC, other bank
subsidiaries of WesBanco could be required to compensate the FDIC by
reimbursing to it the amount of such loss.

     Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of
shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired,
by losses or otherwise to relieve a deficiency in such national bank's
capital stock.  This statute also provides for the enforcement of any
such pro rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover
such impairment of capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the
capital stock of any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment. 
Similarly, the laws of certain states provide for such assessment and
sale with respect to the subsidiary banks chartered by such states. 
WesBanco, as the sole shareholder of its subsidiary banks, is subject to
such provisions.

Dividend Restrictions
- ---------------------
     There are statutory limits on the amount of dividends WesBanco's
depository institution subsidiaries can pay to their parent corporation
without regulatory approval.  Under applicable federal regulations,
appropriate bank regulatory agency approval is required if the total of
all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the
available retained earnings and exceeds the aggregate of the bank's net
profits (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year and its
retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required
transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock.

     If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank
under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe
or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the
bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may
require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from
such practice.  The Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC have
issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank
holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current
operating earnings.

FDIC Insurance
- --------------
     The FDIC has the authority to raise the insurance premiums for
institutions in the BIF to a level necessary to achieve a target reserve
level of 1.25% of insured deposits within not more than 15 years.  In
addition, the FDIC has the authority to impose special assessments in
certain circumstances.  The level of deposit premiums affects the
profitability of subsidiary banks and thus the potential flow of
dividends to parent companies.

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
     Under the risk-based insurance assessment system that became
effective January 1, 1994, the FDIC places each insured depository
institution in one of nine risk categories based on its level of capital
and other relevant information (such as supervisory evaluations).  The
assessment rates under the new system range from 0.23% to 0.31% depending
upon the assessment category into which the insured institution is
placed.  During 1994, all WesBanco banks were at the assessment rate of
0.23%.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
- -------------------------------------------------------------
     In December 1991, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), which substantially
revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and makes revisions to several other federal banking
statutes.

     Among other things, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory
authorities to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  For these
purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized,
adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
and critically undercapitalized.

     Rules adopted by the Federal banking agencies under FDICIA provide
that an institution is deemed to be: "well capitalized" if the
institution has a Total (Tier 1 plus Tier II) risk-based capital ratio
of 10.0% or greater, a Tier I risk-based ratio of 6.0% or greater, and
a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the institution is not subject
to an order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective
action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital
measure; "adequately capitalized" if the institution has a Total risk-
based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio
of 4.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater (or a
leverage ratio of 3.0% or greater if the institution is rated composite
1 in its most recent report of examination, subject to appropriate
Federal banking agency guidelines), and the institution does not meet the
definition of a well-capitalized institution; "undercapitalized" if the
institution has a Total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%,
a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a leverage
ratio that is less than 4.0% (or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%
if the institution is rated composite 1 in its most recent report of
examination, subject to appropriate Federal banking agency guidelines)
and the institution does not meet the definition of a significantly
undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized institution;
"significantly undercapitalized" if the institution has a Total risk-
based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital
ratio that is less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%
and the institution does not meet the definition of a critically
undercapitalized institution; and "critically undercapitalized" if the
institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal
to or less than 2%.

     At December 31, 1994, WesBanco and all of its bank subsidiaries
qualified as well-capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines noted
above.  A bank's capital category, however, is determined solely for the
purpose of applying the prompt corrective actions rules and may not
constitute an accurate representation of that bank's overall financial
condition or prospects.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>     7

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
     The appropriate Federal banking agency may, under certain
circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository
institution as adequately capitalized.  The appropriate agency is also
permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized
institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the
institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically
undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital
levels of the institution.

     The statute provides that an institution may be reclassified if the
appropriate Federal banking agency determines (after notice and
opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound
condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound
practice.

     FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any
capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any
management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would
thereafter be undercapitalized.  Undercapitalized depository institutions
are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital
restoration plan.  The Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital
restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan
is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring
the depository institution's capital.  In addition, for a capital
restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution's parent
holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such
capital restoration plan.  The aggregate liability of the parent holding
company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the
depository institution's total assets at the time it became
undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have
been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital
standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it
fails to comply with the plan.  If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly
undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be
subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders
to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits
from correspondent banks.  Critically undercapitalized institutions are
subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

     FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect
the operation of WesBanco, including new reporting requirements,
regulatory standards for real estate lending, "truth in savings"
provisions, and the requirement that a depository institution give 90
days' prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing
any branch.

Capital Requirements
- --------------------
     The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
banks adopted by the Federal banking agencies were phased in at the end
of 1992.  The minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) under the fully phased-in guidelines is 8%.  At least
half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock, retained
earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stocks, minority interests
and, for bank holding companies, a limited amount of qualifying

- -----------------------------
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other
intangibles ("Tier I capital").  The remainder ("Tier II capital") may 
consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments, and limited
amounts of subordinated debt and the reserve for credit losses.

     In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum
leverage ratio (Tier I capital to total average assets less goodwill and
certain other intangibles) guidelines for bank holding companies and
banks.  These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for
bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified criteria,
including that they have the highest regulatory rating.  All other
banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3.0%
plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points.  The
guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without
significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a
"tangible Tier I leverage ratio" in evaluating proposals for expansion
or new activities.  The tangible Tier I leverage ratio is the ratio of
Tier I capital, less intangibles not deducted from Tier I capital, to
total assets, less all intangibles.  Neither WesBanco nor any of its bank
subsidiaries has been advised of any specific minimum leverage ratio
applicable to it.

     As of December 31, 1994, all of WesBanco's banking subsidiaries had

- ----------------------
     The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of
1994 (hereinafter called "Interstate Banking Act") was signed into law
by President Clinton on September 29, 1994.  The Act generally allows
adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies to acquire
banks in any state starting one year after enactment.  The Act also
permits interstate merger transactions beginning June 1, 1997.  States
are permitted, however, to pass legislation providing for either earlier
approval of mergers with out-of-state banks or "opting-out" of interstate
mergers entirely.  The Act would permit banks to acquire branches of out-
of-state banks by converting their office into branches of the resulting
bank.  The Act would also permit banks to establish and operate "de novo
branches" in any state that "opts-in" to de novo branching.  The Act also
requires each Federal banking agency to prescribe uniform regulations,
including guidelines insuring that interstate branches operated by out-
of-state banks are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of
communities where they operate.  WesBanco is incorporated under the laws
of the State of West Virginia and the West Virginia Legislature has not
yet adopted any legislation which would specifically "opt-in" or "opt-
out" of any of these specific provisions of the Interstate Banking Act.

Statistical Information
- -----------------------
     Except as noted, the following statistical data averages included
in Item 1 - Business were computed using daily averages for the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  Statistical data not included

Item 1.  Business (continued)
- -----------------------------
The effect on interest income and interest expense for the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, due to changes in average volume and
rate from the prior year, is presented below.  The average volumes and
rates are shown in the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders.  The effect
of a change in average volume has been determined by applying the average
rate in the earlier year to the change in volume.  The change in rate has
been determined by applying the average volume in the earlier year to the
change in rate.  The change in interest due to both rate and volume has
been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the
relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of change in each. (in

     Each bank within the Corporation has its own renewal policies regarding
commercial and real estate-construction loans.  However, real estate-
construction loans are generally not renewed at any bank.  Depending on the 
size of each institution, commercial loans above certain pre-approved dollar 
limits must be reviewed by the respective credit review committee or senior 
management prior to extension of maturity dates or rollover of the loan into a 
new loan.  Renewals of commercial loans below specified lending limitations may
be approved by the respective bank loan officer.

     WesBanco Bank Wheeling and WesBanco Bank Elm Grove, which have
approximately 42% of consolidated gross loans have a practice of
originating most commercial loans and real estate construction loans on
a demand basis.  Most of these loans do not require formal repayment
terms other than monthly interest payments.  There is no significant
impact on cash flows since these loans are monitored on a regular basis
and principal repayments, if not made by borrowers, are requested. 
WesBanco banks follow lending policies which require substantial down
payments along with current market appraisals on the collateral when the
loans are originated.  The majority of their loans are either secured by
deeds of trust on real property, security agreements on personal
property, insurance contracts from independent insurance companies or
through the full faith and credit of government agencies.

     All affiliate banks generally recognize interest income on the
accrual basis, except for certain loans which are placed on a nonaccrual
status, when in the opinion of management, doubt exists as to
collectability.  All banks must conform to the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency
Policy which states that banks may not accrue interest on any loan on
which either the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless
the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.  When a
loan is placed on a nonaccrual status, interest income is recognized as
cash payments are received.

     During 1994, nonaccrual loans decreased by $4,896,000 to $4,413,000
as of December 31, 1994 from $9,309,000 as of December 31, 1993.  The
decline was primarily due to a commercial real estate loan which had a
balance of approximately $3,823,000 as of December 31, 1993 being taken
off of nonaccrual status.  Other real estate owned increased to
$4,278,000 as of December 31, 1994 from $2,558,000 as of December 31,
1993.  The increase in other real estate owned was due to a commercial
loan totaling $2,659,000 being classified as an in-substance foreclosure.

Loan Portfolio (continued)
- --------------------------
     During 1993, nonaccrual loans increased by $4,486,000 to $9,309,000, 
however, during the same time period, renegotiated loans declined by $3,919,000
to $168,000. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to a 
reclassification of a renegotiated loan totaling $3,823,000 to nonaccrual 
status during 1993.  A commercial loan totaling $1,216,000 was also placed on 
nonaccrual status during 1993.  All nonaccrual loans are secured by 
collateral believed to have adequate market values to protect the Corporation 
from significant losses.  Nonaccrual and renegotiated loans declined $3,643,000
during 1992 primarily due to one customer's improvement of operations and 
increased debt service ability justifying a renewed extension of credit at 
market terms and conditions.  The decrease in nonaccrual loans of $2,300,000 
during 1991 was primarily due to the transfer of three commercial loans into 
the in-substance foreclosure category.  Other real estate remained fairly level
from 1991 through 1993.  At December 31, 1990, other real estate owned was at a
lower level due to the sale of property held as other real estate during 1990. 
Management continues to monitor the nonperforming assets to ensure against 
deterioration in collateral values.

</TABLE>

  WesBanco has allocated the reserve for possible loan losses to
specific portfolio segments based upon historical net charge-off
experience, changes in the level of non-performing assets, local economic
conditions and management experience.

     Management deems the reserve for loan losses at December 31, 1994
to be adequate.

Risk Elements
- -------------
     The Corporation has historically maintained a reserve for possible
loan losses which is greater than actual charge-offs.  Charge-offs for
the year 1995 are anticipated to be within the historical ranges as
detailed in the summary of loan loss experience.

     Management maintains loan quality through monthly reviews of past
due loans, and a quarterly review of significant loans which are
considered by affiliate bank personnel to be potential problem loans. 
Periodic reviews of other significant loans are completed by personnel
independent of the loan function.

     There are no significant loans made to customers outside the general
market area of each affiliate bank.  At times, in order to maintain loan
volumes, loans are purchased from correspondent banks.  These loans
aggregate less than $9,000,000 as of December 31, 1994.

       Each bank within the Corporation follows its usual loan analysis
procedures before a determination is made to purchase this type of loan.

     Management's review of the loan portfolio has not indicated any
material amount of loans, not disclosed in the accompanying tables and
discussions which are known to have possible credit problems which cause
management to have serious doubts as to the ability of each borrower to
comply with their present loan repayment terms.  There were no loan
concentrations in excess of 10% of total consolidated loans.

Short-Term Borrowings

PRICE WATERHOUSE, LLP

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of WesBanco, Inc.

     In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
auditors, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of WesBanco, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the financial
statements of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. for 1993 and 1992, which
statements reflect total assets of $307,965,000 at December 31, 1993, and
net interest income of $13,913,000 and $14,013,000 for the years ended
December 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Those statements were audited by
other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our
opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. for 1993 and 1992, is based solely on
the report of the other auditors.  We conducted our audits of the
consolidated statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

     As discussed in Note 5, Note 18 and Note 16, the Corporation adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," during 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors and Shareholders
First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of condition of
First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our responsibilty is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1993
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

established.  Each such credit shall be entered in the account as of the date 
on which the fee represented thereby is payable.
     Section 7 - INTEREST.  Interest shall be credited to each account, during
the period that the person in whose name such account is carried is a member of
the Board of Directors, at the rate from time to time determined by Wesbanco
Bank Wheeling (or other adopting subsidiary) for, and payable on, funds on
deposit in the Money Market Accounts maintained by the bank.  Interest
computation shall be made, and the amount of each computation entered in the
account as a credit, on the same dates that interest is computed by the bank on
the aforesaid Money Market Accounts.
     Section 8 - WESBANCO COMMON STOCK.  Alternatively, a Director
may elect to designate that such account be deemed to be invested in Wesbanco
Common Stock.  Such election may be made as to all or part of such credits and
may be made for existing account balances.  In the event such an election is
made, such designated account balances or credits shall be deemed to be invested
in such common stock and the electing Director's account shall be credited with
such shares and the subsequent dividends reinvested therein as if they had been
so invested from the date of such election.
     Section 9 - TERMINATION OF ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE.  An
election to defer fees pursuant to the Plan may be terminated as of the 1st day
of any month by written

                                  3
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     4

notice, signed by the participating Director, delivered to the Corporation not 
less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such termination is to 
become effective.  In the absence of such termination, an election shall remain
in effect as long as the participating Director continues to be a member of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.
     Section 10 - PAYMENT OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION.  No
payments shall be made from any account as long as the Director in whose name
such account has been established continues to be a member of the Board of
Directors provided, however, that in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency,
benefits may be payable, upon approval of the Corporation, without termination
of Board membership, but only to the extent necessary to meet the emergency. 
When a participating Director ceases to be a member of the Board, the
Corporation shall pay to him, in equal annual installments, or at his 
irrevocable election, in one lump sum, the aggregate cash account amount or 
securities deemed held therein, standing to his credit in the account 
maintained for his benefit as of the close of business on the date of the 
termination of his membership on the Board, with interest thereon, until paid 
in full, at the rate payable on Wesbanco Bank Wheeling (or other adopting 
subsidiary) Money Market Accounts for cash accounts  Such annual installments,
together with interest as above provided, shall be paid over a period of years,
with a maximum of ten years, that shall equal in number the number of full 
calendar years that such Director was a participant in the Plan.  The first of
such installments (or the lump sum distribution) shall be due and payable on 
the 2nd day of the calendar year immediately following the year in which the 
participating Director ceases to be a member of the Board, and the remaining 
installments shall be due and payable on the 2nd day of January in each 
succeeding calendar year during the period that such installments are to be 
paid.  In the event a participating Director has elected to deem to invest part
or all of his account balance or credits in Wesbanco Common Stock pursuant to 
Section 8 hereof, the Corporation shall delay any plan distribution to such 
Director for a period of six months from the date such Director ceases to be a 
member of the Board of Directors or such lesser period as may be necessary to 
comply with the provisions of Section 16b of the Securities Exchange Act

                                   4

of 1934 or the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under Section 16b.
     Section 11 - DEATH OF PARTICIPATING DIRECTOR. In the event
of the death of a participating Director prior to the receipt in full of all 
funds or common stock credited to his account, the aggregate amount so 
credited, as of the close of business on the date of such Director's death, 
shall be paid, by the Corporation, in one sum, or distributed by the 
Corporation in the event of common stock, to such Directors' surviving spouse, 
or, if there be no surviving spouse, to the estate of such Director; provided, 
that in the event a participating Director has elected to deem to invest part 
or all of his account balance or credits in Wesbanco Common Stock pursuant to 
Section 8 hereof, the Corporation shall delay any plan distribution from such 
account to such surviving spouse or such estate, as the case may be, for a 
period of six months from the date of such Director's death or such lesser 
period as necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 16b of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules promulgated by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under Section 16b.
     SECTION 12 - OPTIONAL METHODS OF PAYMENT.  In lieu of an
installment payment pursuant to Section 10, or in lieu of a lump sum payment
pursuant to Section 11, a  participating Director shall have the right, by
instrument in writing filed with the Corporation, to select an optional method 
of payment:
          (a)  Payment in one sum to such person, or in specified shares to such
     persons, as such Director shall designate; or
          (b) Payment in annual installments (if the amount to be distributed 
     is not less than $1,000 or consisting of stock with a fair market value of
     at least $1,000), with interest on the deferred cash portion until paid in
     full at the rate payable on Wesbanco Bank Wheeling (or other adopting 
     subsidiary) Money Market Accounts, to such person as such Director shall 
     designate, as follows:
               (i)  If death occurs while such Director is a member of the 
          Board, payment in annual installments, with a maximum of 10,

                                      5
<PAGE>
         
<PAGE>     6
          over a period of years that shall equal the number of full calendar
          years that such Director was a participant in the Plan.  The first of
          such installments shall be due and payable on the 2nd day of
          January in the year immediately following the year of death, and
          the remaining installments shall be due and payable on the 2nd
          day of January in each of the succeeding years during the said
          period.
               (ii)  If death occurs subsequent to the termination of such 
          Director's membership on the Board, and after the payment to 
          such Director of one or more of the annual installments provided
          in Section 10 hereof, payment of the remaining annual
          installments to such designated beneficiary.
     A participating Director must elect either of the foregoing options at 
such time as the deferral election is made pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan. 
Such election must be made by instrument in writing filed with the Corporation 
and upon such filing shall be irrevocable. In the event a Director fails to 
make a timely election, the benefits under this Plan shall be distributed in 
annual installments if paid pursuant to Section 10, or in a lump sum if paid
pursuant to Section 11.
     Section 13 - DEATH OF BENEFICIARY OF PARTICIPATING DIRECTOR. In
the event that any person who is designated as a beneficiary of a participating
Director, pursuant to Section 11 hereof, should predecease such Director, the 
designation of such person as a beneficiary shall be rendered completely 
inoperative, and of no force or effect whatsoever.  In the event that any such 
person should survive such participating Director but should die before the 
receipt of all funds payable to such person pursuant to the election by the 
said Director of the option set forth in Section 12(b) hereof, the balance of 
such funds shall be paid to the estate of such person.

participants and their beneficiaries under this Plan may not be anticipated, 
assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, pledged, encumbered, or 
subjected to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or 
equitable process.
     Section 15 - PAYMENT TO MINOR BENEFICIARIES. In the event that any person
designated as a beneficiary by a participating Director is a minor, the 
Corporation may make payment of any funds or common stock to which such minor 
is entitled hereunder by making such payment to such minor, or to the parent, 
guardian, or person having custody of, such minor, and the receipt of such 
parent, guardian or other person shall be a full and sufficient discharge to 
the Corporation for such payment. 
     Section 16 - AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF PLAN.
he Plan, as hereinabove set forth, may be amended, modified, or terminated, at 
any time, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that
any such amendment, modification, or termination shall be prospective only in 
its operation and effect, and shall not affect or prejudice the rights and 
interests of any participating Director, or other person, as fixed and 
determined prior to the adoption thereof. In the event the Plan is terminated, 
any amounts credited to the participant's account shall be distributed in 
accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
     Section 17 - EFFECTIVE DATE.  The effective date of this Plan, which is a 
successor to the previously adopted Wesbanco, Inc. Directors Deferred 
Compensation Plan and Wesbanco Bank Wheeling (formerly Wheeling Dollar Savings

                       SECOND AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT




     THIS AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, made and entered
into this 1st day of June, 1994, by and between WESBANCO BANK
FAIRMONT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, Fairmont, West Virginia, a national
banking association, hereinafter referred to as "Bank", and PATRICK L.
SCHULTE, hereinafter referred to as "Employee", and WESBANCO, INC., a
West Virginia corporation, hereinafter referred to as "Wesbanco".
     WHEREAS, Employee heretofore executed an Employment Agreement
under date of February 28, 1994, as amended by Agreement dated May 10, 1994,
providing for terms and conditions of employment with the Bank (hereinafter
collectively called "Agreement"); and
     WHEREAS, due to changes which have arisen with respect to the physical
health of Employee and in consideration of the personal well-being of Employee
in light thereof, the Employee and the Bank hereby desire to provide for certain
amendments to the Agreement to permit the Employee to retire effective June 1,
1994, to provide for the payment of certain benefits, and to make certain
modifications and amendments to said Agreement as a consequence. 
     WITNESSETH THAT:  In consideration of the mutual promises and
undertakings hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     1.  RETIREMENT.  Effective June 1, 1994, Employee shall retire from
active full time employment with the Bank and shall no longer be considered a
full time Employee thereof.  Employee shall, however, serve in the position of
Vice-Chairman of the Bank so long as he shall continue as a member of the
Board of Directors of Bank.  Additionally, effective June 1, 1994, 

                                 1
<PAGE>
<PAGE>     2

Employee shall resign as an officer of Wesbanco and shall no longer be
considered an officer of Wesbanco as of such date.  
     2.  INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.  In consideration for Employee's
services, consultation and advice, and as consideration for the modification of
his Agreement with the Bank, the Bank agrees to pay Employee, and Employee
agrees to accept, monthly payments in the gross amount of Nine Thousand Seven
Hundred Twenty-two Dollars ($9,722.00) per month over a period of thirty-six
(36) months, beginning June 1, 1994.  Said payments shall continue until all
thirty-six (36) monthly payments have been paid.  In the event of the death of
Employee prior to the expiration of such payments, such payments shall be made
to the surviving spouse of Employee and in the event of her death prior to the
expiration of such payments, to the estate of the surviving spouse of Employee. 
The parties hereto acknowledge that such payments shall not be considered as
compensation for purposes of Wesbanco's and Bank's Defined Benefit Pension
Plan or Wesbanco's Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
     3.  HOSPITALIZATION BENEFITS AND LIFE INSURANCE.  In
accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 7 of the Agreement, the Bank shall
continue to provide hospitalization coverage for Employee and Employee's
spouse in accordance with the Bank's group hospitalization plan in effect from
time to time until Employee and Employee's spouse reach age sixty-five (65).
Employee shall also continue to be covered as a retired Employee under the
existing group life policy of Wesbanco Bank Fairmont, National Association,
which the parties agree would provide continuing coverage up to one-fourth of
Employee's most recent life insurance benefit, or a minimum of Eighty-seven
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($87,500.00), to the extent coverage can be
provided under such policy.

<PAGE>
                           
<PAGE>     3

     4.  CONTINUATION AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BANKS 
AND WESBANCO.  It is anticipated that Employee shall continue as a member of 
the Board of Directors of Wesbanco and the continuing affiliate banks of the 
Wesbanco system upon which Employee presently serves.  Additionally, it is 
anticipated that Employee will continue as a member of the Executive 
Committee of Wesbanco.  In light of the payments made hereunder, and in light 
of the existing policies of Wesbanco, Employee shall not be entitled to fees 
as a member of the Board of Directors of any of the affiliate banks of 
Wesbanco, except Wesbanco Bank Fairmont, National Association, during the 
period in which Employee is receiving payments hereunder.  
     5.  SUPERSEDING AGREEMENT.  This Agreement is intended to
amend and supersede the terms and provisions of the Agreement and is intended
to be binding upon the Bank's successors and assigns, including, without
limitation, any company or corporation which may acquire substantially all of 
the Bank's assets or business, or with, or into which, Bank may be merged or
otherwise consolidated.  Provided, however, Employee may elect to rescind this 
Agreement by written notice to the Bank delivered not earlier than March 31,
1995, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate.  In the event this Agreement is
terminated as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all of the then
remaining of the 36 payments described in the Agreement (and as further referred
to in Paragraph 2 hereof) shall be paid on account of the retirement of the
Employee.
     6.  CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF WESBANCO.  While the parties
acknowledge that certain provisions of this Agreement may be unenforceable in
some respects against the Bank, pursuant to applicable banking law, it is
nonetheless the intention of the parties to create, pursuant to this Agreement,
a valid and binding Agreement with specified benefits.  As an inducement for
Employee and Bank to enter into this Agreement whereby Employee would be
retired from full time employment with the Bank, Wesbanco hereby undertakes
the independent, separate and unconditional obligation to pay the amounts which
are or may become due to Employee under this Agreement as set forth herein,
regardless of the status of the direct or indirect enforceability 

                                   3
<PAGE>
<PAGE>      4

or validity of Bank's obligation under applicable banking law to pay any or all
such amounts as may be due hereunder to Employee.  Wesbanco hereby
specifically waives any rights it may otherwise have to indemnification or
contribution from Bank or to be subrogated to the claim of Employee hereunder
in the event that such payments as are made by Wesbanco would be
unenforceable or invalid for any reason against the Bank.
     7.  MISCELLANEOUS.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement as against any one or more parties hereto, shall not
impair or affect the other provisions hereof or the enforceability of said term
or provision against the other parties hereto, and notwithstanding any such 
invalidity or unenforceability, each term or provision hereof shall remain in 
full force and effect to the full extent consistent with law.  
     8.  SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS.  The parties hereto acknowledge the
continuing understanding set forth in Section 3(A) of the Agreement that, to the
extent that the recent merger between First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. and FFB
Corporation would adversely impact the continuation of any benefit programs
affecting Employee, not otherwise herein specifically addressed, the Bank and
Wesbanco hereby covenant and agree to replace by separate insurance or
compensation, or to otherwise make Employee whole on an after tax basis with
respect to, any such benefits to which the Employee might otherwise have been
entitled but for such merger.
     9.  SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES.  The parties acknowledge that this
Second Amended Employment Agreement may result in additional Social
Security Taxes being incurred by Employee for the payments to be received by
Employee hereunder, over and above the amounts to which such payments might
have been subject by reason of the Amended Employment Agreement dated May
10, 1994.  Accordingly, Bank hereby agrees to indemnify and save Employee
harmless from any such additional social security taxes for the payments to be
made for the period from January 1, 1995, through and including April 30, 1995,
or such longer period as this Second Amended Employment Agreement remains
in effect as herein provided.

presents to be signed, and their corporate seals to be hereto affixed, and

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        NOTE 1:  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     WesBanco, Inc. and its subsidiary banks provide banking
services primarily in the West Virginia and Eastern Ohio
markets.  The significant accounting principles employed in
the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are summarized below:
Principles of consolidation:
     The Consolidated Financial Statements of WesBanco, Inc.
(the "Corporation") include the accounts of the Corporation
and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Material intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
Investment securities:
  Investments Held to Maturity:
     Investment securities consisting principally of debt
securities, which are generally held to maturity, are stated
at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts.  These securities are purchased with the intent
and ability to hold until their maturity.  Amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts are included in interest
on investment securities in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. 
  Investments Available for Sale:
     U. S. Treasury and Agency debt securities with a maturity
date extending beyond three years of the purchase date,
mortgage backed securities, corporate securities, and
marketable equity securities are classified as available for
sale.  These securities may be sold at any time based upon
management's assessment of changes in economic or financial
market conditions, interest rate or prepayment risks,
liquidity considerations, and other factors.  These
securities are stated at market value, with the market value
adjustment, net of tax, reported as a separate component of
Shareholders' Equity.  No permanent writedowns on these
securities have been required.  Amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts are included in interest on investment
securities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
  Investments Available for Trading:
     The Corporation did not have a trading portfolio during
either of the two years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.
  Gains and Losses:
     Net realized gains and losses on sale of investment
securities are included in the statement of income.  The cost
of these securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.
 Loans:
     Interest is accrued as earned except where doubt exists as
to collectability, in which case recognition of income is
discontinued.  Net loan fees and deferrable costs are not
material.
Reserve for possible loan losses:
     The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a
level considered adequate by management to provide for
potential loan losses.  The reserve is increased by
provisions charged to operating expenses and reduced by loan
losses net of recoveries.  The amount of  reserve is based on
management's evaluation of the loan portfolio, as well as
prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, past loan
loss experience, current delinquency factors, changes in the
character of the loan portfolio, specific problem loans and
other relevant factors.
Bank premises and equipment:
     Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation.  Bank premises and equipment are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using either
the straight-line or an accelerated method.  Useful lives are
revised when a change in life expectancy becomes apparent.
     Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense and
betterments are capitalized.  Gains and losses on bank
premises and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of, are
charged to expense when incurred.
Income taxes:
     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS)
No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the expected future tax consequences attributable  to
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities and their tax bases.  In addition, such
deferred tax asset and liability amounts are adjusted for the
effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates.  The
Corporation's principal temporary differences relate to the
reserve for possible loan losses, the market value adjustment
on investments available for sale, depreciation and
postretirement benefits including pension expense and 
accretion of discounts on investment securities.  
Earnings per share:
     Earnings per share are calculated based upon dividing net
income, less preferred stock dividends and accretion, by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year, retroactively adjusted for the April 1993
two for one stock split.  Conversion of the preferred stock
to common stock, in accordance with the conversion
requirements, would increase outstanding

                  NOTE 1:  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
common shares by approximately 113,443 shares.  The fully
dilutive effect of preferred stock is less than 3%.
Trust department:
     Assets held by the subsidiary banks in fiduciary or agency
capacities for their customers are not included as assets in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Trust fees are
reported on the cash basis of accounting in accordance with
customary banking practice.  Reporting of trust income on an
accrual basis would not materially affect net income. 
Certain trust assets are held on deposit at subsidiary banks.
Statement of cash flows:
     For the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash and due from banks, and Federal
funds sold.  Generally, Federal funds are sold for one day
periods.
New accounting standards to be adopted:
     The following financial accounting standards will be
implemented by WesBanco, Inc. on January 1, 1995.
     FAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan," requires that certain impaired loans be measured based
on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical
expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 
FAS No. 114 is effective for periods beginning after December
15, 1994 and the Corporation anticipates the adoption of  FAS
No. 114 will not have a material impact on the financial
condition or results of operations of the Corporation.
     FAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures" amends FAS No. 114
and eliminates its provisions regarding how a creditor should
report income on an impaired loan.  FAS No. 118 also
clarifies disclosure requirements.  FAS No. 118 is effective
for periods beginning after December 31, 1994.

                    NOTE 2:  ACQUISITIONS  AND MERGERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     On February 28, 1994, WesBanco, Inc. acquired First
Fidelity Bancorp, Inc. which had total assets as of the
acquisition date of approximately $309,911,000.  In
accordance with terms of the merger, WesBanco issued
2,093,815 shares of common stock and 10,000 shares of
redeemable preferred stock.  WesBanco retired and used as
part of the transaction 40,000 shares of treasury stock.  The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and
accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of First Fidelity Bancorp for all periods
presented.  For the two months ended February 28, 1994
(unaudited), First Fidelity Bancorp had net income of
$611,000 and net interest income of $2,257,000 and WesBanco
had net income of $2,461,000 and net interest income of
$6,786,000.
     On July 17, 1992, WesBanco, Inc. acquired First National
Bank of Barnesville, which had total assets of $143,706,000
as of the acquisition date.  In accordance with the terms of
the merger, WesBanco issued 600,000 shares of common stock
for all of the First National Bank of Barnesville's stock. 
The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests
and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of First National Bank of Barnesville
for all periods presented.

             NOTE 3:  RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Federal Reserve regulations require depository
institutions to maintain cash reserves with the Federal
Reserve Bank.  The average amounts of required reserve
balances were approximately $6,519,000 and $7,392,000 during
1994 and 1993, respectively.

                     NOTE 4: LOANS (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Most lending is with customers who are located within the
state of West Virginia and Eastern Ohio.  There is no
significant concentration of credit risk by industry or by
individual borrowers, no significant exposure to highly
leveraged loan transactions, nor any foreign loans.  Loans
aggregating $4,517,000, and $9,477,000 were classified as
renegotiated or nonaccrual as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Interest and fees on loans would have been
increased by approximately $715,000, $593,000 and $437,000
for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, if these
loans had earned their stated interest for the entire year. 
The amount of interest included in net interest income from
renegotiated and nonaccrual loans is $284,000, $629,000 and
$451,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The subsidiary banks, in the ordinary
course of business, grant loans to related parties at terms
which do not vary from terms that would have been required if
the transactions had been with unrelated parties. 
Indebtedness of related parties aggregated approximately
$42,925,000, $39,934,000 and $32,354,000 as of December 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Activity for the year
ended December 31, 1994 is summarized as follows:  (in

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted the
provisions of FAS No. 115.  Under the new rules, debt
securities for which the company has both the positive intent
and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized
cost.  Debt securities that the company does not have the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and all
marketable equity securities are classified as available for
sale and carried at fair value.  The market value adjustment
on securities classified as available for sale is carried as
a separate component of shareholders' equity.  In accordance
with FAS No. 115 retroactive restatement has not been
applied.  The following is a summary of held-to-maturity
securities and available-for-sale securities:

     Some officers and directors (including their affiliates, families

and its subsidiaries are customers of those subsidiaries and have had,
and are expected to have, transactions with the subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business.  In addition, some officers and directors
are also officers and directors of corporations which are customers of
the banks and have had, and are expected to have, transactions with
the banks in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of
management, such transactions are consistent with prudent banking
practices and are within applicable banking regulations.

          NOTE 6:  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES (CONTINUED)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The amount of transactions with related parties including loans and
legal fees aggregated approximately $43,345,000 at December 31, 1994. 
These related party transactions equal 28% of shareholders' equity at
December 31, 1994.

        NOTE 7:  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Individual banks within the Corporation incur off-balance-sheet
risks in the normal course of business in order to meet financing
needs of their customers.  These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  Those
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and
interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial
statements.
     In the normal course of business, there are outstanding, various
commitments to extend credit approximating $50,142,000 and standby
letters of credit of $7,959,000 as of December 31, 1994.
     The banks' exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual
amount of those instruments.  The banks use the same credit and
collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as for all other lending.  Collateral which secures these types of
commitments is the same type as collateral for other types of lending,
such as accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets.
     Commitments to extend credit are commitments to lend to a customer
as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
loan agreement.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements.  The banks evaluate each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis.
     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. 
Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
borrowing arrangements, including normal business activities, bond
financing and similar transactions.  The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in
extending loans to customers.  Collateral securing these types of
transactions is similar to collateral securing the banks' commercial
loans.

     Real estate acquired in satisfaction of a loan and in-substance
foreclosures are reported in other assets.  Properties acquired by
foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and properties classified
as in-substance foreclosures are transferred to other assets and
recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraisal
value at the date actually or constructively received.  Losses arising
at the time of acquisition of such property are charged against the
reserve for possible loan losses.
     The total other real estate including in-substance foreclosures was
$4,278,000 and $2,558,000 as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

                NOTE 12:  ESOP AND LONG TERM BORROWINGS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Corporation has a qualified noncontributory Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Trust Agreement for the purpose of investing
in the common stock of WesBanco on behalf of its employees. 
Currently, the ESOP Trust holds 96,283 shares of WesBanco common
stock.  With the exception of First Fidelity employees, substantially
all employees are included in this plan.  It is anticipated that First
Fidelity employees will join the plan January 1, 1995.  Approximately
61,738 shares of stock were allocated to specific employee accounts as
of December 31, 1994.
     During September 1992, the WesBanco ESOP Trust entered into a
revolving loan agreement with an independent financial institution
providing for a line of credit in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000
to facilitate purchases of WesBanco common stock in the open market. 
During 1994, the ESOP Trust utilized the line of credit to purchase an
additional 10,000 shares of stock for $246,250, pledging those shares
as collateral.  The loan bears interest at a rate equal to the
lender's base rate and requires annual repayments of principal equal
to 20% of the balance at January 1 of each year.  The loan has a final
maturity date of 5 years from date of inception.  The $1,000,000
revolving line of credit has a balance of $849,000 as of December 31,
1994.
     Total contributions to the ESOP during 1994 were $231,956, which
included cash contributions of $183,456 and an additional stock
contribution valued at $48,500.  Contributions during 1993 and 1992
were $246,000 and $180,000, respectively.  Each year's contributions
approximated the required loan payments.  Effective January 1, 1994,
the Corporation adopted Statement of Position No. 93-6, which requires
dividends on unallocated shares to be expensed, and has determined
that these additional requirements have no material effect for 1994.

                   NOTE 13:  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     On February 28, 1994, WesBanco acquired First Fidelity Bancorp
increasing the number of shares of common stock outstanding to
8,682,103 as of December 31, 1994.  WesBanco retired 40,000 shares of
treasury stock in connection with the merger.  Treasury shares of
First Fidelity were considered as retired shares in the year of
acquisition.  First Fidelity had a dividend reinvestment plan which
was replaced by the WesBanco plan after the merger.
     On April 21, 1993, the shareholders of the Corporation approved a
two-for-one stock split effective April 22, 1993, an increase in the
authorized common shares from 10 million to 25 million shares, a
change in common stock par value from $4.1666 to $2.0833 per share and
an increase in the authorized nonredeemable preferred stock from
100,000 shares to 1 million with no par value.   All shares and per
share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split.

     NOTE 14:  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     In accordance with the requirements of FAS No. 107, "Disclosure
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," fair value disclosure
estimates are being made for like kinds of financial instruments. 
Fair value estimates are based on  present value of expected future
cash flows, quoted market prices of similar financial instruments, if
available, and other valuation techniques.  These valuations are
significantly affected by the discount rates, cash flow assumptions,
and risk assumptions used.  Therefore, the fair value estimates may
not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not
intended to reflect the proceeds that may be realizable in an
immediate settlement of the instruments.  
      FAS No. 107 excludes certain items from the disclosure requirements,
and accordingly, the aggregate fair value of amounts presented do not
represent the underlying value of the Corporation.  Management does
not have the intention to dispose of a significant portion of its
financial instruments and, therefore, the unrealized gains or losses
should not be interpreted as a forecast of future earnings and cash
flows.
      The following table represents the estimates of fair value of
financial instruments: (in thousands)

(1)  With the adoption of FAS No. 115, the carrying amount of investment 
securities includes investment securities held-to-maturity at a cost of 
$274,173 and investment securities available-for-sale at their fair value of 
$202,705.

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair
value of like kinds of financial instruments:
Cash and Short-Term Investments:
     The carrying amount for cash and short-term investments is a
reasonable estimate of fair value.  Short-term investments consist of
Federal funds sold.
Investment Securities:
     Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market
prices, if available.  If market prices are not available, then quoted
market prices of similar instruments are used.
Net Loans:
     Fair values for loans with interest rates that fluctuate as current
rates change are generally valued at carrying amounts.  The fair
values for residential mortgage loans are based on quoted market
prices of securitized financial instruments, adjusted for remaining
maturity and differences in loan characteristics.  Fair values of
commercial real estate, construction and consumer loans are based on a
discounted value of the estimated future cash flows expected to be
received.  The current interest rates applied in the discounted cash
flow method reflect rates used to price new loans of similar type,
adjusted for relative risk and remaining maturity.  The fair value of
credit cards is estimated based on the anticipated average cost of
soliciting a new account and the present credit quality of the
outstanding balances.  For nonaccrual loans, fair value is estimated
by discounting expected future principal cash flows only.
Deposits:
     The carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair
value for demand and savings deposits and other variable rate deposit
accounts.  The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is
estimated by a discounted cash flow method using the rates currently
offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Short-Term Borrowings:
     For short-term borrowings, which include Federal funds purchased,
repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, the carrying
amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Redeemable Preferred Stock:
     The fair value of redeemable preferred stock is estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses based on estimated incremental borrowing
rates for similar types of arrangements.
Off-Balance Sheet Instruments:
     The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently
charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit standing of
the counterparties.  The amount of fees currently charged on
commitments are determined to be insignificant and therefore the fair
value and carrying value of off-balance sheet instruments are not
shown.

                      NOTE 15:  PENSION BENEFITS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1994, substantially all employees are participants
in either the WesBanco or First Fidelity defined benefit pension
plans. These plans cover those employees who satisfy minimum age and
length of service requirements.  Benefits of the WesBanco defined
benefit plan are generally based on the years of service and the
employee's compensation during the last five years of employment.  The
WesBanco plan's funding policy has been to contribute annually the
maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. 
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed
to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the
future.
     First Fidelity Bancorp's defined benefit plan formula uses length of
service and the employees compensation to determine benefits. 
Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to
employee service to date and for those benefits expected to be earned
in the future.  All assets and liabilities of First Fidelity Bancorp's
pension plan are expected to be merged into the WesBanco plan no later
than December 31, 1996.
     As of January 1, 1993, all assets and liabilities of the WesBanco
Barnesville (formerly First National Bank of Barnesville) and WesBanco
Kingwood (formerly Albright National Bank) pension plans were merged
into the WesBanco plan.  
     Prior to the merger, Barnesville and Kingwood maintained separate
defined benefit pension plans. Each plan provided a defined benefit
that was determined based on years of service and the employee's
compensation during final years of employment.
     WesBanco Barnesville contributions to its defined benefit plan
reflected benefits attributed to employee's services to date.  Plan
assets consisted exclusively of insurance annuity contracts.  Payment
of retirement benefits were funded solely through these annuity
contracts.
     WesBanco Kingwood funded its defined benefit plan at the maximum
allowable amount and also had a defined contribution 401K plan
covering substantially all of its employees.  The employer matched
employee deferrals at 50% of the deferral up to a maximum of 4% of the
employee's salary.  Funding to this plan was discontinued as of
December 31, 1992.

     WesBanco currently provides a death benefit of $5,000 and a
contributory health insurance plan for all retirees.  WesBanco's
contribution toward health insurance is a fixed amount which may be
changed at its sole discretion.
     In 1992 the Corporation adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  This statement
generally requires accrual accounting for nonpension postretirement
benefits.   With the adoption of FAS No. 106 the Corporation
recognized a one time non-cash charge of $943,947 before the
applicable income tax benefit of $351,453.  The charge to earnings has
been accounted for as a change in accounting principle.

     Postretirement benefits are funded as incurred resulting in cash
payments of approximately $51,000, $50,000 and $48,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     The Corporation's portion of the cost of health care benefits is
expected to increase during 1995.  An assumption of a 1% per year
increase in the benefit level would increase the expense in health
care benefits by $70,000 or  57% for the year ended 1994 and increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $216,000 or  20%
as of December 31, 1994.
     First Fidelity Bancorp had no significant nonpension postretirement
benefits for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992.  First Fidelity Bancorp's
postretirement benefits will be included with WesBanco as of January
1, 1995.  The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the
First Fidelity employees will approximate $340,411.

                          NOTE 18:  INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     On January 1, 1993 the Corporation adopted FAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes."  The adoption of FAS 109 changed the Corporation's
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method (APB
11) to an asset and liability approach. The asset and liability
approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and
liabilities.  Implementation of FAS No. 109 did not have a material
effect upon the reported financial position or results of operations
of the Corporation.
     Pre-tax income from operations for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992 was $21,477,000, $24,429,000 and $22,050,000,
respectively.  A reconciliation of the Federal Statutory tax rate to
the reported effective tax rate is as follows:

     The operations of the subsidiary banks are subject to Federal and
state statutes which limit the banks' ability to pay dividends or
otherwise transfer funds to the Parent Company.  At December 31, 1994 the 
banks, without prior approval from the regulators, could have distributed 
dividends of approximately $17,239,000.

                 NOTE 20:  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     In connection with the acquisition of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc.
on February 28, 1994, 10,000 shares of 8% cumulative redeemable
preferred stock of First Fidelity were converted to WesBanco
redeemable preferred stock.  On the date of original issuance,
November 1, 1990, the First Fidelity redeemable preferred stock had a
par value of $1.25 per share and a fair market value of $174 per
share.  Periodic accretion using the straight-line method which
approximates the interest method will increase stock to $190 per share
by the redemption date.  The accretion is charged against retained
earnings.  Five years after  issuance and for a 30-day period (the
redemption period) the cumulative preferred stock may be redeemed by
the Corporation at a redemption price of $190.  The holder of the
cumulative preferred stock has the option to accept the redemption
price or convert the stock into shares of WesBanco common stock. 
Holders of the cumulative preferred stock who do not surrender their
shares or accept the redemption price  by the  end of the redemption
period will have their shares automatically converted into 11.43
shares of WesBanco common stock per one share of redeemable preferred
stock, based on a formula described in the acquisition document. 
There were no shares purchased or retired during 1993 and 1992. 
During 1994, 75 shares were purchased and retired.  The remaining
shares will be redeemed or converted into WesBanco common stock during
1995.  The redeemable preferred shareholders have liquidation rights
equaling $190.00 per share plus any unpaid cumulative dividends.

         MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The financial statements and the information pertaining to those
statements are the responsibility of management.  The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, applied on a consistent basis.
     The accounting systems of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
include internal controls and procedures which provide reasonable
assurance as to the reliability of the financial records.  Internal
control systems are generally supported by written policies and
procedures.  The internal auditing staff systematically performs
audits of operations, reviews procedures, monitors adherence to bank
policies and submits written audit reports to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of only
outside directors.  The Audit Committee meets regularly with
management, internal audit and our independent accountants to review
accounting, auditing and financial matters.  The internal auditors,
Federal and State examiners, and Price Waterhouse LLP have full access
to the Audit Committee to discuss any appropriate matters.
     Independent accountants provide an objective review of management's
discharge of its financial responsibilities relating to the
preparation of the financial statements. The independent accountant's
report is based on an audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  This report expresses an informed judgement as to
whether management's financial statements present fairly, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the
Corporation's financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.




PRICE WATERHOUSE, LLP

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WESBANCO, INC.

     In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
auditors, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, of changes in shareholders' equity
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of WesBanco, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the
Corporation) at December 31, 1994, and 1993, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the 3 years in the period
ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management; our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.  We did not audit the financial statements of First Fidelity
Bancorp, Inc. for 1993 and 1992, which statements reflect total assets
of $307,965,000 at December 31, 1993, and net interest income of
$13,913,000 and $14,013,000 for the years ended December 31,1993 and
1992, respectively.  Those statements were audited by other auditors
whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc., for 1993 and 1992, is based solely on
the report of the other auditors.   We conducted our audits of the
consolidated statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits and the
report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for the opinion
expressed above. 
     As discussed in Note 5, Note 18 and Note 16, the Corporation adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," during 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

                          EARNINGS SUMMARY
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     WesBanco reported net income of $15,697,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1994 as compared to $17,842,000 and $15,879,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992.  The decline in net income of
12.0% between 1994 and 1993 is attributed to a loan write-down with an
after-tax effect on net income of approximately $2,469,000 or $ .29
per share.  Excluding the after-tax effect of the write-down,  net
income would have exceeded 1993 results.  
     Net income increased 12.4% between 1993 and 1992 due primarily to an
increase in net interest income.  Return on assets (ROA) and return on
equity (ROE) were 1.17% and 9.99% for the year ending December 31,
1994, respectively.  ROA was 1.34% for the year ending December 31,
1993 as compared to 1.22% for the same time period in 1992.  ROE was
11.70% for the year ending December 31, 1993 and 11.13% for the same
time period in 1992.  During 1992, WesBanco adopted a new accounting
requirement for employee postretirement benefits, recognizing the
after tax cumulative effect as a one-time noncash charge of $592,000.  

     The following table presents a comparative average balance sheet and
interest rate analysis.  The analysis is used for discussion of net
interest income and balance sheet components which follow.

                            NET INTEREST INCOME
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Net interest income is interest income on all interest earning
assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources used to
support such assets.  On a fully taxable-equivalent basis, net
interest income for 1994 increased $252,000 or .4% following a 5.2%
increase in 1993 over 1992.  The taxable equivalent basis is
calculated on non-taxable investment securities using a tax rate of
34.3% for 1994 and 1993 and 34% for 1992.
     The increase in net interest income during 1994 was due to a
moderate  .7% increase in average earning assets.  In 1993, net
interest income increased due to a 2.5% increase in average earning
assets combined with a 12 basis point increase in the net taxable
equivalent yield on earning assets.
     The net yield, which is calculated as net interest income expressed
as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.8% for 1994 and 1993
up from 4.7% for 1992.  The stability in the net yield since 1992
indicates that the Corporation has been able to manage its earning
asset yields in relation to rates paid on interest bearing
liabilities.  During the past three years, nationwide bank base
lending rates ranged from a high of 8.5% to a low of 6.0% during 1994
and were at 6.0% during 1993 and 1992.
     The decline in interest rates during 1993 and early 1994 caused the
average earning asset yield to decrease to 7.3% during 1994 from 7.7%
and 8.4% for 1993 and 1992, respectively.  During the same period the
average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to 3.0% in
1994 from 3.4% in 1993 and 4.2% in 1992.

                         INVESTMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     As of January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted FAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." 
Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 115, classification of available for
sale securities included U.S. Treasury and Agency debt securities with
a call or maturity of one year or less, corporate securities and
marketable equity securities.  The adoption of FAS No. 115, changed
the classification of investment securities available for sale to
include Treasury and Agencies purchased with final maturities
extending beyond three years, corporate securities, mortgage-backed
securities and marketable equity securities.
     The market value adjustment resulting from the adoption of FAS No.
115 as of January 1, 1994 reflected a net unrealized gain on
securities classified as available for sale, increasing investments by
$5,259,000 and shareholders' equity, net of tax, by $3,182,000.  By
December 31, 1994, due to the increase in interest rates during the 
second half of the year, the market value adjustment reflected a net
unrealized loss on available for sale securities, decreasing
investment securities by $7,342,000 and shareholders' equity, net of
tax, by $4,482,000.  The unrealized net loss on investments available
for sale represents a temporary market value fluctuation which may
change depending upon general changes in market rates.  If these
securities are held until their respective maturity date, no net loss
would be realized.
     WesBanco can adjust the volatility of the market value adjustment by
managing both the volume of securities classified as available for
sale and average maturities.  Available for sale securities comprise 
42% of total investment securities and have an average maturity of 3.0
years at December 31, 1994.
     Exclusive of the market value adjustment, investment securities
averaged $501,593,000 during 1994, a decrease of $4,297,000 or .8%
over 1993.  During 1993 average investments increased $42,024,000 or
9.1% over 1992.  The  1994 decrease was required to fund loan growth
which exceeded deposit growth during the year.  The growth in average
investments during 1993 is attributable to the investment of funds
generated from a decrease in Federal funds and growth in average
deposits.
     During 1994 and 1993, as loan demand exceeded deposit growth,
matured, called or sold investment securities represented a primary
source of liquidity.  Investment securities with a total carrying
value of $98,939,000 either matured or were called during 1994 as
compared to $145,657,000 during 1993.  Investment securities of
$67,002,000 and $37,577,000 were sold during 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  As a result, 35% of the total investments repriced
during 1994 as compared to 37% during the previous year.  
      Average non-taxable  securities, comprised of municipal bonds,
increased by $12,713,000 during 1994 and $21,098,000 during 1993. On a
taxable equivalent basis these securities provide the highest yield in
the investment portfolio.  Accordingly, the Corporation will continue
to take advantage of market opportunities to further increase
investments in the municipal sector which now comprises 25% of total
securities.  Corporate securities comprise less than 1% of investment
securities.  The average maturity of investment securities at December
31, 1994 was 3.1 years as compared to 3.6 years and 3.5 years for the
years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

                           INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      During 1995, the investment portfolio will be managed to maintain
sufficient levels of Federal funds and short-term investments to
provide liquidity for loan commitments and deposit withdrawals.
Management believes that the scheduled payments in both the loan and
investment portfolios will provide for adequate liquidity. 
Approximately $101,619,000 or 21% of total investment securities are
expected to mature during 1995 providing for potential liquidity
needs.
      Investment income declined by $2,439,000 during 1994 after declining
by $1,866,000 during 1993 reflecting a decrease in the average rates
earned on securities.  The average yield on taxable securities,
excluding the effects of the market value adjustment on available for
sale securities, was 5.8% for 1994 as compared to 6.2% for 1993 and
7.2% for 1992.  The average yield on nontaxable securities, not
adjusted for tax equivalency, was 5.5% for 1994 as compared to 5.9%
for 1993 and 6.6% for 1992.  Net realized securities gains amounted to
$366,000 in 1994 as compared to $164,000 and $404,000 in 1993 and
1992, respectively.  Gains and losses on securities are dependent upon
the changing bond market conditions and the composition of the
securities.
                                  LOANS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     WesBanco has continued its trend of steady loan growth during 1994
as loans outstanding (total loans, net of unearned income), increased
$27,303,000 or 3.7% to $773,452,000 as of December 31, 1994 after a
growth of $35,499,000 or 5.0% to $746,149,000 as of December 31, 1993. 
The loan growth can be attributed to mortgage and consumer loans which
increased $19,920,000 and $12,535,000, respectively.   This represents
individual portfolio increases of 5.5% for both mortgage and consumer
loans.  The increase in mortgage loans was largely due to consumers
refinancing homes to take advantage of the lower interest rates
through mid 1994.  The increase in consumer loans was the result of
offering attractive rates on automobile loans. Commercial loans
decreased 2% during 1994 and 2.9% during 1993.  In general, the
decline in commercial loan balances can be attributed to the
uncertainty of the Upper Ohio Valley economy.  The commercial loan
decline in 1994 was further affected by a write-down approximating
$4,000,000 on a collateralized commercial loan which encountered
financial problems.  As of December 31, 1994, commercial loans
comprise 20% of the loan portfolio, real estate secured loans comprise
49% and consumer-type loans comprise 31%.  WesBanco's lending limit to
one customer was $24,209,000 as of December 31, 1994.
     Reflecting a lower interest rate environment, interest on loans
declined $1,090,000 or 1.7% during 1994 after declining $2,672,000 or
4.0% during 1993. The average yield earned on the loan portfolio
during 1994 was 8.5% as compared to 8.9% and 9.6% during 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The majority of commercial and mortgage loans
reprice monthly or annually based on changes in national indices such
as the prime rate or the one year U.S. Treasury Bill rate.
     Showing some improvement over last year, loans classified as
nonaccrual or renegotiated reduced to $4,517,000 or .6% of loans
outstanding as of December 31, 1994 as compared to $9,477,000 or 1.3%
as of December 31, 1993.  During 1994, nonaccrual loans declined by
$4,896,000 to $4,413,000 and renegotiated loans declined by $64,000 to
$104,000.  The decline in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to a
commercial real estate loan totaling $3,823,000 which was taken off of
nonaccrual status. All nonaccrual loans are secured by collateral
believed to have adequate market values to protect against significant
losses. The Corporation continues to monitor the nonperforming assets
to ensure against deterioration in collateral values.
     Net chargeoffs and the provision for possible loan losses in 1994
increased primarily due to a write-off of a commercial real estate
loan approximating $4,000,000.   Net loan chargeoffs were $5,589,000
in 1994 as compared to $2,016,000 in 1993 and $2,497,000 in 1992. The
provision for possible loan losses increased to $6,055,000 in 1994
from $3,229,000 and $3,279,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
reserve for possible loan losses to loans outstanding was 1.59% as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993.  Net loan chargeoffs were 45% and 17% of
the reserve as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
reserve for possible loan losses as of December 31, 1994 is considered
to be adequate to provide for future losses in the loan portfolio.  In
determining the adequacy of the reserve for possible loan losses, the
Corporation meets the minimum guidelines as set forth by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency.  During 1994, the amount charged to
earnings was based on periodic management evaluations of the loan
portfolio as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions,
net loans charged off, past loan experiences, current delinquency
factors, changes in the character of the loan portfolio, specific
problem loans and other factors.  On January 1, 1995, WesBanco will
adopt FAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"
which prescribes additional requirements for determining the
components of the reserve for possible loan losses.

                              DEPOSITS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total average deposits increased approximately $10,078,000 to
$1,115,193,000 during 1994, a 1% increase over 1993, following an
increase of approximately $20,193,000 or 1.9% between 1993 and 1992. 
The moderation of deposit growth during 1994 can be attributed to the
competition for funds in a low interest rate environment which has
intensified as customers seek higher yielding alternatives and nonbank
products. The declines in market interest rates during 1993 and early
1994 caused banks to lower their rates paid on deposit accounts. 
Average rates paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to 3.4%
during 1994 as compared to 3.8% and 4.7% during 1993 and 1992,
respectively.
     Contributing further to the lower average rates has been a shift
from certificates of deposit into non-term deposit products.  During
1994, certificates of deposit comprised 35% of average deposits, down
from 42% in 1992.  This shift in deposits reflects a growing consumer
preference for liquidity in a low interest rate environment.
     During the second half of 1994, market interest rates rose steadily
throughout the remainder of the year.  Although WesBanco responded by
increasing deposit rates in the fourth quarter, the competition for
funds in the local market caused a decline in deposit balances during
this period.  Reflecting this decline, total deposits decreased to
$1,109,219,000 as of December 31, 1994 from $1,113,604,000 as of
December 31, 1993.
     Total interest expense on deposits decreased $3,764,000 or 10.1%
during 1994 as compared to $8,585,000 or 18.7% during 1993.  The
decrease in interest expense can be attributed to a decline in
interest rates through early 1994 and a shift in balances to non-term
deposit accounts.

                             CAPITAL ADEQUACY
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     On December 31, 1994 shareholders' equity totaled $156,630,000, a
decline of $886,000 from 1993.  The decrease can be attributed to the
acquisition of treasury stock and the inclusion of the market value
adjustment on investments available for sale, net of tax, under the
requirements of FAS No. 115.  
     Reflecting strong capital levels, the Corporation implemented a
$7,000,000 stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 1994
to make available shares for general corporate purposes.  In addition,
WesBanco recognized two cash dividend increases during 1994. 
Effective April 1, 1994 the quarterly dividend rate was increased 5%
to $ .21 from $ .20 per share and increased again on October 1, 1994
to $ .22 per share.  The  increase in the dividend rate, combined with
a decline in net income during 1994, resulted in a significant
increase in the dividend payout ratio to 47% from 37% in 1993.
     The Corporation's primary capital to asset ratio was 12.4% as of
December 31, 1994 and 12.5% as of December 31, 1993.  The company is
subject to risk-based capital guidelines that measure capital relative
to risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. 
Capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board require bank
holding companies to have a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of
8%, with at least half of total capital in the form of Tier 1 capital. 
In addition, a leverage ratio is being used in connection with the
risk-based capital standards and defined as Tier 1 capital divided by
total assets.  The minimum leverage ratio under this standard is 3%. 
Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios as well as the leverage
ratio of the Corporation and its subsidiaries exceed the minimum
regulatory levels.  These capital adequacy ratios are summarized as
follows:

              INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Interest rate management measures the sensitivity of net interest
earnings to changes in the level of interest rates.  As interest rates
change in the market, rates earned on interest earning assets and
rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities do not necessarily move
concurrently.  Differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed
rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities or
because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing of
rate changes.
     The affiliate banks review their interest rate sensitivity on a
periodic basis.  The analysis presented below classifies interest
earning assets and interest bearing liabilities into maturity
categories and measures the differences between maturing assets and
liabilities in each category (interest sensitivity gap).  At December
31, 1994, the Corporation was in a liability sensitive position as
summarized in the table below (in thousands):

(1)  Securities are categorized above by expected maturity at amortized cost.

     The changing interest rate environment can substantially impact the
Corporation's net interest income and profitability.   The
Asset/Liability Committee believes the Corporation's interest
sensitivity position provides for a changing interest rate
environment.  During the next twelve months, the Corporation's net
interest sensitivity position is $(529,751,000), $12,188,000, $
31,515,000 and $ 50,358,000 during the periods under three months,
three to six months, six to nine months and nine months to one year,
respectively.  The liability sensitive position in the under three
month time period is caused by savings and NOW deposits, which
formerly had fixed interest rates are now subject to management's
discretion.  Rates on these types of deposits ranged from 2.5% to 3.0%
during 1994 as compared to 2.5% to 3.5% during 1993.
     The Corporation's short-term liability sensitive position would
suggest exposure of the net interest margin to changing interest
rates.  An increase in interest rates may cause a decline in the net
interest margin while decreasing interest rates may have the opposite
effect. The Corporation may reduce its short-term liability sensitive
position making its net interest margin less vulnerable to rising
interest rates by shortening asset maturities, primarily through
Federal Funds and investment maturities.  In addition, management may
emphasize attracting longer-term deposits by holding the rates paid on
savings and NOW accounts at a fixed level and increasing rates on term
certificates of deposit.
     The Corporation manages its liquidity position to ensure that
sufficient funds are available to meet customer needs for borrowing
and deposit withdrawals.  The Corporation's primary source of
liquidity is its strong core deposit base.  The growth in deposits is
somewhat dependent upon interest rates of competitive financial
instruments.  Short-term liquidity is maintained through the use of
Federal funds sold, which represent one day investments, and cash
balances.  As of December 31, 1994, Federal funds sold and cash
balances were $65,310,000 or 4.8% of total assets as compared to
$76,952,000 or 5.4% of total assets as of December 31, 1993. 
Additional short-term liquidity is maintained through investments with
expected maturities of less than one year which, during 1995,
approximate $101,619,000 or 7.5% of total assets.  During 1994
investment maturities and calls of $98,939,000 became available for
reinvestment.  
     As of December 31, 1994 the Corporation had outstanding commitments
to extend credit in the ordinary course of business approximating
$50,142,000.  On a

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
historical basis only a small portion of these commitments result in
expended funds.
     The Corporation has commitments for planned additions to fixed
assets of approximately $1,500,000 during 1995 to replace an existing
outdated branch office and for data processing equipment. The
Corporation has adequate liquidity to provide for these planned
additions. 

                               OTHER INCOME
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Trust fee income was $4,425,000 for 1994, an increase of $265,000 or
6.4% over 1993.  Trust fee income increased $224,000 or 5.7% between
1993 and 1992.  This steady increase in trust fees can be attributed
to the increased number of accounts under administration. The number
of accounts managed increased by 280 during 1994 after an increase of
223 accounts in 1993 and 187 accounts in 1992.  The market value of
assets held by the Trust Department at December 31, 1994 approximates
$1,113,416,000 as compared to $1,150,968,000 at December 31, 1993. 
The decline in market value was due to the general declines in the
bond and stock markets.  Service charges and other income was
$5,037,000 for 1994, an increase of $224,000 over 1993.  Service
charges and other income increased $265,000 between 1993 and 1992. 
The increase during 1994 and 1993 was due to the increases in the fees
associated with deposit accounts.

                         OTHER EXPENSES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Personnel expenses represented the largest single increase in non-
interest expenses.  Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased
$1,239,000 or 6.1% in 1994 as compared to an increase of $884,000 or
4.5% in 1993.  Employee salary and fringe benefit expenses increased
during 1994 and 1993 due to normal salary adjustments, increased
payroll taxes, net periodic pension costs, increased cost of health
insurance and the recognition of the entire employment contracts for
two First Fidelity executive officers.  There were 775 full time
equivalent employees at December 31, 1994 and 1993 as compared to 761
at December 31, 1992.  While internal consolidation reduced staffing
levels in different areas of the affiliate banks, staffing levels were
increased in other areas to improve customer service and to comply
with new regulatory requirements.  Future personnel changes will occur
through operational efficiencies obtained from the planned affiliate
bank consolidations.
     Occupancy and equipment expense decreased $108,000 to $4,330,000
during 1994 as compared to a decrease of $21,000 during 1993. 
Occupancy and equipment expense was $4,438,000 and $4,459,000 during
1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Other operating expenses decreased $228,000 or 1.7% to $13,590,000
in 1994 and increased $572,000 or 4.3% during 1993.  The decline in
other operating expenses can be attributed to improved operational
efficiencies through internal consolidations of affiliate banks. 
During 1992, WesBanco consisted of fifteen subsidiary banks.  Internal
consolidations reduced the number of subsidiary banks to thirteen
during 1993 and to ten during 1994.  Affiliate bank consolidations
will continue throughout 1995 with an additional three banks to be
merged into other WesBanco subsidiaries.  Regarding the operating
expense increase during 1993, $230,000 or 40% of the increase was due
to marketing expenses.  The increase in marketing expenses can be
attributed to the cost of the name change campaign during 1993 at our
two most recently acquired affiliates and also the increase in image
and product advertising throughout the Corporation. 

                               INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Federal income tax expense decreased $567,000 to $4,940,000 during
1994 and increased $274,000 to $5,507,000 during 1993.  The decrease
in tax expense for 1994 is affected primarily by the decrease  in
pretax earnings and the level of nontaxable income.  In 1993, the tax
expense increased due to increased pretax earnings.
     The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 27% for 1994 and 1993
as compared to 28% for 1992.  The changes in the effective tax rate
are representative of the change in the level of nontaxable income and
to a lesser extent the changing state tax rates.  The alternative
minimum tax will affect WesBanco only if a significant amount of non-
taxable income exists when compared to taxable income.
     During 1993, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1993 which included increasing certain corporate income tax rates
retroactive to January 1, 1993.  The change in the Corporate tax rate
was increased to 35% from 34% for Corporations with income over
$15,000,000.

                       INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Corporation adopted FAS No. 109 during 1993.  See Footnote 18 on
Income Taxes for disclosures regarding FAS No. 109.
     The State of West Virginia has a corporate net income tax based upon
Federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items not subject to
state taxation.  The state tax rate for 1994 was 9.0%.  State income
tax included in the provision for income taxes was $840,000 for 1994
as compared to $1,080,000 and $939,000 for 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  The State of Ohio does not have a corporate income tax,
but rather, businesses are subject to an Ohio corporate franchise tax
which is included in other operating expenses.  

                           ACQUISITIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     During February 1994, the Corporation acquired all of the
outstanding stock of First Fidelity Bancorp, Inc.(Fidelity). The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests which requires
all amounts included in the proforma financial statements be restated
as if the acquisition had occurred on the first day of each year
presented.  Fidelity had net income of $3,179,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1993 as compared to $3,547,000 and $3,165,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. On a proforma
basis the acquisition of Fidelity caused dilution in earnings per 
share of $.18, $.06 and $.06 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 
1992 and 1991, respectively.  Book value was diluted by $.87, $.73 
and $.37 for 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. Improved future 
earnings of the acquired institution are expected to recapture the 
dilution in both the book value per share and earnings per share.
     During July 1992, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding
stock of The First National Bank of Barnesville (Barnesville).  The
acquisition was accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of
