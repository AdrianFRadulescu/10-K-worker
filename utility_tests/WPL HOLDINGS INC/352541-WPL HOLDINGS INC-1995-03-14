   ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

            WPL Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as the "Company") was
   incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on April 22, 1981
   and operates as a holding company with both utility and nonregulated
   businesses.  It is the parent company of a public utility, Wisconsin Power
   and Light Company ("WPL") and its related subsidiaries, and of Heartland
   Development Corporation ("HDC"), the parent corporation for the Company's
   nonregulated businesses.  The Company has no employees who are not also
   employees of WPL and or HDC.  See Item 8 - "Financial Statements and
   Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements", Note 12,
   for financial information related to the Company's business segments.

                                       WPL

            WPL, incorporated in Wisconsin on February 21, 1917 as the
   Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company, is a public utility predominately
   engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric energy and the
   generation and bulk purchase of electric energy for sale.  WPL also
   transports, distributes and sells natural gas purchased from gas
   suppliers.  Nearly all of WPL's customers are located in south and central
   Wisconsin.  WPL operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of
   indefinite duration which are regulated by Wisconsin law.  WPL does not
   derive a material portion of its revenues from any one customer.

            WPL owns all of the outstanding capital stock of South Beloit
   Water, Gas and Electric Company ("South Beloit"), a public utility
   supplying electric, gas and water service, principally in Winnebago
   County, Illinois, which was incorporated on July 23, 1908.

            WPL also owns varying interests in several other subsidiaries
   and investments which are not material to WPL's operations.

   Regulation

            WPL is subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission
   of Wisconsin ("PSCW") as to retail utility rates and service, accounts, 
   issuance and use of proceeds of securities, certain additions and 
   extensions to facilities, and in other respects.  South Beloit is subject
   to regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC") for similar 
   items.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") has jurisdiction
   under the Federal Power Act over certain of the electric utility 
   facilities and operations, wholesale rates and accounting practices of 
   WPL and in certain other respects.  Certain of WPL's natural gas 
   facilities and operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC
   under the Natural Gas Act.  The Company is presently exempt from all
   provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, except
   provisions relating to the acquisition of securities of other public
   utility companies.

            The PSCW has recently opened a formal docket initiating an
   inquiry into the future structure of the electric utility industry in
   Wisconsin.  The goals of Wisconsin utility regulation and the principles
   to be used in choosing among alternative proposals have been identified. 
   WPL has submitted its preferred structure which, in summary form, calls
   for open access to transmission and distribution systems and a competitive
   power generation marketplace.  It is not possible at this time to predict
   the outcome of these proceedings.

            With respect to environmental matters impacting WPL and its
   subsidiaries, the United States Environmental Protection Agency administers
   certain federal statutes with administrative responsibility with respect
   to others being delegated to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
   ("DNR").  In addition, the DNR has jurisdiction over air and water quality
   standards associated with fossil fuel fired electric generation and the
   level and flow of water, safety and other matters pertaining to 
   hydroelectric generation.

            WPL is subject to the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission ("NRC") with respect to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
   ("Kewaunee") and to the jurisdiction of the United States Department of
   Energy ("DOE") with respect to the disposal of nuclear fuel and other
   radioactive wastes from Kewaunee.

   Employees

            At year-end 1994, WPL employed 2,391 persons, of whom 1,924 were
   considered electric utility employees, 334 were considered gas utility
   employees and 133 were considered other utility employees.  WPL has a
   three-year contract with members of the International Brotherhood of
   Electrical Workers, Local 965, that is in effect until June 1, 1996.  The
   contract covers 1,647 of WPL's employees.

   ELECTRIC OPERATIONS:

   General

            WPL provides electricity in a service territory of approximately
   16,000 square miles in 35 counties in southern and central Wisconsin and
   four counties in northern Illinois.  As of December 31, 1994, WPL provided
   retail electric service to approximately 371,000 customers in 663 cities,
   villages and towns, and wholesale service to 27 municipal utilities, one
   privately owned utility, three rural electric cooperatives and to the
   Wisconsin Public Power, Inc. system, which provides retail service to nine
   communities.

            WPL owns 20,969 miles of electric transmission and distribution
   lines and 362 substations located adjacent to the communities served.

            WPL's electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the yearly
   peak normally occurring in the summer months.  WPL also experiences a
   smaller winter peak in December or January.

   Fuel

            In 1994, approximately 80 percent of WPL's net kilowatthour
   generation of electricity was fueled by coal and 17 percent by nuclear
   fuel (provided by WPL's 41 percent ownership interest in Kewaunee).  The
   remaining electricity generated was produced by hydroelectric, oil-fired
   and natural gas generation.

   Coal

            WPL anticipates that its average fuel costs will likely increase
   in the future, due to cost escalation provisions in existing coal and
   transportation contracts.

            The estimated coal requirements of WPL's generating units
   (including jointly-owned facilities) for the years 1995 through 2014 total
   about 167  million tons. Present coal supply contracts and transportation
   contracts (excluding extension options) cover approximately 14 percent and
   21 percent, respectively, of this estimated requirement.  WPL will seek
   renewals of existing contracts or additional sources of supply and
   negotiate new or additional transportation contracts to satisfy these
   requirements and to comply with environmental regulations.

   Nuclear

            Kewaunee is jointly-owned by WPL (41%), Wisconsin Public Service
   Corporation (41.2%) and Madison Gas & Electric Company (17.8%).  Wisconsin
   Public Service Corporation (WPSC) is the operating partner.  The plant
   began commercial operation in 1974.

            WPSC, the plant operator, is a member of the INPO, an
   organization of nuclear utilities which promotes excellence in all aspects
   of nuclear plant operations.  INPO manages the accreditation process for
   industry training programs, which includes periodic accreditation of those
   training programs by an independent organization, the NNAB.  All ten
   accredited training programs at Kewaunee are currently in good standing
   with the NNAB.

            The supply of nuclear fuel for the Kewaunee plant involves the
   mining and milling of uranium ore to uranium concentrates, the conversion
   of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of the uranium
   hexafluoride and fabrication of the enriched uranium into usable fuel
   assemblies.  After a region (approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel
   assemblies in the reactor) of spent fuel is removed from the reactor, it
   is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the
   plant site.  Permanent storage is addressed below.  Presently, there are
   no operating facilities in the United States reprocessing commercial
   nuclear fuel.  A discussion of the nuclear fuel supply for Kewaunee, which
   requires approximately 250,000 pounds of uranium concentrates per year
   follows:

         (a)   Requirements for uranium are met through spot market purchases
               of uranium.  In general, a four-year supply of uranium is
               maintained.

         (b)   Uranium hexafluoride, from inventory and from spot market
               purchases, was used to satisfy converted material requirements
               in 1994.  Conversion services relating to uranium hexafluoride
               will be purchased on the spot market in the future.

         (c)   In 1994, enriched uranium was procured from COGEMA, Inc.
               pursuant to a contract last amended in 1993.  Enrichment
               services were purchased from the Department of Energy (DOE),
               under the terms of the utility services contract.  This
               contract is in effect for the life of Kewaunee.  The
               partnership is committed to take 70 percent of its annual
               requirements in 1995, and in alternate years thereafter, from
               the DOE.

         (d)   Fuel fabrication requirements through June 15, 1995 are
               covered by contract.  This contract contains an option to
               allow extension of the contract through 1998.  WPSC is
               negotiating a contract for fuel fabrication extending through
               2001.

         (e)   Beyond the stated periods for Kewaunee, additional contracts
               for uranium concentrates, conversion to uranium hexafluoride,
               fabrication and spent fuel storage will have to be procured. 
               The prices for the foregoing are expected to increase.

        The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 provides that both the
   Federal government and the nuclear utilities fund the decontamination and
   decommissioning of the three federal gaseous diffusion plants in the
   United States.  This will require the owners of Kewaunee to pay
   approximately $15 million in current dollars over a period of 15 years. 
   WPL's share amounts to an annual payment of approximately $410,000.

        The steam generator tubes at the Kewaunee plant are susceptible to
   corrosion characteristics, a condition that has been experienced
   throughout the nuclear industry.  Annual inspections are performed to
   identify degraded tubes.  Degraded tubes are either repaired by sleeving
   or are removed from service by plugging.  The steam generators were
   designed with approximately 15 percent heat transfer margin, meaning that
   full power should be sustainable with the equivalent of 15 percent of the
   steam generator tubes plugged.  Tube plugging and the build-up of deposits
   on the tubes affect the heat-transfer capability of the steam generators
   to the point where eventually full power operation is not possible and
   there is a gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant.  As a result of
   this process, Kewaunee's capacity could be reduced by as much as 20% by
   the year 2013 when the current operating license expires.  Currently, the
   equivalent of approximately 12 percent of the tubes in the steam generator
   are plugged.  WPL and the joint-owners recently completed studies
   evaluating the economics of replacing the two steam generators at
   Kewaunee.  The studies resulted in the conclusion that the most prudent
   course of action is to continue operation of the existing steam
   generators.  WPL and the other joint-owners continue to evaluate
   appropriate strategies, including replacement, as well as continued
   operation of the steam generator without replacement.  WPL and the joint-
   owners also continue to fund the development of welded repair technology
   for steam generator tubes.  The plant is expected to be operated until at
   least 2013.  WPL and the joint-owners are also continuing to evaluate and
   implement initiatives to improve the performance of Kewaunee which already
   performs at above average levels for the industry.  These initiatives
   include conversion from a 12-month to an 18-month fuel cycle and numerous
   other cost reduction measures.  These initiatives have resulted in
   reductions in Kewaunee operating and maintenance costs since 1991.

        Physical decommissioning is expected to occur during the period 2014
   to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred during the period 2022
   to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the site. 
   Wisconsin utilities operating nuclear generating plants are required by
   the PSCW to establish external trust funds to provide for the
   decommissioning of such plants.  The market value of the investments in
   the funds established by WPL at December 31, 1994 totaled $51.8  million. 
   Additionally, in July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic order covering
   utilities that have nuclear generation.  This order standardizes the
   escalation assumptions to be used in determining nuclear decommissioning
   liabilities.

        WPL's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be $159
   million (in 1994 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013)
   based on a 1992 study, using the immediate dismantlement method of
   decommissioning.  The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs
   estimated to be expended between the years 2014 and 2050 is $1,016
   million.  After-tax earnings on the tax-qualified and nontax-qualified
   decommissioning funds are assumed to be 6.1% and 5.1%, respectively.  The
   future escalation rate is assumed to be 6.5%.

        Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE has
   entered into a contract with WPL to accept, transport and dispose of spent
   nuclear fuel beginning no later than January 31, 1998.  It is likely that
   the DOE will delay the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel beyond 1998.  A
   fee to offset the costs of the DOE's disposal for all spent fuel used
   since April 7, 1983 has been assessed by the DOE at one mill per net
   kilowatthour of electricity generated and sold by the Kewaunee nuclear
   power plant.  An additional one-time fee was paid for the disposal of
   spent nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983.

        Spent fuel is currently stored at Kewaunee.  The existing capacity
   of the spent fuel storage facility will enable storage of the projected
   quantities of spent fuel through April 2001.  WPL is currently evaluating
   options for the storage of additional quantities beyond 2001.  Several
   technologies are available.  An investment of approximately $2.5 million
   in the early 2000's could provide additional storage sufficient to meet
   spent fuel storage needs until the expiration of the current operating
   license.

        The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 as amended in
   1985 provides that states may enter into compacts to provide for regional
   low-level waste disposal facilities.  Wisconsin is a member of the Midwest
   Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.  The state of Ohio has
   been selected as the host state for the Midwest Compact and is proceeding
   with the preliminary phases of site selection.  In June of 1994, the
   Branwell, South Carolina disposal facility, which had been accepting
   Kewaunee low level radioactive waste materials, discontinued taking waste
   materials from outside its region.  WPL expects to have sufficient storage
   space of its own to satisfy low level radioactive waste disposal needs
   until the Ohio facility accepts low level radioactive waste materials.

   Recovery of Electric Fuel Costs

        In 1994 WPL did not automatically pass changes in electric fuel costs
   through to its Wisconsin retail electric customers.  Instead, rates were
   based on estimated per unit fuel costs established during rate proceedings
   and were not subject to change by fuel cost fluctuations unless actual
   costs were outside specified limits.  If actual fuel costs had varied from
   the estimated costs by more than +10 percent in a month or by more than
   +3 percent for the test year to date, rates could have been adjusted,
   based on the results of a special fuel cost hearing.  During 1994, fuel
   costs remained within the aforementioned parameters.  See Note 1F in the
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of Item 8
   hereto.

        WPL's wholesale rates and South Beloit's retail rates contain fuel
   adjustment clauses pursuant to which rates are adjusted monthly to reflect
   changes in the costs of fuel.

   GAS OPERATIONS:

   General

            As of December 31, 1994, WPL provided retail natural gas service
   to approximately 141,000 customers in 239 cities, villages and towns in
   22 counties in southern and central Wisconsin and one county in northern
   Illinois.

            WPL's gas sales follow a seasonal pattern.  There is an annual
   base load of gas used for heating, cooking, water heating and other
   purposes, with a large peak occurring during the heating season.

            In 1994, WPL continued to purchase significant volumes of lower
   cost gas directly from producers and marketers and transported those
   volumes over its two major pipeline supplier's systems.  This replaced
   higher cost gas historically purchased directly from the major pipeline
   systems.

   Gas Supplies

            During 1993, both of the interstate pipelines which serve WPL,
   ANR Pipeline and Northern Natural Pipeline, completed their transition to
   providing unbundled services as mandated by the FERC in its Order 636.  As
   a result, WPL now contracts with these two parties for various unbundled
   services such as firm and interruptible transportation, firm and
   interruptible storage service and "no-notice" service.  WPL and its gas
   customers have benefited from enhanced access to competitively priced gas
   supplies, and from more flexible transportation services.  As part of this
   restructuring, pipelines have sought and received authorization to recover
   from  their customers certain transition costs associated with
   restructuring.  WPL is passing these costs along to its retail gas
   customers pursuant to provisions of its retail gas tariffs.

            The gas industry, in general, was put to a severe test during
   the first quarter of 1994 in the wake of the coldest weather on record. 
   On January 18, 1994, the temperature averaged -17F in Madison, Wisconsin
   and did not rise above -7F.  WPL set a record peak day load of 251,194
   MMBTU.  Overall throughput for January was 23% above forecast.  Through
   effective use of transportation, supply, and storage contracts and by
   invoking tariff language allowing interruption and constraint of gas
   supplies to WPL's large industrial and commercial customers, WPL was able
   to maintain gas flows within the parameters imposed by its pipeline
   contracts.  By doing so, WPL avoided substantial penalty exposure from the
   pipeline companies for unauthorized use of gas.  WPL's large industrial
   and commercial customers served under interruptible rates moved to
   alternate fuel supplies during the periods of interruption and constraint. 
   These customers pay a discounted rate year round in exchange for WPL's
   right to interrupt service to their facilities.

            WPL's portfolio of natural gas contracts over the last several
   years is as follows:

   (a)         Total no longer equals sum of components.  Currently, Northern Natural requires that WPL hold firm transportation
               equal to its total peak-day requirements.  Firm storage, "unbundled" sales from Northern Natural, and third party
               gas supply (not shown) are all eligible gas sources to be moved to WPL's city gates via this firm transportation. 
               Contract demand services from Northern Natural have been eliminated.

            As the natural gas market continues to evolve, WPL continuously
   evaluates products and services provided by pipelines and gas suppliers to
   meet the changing needs of its firm and interruptible gas customers.

   Environmental Matters

            WPL cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental
   regulations by Federal, state and local authorities upon its generating,
   transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has taken steps
   to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of current
   environmental regulations.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and
   subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
   affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes along
   with clean air legislation passed in 1990 by Congress, could affect the
   siting, construction and operating costs of both present and future
   generating units.

            Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
   Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
   ways are required to be obtained from the DNR to which the permit program
   has been delegated.  These permits must be periodically renewed.  WPL has
   obtained such permits for all of its generating stations or has filed
   timely applications for renewals of such permits.

            Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance
   with Federal standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of
   particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and
   require permits from the  DNR for the operation of emission sources.  WPL
   currently has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled
   generating facilities.  With the passage of the new Federal Clean Air Act
   Amendments, the states are required to include these provisions into their
   permit requirements.  WPL has submitted timely Title V permit applications
   in compliance with schedules set forth by the regulators.  The operating
   permits, when issued, will consolidate all existing air permit conditions
   and regulatory requirements into one permit for each facility.  Permits
   may be issued in late 1995 or 1996.  Until such time, the facilities will
   continue to operate under their existing permit conditions.

            Pursuant to Section 144.386(2)of the Wisconsin Statutes, WPL has
   submitted data and plans for 1995 sulfur dioxide emissions compliance. 
   Actual 1994 emissions were reported to the DNR.  WPL is currently in
   compliance with this state requirement.  WPL will make any necessary
   operational changes in fuel types and power plant dispatch to comply with
   the system emissions limit of 1.2 pounds SO2 per million BTU.

            WPL's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's sulfur dioxide law
   (discussed above) and the Federal Clear Air Act Amendments required plant
   upgrades at its generating facilities.  The majority of these projects
   were completed in 1993.  WPL has installed continuous emission monitoring
   systems at all of its coal fired boilers in compliance with Federal
   requirements.  Monitoring for sulfur dioxide was also required by Title IV
   of the Federal Clean Air Act at WPL's South Fond du Lac combustion turbine
   site.  These requirements were also met.  Additional monitoring systems
   for nitrogen oxides will be required by January 1, 1996 at the combustion
   turbine site.  WPL will install these monitors in 1995.  No significant
   investments are anticipated at this time to meet the requirements of the
   Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.

            Pursuant to Section 311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act, WPL has
   submitted facility response plans for the Rock River generating station
   and the South Fond du Lac combustion turbine site.  The plans address
   pollution prevention and spill response activities for those facilities
   with capacity to store in excess of one million gallons of oil.

            WPL maintains licenses for all its ash disposal facilities and
   regularly reports to the DNR groundwater data and quantities of ash
   landfilled or reused.  The landfills are operated according to a Plan of
   Operation approved by the DNR.

            WPL's accumulated pollution abatement expenditures through
   December 31, 1994, totaled approximately $133 million.  The major
   expenditures consist of about $60 million for the installation of
   electrostatic precipitators for the purpose of reducing particulate
   emissions from WPL's coal-fired generating stations and approximately
   $73 million for other pollution abatement equipment at the Columbia, Edge-
   water, Kewaunee, Nelson Dewey, Rock River and Blackhawk plants. 
   Expenditures during 1994 totalled approximately $5 million.  Estimated
   future  pollution abatement expenditures total $1.5 million through 1996. 
   WPL's estimated pollution abatement expenditures are subject to continuing
   review and are revised from time to time due to escalation of construction
   costs, changes in construction plans and changes in environmental
   regulations.

            See "Electric Operations - Fuel" for information concerning the
   disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste.

   Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

            Historically, WPL has owned 11 properties that have been
   associated with the production of manufactured gas.  Currently, WPL owns
   five of these sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining
   three are owned by private companies.  In 1989, WPL initiated
   investigation of these manufactured gas plant sites.  The DNR has been
   involved in reviewing investigation plans and has received ongoing reports
   regarding these investigations.

            In 1992, and into the beginning of 1993, WPL continued its
   investigations and studies.  WPL confirmed that there was no contamination
   at two of the sites and received a close out letter from the DNR related
   to one of those sites and requested a close out letter for the other site. 
   Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
   indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
   In February 1993, WPL completed cost estimates for the environmental
   remediation of the eight remaining sites.  The results of this analysis
   indicate that during the next 34 years, WPL will expend approximately $81
   million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil remediation
   activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation activities,
   including construction of slurry containment walls and the installation of
   groundwater pump and treatment facilities.  This estimate was based on
   various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and revision by
   management.

            The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average
   inflation over a 34 year period.  The cost estimate also contemplates that
   primarily groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after
   1998 through and including 2027.  During this time, WPL estimates that it
   will incur average annual costs of $2.0 million to complete the planned
   groundwater remediation activities.

            With respect to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has
   approved a five year amortization of the unamortized balance of
   environmental costs expended to date.

            In addition, WPL is pursuing insurance recovery for the costs of
   remediating these sites and is investigating to determine whether there
   are other parties who may be responsible for some of the clean-up costs.

            Through 1994, management has continued its oversight of the
   issues related to the above manufactured gas plant sites without
   significant revision to the above estimates and assumptions.

            Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management
   believes that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant
   sites will be recovered in rates.

            The maximum net hourly peak load on WPL's electric system was
   2,002,000 kw and occurred on June 16, 1994.  At the time of such peak
   load, 2,386,000 kw were produced by generating facilities operated by WPL
   (including other company shared jointly-owned facilities).  WPL delivered
   934,000 kw of power and received 540,000 kw of power from external
   sources.  During the year ended December 31, 1994, about 84.4 percent of
   WPL's total kilowatthour requirements were generated by company-owned and
   jointly-owned facilities and the remaining 15.6 percent was purchased. 
   Substantially all of WPL's facilities are subject to the lien of its first
   mortgage bond indenture.

   ratio below 51.93 percent.

   1994 COMPARED WITH 1993

   OVERVIEW

   Earnings per share of WPL Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") common stock
   increased to $2.13 in 1994 compared with $2.11 in 1993.  Earnings for 1994
   were significantly affected by two non-recurring items from the Company's
   utility subsidiary Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WPL").  These items
   were the reversal of a coal contract penalty in the 1st quarter and costs
   associated with early retirement and severance programs which primarily
   occurred in the 4th quarter.  Both of these items are discussed in the
   "Other Events" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.  The
   following breakout presents the recurring aspects of 1994's operations.

                                                 1994          1993

                                                =====         =====

   The increase in the "Earnings per share before the above non-recurring
   items" primarily reflects an increase in operating earnings from WPL.  The
   increase was somewhat offset by program start-up costs associated with
   expansion of the affordable housing and energy services businesses of the
   Company's non-regulated subsidiary, Heartland Development Corp. ("HDC").

   WPL's electric margin increased during 1994 compared to 1993.  The primary
   factor was a 3.8 percent retail rate increase effective October 1, 1993. 
   Strong economic conditions in the industrial and commercial customer
   classes contributed higher sales and customer growth.  A colder than
   normal January and a very warm mid-September offset relatively mild summer
   conditions in July and August making 1994 a relatively average year in
   terms of degree day impacts on sales volumes.  Electric production fuel
   costs were stable in 1994.  The volume of purchased power increased as a
   result of WPL's efforts to conserve coal inventories during a rail strike
   in the 3rd quarter of 1994.  See "Other Events" for details.

   </TABLE>

   Gas margin increased in 1994 from 1993 primarily based on two factors: 1)
   a 1.4 percent retail rate increase effective October 1, 1993 and, 2) an
   increase in customers in the higher rate firm service resulted in a more
   favorable sales mix.  The overall cost of purchased gas declined
   reflecting WPL's effective use of opportunities on the gas spot market.
    
   Fees, Rents and Other Operating Revenues ("Other Revenues")

   Environmental services revenues increased due to continued strong demand. 
   Other revenues increased due to an increased number of affordable housing
   project syndications and the inclusion of the full year of revenues in
   1994 for A&C Enercom Consultants, Inc. that was acquired in February,
   1993.

   Other Operation Expense

   The increase in other operation expense is primarily related to the early
   retirement and severance programs discussed later in the "Other Events"
   section and increased program start-up costs associated with the expansion
   of the Company's affordable housing and energy services businesses. 
   Offsetting these costs were reductions in WPL's operating costs resulting
   from the ongoing reengineering of its processes.

   Maintenance

   Maintenance expense decreased between years due to the variation in the
   timing and extent of WPL's maintenance outages at its generating
   facilities between years.  Secondarily, a severe storm in the summer of
   1993 increased 1993's maintenance expense related to service restoration.

   Depreciation and Amortization

   Depreciation expense increased, principally reflecting increased property
   additions, and increased decommissioning costs for WPL.

   Other Income and (Deductions)

   Other income increased due to the reversal of a coal contract penalty
   discussed later in the "Other Events" section.

   Income Taxes

   Income taxes increased between years primarily due to higher taxable
   income.

   Affordable housing tax credits declined as HPI reduced its ownership
   interests in qualifying properties late in 1993, placing more emphasis on
   the generation of syndication and development fees and retaining only
   small ownership interests in additional properties.

   1993 COMPARED WITH 1992

   OVERVIEW

   Earnings per share of the Company common stock increased to $2.11 in 1993
   compared with $2.10 in 1992.  The increase in earnings primarily reflected
   an increase in earnings from WPL.  The principle factors leading to
   increased earnings included warmer summer weather and lower electric fuel
   costs per kWh which yielded higher electric margins for WPL.  These
   increases were somewhat offset by increased depreciation expense resulting
   from additional investment in utility plant and property additions, a
   change in the mix of gas sales from higher margin sales to lower margin
   sales, the increase in the Federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to
   35 percent and a one-time 4-cent-per-share charge associated with a
   voluntary separation program for the executive management group at the
   utility.

   The Company's nonregulated subsidiary, HDC, contributed to earnings
   through its principal businesses: 1) environmental engineering and
   consulting, 2) affordable housing, and 3) energy products and services.

   WPL's electric margin in dollars increased during 1993 compared with 1992
   due to increased demand for electricity brought on by warmer summer
   weather.  Residential customers, being the most weather sensitive,
   experienced the most significant increases.  Wisconsin's strong economy
   kept the commercial and industrial classes growing steadily.  These
   increases were coupled with declining electric production fuel costs per
   kWh.  The decrease in electric production fuels was due to WPL's
   aggressive pursuit of additional spot coal purchase opportunities as its
   longer term contracts began to expire.  Additionally, a highly competitive
   rail transportation environment significantly reduced the cost of
   transporting the coal.  Also, lower cost purchased power became available
   due to excess capacity in the bulk-power market.

   </TABLE>

   WPL's gas revenues for 1992 were affected by the recognition of a $4.9
   million before-tax refund to its natural gas customers resulting from an
   adjustment in the calculation of the purchased gas adjustment clause. 
   Without the impact of this revenue adjustment, comparative gas margins
   would have  declined for 1993 compared with 1992.

   The overall increases in gas revenues and purchased gas costs between
   years resulted primarily from increased volumes procured on behalf of
   transportation customers.  This had the impact of decreasing margins as a
   percentage of total revenues.  A change in the mix of gas sales from
   higher margin residential sales to lower margin sales also moved margins
   downward. Offsetting this decline, Wisconsin's strong economy enabled
   growth in the commercial and industrial classes, and there was also some
   overall increase in the demand for natural gas due to colder weather.

   Fees, Rents and Other Operating Revenues ("Other Revenues")

   Other revenues increased between years as a result of RMT's and HPI's
   growth in their respective businesses and the result of acquisitions in
   the environmental and energy-services businesses.

   Other Operation Expense

   Other operation expense also increased as a result of the above factors. 
   An additional increase resulted from higher WPL employee benefit expense
   (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7).  These increases
   were offset somewhat by decreases in WPL's conservation program
   expenditures and decreases in fees associated with the sale of WPL's
   accounts receivable due to a decline in interest rates.  Additionally,
   WPL's cost management efforts have helped control annual inflationary
   pressures on general and administrative costs.

   Depreciation and Amortization

   Depreciation and amortization expense increased, principally reflecting
   increased property additions and the commencement of deferred charge
   amortizations approved in WPL's rate orders received in December 1992 and
   October 1993.  The most significant amortizations include the amortization
   related to an acquisition adjustment which resulted from the purchase of
   transmission facilities and the amortization of costs incurred related to
   the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites (see Notes to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11).
    
   Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC")

   Total AFUDC increased in 1993 compared with 1992, reflecting the greater
   amounts of construction work in progress including the costs associated
   with WPL's construction of two 86-megawatt combustion-turbine generators.

   Interest Expense

   Interest expense on debt decreased between years, primarily reflecting the
   benefits of WPL's refinancing efforts.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Rates and Regulatory Matters

   On December 9, 1994, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW")
   issued rate order UR-109, effective for a two-year period beginning
   January 1, 1995.  The order included the following decisions on WPL's
   retail rate application as filed on February 4, 1994:  1) electric
   revenues will be decreased by approximately $12.3 million (2.8 percent)
   annually, 2) natural gas revenues will be increased by approximately $.7
   million (.5 percent) annually, 3) return on common equity will be 11.5
   percent versus WPL's previously allowed return on equity of 11.6 percent.

   Further, the PSCW approved certain incentive programs described below:

   1.   The electric fuel adjustment mechanism was eliminated.  In its
        absence, WPL will benefit from reductions in fuel cost.  Conversely,
        WPL will be exposed to increases in fuel costs.

   2.   The automatic purchased gas adjustment clause was also eliminated. 
        In the future, the fluctuations in the commodity cost of gas above or
        below a prescribed commodity price index will serve to increase or
        decrease WPL's margin on gas sales.  Fixed demand costs are excluded
        from the incentive program.  Both benefits and exposures are subject
        to ratepayer sharing provisions, which are capped at $1.1 million.

   3.   In order to promote air quality and reliability, there are SO2
        emissions and service reliability incentive clauses.  Positive
        incentive available under these clauses is a pre-tax  $1.5 million
        for the SO2 emissions and a pre-tax $.5 million for the service
        reliability.  WPL's earnings are also negatively exposed for equal
        amounts.   Since WPL is allowed to collect all revenues under these
        programs in advance, up to $4.0 million annually of pre-tax revenue
        may be collected subject to refund upon final determination of
        performance under this program.

   Industry Outlook

   The PSCW has recently opened a formal docket initiating an inquiry into
   the future structure of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin.  The
   goals of Wisconsin utility regulation and the principles to be used in
   choosing among alternative proposals have been identified.  WPL has
   submitted its preferred structure which, in summary form, calls for open
   access to transmission and distribution systems and a competitive power
   generation market place.  It is not possible at this time to predict the
   outcome of these proceedings.

   Financing and Capital Structure

   The level of short-term borrowings fluctuates based on seasonal corporate
   needs, the timing of long-term financing and capital market conditions. 
   The Company's operating subsidiaries generally issue short-term debt to
   provide interim financing of construction and capital expenditures in
   excess of available internally generated funds.  The subsidiaries
   periodically reduce their outstanding short-term debt through the issuance
   of long-term debt and through the Company's additional investment in their
   common equity.  To maintain flexibility in its capital structure and to
   take advantage of favorable short-term rates, the Company also uses
   proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to
   finance a portion of its long-term cash needs.  The Company anticipates
   that short-term debt funds will continue to be available at reasonable
   costs due to strong ratings by independent utility analysts and rating
   services.  WPL commercial paper has been rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor's
   Corp. and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service.

   Bank lines of credit of $97.5 million at December 31, 1994 are available
   to support these borrowings.

   The Company's capitalization at December 31, 1994, including the current
   maturities of long-term debt, variable rate demand bonds and short-term
   debt, consisted of 48.8 percent common equity, 4.9 percent preferred stock
   and 46.3 percent long-term debt.  The common-equity-to-total
   capitalization ratio at December 31, 1994 increased to 48.8 percent from
   47.9 percent at December 31, 1993.

   The retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, requires WPL to maintain
   a utility common equity level of 51.93 percent of total utility
   capitalization during the two-year test year ending December 31, 1996.  In
   addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment of dividends
   by WPL to the Company that are in excess of the level forecasted for 1995
   ($58.1 million), if such dividends would reduce WPL's average common
   equity ratio below 51.93 percent.

   Capital Requirements

   The Company's largest subsidiary, WPL, is capital-intensive and requires
   large investments in long-lived assets.  Therefore, the Company's most
   significant capital requirements relate to WPL construction expenditures. 
   Estimated capital requirements of WPL for the next five years are as
   follows:

   </TABLE>


   Included in the construction expenditure estimates, in addition to the
   recurring additions and improvements to the distribution and transmission
   systems, are the following: 1) expenditures for managing and controlling
   electric line losses and for the electric delivery system that will reduce
   electric line losses and enhance WPL's interconnection capability with
   other utilities; 2) expenditures related to environmental compliance
   issues, including the installation of additional emissions-monitoring
   equipment and coal-handling equipment; 3) expenditures associated with the
   construction of an 86-megawatt combustion-turbine generator expected to
   become operational in 1996.

   The Company's capital requirements may also be impacted by decisions 
   relating to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee").  The steam
   generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion characteristics,
   a condition that has been experienced throughout the nuclear industry.  
   Annual inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes.  Degraded
   tubes are either repaired by sleeving or are removed from service by
   plugging.  The steam generators were designed with an approximately 15 
   percent heat transfer margin, meaning that full power should be 
   sustainable with the equivalent of 15 percent of the steam generator 
   tubes plugged.  Tube plugging and the build-up of deposits on the tubes 
   affect the heat-transfer capability of the steam generators to the point 
   where eventually full-power operation is not possible and there is a 
   gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant.  The plant's capacity 
   could be reduced by as much as 20% by the year 2013 when the current 
   operating license expires.  Currently, the equivalent of approximately 
   12 percent of the tubes in the steam generators are plugged.  WPL and 
   the joint-owners recently completed studies evaluating the economics of 
   replacing the two steam generators at Kewaunee.  The studies resulted 
   in the conclusion that the most prudent course of action is to continue 
   operation of the existing steam generators.  WPL and the other joint-
   owners continue to evaluate appropriate strategies, including
   replacement, as well as continued operation of the steam generators
   without replacement.  WPL and the joint owners also continue to fund the
   development of welded repair technology for steam generator tubes.  The
   plant is expected to be operated until at least 2013.  WPL and the joint-
   owners are also continuing to evaluate and implement initiatives to
   improve the performance of Kewaunee, which already performs at above-
   average levels for the industry.  These initiatives include conversion
   from a 12-month to an 18-month fuel cycle and numerous other cost
   reduction measures.  These initiatives have resulted in reductions in
   Kewaunee operating and maintenance costs since 1991.

   HDC has expanded its energy related products and services business and its
   environmental services through investment in existing businesses during
   1994.  In addition to its investment in affordable housing,  HPI continues
   to market its affordable housing expertise by expanding its business to
   provide assistance to other corporate/public investors in their
   development, operation and financing of affordable housing projects.

   HDC has begun an assessment of the strategic fit of its utility service
   business and is considering various alternatives, including the possible
   sale of part or all of this business.  

   In 1994, A&C Enercom sold its EcoGroup operations.  EcoGroup, a Phoenix,
   Arizona based company initially acquired by A&C Enercom in 1993, provided
   energy and environmental programs primarily for the electric and gas
   utility industry.

   Capital Resources

   One of the Company's objectives is to finance construction expenditures
   through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by outside
   financing.  With this objective in place, the Company has financed an
   average of 85 percent of its construction expenditures during the last
   five years from internal sources.  However, during the next five years,
   the Company expects this percentage to be reduced primarily due to the
   continuation of major construction expenditures and the maturity of $64
   million of WPL first mortgage bonds.  External financing sources such as
   the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and short-term borrowings
   will be used by the Company to finance the remaining construction
   expenditure requirements for this period.  Current forecasts are that
   $40.5 million of additional equity and $65 million of long-term debt will
   be issued over the next three years. 

   In 1994, the Company increased its dividends by 1.1 percent and issued
   337,980 new shares of common stock through its Dividend Reinvestment and
   Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Savings Plan, generating proceeds of $9.7
   million.

   INFLATION

   Under current rate-making methodologies prescribed by the various
   commissions that regulate WPL, projected or forecasted operating costs,
   including the impacts of inflation, are incorporated into WPL revenue
   requirements.  Accordingly, the impacts of inflation on WPL are currently
   mitigated.  Although rates will be held flat until at least 1997,
   management expects that any impact of inflation will be mitigated by
   customer growth and productivity improvements.  Inflationary impacts on
   the non-regulated businesses are not anticipated to be material to the
   Company.

   OTHER EVENTS

   Coal Contract Penalty

   In November 1989, the PSCW concluded that WPL did not properly administer
   a coal contract, resulting in an assessment to compensate ratepayers for
   excess fuel costs having been incurred.  As a result, WPL recorded a
   reserve in 1989 that had an after-tax affect of reducing 1989 net income
   by $4.9 million.  The PSCW decision was found to represent unlawful
   retroactive rate-making by both the Dane County Circuit Court and the
   Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  The case was then appealed to the Wisconsin
   Supreme Court.

   In January, 1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of
   the Dane County Circuit Court and Wisconsin Court of Appeals.  In
   management's opinion, all avenues for appeal have been exhausted.  As a
   result, WPL reversed the entire reserve and was also allowed to collect
   interest on amounts of the penalty previously refunded to ratepayers.  The
   reversal of the reserve plus interest had an after-tax affect of
   increasing net income in 1994 by $5.3 million.

   Early Retirement and Severance Programs

   Given the expectation of increasing competition, WPL has continued to
   reengineer its processes to implement cost efficiencies in its operations. 
   In connection with these efforts, WPL offered voluntary early retirement
   programs and voluntary severance programs to affected employees in 1994
   and 1993.  These programs primarily closed late in the fourth quarter of
   1994 and 1993.

   In terms of pre-tax costs, the early retirement programs totalled $9.8
   million and the severance programs totalled $3.9 million for a grand total
   of $13.7 million in 1994.  For 1993, program costs totalled $1.8 million.

   Coal Transporter's Strike

   One of WPL's major coal transporters experienced a labor strike during the
   third quarter of 1994.  During the term of the strike (55 days), WPL's
   ability to receive coal from its suppliers was impaired, which required
   WPL to use some of its existing coal reserves and to purchase additional
   power.  On August 29, 1994, President Clinton, acting under the Railway
   Labor Act, forced a temporary end (the "cooling off period") to the strike
   by ordering the railroad union employees back to work and establishing a
   three member Presidential Emergency Board to draft a recommended
   settlement.  Railroad management and the United Transportation Union have
   subsequently settled on a contract.  As of December 31, 1994, the existing
   and anticipated financial impact on WPL's operating results was not
   material.

   Environmental

   WPL cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental
   regulations by federal, state and local authorities upon its generating,
   transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has taken steps
   to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of current
   environmental regulations.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and
   subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
   affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, along
   with the clean air legislation passed in 1990 by Congress, could affect
   the siting, construction and operating costs of both present and future
   generating units.

   Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
   Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
   ways are required to be obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural
   Resources (DNR).  WPL has obtained such permits for all of its generating
   stations or has filed timely applications for renewals.

   Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance with federal
   standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of particulates,
   sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and require
   permits from the DNR for the operation of emission sources.  WPL currently
   has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled generating
   facilities.  However, beginning in 1994, new permits were required for all
   major facilities in Wisconsin.  WPL's Columbia Generating facility
   submitted a permit application on May 1, 1994.  The remaining facilities
   will be addressed in early 1995.

   WPL's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's 1993 sulfur dioxide law and the
   Federal Clean Air Act Amendments required plant upgrades at its generating
   facilities.  The majority of these projects were completed in 1993 and
   1994.  WPL has installed continuous emissions monitoring systems at all of
   its coal fired boilers.  No additional costs for compliance with these
   acid-rain-prevention requirements are anticipated at this time.

   for a discussion of WPL's manufactured gas plant sites.

   WPL HOLDINGS, INC.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands except as
   otherwise indicated)

   NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING
                   POLICIES:

   a.  Business and Consolidation:

   WPL Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "WPLH") is the parent holding company
   of Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WPL") and Heartland Development
   Corporation ("HDC").  The consolidated financial statements include the
   Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, WPL and HDC, along with their
   respective subsidiaries.  Certain amounts from prior years have been
   reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

   WPL is a public utility predominantly engaged in the transmission and
   distribution of electric energy and the generation and bulk purchase of
   electric energy for sale.  WPL also transports, distributes and sells
   natural gas purchased from gas suppliers.  Nearly all of WPL's retail
   customers are located in south and central Wisconsin.  WPL's principal
   consolidated subsidiary is South Beloit Water, Gas and Electric Company.

   HDC and its principal subsidiaries are engaged in business development in
   three major areas: 1) environmental services through the Environmental
   Holding Company ("EHC"), the parent company of RMT, Inc. ("RMT"), Jones
   and Neuse, Inc., and QES, Inc., 2) affordable housing and historic
   rehabilitation through Heartland Properties, Inc. ("HPI") and 3) energy
   services, which includes ENSERV, Inc., A&C Enercom Consultants, Inc. and
   Entec Consulting, Inc.

   b.  Regulation:

   WPL's financial records are maintained in accordance with the uniform
   system of accounts prescribed by its regulators.  The Public Service
   Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") and the Illinois Commerce Commission have
   jurisdiction over retail rates, which represent approximately 83 percent
   of electric revenues plus all gas revenues.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
   Commission ("FERC") has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates
   representing the balance of electric revenues.  Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of
   Certain Types of Regulation" provides that rate-regulated public utilities
   such as WPL record certain costs and credits allowed in the ratemaking
   process in different periods than for unregulated entities.  These are
   deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and are recognized
   in the Consolidated Statements of Income at the time they are reflected in
   rates.

   c.  Utility Plant and Other Property and Equipment:

   Utility plant and other property and equipment are recorded at original
   cost and cost, respectively.  Utility plant costs include financing costs
   that are capitalized through the PSCW-approved allowance for funds used
   during construction ("AFUDC").  The AFUDC capitalization rates approximate
   WPL's cost of capital.  These capitalized costs are recovered in rates as
   the cost of the utility plant is depreciated.

   Normal repairs, maintenance and minor items of utility plant and other
   property and equipment are expensed.  Ordinary utility plant retirements,
   including removal costs less salvage value, are charged to accumulated
   depreciation upon removal from utility plant accounts, and no gain or loss
   is recognized.  Upon retirement or sale of other property and equipment,
   the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
   accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income and deductions. 
         
   d.  Nuclear Fuel:

   Nuclear fuel is recorded at its original cost and is amortized to expense
   based upon the quantity of heat produced for the generation of
   electricity.  This accumulated amortization assumes spent nuclear fuel
   will have no residual value.  Estimated future disposal costs of such fuel
   are expensed based on kilowatthours generated.

   e.  Revenue:

   WPL accrues utility revenues for services provided but not yet billed. 
   HDC records revenues earned but not billed and revenues from professional
   services rendered as incurred using a time-and-materials basis.

   f.  Electric Production Fuels and Purchased Gas:

       (1)Electric Production Fuels:

          Through 1994, the PSCW retail electric rates provided a range from
          which actual fuel costs could vary in relation to costs forecasted
          and used in rates.  If actual fuel costs fell outside this range, a
          hearing could be held to determine if a rate change was necessary,
          and a rate increase or decrease could result.

          Beginning with WPL's latest rate order UR-109, effective January 1,
          1995, the automatic fuel adjustment clause was eliminated.  In its
          absence, WPL will benefit from reductions in fuel cost. 
          Conversely, WPL will be exposed to increases in fuel costs.

          An automatic fuel adjustment clause for the FERC wholesale portion
          of WPL's electric business operates to increase or decrease monthly
          rates based on changes in fuel costs.

       (2)Purchased Gas:

          Through 1994, WPL's base gas cost recovery rates permitted the
          recovery of or refund to all customers for any increases or
          decreases in the cost of gas purchased from WPL's suppliers through
          a monthly purchased gas adjustment clause.

          Beginning with UR-109, the monthly purchased gas adjustment clause
          was also eliminated.  In the future, the fluctuations in the
          commodity cost of gas above or below a prescribed commodity price
          index will serve to increase or decrease WPL's margin on gas sales. 
          Fixed demand costs are excluded from the incentive program.  Both
          benefits and/or exposures are subject to ratepayer sharing
          provisions, which are capped at $1.1 million.

   g.  Cash and Equivalents:

   The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
   maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  The carrying
   amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
   items.

   h.     Income Taxes:

   The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return.  Under the
   terms of an agreement between WPLH and its subsidiaries, WPL and HDC
   calculate their respective federal tax provisions and make payments to
   WPLH as if they were separate taxable entities.  Beginning in 1993, the
   Company fully provides deferred income taxes in accordance with SFAS
   No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," to reflect tax effects of reporting
   book and tax items in different periods.

   As part of HPI's investments in affordable housing, HPI is eligible to
   claim affordable housing and historic rehabilitation credits.  These tax
   credits can be recognized to the extent the Company has consolidated taxes
   payable.

   i.  Goodwill:

   The excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of net assets acquired
   is amortized over 20 to 30 years on a straight-line basis based on its
   estimated useful benefit.  Subsequent to its acquisitions, the Company
   continually evaluates whether later events and circumstances have occurred
   that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant
   revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. 
   To evaluate goodwill for possible impairment, the Company uses a forecast
   of the related business's discounted earnings over the remaining life of
   the goodwill.  Goodwill (net of accumulated amortization) was $20,135 and
   $20,920 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   NOTE 2. PROPERTY:
    
   a.  Jointly-Owned Utility Plants:

   WPL participates with other Wisconsin utilities in the construction and
   operation of several jointly-owned utility generating plants.  The chart
   below represents WPL's proportionate share of such plants as reflected in
   the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1994 and 1993:

   </TABLE>

   Each of the respective joint owners finances its portion of construction
   costs.  WPL's share of operation and maintenance expenses is included in
   the Consolidated Statements of Income.

   b.   Capital Expenditures:

   The Company's capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated to total $102
   million.  Substantial commitments have been incurred for such
   expenditures.

   NOTE 3.  DEPRECIATION:

   The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation.  For utility
   plant, straight-line depreciation is computed on the average balance of
   depreciable property at individual straight-line PSCW approved rates that
   consider the estimated useful life and removal cost or salvage value as
   follows:

                Electric     Gas          Water     Common
      1994        3.2%       3.7%          2.5%      7.2%
      1993        3.2%       3.7%          2.5%      7.3%
      1992        3.2%       3.7%          2.6%      7.1%

   Estimated useful lives related to other property and equipment are from 3
   to 12 years for equipment and 31.5 to 40 years for buildings.

   NOTE 4.  NUCLEAR OPERATIONS:

   Depreciation expense related to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
   ("Kewaunee") includes a provision to accrue for the cost of
   decommissioning over the life of the plant, which totalled $13.4 million,
   $6.1 million and $3.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
   Wisconsin utilities with ownership of nuclear generating plants are
   required by the PSCW to establish and make annual contributions to
   external trust funds to provide for plant decommissioning.  Additionally,
   in July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic order covering utilities that have
   nuclear generation.  This order standardizes the escalation assumptions to
   be used in determining nuclear decommissioning liabilities.

   WPL's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be $159 million
   (in 1994 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013) based on a
   1992 study, using the immediate dismantlement method of decommissioning. 
   The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
   between the years 2014 and 2050 is $1.016 billion.  After-tax earnings on
   the tax-qualified and nontax-qualified decommissioning funds are assumed
   to be 6.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.  The future escalation
   rate is assumed to be 6.5 percent.

   Decommissioning costs and a charge to offset earnings on the external
   trusts are recorded as portions of depreciation expense and accumulated
   provision for depreciation on the Statements of Consolidated Income and
   the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.  As of December 31, 1994,
   the total decommissioning costs included in the accumulated provision for
   depreciation were approximately $62.8 million.

   WPL has established external trusts to hold decommissioning funds, and the
   PSCW has approved WPL's funding plan which provides for annual
   contributions of current accruals over the remaining service lives of the
   nuclear plants.  The earnings on the external trusts accumulate in the
   fund balance and in the accumulated provision for depreciation.  Such
   earnings on the external trust funds, which have been offset by a charge
   to depreciation expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income, were
   $2.7, $1.1 and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
   and 1992, respectively.

   Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy
   ("DOE") is responsible for the ultimate storage and disposal of spent
   nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors.  

   Interim storage space for spent nuclear fuel is currently provided at
   Kewaunee.  Currently there is on-site storage capacity for spent fuel
   through the year 1999.  Nuclear fuel, net, at December 31, consists of:

                                          1994                 1993
     Original cost of nuclear fuel      $155,190             $147,325
     Less--Accumulated amortization      135,794              129,325
                                        --------             --------
     Nuclear fuel, net                  $ 19,396             $ 18,000
                                        ========             ========
          
   The Price Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for public
   liability claims arising from a nuclear incident.  Accordingly, in the
   event of a nuclear incident, WPL, as a 41-percent owner of Kewaunee, is
   subject to an overall assessment of approximately $32.5 million per
   incident for its ownership share of this reactor, not to exceed $4.1
   million payable in any given year.

   Through its membership in Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, WPL has
   obtained property damage and decontamination insurance totalling $1.5
   billion for loss from damage at Kewaunee.  In addition, WPL maintains
   outage and replacement power insurance coverage totalling $101.4 million
   in the event an outage exceeds 21 weeks.

   NOTE 5.  NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:

   WPL has a contract with a financial organization to sell, with limited
   recourse, certain accounts receivable and unbilled revenues.  These
   receivables include customer receivables resulting from sales to other
   public utilities as well as from billings to the co-owners of the jointly-
   owned electric generating plants that WPL operates.  The contract allows
   WPL to sell up to $150 million of receivables at any time.  Expenses
   related to the sale of receivables are paid to the financial organization
   under this contract and include, along with various other fees, a monthly
   discount charge on the outstanding balance of receivables sold that
   approximated a 4.86 percent annual rate during 1994.  These costs are
   recovered in retail utility rates as an operating expense.  All billing
   and collection functions remain the responsibility of WPL.  The contract
   expires August 19, 1995, unless extended by mutual agreement.

   As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, proceeds from the sale of accounts
   receivable totalled $76.5  million and $74 million, respectively.  During
   1994, WPL sold an average of $82.3 million of accounts receivable per
   month, compared with $75.9 million in 1993.

   As a result of its diversified customer base and WPL's sale of
   receivables, the Company does not have any significant concentrations of
   credit risk in the December 31, 1994, net accounts receivable balance.

   NOTE 6.  REGULATORY ASSETS AND REGULATORY LIABILITIES:

   Certain costs and credits are deferred and amortized in accordance with

   NOTE 7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

   a.  Pension Plans:

   WPL has non-contributory, defined benefit retirement plans covering
   substantially all employees.  The benefits are based upon years of service
   and levels of compensation.  WPL's funding policy is to contribute at
   least the statutory minimum to a trust.

   The projected unit credit actuarial cost method was used to compute net
   pension costs and the accumulated and projected benefit obligations.  The
   discount rate used in determining those benefit obligations was 8.25, 7.25
   and 8.00 percent for 1994, 1993 and 1992 respectively.  The long-term rate
   of return on assets used in determining those benefit obligations was
   9.00, 9.75 and 10.00 percent for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

   The following table sets forth the funded status of the WPL plans and
   amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at
   December 31, 1994 and 1993:

   b.         Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance:

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted SFAS No. 106,
   "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". 
   SFAS No. 106 establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting
   for the Company's postretirement health care and life insurance benefits. 
   SFAS No. 106 requires the accrual of the expected cost of such benefits
   during the employees' years of service based on actuarial methodologies
   that closely parallel pension accounting requirements.  WPL has elected
   delayed recognition of the transition obligation and is amortizing the
   discounted present value of the transition obligation to expense over 20
   years.  For WPL, the cost of providing postretirement benefits, including
   the transition obligation, is being recovered in retail rates under
   current regulatory practices.

   The following table sets forth the plans' funded status:

                                                        1994        1993

                                                      ========    ========

   For 1994 and 1993, the annual net postretirement benefits costs recognized
   in the Consolidated Statements of Income consist of the following
   components:

                                                        1994        1993

         Service cost                                 $ 1,739     $ 1,463
         Interest cost on projected benefit
           obligation                                   3,135       3,151
         Actual return on plan assets                    (253)       (696)
         Amortization of transition obligation          1,527       1,560
         Amortization and deferral                       (381)        (27)
                                                      -------     -------
         Net postretirement benefits cost             $ 5,767     $ 5,451
                                                       ======      ======

   The postretirement benefits cost components for 1994 were calculated
   assuming health care cost trend rates ranging from 11.5 percent for 1994
   and decreasing to 5 percent by the year 2002.  The health care cost trend
   rate considers estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization
   or delivery, technological advances, and changes in the health status of
   the plan participants.  Increasing the health care cost trend rate by one
   percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1994 by $2.5  million
   and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the net
   periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year by $.4 million.

   The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
   postretirement obligation was 8.25  and 7.25 percent in 1994 and 1993,
   respectively.  The long-term rate of return on assets was 9.00 and 9.50
   percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Plan assets are primarily
   invested in common stock, bonds and fixed income securities.  The
   Company's funding policy is to contribute the tax-advantaged maximum to a
   trust.

   The costs for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits,
   based on an actuarial determination were $1.3 million in 1992.

   c. Other Postemployment Benefits:

   In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 
   No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits".  SFAS No.
   112, which was effective January 1, 1994, establishes standards of
   financial accounting and reporting for the estimated cost of benefits
   provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment
   but before retirement.  The effect of adopting SFAS No. 112 was not
   material.

   Changes in WPL's deferred income taxes arising from the adoption of SFAS
   No. 109 represent amounts recoverable or refundable through future rates
   and have been recorded as net regulatory assets totalling approximately
   $26 million and $29 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, on the
   Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These net regulatory assets are being
   recovered in rates over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets
   to which they pertain. 


   NOTE 9. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT:

   The Company and its subsidiaries maintain bank lines of credit, most of
   which are at the bank prime rates, to obtain short-term borrowing
   flexibility, including pledging lines of credit as security for any
   commercial paper outstanding.  Amounts available under these lines of
   credit totalled $97.5 million, $100 million and $70 million as of December
   31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Information regarding short-term
   debt and lines of credit is as follows:

   NOTE 10. CAPITALIZATION:

   a. Common Shareowners' Investment:

   During 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, the Company issued 337,980,
   451,233 and 528,142 new shares of common stock through its Dividend
   Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Savings Plan, generating
   proceeds of $9.6 million, $15.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively.
     
   On April 27, 1993, a public offering of 1.65 million newly issued shares
   of the Company's common stock, priced at $35.50 per share, raised net
   proceeds of $56.7 million.  The proceeds were used by the Company to
   refinance short-term debt and for general corporate purposes including
   construction.

   In February 1989, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a
   dividend distribution of one common stock purchase right ("right") on each
   outstanding share of the Company's common stock.  Each right would
   initially entitle shareowners to buy one-half of one share of the
   Company's common stock at an exercise price of $60.00 per share, subject
   to adjustment.  The rights are not currently exercisable, but would become
   exercisable if certain events occurred related to a person or group
   acquiring or attempting to acquire 20 percent or more of the outstanding
   shares of common stock.  The rights expire on February 22, 1999, unless
   the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

   Authorized shares of common stock total 100,000,000 as of December 31,
   1994, and can be categorized as follows:

   A retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, requires WPL to maintain a
   utility common equity level of 51.93 percent of total utility
   capitalization during the test year January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996. 
   In addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment of
   dividends by WPL to the Company that are in excess of the level forecasted
   in the rate order  ($58.1 million), if such dividends would reduce WPL's
   average common equity ratio below 51.93 percent.

   b.    Preferred Stock:

   On October 27, 1993, WPL issued two new series of preferred stock through
   two separate public offerings.  The 6.2 percent Series is non-redeemable
   for ten years and the 6.5 percent Series is non-redeemable for five years. 
   The proceeds from the sale were used to retire 150,000 shares of 7.56
   percent Series and 149,865 shares of 8.48 percent Series preferred stock.

   c.    Long-term Debt:

   Substantially all of WPL's utility plant is secured by its first mortgage
   bonds.  Current maturities of long-term debt are as follows: $2.8 million
   in 1995, $3.3 million in 1996, $67.6 million in 1997, $11.6 million in
   1998 and $2.1 million in 1999.

   The Company has $150 million of notional principal under interest rate
   swap contracts.  The fair value of these contracts was not material as of
   December 31, 1994.

   The fair value of the Company's long-term debt based on quoted market
   prices for similar issues at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was $501,530 and
   $518,251, respectively.

   NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

   a.  Coal Contract Commitments:

   To ensure an adequate supply of coal, WPL has entered into certain
   long-term coal contracts.  These contracts include a demand or take-or-pay
   clause under which payments are required if contracted quantities are not
   purchased.  Purchase obligations on these coal and related rail contracts
   total approximately $149 million through December 31, 2003.  WPL's
   management believes it will meet minimum coal and rail purchase
   obligations under the contracts.  Minimum purchase obligations on these
   contracts over the next five years are estimated to be $25 million in 1995
   and $26 million in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.

   b.  Purchased Power and Gas:

   Under firm purchase power and gas contracts, WPL is obligated as follows
   (dollars in millions):

                              Purchased Power         Purchased Gas 
                             Purchase               Purchase  Decatherms

                             ======       ======     ====        ===

   c.  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

   Historically, WPL has owned 11 properties that have been associated with
   the production of manufactured gas.  Currently, WPL owns five of these
   sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining three are
   owned by private companies.  In 1989, WPL initiated investigation of these
   manufactured gas plant sites.  The Wisconsin Department of Natural
   Resources ("DNR") has been involved in reviewing investigation plans and
   has received ongoing reports regarding these investigations.

   In 1992, and into the beginning of 1993, WPL continued its investigations
   and studies.  WPL confirmed that there was no contamination at two of the
   sites.  WPL received a close-out letter from the DNR related to one of
   those sites and requested a close-out letter for the other site. 
   Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
   indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
   In February 1993, WPL completed cost estimates for the environmental
   remediation of the eight remaining sites.  The results of this analysis
   indicate that during the next 35 years, WPL will expend approximately $81
   million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil remediation
   activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation activities,
   including construction of slurry containment walls and the installation of
   groundwater pump and treatment facilities.  This estimate was based on
   various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and revision by
   management.

   The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average inflation over
   a 35 year period.  The cost estimate also contemplates that primarily
   groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after 1998
   through and including 2027.  During this time, WPL estimates that it will
   incur average annual costs of $2.0 million to complete the planned
   groundwater remediation activities.

   With respect to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has approved a five
   year amortization of the unamortized balance of environmental costs
   expended to date.

   In addition, WPL is pursuing insurance recovery for the costs of
   remediating these sites and is investigating to determine whether there
   are other parties who may be responsible for some of the clean-up costs.

   Through 1994, management has continued its oversight of the issues related
   to the above manufactured gas plant sites without significant revision to
   the above estimates and assumptions.

   Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management believes
   that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant sites will
   be recovered in rates.

   NOTE 13.  ACQUISITIONS:

   On August 31, 1993, the Company issued 515,993 shares of Company common
   stock in exchange for the outstanding common and preferred stock of Jones
   and Neuse, Inc. ("JN"), a 250-employee environmental consulting and
   engineering service firm based in Austin, Texas.  This transaction was
   accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The Company positioned JN as a
   service region of its own 550-employee environmental consulting and
   engineering company, RMT, a subsidiary of HDC.

   In February 1993, HDC acquired A&C Enercom Consultants, Inc., a Georgia
   corporation, for cash and new shares of the Company's common stock.  A&C
   Enercom provides demand-side management and energy-related consulting
   services, primarily to public electric and gas utility companies.

              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULES


   To WPL Holdings, Inc.:


   We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
   the consolidated financial statements included in the 1994 Form 10-K of
   WPL Holdings, Inc. and have issued our report thereon dated February 1,
   1995.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
   statements taken as a whole.  Supplemental Schedules I and II are the
   responsibility of the Company's management and are presented for purposes
   of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are
   not part of the basic consolidated financial statements.  These schedules
   have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
   basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state
   in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
   therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
   as a whole.

                              Stocks and Transfers

        Section 1 - Each holder of fully paid stock shall be entitled to a
   certificate or certificates of stock, stating the number of shares owned
   by such shareowner and the designation of the Class and Series in which
   issued.  All stock certificates shall be signed by the President or the
   Vice President and by the Secretary of the Company, and be sealed with the
   corporate seal of the Company, which seal may be facsimile, engraved or
   printed.  If and when a Transfer Agent and/or a Registrar shall have been
   appointed by the Board with respect to the shares of any class of stock,
   or series thereof, of the Company, the certificates representing such
   shares shall also be countersigned by such Transfer Agent and/or
   countersigned and registered by such Registrar, as the case may be. 
   Certificates which have been countersigned by a Transfer Agent and
   countersigned and registered by a Registrar, in both cases duly appointed
   by the Board of Directors for such purpose, may bear the signatures of the
   President or the Vice President and the Secretary of the Company in
   facsimile, engraved or printed; provided, that no certificate bearing the
   facsimile signatures of the Officers of the Company shall be valid or
   effective for any purpose unless and until it shall have been so
   countersigned and registered.  In case any such Officer who has signed any
   stock certificate, or whose facsimile signature has been placed thereon,
   shall have ceased to be such Officer before such certificate is issued,
   such certificate may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if
   such Officer had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue.

        Section 2 - The stock of the Company shall be divided into such
   Classes, with such relative rights and preferences, as shall be provided
   by the Articles of Organization of the Company as the same may from time
   to time be amended in accordance with the laws of Wisconsin.

        Section 3 - Shares of stock shall be transferable only on the books
   of the Company; and upon proper endorsement and surrender of the
   outstanding certificates representing the same.  Subject to such
   conditions as the Board of Directors may, by Resolution, establish:  (a)
   If an outstanding certificate of stock shall be lost, destroyed or stolen,
   the holder thereof may have a new certificate issued, upon producing
   evidence satisfactory to the Officers of the Company, of such loss,
   destruction or theft; and upon furnishing to the Company a bond of
   indemnity, surety bond, or such other assurance as the Officers may
   require.  (b) Where any outstanding certificates of stock are deemed
   abandoned by the holder thereof, pursuant to the unclaimed property or
   escheatment laws of any state having jurisdiction thereof, the Officers of
   the Company are authorized and directed to cause the transfer and delivery
   of said certificates or to cause the issuance of replacement certificates,
   to such person or persons as may be entitled thereto in accordance with
   such escheatment laws.

        Section 4 - Transfer books may be closed by order of the Board of
   Directors for short periods, not exceeding forty days at any one time, for

            signed by the facsimile signature of the President or the

            maintained and accounted for by the cashier or other employee
            assigned such responsibility by the Treasurer.

                 countersigned on behalf of the Company by such employees as
                 the Treasurer or President may from time to time authorize
                 and designate; provided, however, that no such check shall
                 be signed and countersigned by the same person.

            (b)  No payment out of petty cash funds, whether by cash or
                 check, shall exceed $2,500.

        6.  Checks drawn on special accounts which the Company creates or

            President and shall not require any countersignature.

        7.  All bonds and notes issued under an indenture or mortgage shall
            be executed on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile

   Officers, is authorized to direct any depository:

        (a)      to charge amounts directly to the account of the Company
                 without the issuance of a check or draft of the Company, for
                 the purpose of paying principal of and interest on bonds and
                 notes issued by the Company, and

        (b)      to accept and process data submitted via electronic means or
                 by wire transfer for purposes of receipt or disbursement of
                 funds;

        Section 2 - Mandatory Indemnification -

        1.  The Corporation shall indemnify a Director or Officer, to the
            extent he or she has been successful on the merits or otherwise
            in the defense of a proceeding, for all reasonable expenses
            incurred in the proceeding if the Director or Officer was a party
            because he or she is a Director or Officer of the Corporation.

        2.  a.  In cases not included under sub. 1., the Corporation shall
            indemnify a Director or Officer against liability incurred by the
            Director or Officer in a proceeding to which the Director or
            Officer was a party because he or she is a Director or Officer of
            the Corporation, unless liability was incurred because the
            Director or Officer breached or failed to perform a duty he or
            she owes to the Corporation and the breach or failure to perform
            constitutes any of the following:

                1) A willful failure to deal fairly with the Corporation or

                   Director or Officer has a material conflict of interest.

                2) A violation of criminal law, unless the Director or
                   Officer had reasonable cause to believe his or her
                   conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe his
                   or her conduct was unlawful.

                3) A transaction from which the Director or Officer derived
                   an improper personal profit.

                4) Willful misconduct.

                settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of no contest or an
                equivalent plea, does not, by itself, create a presumption
                that indemnification of the Director or Officer is not
                required under this subsection.

        3.  A Director or Officer who seeks indemnification under this
            section shall make a written request to the Corporation.

        4.  a.  Indemnification under this Article X is not required to the
                extent limited by the articles of incorporation under
                Section 180.048, Wis. Stats.

            b.  Indemnification under this Article X is not required if the
                Director or Officer has previously received indemnification

                or allowance of expenses from any person, including the
                Corporation, in connection with the same proceeding.

        Section 3 - Determination of Right to Indemnification - Unless
   otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation or bylaws or by
   written agreement between the Director or Officer and the Corporation, the
   Director or Officer seeks indemnification under Section 2, 2. shall select
   one of the following means for determining his or her right to
   indemnification:

        1.  By a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors
            consisting of Directors not at the time parties to the same or
            related proceedings.  If a quorum of disinterested Directors
            cannot be obtained, by majority vote of a committee duly
            appointed by the Board of Directors and consisting solely of 2 or
            more Directors not at the time parties to the same or related
            proceedings.  Directors who are parties to the same or related
            proceedings may participate in the designation of members of the
            committee.

        2.  By independent legal counsel selected by a quorum of the Board of
            Directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in 1., above,
            if unable to obtain such a quorum or committee, by a majority
            vote of the full Board of Directors, including Directors who are
            parties to the same or related proceedings.

        3.  By a panel of three arbitrators consisting of one arbitrator
            selected by those Directors entitled under 2., above, to select
            independent legal counsel, one arbitrator selected by the
            Director or Officer seeking indemnification and one arbitrator
            selected by the two arbitrators previously selected.

        4.  By an affirmative vote of shares as provided in Section 180.28,
            Wis. Stats., shares owned by, or voted under the control of,
            persons who are at the time parties to the same or related
            proceedings, whether as plaintiffs or defendants or in any other
            capacity, may not be voted in making the determination.

        5.  By a court under Section 180.051, Wis. Stats., as created by 1987
            Wisconsin Act 13.

        6.  By any other method provided for in any additional right to
            indemnification permitted under Section 5, below.
    

        Section 4 - Allowance of Expenses as Incurred - Upon written request
   by a Director or Officer who is a party to a proceeding, the Corporation
   may pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses as incurred if the
   Director or Officer provides the Corporation with all of the following:

        1.  A written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or
            she has not breached or failed to perform his or her duties to
            the Corporation.

        2.  A written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her
            behalf, to repay the allowance and/if required by the
            Corporation, to pay reasonable interest on the allowance to the
            extent that it is ultimately determined under Section 3, above,
            that indemnification under Section 2, above, is not required and
            that indemnification is not ordered by a court.  The undertaking
            under this subsection shall be an unlimited general obligation of
            the Director or Officer and may be accepted without reference to
            his or her ability to repay the allowance.  The undertaking may
            be secured or unsecured.

        Section 5 - Additional Rights to Indemnification and Allowance of
   Expenses  

        1.  Except as provided in 2. below, Sections 2 and 4 above, do not
            preclude any additional right to indemnification or allowance of
            expenses that a Director or Officer may have under any of the
            following:

            a.  The articles of incorporation or bylaws.

            b.  A written agreement between the Director or Officer and the
                Corporation.

            c.  A resolution of the Board of Directors.

            d.  A resolution, after notice, adopted by a majority vote of all
                the Corporation's voting shares then issued and outstanding.

        2.  Regardless of the existence of an additional right under
            subsection 1., above, the Corporation may not indemnify a
            Director or Officer, or permit a Director or Officer to retain
            any allowance of expenses unless it is determined by or on behalf
            of the Corporation that the Director or Officer did not breach or
            fail to perform a duty he or she owes to the Corporation which
            constitutes conduct under Section 2, 2. a. 1), 2), 3) or 4).  A
            Director or Officer who is a party to the same or related
            proceeding for which indemnification or an allowance of expenses
            is sought may not participate in a determination under this
            subsection.

        3.  No provision of this Article X shall affect the Corporation's
            power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a Director or
            Officer in any of the following circumstances:

            a.  As a witness in a proceeding to which he or she is not a
   party.

            b.  As a plaintiff or petitioner in a proceeding because he or
                she is or was an employee, agent, Director or Officer of the
                Corporation.

        Section 6 - Insurance - The Corporation may purchase and maintain
   insurance on behalf of an individual who is an employee, agent, Director
   or Officer of the Corporation against liability asserted against or
   incurred by the individual in his or her capacity as an employee, agent,
   Director or Officer or arising from his or her status as an employee,
   agent, Director or Officer, regardless of whether the Corporation is
   required or authorized to indemnify or allow expenses to the individual
   against the same liability under Sections 2, 3, 4 or 5 of this Article X.

        Section 7 - Indemnification and Insurance Against Securities Law 
   Claims - Sections 1 through 6, inclusive, apply to the extent applicable
   to any other proceeding, to any proceeding involving a federal or state
   statute, rule or regulation regulating the offer, sale or purchase of
   securities, securities brokers or dealers, or investment companies or
   investment advisers.


        Section 8 - Reliance by Directors or Officers -

        1.  Unless the Director or Officer has knowledge that makes reliance
            unwarranted, a Director or Officer, in discharging his or her
            duties to the Corporation, may rely on information, opinions,
            reports or statements, any of which may be written or oral,
            formal or informal, including financial statements and other
            financial data, if prepared or presented by any of the following:

            a.  An Officer or employee of the Corporation whom the Director
                or Officer believes in good faith to be reliable and
                competent in the matters presented.

            b.  Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to
                matters the Director or Officer believes in good faith are
                within the person's professional or expert competence.

            c.  In the case of reliance by a Director, a committee of the
                Board of Directors of which the Director is not a member if
                the Director believes in good faith that the committee merits
                confidence.

         2.     This section does not apply to a Director's reliance under
                Section 180.40(3), Wis. Stats., as in effect on the date of
                adoption hereof.


        Section 9 - Consideration of Interests in Addition to Shareholders'
   Interests - In discharging his or her duties to the Corporation and in
   determining what he or she believes to be in the best interests of the
   Corporation, a Director or Officer may, in addition to considering the
   effects of any action on shareholders, consider the following:

        1.  The effects of the action on employees, suppliers and customers
            of the Corporation.

         the fourth Friday of the month following the month in which the
         Participant ceases to be a member of the Board.


   Section VIII - Interest Credit to Participant Accounts

   8.1   All deferred amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall be
         credited interest on December 31 at a rate equivalent to the
         A-Utility Bond yield (as reported in the Federal Reserve statistical
         release H.15) using the average of the rates reported for the last
         Friday of each month for the preceding  twelve (12) calendar months. 
         Interest shall continue to be credited and compounded in this manner
         until the final payment shall have been made from the Participant's
         Account.

         Partial year interest accruals for Participants who because of
         financial hardship, termination or death during the Plan Year will
         also be computed at a rate equivalent to the A-Utility Bond yield
         (in the manner prescribed above) using the average rates from the
         January 1 preceding the Participant's termination date through the
         fourth Friday of the month preceding the Participant's termination
         date.  Interest payments will apply to amounts deferred up to the
         date the plan distribution is made.

   8.2   The interest credit rate determined in Section 8.1 will be applied
         to the average Participant Account balance for that period.


   Section IX - Rights of Participants and Forfeiture

   9.1   Nothing contained in the Plan shall

         (a)  confer upon any Director the right to continue on the Board of
              Directors, or

              provided for herein, or

         (c)  confer upon any Director or other person any claim or right to
              any distribution under the Plan except in accordance with its
              terms.

         actual payment or distribution to such Participant, be assignable or
         transferable in whole or in part, either voluntarily or by operation
         of law or otherwise, or be subject to payment of debts of any
         Participant by execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge,
         bankruptcy of in any other manner.

   9.3   If a Participant has elected to defer pursuant to Section 4.1 and
         his or her services as a member of the Board are terminated
         voluntarily or involuntarily, the Participant shall retain all
         rights to the undistributed amounts credited to his or her
         Participant Account.

   9.4   The deferral amount and investment earnings of the plan is and shall
         remain at all times subject to the claims of the general creditors
         of the Company.   As such, the Plan Participants have the status of
         general unsecured creditors of the Company and this Plan constitutes
         a mere promise by the Company to make benefit payments to
         Participants in the future.

         unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of title I of ERISA.

         amount of any such distribution shall be limited to the amount
         deemed necessary by the Compensation and Personnel  Committee to
         alleviate or remedy the Participant's hardship.  Such distributions
         shall be made in a lump sum pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 8.2 on the
         fourth Friday of the month following the month of committee
         approval.

         cease deferrals during the plan year on the Board meeting date
         following the committee approval in response to an Unforeseeable
         Emergency.


   Section XIII - Distribution in the Event of Significant Change in Tax Law

   13.1  Under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, the
         Compensation and Personnel Committee may allow payments to a
         Participant before any payments would otherwise be due if the
         Compensation  and Personnel Committee determines, based on changes
         in the Federal tax or revenue laws, a published ruling or similar
         announcement issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a regulation
         issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, a decision by a court of
         competent jurisdiction involving a Participant or a beneficiary, or
         a closing agreement made under section 7121 of the Internal Revenue
         Code which has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service and

         paid.


   Section XIV - Administration

   14.1  The Compensation and  Personnel Committee may from time to time
         amend, suspend, terminate or reinstate any or all of the provisions
         of the Plan as may seem necessary or advisable for the
         administration of the Plan.

   14.2  The Compensation and Personnel Committee shall, subject to express
         provisions of the Plan, have power to construe the Plan, to

         of the Plan.  The Compensation and Personnel Committee may correct
         any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in
         the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to
         carry it into effect.

             THIS AGREEMENT made as of the 21st day of December, 1994, by and
   between Heartland Development Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (the

             WHEREAS, the Shareholder serves as President of Holdings with
   supervisory responsibility for the Company and serves as Chairman of the
   Company;

             WHEREAS, to promote continuity of management and retain the
   services of the Shareholder and enhance the interest of the Shareholder in
   the success of the Company, Holdings believes it is in its and its
   shareholders' best interests to grant an equity interest in the Company to
   the Shareholder and to provide the Shareholder with rights to exchange
   shares of the Company for shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value
   ("Holdings Common Stock") of Holdings, which exchange is intended by
   Holdings and the Shareholder to qualify as a reorganization under the
   Internal Revenue Code Section 368(a)(1)(B);

             WHEREAS, Holdings, the Company and the Shareholder believe it to
   be in the best interests of the parties hereto to assure the continuity of

   Company ("Stock") to be granted to the Shareholder pursuant to this
   Agreement by providing for, among other things, certain restrictions on
   the transfer of such Stock;

             WHEREAS, the Wisconsin Marital Property Law, Wisconsin Statutes
   Chapter 766, effective January 1, 1986, may have the effect of vesting in
   the Shareholder's spouse (the "Spouse") an interest in the Stock to be
   owned by the Shareholder, which interest may take the form of an interest
   in marital property or deferred marital property under such law; and

             WHEREAS, the Shareholder desires to provide for the disposition
   of any interest that the Shareholder's Spouse may obtain in the
   Shareholder's Stock by reason of the Wisconsin Marital Property Law.

             NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
   agreements contained herein, the parties hereto mutually agree and
   covenant as follows:

             1.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following

             "Cause" means any one or more of the following: (i) theft,

   immediately preceding the date in question, divided by the number of
   shares of Stock outstanding as of the date of such financial statements,
   plus any additional shares of Stock that have vested in the Shareholder
   pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to the date of such financial
   statements (with such share numbers appropriately adjusted for any stock
   splits); provided, however, that no value shall be given to goodwill,
   going concern value, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, trade names,
   patents or other intangible assets of the Company.  Net Book Value Per

             "Purchaser."  The Company shall at all times have the right (but
   not the obligation) to arrange for the purchase by one or more Purchasers
   in the Company's stead of all or part of any Stock that the Company has
   the right or obligation to purchase pursuant to any Section of this
   Agreement.  The term "Purchaser" shall mean an individual or entity
   designated by the Company to purchase Stock in lieu of the Company, as
   provided by the preceding sentence, in such amounts and on such terms and
   conditions as the Company shall determine. Such designation of a Purchaser
   or Purchasers and such determination of amounts, terms and conditions
   shall be made by the Company's Board of Directors.  Each Purchaser shall

   appropriate Section of this Agreement for any Stock purchased by such
   Purchaser.

             "Sale Notice" is defined in Section 10(A).

   purchaser or purchasers, other than one or more of the existing
   shareholders, in a transaction or series of transactions in any one (1)

             "Valuation Formula Price" means a price as of the most recent
   Fiscal Year as determined by an independent appraiser selected by the
   Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Holdings and the
   Shareholder, provided however, if Holdings and the Shareholder cannot
   agree on an appraiser each of Holdings and the Shareholder shall select an
   appraiser and each of such appraisers so selected shall select a third
   appraiser.  The Valuation Formula Price shall be the average of the fair
   market values determined by such three appraisers.

             2.   Grant of Stock.  In consideration of the continued
   employment of the Shareholder by Holdings and the Company, the Company
   grants to the Shareholder 1.67 shares of Stock upon the terms and
   conditions set forth herein.

             3.   Vesting.  As long as the Shareholder is still serving the
   Company as its Chairman, the Stock granted to the Shareholder pursuant to
   Section 2 hereof shall vest in the Shareholder as follows: (i) .4175
   shares of Stock on December 21, 1994; (ii) .4175 shares of Stock on March
   31, 1995; (iii) .4175 shares of Stock on March 31, 1996; and (iv) .4175
   shares of Stock on March 31, 1997.  Notwithstanding the vesting schedule
   above, (A) all shares of Stock granted to the Shareholder pursuant to
   Section 2 hereof shall vest in the Shareholder if there is a Sale of or
   public offering by the Company and (B) in the event of the Executive's
   death or Disability prior to March 31, 1997, a pro rata portion (based on
   the number of days elapsed from the immediately preceding March 31 to the
   date of death or Disability) of the Stock that would have vested on the
   next succeeding March 31 shall vest as of the date of death or Disability.

             4.  Restrictions on Transferability.

             (A)  Except as hereinafter provided, the Shareholder may not
   sell, pledge, encumber, transfer by or pursuant to a gift or bequest or
   otherwise transfer or dispose of, and will not permit to be sold,
   encumbered, attached, or otherwise disposed of or transferred in any
   manner, either voluntarily or by operation of law (collectively referred
   to as "Transfer"), all or any portion of the Stock granted to the
   Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, or any Stock at any time hereafter
   acquired by the Shareholder in respect of such Stock, except in accordance
   with and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

             (B)  For purposes of this Agreement, all references to Stock
   owned or held by the Shareholder shall include, without limitation, all
   interests in Stock now owned or hereafter acquired by the Spouse as
   marital property or pursuant to the Spouse's elective rights to deferred
   marital property or to an augmented marital property estate.  The creation
   of an interest in the Stock in the Spouse by operation of marital property
   laws during the Shareholder's lifetime shall not be deemed to be a
   Transfer of such Stock or any portion thereof for purposes of this
   Agreement so long as (i) the Stock in which such interest is created
   continues to be registered solely in the name of the Shareholder and (ii)
   the Shareholder maintains full management and control rights with respect
   to such Stock; provided, however, that if either of the foregoing
   conditions shall cease to be satisfied, then the Shareholder and the
   Company shall have the option to purchase the Spouse's interest in the
   Stock in the sequence and manner and upon the same terms and conditions as
   specified in Section 9 hereof as if the marital relationship of the
   Shareholder and the Spouse had been terminated.  During the marriage of
   the Shareholder and the Spouse, the Shareholder's obligation to sell or to
   offer to sell Stock and the Company's option or right to purchase the
   Stock hereunder shall include an obligation on the part of the Spouse to
   sell or to offer to sell any interest of the Spouse in the Stock in the
   same manner and upon the same terms and conditions.

             (C)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
   the Shareholder may not Transfer any shares of Stock granted pursuant to
   Section 2 hereof until such shares are vested pursuant to Section 3
   hereof.

             5.   Right of First Refusal.

             (A)  If the Shareholder desires to Transfer any Stock (other
   than pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 or to the Company), then the Shareholder
   shall give prior written notice ("Transfer Notice") of such intention to
   the Company specifying the name of the proposed transferee, the proposed
   consideration for such transfer, the number of shares involved and all
   other terms of the proposed transfer.  Such Transfer Notice shall
   constitute an offer to sell to the Company the number of shares of Stock
   indicated in the Transfer Notice at a price per share equal to the lesser
   of the price specified in the Transfer Notice per share or the Net Book
   Value Per Share (or if after March 31, 1997, the Valuation Formula Price)
   as of the date of the Transfer Notice.  Within thirty (30) days after
   receipt of such Transfer Notice, the Company may, at its option, elect to
   purchase all, but not less than all, of the shares of Stock offered.  The
   Company shall exercise its option to purchase by delivering written notice
   thereof to the Shareholder within the option period.

             (B)  If the Company elects to purchase the Shareholder's Stock
   as provided in Section 5(A), then the terms of payment for such purchase
   shall be the terms offered by the Shareholder's proposed transferee as
   specified in the Transfer Notice; provided, however, if the shares of
   Stock are offered for purchase because of a Transfer by operation of law,
   the terms of such purchase shall be cash at the closing.  The closing of
   any sale made pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof shall be held not later than
   sixty (60) days after receipt of the Transfer Notice by the Company or on
   such other date as mutually agreed by the Company and the Shareholder.

             (C)  If the Company is entitled to purchase the Shareholder's
   Stock as provided herein but does not elect to do so, then the Shareholder
   may make a bona fide transfer of the Stock described in the Transfer
   Notice to the prospective purchaser named in the Transfer Notice.  Such
   transfer shall be made only in strict accordance with the specific terms
   stated in the Transfer Notice and only if such purchaser agrees in writing
   to sign a counterpart of this Agreement so as to impose on the Stock so
   transferred restrictions on further transferability identical to the
   restrictions imposed by this Agreement, and to bind the transferee as if
   such transferee were a party hereto.  If, however, the Shareholder fails
   to make such transfer in compliance with this Section 5(B) within thirty
   (30) days following the expiration of the last time period provided in
   Section 5(A) above, the Shareholder's Stock shall again become subject to
   all the restrictions of this Agreement.

             6.   Pledge.  If the Shareholder desires to voluntarily Transfer
   by pledge, security interest or other encumbrance ("Pledge") any of the
   Shareholder's Stock (other than to the Company), then the Shareholder
   shall first give notice thereof to the Company, setting forth the terms of
   Pledge and affording to the Company a period of not less than ten (10)
   days within which to consult and advise with the Shareholder and attempt
   to arrange an acceptable alternative to such Pledge, if desirable and
   feasible.  Such notice period may be waived or shortened by written notice
   from the Company to the Shareholder.  Any attempted Pledge in violation of
   this Agreement shall be void.  If no mutually acceptable alternative is
   arranged within such period, then the Shareholder shall be free to effect
   such Pledge, provided that the Shareholder shall continue to be subject to
   all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in respect to the
   Shareholder's interest in the Pledged Stock, and the holding by the
   pledgee shall likewise be subject to all such terms and provisions as
   though the pledgee were a party hereto.  So long as such Pledge is in
   effect, if the Shareholder shall default (or be deemed by the pledgee to
   be in default), then the Company shall at all times thereafter have the
   immediate and continuing option to purchase the Pledged Stock (whether
   still in Pledge or in the ownership of the pledgee or any other
   transferee) upon notice by the Company to the Shareholder, pledgee or
   other record holder, at the Net Book Value Per Share as of the date of
   default and in current and immediately available funds within thirty (30)
   days after notice has been given of election to purchase such shares or on
   such other date as mutually agreed by the Company and the Shareholder,
   pledgee or other recordholder, as the case may be.

             7.   Termination of Employment.

             (A)  In the event of the Shareholder's death, Disability or
   termination from employment without Cause, or resignation after March 31,
   1997 or termination for Cause after March 31, 1997, (i) the Shareholder or
   the personal representative of the Shareholder's estate shall be required
   to sell all Stock held or owned by such Shareholder, and the Company shall
   be required to purchase all such Stock, at a purchase price per share
   equal to the Valuation Formula Price as of the date of death, Disability
   or termination or resignation after March 31, 1997, as the case may be;
   and (ii) any shares of Stock granted to the Shareholder pursuant to
   Section 2 hereof but not vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall
   automatically be forfeited and returned to the Company and any dividend or
   other distribution held in trust by the Company pursuant to Section 13
   hereof and applicable to such shares shall automatically be forfeited to
   the Company.

             (B)  In the event of the Shareholder's resignation from his
   employment by Holdings or the Company prior to March 31, 1997 or Holdings
   or the Company's termination of the Shareholder's employment for Cause
   prior to March 31, 1997, (i) such Shareholder shall be required to sell
   all Stock held or owned by such Shareholder, and the Company shall be
   required to purchase all such Stock at a purchase price per share equal to
   the Net Book Value Per Share as of the date of resignation or termination,
   and (ii) any shares of Stock granted to the Shareholder pursuant to
   Section 2 hereof but not vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall
   automatically be forfeited and returned to the Company and any dividend or
   other distribution held in trust by the Company pursuant to Section 13
   hereof and applicable to such shares shall automatically be forfeited to
   the Company.

             (C)  For purchases and sales pursuant to Section 7(A) or 7(B),
   the purchase price shall be paid in current and immediately available
   funds within thirty (30) days after such termination described in Section
   7(A) or 7(B) or on such other date as mutually agreed by the Company and
   the Shareholder or the personal representative of the Shareholder's
   estate, as the case may be.

             8.   Involuntary Transfer.  Whenever the Shareholder has any
   notice or knowledge of any attempted, impending or consummated involuntary
   Transfer of any of the Shareholder's Stock, whether by operation of law or
   otherwise, the Shareholder shall give immediate written notice thereof to
   the Company.  Whenever the Company has any other notice or knowledge of
   any such attempted, impending or consummated involuntary Transfer, it may
   give written notice thereof to the Shareholder.  In either case, the
   Shareholder will forthwith disclose to the Company all pertinent
   information in his possession relating thereto.  If any Stock is subject
   to any such involuntary Transfer, the Company shall at all times have the
   immediate and continuing option to purchase such Stock upon notice by the
   Company to the Shareholder or other record holder, at the Net Book Value
   Per Share or in event of an involuntary transfer after March 31, 1997, at
   the Valuation Formula Price as of the date of involuntary Transfer and in
   current and immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after
   notice has been given of election to purchase such shares or on such other
   date as mutually agreed by the Company and the Shareholder or other record
   holder, as the case may be, and Stock so purchased shall in every case be
   free and clear of such Transfer.

             9.  Termination of Marital Relationship.

             (A)  If the marital relationship of the Shareholder and the
   Spouse is terminated by the death of the Spouse or by divorce, annulment,
   legal separation or other termination by judicial process ("Divorce") and
   the Shareholder does not receive, or succeed to, all interests of the
   Spouse in Stock acquired through marital property laws or otherwise,
   whether by testamentary disposition, operation of law, property settlement
   agreement, court order or otherwise, then the Shareholder will have the
   option to purchase any part or all of the Spouse's interest in the Stock
   and the Spouse or the personal representative of the Spouse's estate, as
   the case may be, shall be obligated to sell such interest in the Stock at
   the Net Book Value Per Share if prior to March 31, 1997, and thereafter at
   the Valuation Formula Price as of the date of death or Divorce, as the
   case may be, and in current and immediately available funds within thirty
   (30) days after notice has been given (as provided for below) or on such
   other date as mutually agreed by the Company, the Shareholder and the
   Spouse or the personal representative of the Spouse's estate, as the case
   may be.

             (B)  If the Shareholder elects to purchase the Spouse's interest
   in the Stock in whole or in part, the Shareholder shall signify such
   election and the portion of the Spouse's interest in the Stock to be
   purchased by written notice delivered to the Spouse or the personal
   representative of the Spouse's estate and to the Company within sixty (60)
   days after the date of the Spouse's death or the effective date of the
   Divorce.

             (C)  If the Shareholder fails to exercise such option in full
   within such 60-day period, the Company shall, during the 60-day period
   following the later of (i) the expiration of the 60-day period described
   in Section 9(B) or (ii) the date upon which the Company shall receive
   actual notice of the Spouse's death or Divorce, have the option to
   purchase that portion of the Spouse's interest in the Stock not purchased
   by the Shareholder upon written notice delivered within such latter 60-day
   period to the Spouse or to the personal representative of the Spouse's
   estate.  If the Company elects to purchase that portion of the Spouse's
   interest not purchased by the Shareholder as provided herein, the price
   shall be the Net Book Value Per Share if prior to December 21, 1997, and
   thereafter at the Valuation Formula Price as of the date of death or
   Divorce, as the case may be, and such payment shall be in current and
   immediately available funds within thirty (30) days after notice of such
   election has been given or on such other date as mutually agreed by the
   Company and the Spouse or the personal representative of the Spouse's
   estate, as the case may be.

             (D)  Upon lapse in whole or in part of the Shareholder's and the
   Company's option heretofore described, the Spouse or the personal
   representative of the Spouse's estate, as the case may be, shall continue
   to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement with respect to any
   interest in the Stock not purchased pursuant to this Section 9; provided,
   however, that the personal representative may transfer any part or all of
   the Stock not so purchased pursuant to the terms of the Spouse's Last Will
   and Testament or other estate planning documents or pursuant to the laws
   of intestacy (if applicable) of the state of which the Spouse shall have
   been a resident on the date of the Spouse's death (the transferee being
   hereinafter referred to as "Transferee"); provided, further, that all
   interests in the Stock so transferred shall continue to be subject to all
   of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The Shareholder's
   obligation to sell or to offer to sell Stock pursuant to this Agreement
   shall include an obligation on the part of the Spouse, the personal
   representative of the Spouse's estate, or the Transferee to sell or to
   offer to sell the interest in the Stock owned by such person in the same
   manner and upon the same terms and conditions. In the absence of a court
   order, no obligation to cause shares representing an interest in the Stock
   owned by the Spouse, the personal representative of the Spouse's estate or
   the Transferee to be registered in such person's name if such shares shall
   then be registered in the Shareholder's name.  The Company shall have the
   right to require, as a condition to any transfer of Stock on the books of
   the Company, that the Transferee execute a shareholders' agreement
   substantially in the form of this Agreement.

             10.  Sale of the Company.

             (A)  In the event of an impending Sale of the Company, the
   Company shall send prior written notice of such impending sale (the "Sale
   Notice") to the Shareholder, which notice shall set forth the
   consideration to be paid for each share of Stock and the terms and
   conditions of the proposed sale. Within five (5) days after the date of
   the Sale Notice, the Shareholder shall have the right to require, by
   written notice to the Company, that all, but not less than all, of his
   Stock, whether vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof or not, be included in
   such sale, on substantially the same terms and conditions and for the same
   or equivalent consideration as are available to other shareholders.  If
   the Sale of the Company is accomplished pursuant to a sale of
   substantially all of the Company's assets, then the Company shall fulfill
   its obligation under this Section by distributing to the Shareholder his
   pro-rata share of the proceeds of such sale.

             (B)  If the Sale Notice so provides, the Shareholder shall be
   required to sell all of his Stock at the same price, on the same terms and
   conditions, at such time (which may be immediately) and in such manner as
   specified in the Sale Notice.

             11.  Public Offering.  In the event of a Public Offering,
   Sections 4(A), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.1 of this Agreement shall
   terminate; provided, however, that obligations to make payments, if the
   event creating such obligations occurred prior to the Public Offering,
   shall not hereby be terminated.

             11.1 Exchange of Stock for WPL Holdings, Inc. Common Stock.

             (A)  Commencing on March 31, 1997 and on March 31 of each year
   thereafter, or next succeeding business day if such date is not a business
   day, (each such date separately the "Exchange Date"), the Shareholder
   shall be entitled to exchange 33 1/3% of the shares of Stock owned by the
   Shareholder on the Exchange Date for shares of Holdings Common Stock.  If
   the Shareholder does not exercise his exchange option on any Exchange
   Date, he shall then be entitled to exchange the following Applicable
   Percentage of shares of Stock owned on subsequent Exchange Dates.

            Years from              Applicable
      Previous Exchange Date        Percentage

                1                     33 1/3
                2                       55
                3                       70
                4                       80
                5                      100 

             When the remaining shares of Stock owned by the Shareholder
   equal .5 shares or less, the next Applicable Percentage shall be 100%.  

             For purposes of such exchange, each share of Stock shall be
   valued at the Valuation Formula Price and shares of Holdings Common Stock
   shall be valued at their Fair Market Value.  Fair Market Value of Holdings
   Common Stock means average of the per share closing prices in its
   principal trading market for the Holdings Common Stock for the five (5)
   trading days next preceding the Exchange Date.

             (B)  All shares of Holdings Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
   this Agreement will be subject to the following agreement:  (i) the shares
   may not be sold, transferred or otherwise alienated or hypothecated except
   in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable State
   securities laws; and (ii) the Company may require the Shareholder to enter
   into an appropriate agreement at the time of delivery of Holdings Common
   Stock.

             12.  Voting Rights.  The Shareholder shall have voting rights
   for all Stock granted pursuant to Section 2 hereof regardless of whether
   it has vested pursuant to Section 3 hereof.

             13.  Dividends and Other Distributions.  Unless specifically
   determined by the Board of Directors and reflected in written notice to
   the Shareholder, no dividends or other distributions will be paid with
   respect to the Stock owned by the Shareholder; provided, however, that
   dividends may be paid on Stock owned by Holdings ("Holdings Stock")
   respecting capital invested in the Company by Holdings after January 1,
   1992, which dividends shall for purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be
   return of capital to Holdings, and the Shareholder shall have no rights to
   receive or participate pro rata or otherwise in such distributions.  The
   total amount of dividends on Holdings Stock shall not exceed the portion
   of paid-in capital and retained earnings allocated to Holdings Stock.  All
   dividends on Holdings Stock shall be considered a repurchase of Holdings
   Stock at the Valuation Formula Price next preceding the date of any
   dividend payment.  The Shareholder and Holdings recognize that the
   agreements set forth in this Paragraph 13 result in the creation of two
   (2) classes of Common Stock, no par value, of the Company and agree to
   execute appropriate amendments to the Articles of Incorporation reflecting
   such agreement.

             14.  Endorsement on Stock Certificates.  Conspicuously noted on
   each certificate representing Stock now owned or hereafter acquired by the
   Shareholder (or his Spouse or transferee) shall be a legend reading
   substantially as follows:

             "ANY SALE, ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR ANY OTHER
        DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS
        CERTIFICATE IS RESTRICTED BY, AND SUBJECT TO, THE TERMS AND
        PROVISIONS OF A RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
        _______________.  A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT AND OF ALL AMENDMENTS
        OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO IS ON FILE IN THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
        OF THE COMPANY. BY ACCEPTANCE OF THIS CERTIFICATE, THE HOLDER
        AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SAID AGREEMENT AND ALL
        AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO."

             15.  Certain Breaches.  If the Shareholder refuses to deliver
   stock certificates representing Stock in breach of this Agreement (as
   determined by the Company's legal counsel), the Company shall have the
   right to cancel the outstanding stock certificates owned or held by or in
   the name of the Shareholder and to reissue stock certificates representing
   such shares in the name of the Company and/or any Purchaser upon the
   payment of the appropriate aggregate purchase price as provided herein,
   and the defaulting Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold the Company
   and any Purchaser harmless from and against all costs, damages and
   expenses as a result of such breach.

             16.  Certain Actions by the Company.  The Shareholder agrees
   that, if the Company is unable to make any purchase required of it
   hereunder because of the provisions of applicable statutes or of its
   Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, the Company, the Shareholder, and
   the Spouse, transferees and legal representatives of the Shareholder and
   his/her Spouse shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to
   permit the Company to make such purchase, including without limitation any
   action necessary to recapitalize the Company to increase the surplus of
   the Company to an amount adequate to pay the purchase price of the Stock
   to be so purchased; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be
   construed to require any such person to make any additional personal
   investment in the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
   contained in this Agreement shall require the Company to purchase or
   impose any liability upon the Company for failing to purchase Stock if
   such purchase would render the Company insolvent or would be prohibited by
   law or any applicable state or federal regulation.  The Shareholder
   further agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit the
   Company's rights to issue additional shares of Stock provided, however, in
   the event that shares are issued at less than Net Book Value Per Share (or
   if after March 31, 1997, the Valuation Formula Price) the Board shall make
   such an equitable adjustment, as it shall determine in its reasonable
   discretion in the price at which shares held by the Shareholder may be
   repurchased by the Company.

             17.  Withholding Tax.  If the Company determines that it is
   required to withhold state or federal income tax or FICA tax as a result
   of the vesting of the Shareholder's Stock, the Shareholder will make
   arrangements satisfactory to the Company to enable it to satisfy such
   withholding requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder
   may elect, by written notice to the Company delivered ten (10) business
   days prior to any regular date for the vesting of Stock pursuant to
   Section 3 (or upon execution of this Agreement for Stock vesting upon such
   execution), to satisfy the Shareholder's obligation under this Section as
   to Stock vesting on such date by requesting the Company to purchase from
   the Shareholder on the vesting date, at a price per share of Stock equal
   to the Net Book Value Per Share, an amount of the Stock to be vested equal
   in value to the lesser of (A) the amount the Company has determined it is
   required to withhold on such date and (B) the amount set forth in the
   Shareholder's request.  The Company shall be obligated to comply with each
   such request under this Section 17.

             18.  Termination.  Except as otherwise provided herein, this
   Agreement and all provisions thereof shall continue in force and effect
   until terminated by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
   and the Shareholder; provided, however, that obligations to make payments,
   if the events creating such obligations occurred prior to the termination,
   shall not hereby be terminated.

             19.  Notice.  Every notice or request required or permitted
   herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
   personally, sent by telecopy or facsimile (with receipt acknowledged) or
   mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt
   requested and postage prepaid, to the recipient.  Such notice, request or
   other communication will be sent to each party hereto at the addresses

             20.  Severability, Governing Law and Effect of Invalid
   Provisions.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular
   provision of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof,

   or unenforceable provision were omitted.  This Agreement shall be governed
   by the laws of the State of Wisconsin.

   construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

             23.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or
   more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
   which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

             24.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
   agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
   hereof and may not be modified orally or in any manner other than by any
   agreement in writing signed by all of the parties hereto.

             IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as
