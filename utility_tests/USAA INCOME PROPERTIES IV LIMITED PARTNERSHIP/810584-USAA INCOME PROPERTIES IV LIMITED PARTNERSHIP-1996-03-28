Item 1. Business

         USAA Income Properties IV Limited Partnership (the
"Partnership") is a limited partnership formed February 5, 1987,
under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware
to invest in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real
properties such as shopping centers, office buildings, apartments,
industrial buildings and other similar income-producing real
property.  The Partnership has three principal business objectives: 
(i) to preserve and protect the Partnership's capital (ii) to
obtain long-term appreciation in the value of its properties, and
(iii) to provide partially "tax-sheltered" distributions of cash
from operations.  Defined terms used herein shall have the meanings
as set forth under the caption "Glossary" contained at pages 87-89
of the Prospectus, dated June 8, 1987, filed pursuant to Rule
424(b), attached as Exhibit 99.a and incorporated herein by
reference.

         The Partnership Agreement authorized the issuance of up to
160,000 Limited Partnership Interests at a price of $500 each.  The
Partnership sold $30,247,500 in Limited Partnership Interests
(60,495 Interests at $500 per Interest) from the commencement of
the offering of Interests on or about July 1, 1987, through the
completion of the offering on February 29, 1988.  Limited Partners
are not required to make any additional capital contributions.  

         Proceeds available to the Partnership for investment in
properties were used to acquire the following properties in fiscal
year 1987:  Linear Technology Corporate Headquarters, Eastman Kodak
Building, and 1881 Pine Street (Century Electric Office Building). 
During 1988, the Partnership acquired a 55.8% joint venture
interest in USAA Chelmsford Associates Joint Venture which owns the
Apollo Computer Research and Development Headquarters Building. 
See "Item 2 Properties".  

         Competitive conditions for the Partnership's properties in
1995 were as follows:

         The Linear Technology Building, located in Milpitas, Santa
Clara County, California, is located three miles north of the San
Jose Municipal Airport and eight miles from Stanford University. 
At December 31, 1995, the building was 100% leased by Linear
Technology Corporation as its corporate headquarters under a lease
which expires in 2000.  During 1995, the lease with Linear
Technology was renewed for an additional five years.  The tenant
renewed at a monthly rate of $.75 per square foot for the 42,130
square foot building, down from the previous monthly rate of $1.15
per square foot.  This new rate reflects the current market
conditions in the area surrounding the property.  An allowance for
tenant improvements has been provided at a total of approximately
$168,500 to be paid out of the working capital reserve.  As of
December 31, 1995, none of the allowance had been expended.  Linear 

<PAGE>
Technology provided approximately $459,000 of annual rental income
to the Partnership in 1995 and $561,000 during 1994 and 1993, which
represented approximately 11% of total Partnership rental income
for 1995, 1994 and 1993.

         The Linear Technology Building is located in the Milpitas
submarket of the Silicon Valley.  This submarket had approximately
300,000 square feet of available research and development (R & D)
space as of December 31, 1995, with a vacancy factor of 4% compared
to a 13% vacancy factor as of December 31, 1994.  The submarket had
net absorption of approximately 635,000 square feet in 1995.

         The Eastman Kodak Building is located in Sorrento Valley, San
Diego, California near the intersection of Interstates 5 and 805. 
At December 31, 1995, the building was 100% leased, with Kodak
occupying 34,600 square feet and Invitrogen Corporation occupying
the remaining 23,147 square feet.  Kodak's lease expires in
February 1998.  The Invitrogen lease expires in April 1996 and the
tenant is in need of additional space.  This need for additional
space can not be accommodated at the Kodak property; therefore,
Invitrogen plans to construct and occupy their own building. 
Invitrogen is seeking a possible short-term extension until the
construction of their new building is complete.  Kodak has made no
commitment to take Invitrogen's space.

         The Kodak Building is located in the Sorrento Valley R & D
submarket.  The vacancy rate in the submarket decreased to
approximately 9.5% as of the end of 1995 compared to 17% in 1994. 
Total inventory in the Sorrento Valley R & D submarket was
approximately 1.3 million square feet with 125,000 square feet
available at the end of 1995.

         The Century Electric Office Building is located in St. Louis,
Missouri near Interstate 44, the Gateway Arch, and Union Station. 
MagneTek, the single tenant at Century Electric, vacated the
property at the expiration of its lease in May 1995.  A broker was
hired in 1994 to lease the property either as a single-tenant or
multi-tenant building.  The property has undergone some
improvements to prepare the building for new tenants and will be
marketed as 1881 Pine Street.  In December, a marketing center was
completed at the property to aid in showing to prospective tenants. 
MagneTek provided approximately $537,000 of rental income to the
Partnership during 1995, $1,306,000 during 1994 and $1,305,000
during 1993.  This represented approximately 13% of total
Partnership rental income for 1995, 26% for 1994 and 25% for 1993. 

         At the end of 1995, the parking lot improvements at 1881
Pine Street were approximately 98% complete and are anticipated to
be complete in March 1996 at a total cost of approximately $172,000,
down from the anticipated cost of $185,000.  Improvements included
demolition of an old fence, and installation of new lights, new asphalt,
striping, wrought iron fencing, landscaping and parking lot access
gates with a card entry reader system.  The cost of improvements
will be funded from the working capital reserve.


<PAGE>
         The 1881 Pine Street property is located in the Downtown St.
Louis submarket.  The occupancy rate as of the end 1995 in this
submarket was approximately 82% as compared to approximately 83% as
of 1994.  The occupancy rate in the overall St. Louis office market
remained stable at approximately 88%.

         USAA Chelmsford Associates Joint Venture, the joint venture
in which the Partnership holds a 55.8% interest, owns and operates
the Apollo Computer Research and Development Headquarters Building
which is located in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. 
The property is an office/R & D building and is 100% leased to
Hewlett-Packard Company, successor in interest to Apollo Computer,
Inc.  During 1995, negotiations with Hewlett-Packard Company
resulted in the renewal of their lease for an additional 41 months. 
The new monthly rental rate of $.57 per square foot for the 291,424
square foot building will begin January 1997.  This rate is lower
than the current rate of approximately $.76 per square foot and
reflects the current market conditions in the area surrounding the
property. An allowance for tenant improvements was provided at a
total of approximately $565,000 to be paid from the working capital
reserve.  As of December 31, 1995, approximately $108,000 of the
allowance has been expended.  This tenant provided approximately
$2,759,000 of annual rental income to the Partnership in 1995,
$2,761,000 in 1994 and $2,763,000 in 1993 which represented
approximately 65% of total Partnership rental income for 1995 and
54% for 1994 and 1993.

         The Apollo Computer Building is located within the 495
Markets/Metrowest submarket of the Greater Boston market.  This
building is configured in a way that allows it to compete as 
office or  R & D.  Total inventory in the submarket was
approximately 11.3 million square feet of office space with an
occupancy rate of approximately 89% as of December 31, 1995
compared to an occupancy rate of approximately 88% as of the end of
1994. Total inventory of R & D space was approximately 2.6 million
square feet as of the end of 1995 with an occupancy of
approximately 88%.  There is no R & D construction underway. 

         See "Item 2 Properties" for further information pertaining
to the status of the Partnership's properties.
         
         The Partnership has no employees; it has, however, entered
into an Advisory Agreement with USAA Real Estate Company (the
"Adviser"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital Corporation,
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Services Automobile
Association ("USAA").  The Adviser is responsible for managing the
day-to-day operations of the Partnership.                     

         The General Partner (the "General Partner") of the
Partnership is USAA Properties IV, Inc., a Texas corporation and a
subsidiary of the Adviser.  The General Partner has the general
responsibility for management of the Partnership's business and
oversees the activities of the Adviser.

<PAGE>
Item 3. Legal Proceedings

       There are no material legal proceedings pending to which the
General Partner or the Partnership is a party or to which any of
the Partnership's properties are subject.

       No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report
through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

                            PART II

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Limited Partnership Interests 
        and Related Security Holder Matters

       There is no established public trading market for the
Interests, and it is not anticipated that a public market will
develop.  Upon request, Real Estate Limited Partnership Investor
Services, a department in the USAA Real Estate Company, may assist
a Limited Partner desiring to transfer his Interests.  The limited
market for the Interests may adversely affect the value of the
Interests.  The purchase price for the Interests upon resale and
all other terms of a resale transaction are subject to negotiation
between the buyer and the seller.

       As of December 31, 1995, there were 2,989 Limited Partners
of the Partnership, owning an aggregate of 60,495 Interests.

       During the year ended December 31, 1995, quarterly
distributions totaling $907,425 and $9,166 were distributed to the
Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively, for a total of
$916,591 in cash distributions.  These distributions represented a
return of capital for both the Limited Partners and General
Partner.

       During the year ended December 31, 1994, quarterly
distributions totaling $907,426 and $9,166 were distributed to the
Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively, for a total of
$916,592 in cash distributions.  The return of capital portion of
1994 distributions was $355,803 and $3,594 for the Limited Partners
and General Partner, respectively.
  
       Future cash distributions to Limited Partners are
anticipated.  It is anticipated that distributions will be reduced
due to significant decreases in future cash flows as a result of
lease expirations, renewals at lower rental rates which reflect
market conditions and substantial re-leasing costs.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial        
         Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31, 1995, the Partnership had cash of $61,643 and
temporary investments of $2,217,339.  Included in these amounts
was the working capital reserve and funds held for payment of
current obligations of the Partnership.  Accounts receivable
consisted of amounts due from tenants.  Deferred charges and
other assets  consisted primarily of deferred rent resulting from
recognition of income as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.  Accounts payable consisted of amounts due
to USAA Real Estate Company for management fees and reimbursable
expenses and amounts due to third parties for expenses incurred
for operations.  Other liabilities consisted of security deposits
and prepaid rent.  

The original lease with Linear Technology, the single tenant at
the Linear Technology Building in Milpitas, California, expired
in June 1995.  During the year, negotiations with Linear resulted
in a five year renewal.  The tenant renewed at a monthly rental
rate of $.75 per square foot for the 42,130 square foot building,
down from the previous monthly rate of $1.15 per square foot. 
This new rate reflects the current market conditions in the area
surrounding the property.  An allowance for tenant improvements
has been provided for a total of approximately $168,500 to be
paid out of the working capital reserve.  As of December 31,
1995, none of the allowance had been expended.

During May 1995, MagneTek vacated 1881 Pine Street (formerly
known as the Century Electric Building) in St. Louis, Missouri. 
This property has undergone some improvements to prepare the
building for new tenants.  In December, a marketing center was
completed at the property to show prospective tenants.  A broker
was hired in 1994 to lease the property as either a single-tenant
or multi-tenant building.  Rental rates for new leases will be
lower than the previous rate reflecting market conditions in the
area surrounding the property.

At end of 1995, the parking lot improvements at 1881 Pine Street 
were approximately 98% complete and are anticipated to be
complete in March 1996 at a total cost of approximately $172,000,
down from the anticipated cost of $185,000.  Improvements included
demolition of an old fence, and installation of new lights, new
asphalt, striping, wrought iron fencing, landscaping, and parking
lot access gates with a card entry reader system.  The cost of
improvements will be funded from the working capital reserve.

Although the lease with Hewlett-Packard Company, the single
tenant at the Apollo Building in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, did
not expire until 1996, negotiations during 1995 resulted in a
renewal.  The tenant has agreed to renew for an additional 41
months at a monthly rate of $.57 per square foot for the 291,424
square foot building.  This rate is lower than the current rate 

<PAGE>
of approximately $.76 per square foot and reflects the current
market conditions in the area surrounding the property.  This new
lease expires in May 2000.  An allowance for tenant improvements
was provided at a total of approximately $565,000 to be paid from
the working capital reserve.  As of December 31, 1995,
approximately $108,000 of the allowance had been expended.

Total cash distributions in 1995 to Partners remained consistent
with total cash distributions to Partners in 1994.  The single
tenant lease at 1881 Pine Street expired in May 1995 and
substantial expenditures for tenant improvements are anticipated
beginning in 1996 as new leases are signed.  Linear renewed its
lease effective June 1995 for an additional five years with
approximately $168,500 in tenant improvement costs and a rental
rate decrease to reflect market conditions.  Apollo renewed its
lease effective January 1997 for an additional 41 months at a
reduced rental rate to reflect current market conditions and with
$565,000 in tenant improvement costs.  In addition, the
Invitrogen lease expires in 1996.  Due to significant decreases
in 1996 cash flow, reductions in distributions are anticipated
for 1996.

Future liquidity is expected to result from cash generated from
the operations of the properties, interest on temporary
investments and ultimately through the sale of the properties.


Results of Operations

For the three-years ended December 31, 1995, income was generated 
from rental income from the income-producing real estate
properties and from interest income earned on the funds in
temporary investments.

Expenses incurred during the same periods were associated with
the operation of the Partnership's properties, interest on the
mortgages and note payable, and various other costs required for
administration of the Partnership.

During 1995, 1994 and 1993, two of the Partnership's properties
were single-tenant properties with absolute triple net leases. 
Under an absolute triple net lease, the lessee is required to
make all payments for expenses related to the use and occupation
of the leased premises, including real estate taxes and
assessments, property and liability insurance, repairs and
maintenance, utilities and other operating costs associated with
the property.  Accordingly, the Partnership received rental
income and the lessee absorbed all such expenses on these
properties.

Rental income decreased for 1995 as compared to 1994 primarily
due to the single tenant at 1881 Pine Street vacating the
property in May 1995 upon expiration of the lease.  Also
contributing to the decrease in rental income was the rent
reduction at Linear.  The tenant at Linear renewed at a monthly 

<PAGE>
rate of $.75 per square foot for the 42,130 square foot building,
which is lower than the previous monthly rate of $1.15 per square
foot and reflects the current market conditions in the area
surrounding the property.

Depreciation increased for 1995 as compared to 1994 due to
improvements at 1881 Pine Street and Kodak.  The increase in
depreciation in 1994 as compared to 1993 was attributable to the
tenant improvements for the Kodak lease placed in service January
1994.  Other direct expenses were higher for 1995 as compared to
1994 as a result of sidewalk repairs, property tax payments and
demolition costs at the 1881 Pine Street property to enhance the
appearance of the property for showing to prospective tenants. 
Also contributing to the increase was parking lot repairs at the
Apollo Building which was part of the tenant improvement
allowance.  Other direct expenses for 1994 reflected an increase
as compared to 1993 due to an increase in marketing expenses and
an evaluation of the heating and air conditioning system at 1881
Pine Street, and an increase in property earthquake insurance at
Kodak and Linear.  

Higher interest rates and an increase in cash reserves accounted
for the increase in interest income for 1995 and 1994 as compared
to 1993.

General and administrative expenses decreased for 1995 as
compared to 1994 due to a reduction in charges for preparation of
federal and state tax returns, a reduction in a partnership
earnings tax paid to the City of St. Louis and a decrease in
printing charges.  The increase in general and administrative
expenses for 1994 as compared to 1993 was attributable to a
partnership earnings tax paid to the City of St. Louis.

The management fee payable to the adviser is based on cash flow
from operations of the Partnership adjusted for cash reserves and
fluctuated accordingly.  

Interest expense decreased in 1995 and 1994 as compared to 1993
due to principal balance reductions.

Minority interest in joint venture earnings decreased for 1995 as
compared to 1994 due to a decrease in net income of the joint
venture property as a result of parking lot repairs offset
somewhat by a decrease in interest expense.   Minority interest
in joint venture earnings increased for 1994 as compared to 1993
as a result of a decrease in interest expense. 

<PAGE>
Inflation

An increase in inflation could affect the Partnership's
investments through increases in various administrative costs of
Partnership operation.  The adverse effect inflation may have
would be offset to some extent by increases in rental rates
charged tenants at the Partnership's properties.

         USAA INCOME PROPERTIES IV LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993


1.  Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
    Other

    USAA Income Properties IV Limited Partnership is engaged
    solely in the business of real estate investment; therefore,
    presentation of information about industry segments is not
    applicable.

    The Partnership owns office buildings in Milpitas,
    California; San Diego, California; St. Louis, Missouri and a
    joint venture  interest in a research and development
    property in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.  The Partnership's
    revenue is subject to changes in the economic environments of
    these areas.

    The General Partner, USAA Properties IV, Inc., is a wholly-
    owned subsidiary of USAA Real Estate Company (Realco), which
    is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital Corporation,
    which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Services
    Automobile Association (USAA).

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

    Rental properties are valued at cost.  The carrying amount of
    a property is not changed for temporary fluctuations in value
    unless the carrying value is believed to be permanently
    impaired.  In 1995, the Partnership adopted the provisions of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
    "Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-
    lived Assets to be Disposed of," (Statement 121).  Statement
    121 provides guidance for determining impairment of long-
    lived assets utilizing undiscounted future cash flows.  Based
    on the provisions of Statement 121, the Partnership's long-
    lived assets,  real  estate  and  improvements,  are  not
    considered impaired.  The adoption of this Statement had no
    financial statement impact.

    Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
    the properties using the straight-line method.  The estimated
    lives of the buildings and improvements is 30 years (31.5 -
    39 years for Federal income tax purposes).


<PAGE>
    Rental income is recognized under the operating method,
    whereby aggregate rentals are reported on a straight-line
    basis as income over the life of the lease.  Rental income
    recognized was $142,781, $148,920 and $99,643 less than the
    amount due per the lease agreements for the years ended
    December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    No provision or credit for income taxes has been made as the
    liability for such taxes is that of the Partners rather than
    the Partnership.  The Partnership files its tax return on an
    accrual basis.

    For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,
    all highly liquid marketable securities that have a maturity
    at purchase of three months or less, and money market mutual
    funds are considered to be cash equivalents.  

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Partnership and its majority-owned joint venture.  All
    significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in
    consolidation. 

    For financial reporting purposes, net income is allocated 1%
    to the General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners.  Net
    income per limited partnership interest is based upon the
    limited partnership interests outstanding at the end of the
    period and net income allocated to the Limited Partners.

    Cash distributions per limited partnership interest were
    $15.00 for 1995 and 1994 and $19.50 for 1993, and were based
    on the limited partnership interests outstanding at each
    quarter end and the cash distributions allocated to Limited
    Partners.


2.  Partnership Agreement

    Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, Net Cash
    from Operations shall be allocated and paid 1% to the General
    Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners.  Any Net Cash from
    Operations received by a Limited Partner shall count toward
    his 6% cumulative Preferred Return, as defined in the
    Partnership Agreement.  Net Proceeds from Sales or
    Refinancings, shall be allocated and paid 1% to the General
    Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners until the Limited
    Partners have been returned their Original Invested Capital
    from Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings, plus their
    Preferred Return.  Second, Net Proceeds from Sales or
    Refinancings shall be allocated and paid to the Adviser in
    payment of any unpaid Subordinated Disposition Fee.  Third,
    Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings shall be allocated
    and paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General
    Partner.


<PAGE>
    Generally, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
    credit from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited
    Partners and 1% to the General Partner.  Net gain or net loss
    from the sale or other disposition of a property shall be
    allocated as described in the Partnership Agreement.


3.  Rental Properties

    Rental properties at December 31 consisted of the following:


                                      1995           1994

                                  $ 46,218,351     47,806,604

4.  Investment in Joint Venture

    On May 31, 1988, the Partnership entered into the USAA
    Chelmsford Associates Joint Venture with USAA Real Estate
    Company for the ownership and operation of the Apollo
    Computer Research and Development Headquarters Building.  The
    Partnership contributed $9,000,000 for its 55.8% joint
    venture interest.  The contribution consisted of $3,000,000
    in remaining offering proceeds and $6,000,000 in proceeds
    from a note payable to USAA Real Estate Company (note 7).


<PAGE>
    Summary financial information for the joint venture as of
    December 31, 1995 and 1994 and for the years ended December
    31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 follows:

5.  Minimum Future Rentals

    Operating leases with tenants have remaining terms from four
    months to five years.  Minimum future rentals are cash payments
    to be received under non-cancelable leases over the lease terms
    and do not necessarily represent rental income under generally
    accepted accounting principles.  Rental income reported in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations is recognized under the
    operating method, whereby aggregate rentals are reported on a
    straight-line basis as income over the life of the lease. 
    Approximate minimum future rentals are as follows:


            1996             $ 3,598,000
            1997               2,737,000
            1998               2,439,000
            1999               2,379,000
            2000               1,023,000
            Thereafter                --
                             $12,176,000 

6.  Triple Net Leases

    During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Partnership had ownership
    interests in two office buildings occupied by single tenants. 
    The lease agreements between the tenants and the Partnership
    were absolute triple net lease arrangements whereby the lessee
    is required to make all payments for expenses related to the use
    and occupation of the leased premises including real estate
    taxes and assessments, property and liability insurance, repairs
    and maintenance, utilities and other operating costs associated
    with the property.  Accordingly, net operating income reflected
    only rental income and excluded all expenses directly related
    to the operations of the property as payments for such expenses
    are made directly by the lessee.

7.  Mortgages and Note Payable

    Mortgages payable at December 31:

                                        $ 16,638,886   16,839,334

    On May 31, 1988, $6,000,000 of the total $9,000,000 Partnership

    and $2,168,197 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    acquisition fees of up to 5% of gross offering proceeds, real
    estate brokerage commissions of up to 2% of the aggregate
    selling prices of properties sold and management fees of 9% of

    A portion of the Partnership's working capital reserve and other
    available funds were invested in USAA Mutual Fund, Inc. and
    earned interest thereon at market rates.

10.  Major Customer Information

     During 1995, the Partnership recorded approximately $2,759,000,
     $537,000 and $459,000 of rental income from single-tenant leases
     which represented approximately 65%, 13% and 11% of total rental
     income, respectively.  

     During 1994, the Partnership recorded approximately $2,761,000,
     $1,306,000 and $561,000 of rental income from single-tenant
     leases which represented approximately 54%, 26% and 11% of total
     rental income, respectively.  

     During 1993, the Partnership recorded approximately $2,763,000,
     $1,305,000 and $561,000 of rental income from single-tenant
     leases which represented approximately 54%, 25% and 11% of total
     rental income, respectively.  

  
11.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates 
     fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

     The fair value of mortgages and note payable at December 31,
     1995 and 1994 was $21,677,908 and $21,733,260, respectively, and
     was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
     interest rates currently being offered for mortgage loans and
     notes with similar characteristics and maturities.

The Partners
USAA Income Properties IV Limited Partnership:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of

joint venture as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, partners' equity, and cash

responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of USAA Income Properties IV Limited Partnership and
majority-owned joint venture as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

     "Average Annual Unreturned Invested Capital:"  The total of
all the Limited Partners' Original Invested Capital reduced by
the total of all distributions of Net Proceeds from Sales or
Refinancings (but not below zero) to Limited Partners, as
reflected on the Partnership's books and records, weighted on a

<PAGE>
     "Nonrecourse Deductions":  Partnership losses or deductions
attributable to Nonrecourse Liabilities and for each Partnership
taxable year shall equal in the aggregate for the Partnership the
net increase, if any, in the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
during that taxable year.  The Nonrecourse Deductions for a
Partnership taxable year shall consist first of depreciation or
cost recovery deductions with respect to items of Partnership
property subject to one or more Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership to the extent of the increase in Partnership Minimum
Gain attributable to the Nonrecourse Liabilities to which each
such item of property is subject, with the remainder of such
Nonrecourse Deductions, if any, made up of a pro rata portion of
the Partnership's other items of deduction or loss for that
taxable year.  If, however, such depreciation or cost recovery
deductions exceed the net increase in Partnership Minimum Gain, a
proportional share of each such deduction shall constitute a
Nonrecourse Deduction.  If the net increase in Partnership
Minimum Gain during a Partnership taxable year exceeds the total
amount of items of Partnership loss or deduction for such taxable
year, then an amount of Partnership loss and deduction for the
Partnership's next succeeding taxable year (or years) equal to
such excess shall constitute Nonrecourse Deductions, as if there
had been a net increase in Partnership Minimum Gain during such
succeeding taxable year (or years) in the amount of such excess.

     "Nonrecourse Liability":  A liability of the Partnership (or
portion thereof) with respect to which none of the Partners (or
any person related to a Partner) has any economic risk of loss
(other than through their interests as Partners in the
Partnership's assets subject to the liability).

     "Organizational and Offering Expenses":  Expenses incurred
in connection with the organization of the Partnership and the
offering of the Interests (excluding selling commissions)
including legal fees, accounting fees, escrow fees, printing
costs, filing and qualification fees, reimbursement of expenses
incurred by the General Partner or its Affiliates, and other
disbursements in connection with the sale and distribution of
Interests.

     "Original Invested Capital":  An amount equal to $500 per
Interest.

     "Partner":  A General Partner or any Limited Partner.

     "Partnership":  The partnership formed and continued under
the Restated and Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership
attached as Exhibit A.

     "Partnership Minimum Gain":  The amount determined by
computing, with respect to each Nonrecourse Liability, the amount
of gain, if any, that would be realized by the Partnership if it
disposed of (in a taxable transaction) the Property subject to
such liability in full satisfaction thereof, and by then
aggregating the amounts so computed.


<PAGE>
     "Partner's Share of Partnership Minimum Gain":  As to any
Partner at the end of any Partnership taxable year, the amount
equal to the aggregate Nonrecourse Deductions allocated to such
Partner (and such Partner's predecessors in interest) up to that
time, less such Partners (and such predecessor's) aggregate share
of the net decreases in Partnership Minimum Gain up to that time. 
A Partner's share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during a Partnership taxable year equals an amount that bears the
same relation to the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during such year as such Partner's Share of Partnership Minimum
Gain at the end of the prior taxable year of the Partnership
bears to the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain at the end of
such prior taxable year.

     "Preferred Return":  The cumulative non-compounded preferred
return to each Limited Partner equal to 6% per annum on his
Average Annual Unreturned Invested Capital payable from either
distributions of Net Cash from Operations or Net Proceeds from
Sales or Refinancings.  Such cumulative preferred return shall be
calculated from the date the owner of such Interests is admitted
as a Limited Partner.

     "Property" or "Properties":  Shall mean one or more of the
properties actually acquired by the Partnership.

     "Prospectus":  The prospectus contained in the Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     "Purchase Price":  The price paid upon the purchase or sale
of a Property, including the amount of Acquisition Fees and all
liens and mortgages on the Property, but excluding points and
prepaid interest.

     "Qualified Trust":  Any employee benefit plan or other
entity subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or described
in Code Section 4975(e)(1) (other than a plan described in Code
Sections 4975(g)(2) or 4975(g)(3)), including an individual
retirement account defined in Code Section 408(a).

     "Registration Statement":  The Partnership's Registration
Statement on Form S-11 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and as amended from time to time.

     "Sales Agent":  USAA Investment Management Company, an
Affiliate of the General Partner.

     "Subordinated Disposition Fee":  The fee payable to the

transfer of a Property.

Exempt Entity.

Taxable Entity on the date that he or it is admitted to the
Partnership.

exempt entity within the meaning of Code Section 168(h)(2)(A) as
in effect after December 31, 1986, including (i) the United

                                          Partnership the General 
                                          Partner shall receive an 
                                          amount equal to the 
                                          positive balance, if any,
                                          in its capital account. 
                                          See "Income and Losses 
                                          and Cash Distributions."

                                          time.(6)



(1)  See "The Offering".

(2)  The Sales Agent shall receive a non-accountable expense
     allocation for Organizational and Offering Expenses in an
     amount equal to 2% of gross offering proceeds.  The Sales
     Agent shall pay all Organizational and Offering Expenses in
     excess of such amount.

(3)  The Partnership may invest offering proceeds, including
     working capital reserves, from time to time in a money market
     or mutual fund sponsored by USAA or its Affiliates for which
     the advisory fee shall be paid annually.  See "Investment
     Objectives and Policies--Preliminary Investments."  

(4)  At a minimum, an amount equal to the greater of (i) 67% of the
     Limited Partners' capital contributions or (ii) 80% of such
     capital contributions reduced by .1625% for each 1% of
     indebtedness encumbering the Partnership's Properties must be
     committed to investment in properties.  For purposes hereof,
     "Investment in Properties" is the amount of capital
     contributions actually paid or allocated to the purchase,
     development, construction or improvement of properties
     acquired by the Partnership (including working capital
     reserves not in excess of 5% of gross offering proceeds) but
     excluding front-end fees.  The remaining capital contributions
     not invested in properties are available for front-end fees: 
     Organizational and Offering Expenses, selling commissions,
     Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses, and real estate
     broker commissions.  Therefore, assuming the Partnership
     acquires properties utilizing leverage of approximately 50% of
     the aggregate Purchase Prices, it would be required to commit
     to Investment in Properties 71.875% of gross offering
     proceeds, computed as follows: 80%  -  (50 x .1625%) =
     71.875%.  As indicated under the "Estimated Use of Proceeds"


<PAGE>
     table, it is anticipated that the Partnership's Investment in
     Properties will be well within the limitations set forth
     above.

(5)  The General Partner or its Affiliates may be reimbursed for
     (a) the actual cost of goods and materials used for or by the
     Partnership and obtained from an entity that is not an
     Affiliate of the General Partner; (b) salaries and related
     salary expenses for services which could be performed directly
     for the Partnership by independent parties, including legal,
     accounting, transfer agent, data processing, duplicating and
     administration of investor accounts; and (c) the cost of
     Partnership reports and communications to investors.  No
     reimbursement shall be permitted for services for which the
     General Partner or Affiliates receive a separate fee or for
     (i) salaries, related salary expenses, traveling expenses, and
     other administrative items incurred by any Controlling Persons
     or which are not directly attributable to the rendering of
     services to the Partnership and (ii) any indirect expenses
     incurred in performing services for the Partnership, such as
     rent or depreciation, utilities, capital equipment, and other
     administrative items.  "Controlling Person" for this purpose
     shall mean any person, regardless of title, who performs
     executive or senior management functions for the General
     Partner or Affiliates similar to those of directors, executive
     management and senior management, or any person who either
     holds 5% or more equity interest in the General Partner or
     Affiliates or has the power to direct or cause the direction
     of the General Partner or Affiliates, whether through the
     ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise, or,
     in the absence of a specific role or title, any person having
     the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
     level employees and policies of the General Partner or
     Affiliates.  It is not intended that every person who carries
     a title such as vice president, senior vice president,
     secretary or treasurer be included in the definition of
     Controlling Person.  In no event shall any amount charged to
     the Partnership as a reimbursable expense by the General
     Partner exceed the lesser of the actual cost of such services,
     or 90% of the amount which the Partnership would be required
     to pay to independent parties for comparable services in the
     same geographic location.  Reimbursements are also allowable
     for certain Organizational and Offering Expenses and
     expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of
     the Properties by the Partnership.

(6)  Any prediction of such dollar amount would necessarily involve
     assumptions of future events that cannot be determined at this
     time.


<PAGE>
(7)  The Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner or any
     Affiliate of the General Partner to make a loan to the
     Partnership if the interest and other similar charges or fees
     on any such loan are not in excess of the amounts which would
     be charged by unaffiliated lending institutions on comparable
     loans for the same purpose in the same locality but not in
     excess of 2% above the prime rate published from time to time
     during the term of the loan by Chase Manhattan Bank of New
     York City, New York, such amount charged not to exceed 10% per
     annum.

(8)  See "Income and Losses and Cash Distributions."

(9)  Subordinated Disposition Fees payable to the Adviser or its
     Affiliates for services in connection with the sale of
     Properties shall be cumulative but shall be paid only after
     the Limited Partners have been returned their Original
     Invested Capital plus their Preferred Return from either Net
     Cash from Operations or Net Proceeds from Sales or
     Refinancings.  If an unaffiliated broker participates in the
     sale of a Property, the subordination requirement will apply
     only to the fee, if any, earned by the Adviser or its
     Affiliates.  The total of all real estate fees payable to all
     parties in connection with the sale of a Property, including
     the Subordinated Disposition Fee, shall not exceed the lesser
     of a competitive real estate fee which is reasonable,
     customary and competitive in light of the size, type and
     location of the Property or 6% of the sales price of the
     Property.


     An Affiliate of the General Partner may provide insurance
brokerage services in connection with obtaining insurance on the
Properties so long as the cost of providing such service, including
cost of the insurance, is no greater than the lower quote obtained
from two unaffiliated insurance agencies and the coverage and terms
are likewise comparable.  In no event may such services be provided
by any such Affiliate unless it is independently engaged in the
business of providing such services to other than Affiliates and at
least 75% of its insurance brokerage service gross revenue is
derived from other than Affiliates.

     It is presently contemplated that the Properties will be
managed by unaffiliated management firms, and by the Adviser as
necessary, or by operating partners in situations where the
Partnership is a partner or joint venturer.  The Adviser and its
Affiliates are presently engaged in providing property management
services for prior USAA partnerships and will in the future provide
such services to the Partnership for some or all of the Properties. 
The Partnership Agreement permits the Partnership to obtain
property management services from the General Partner, the Adviser,
or another Affiliate of the General Partner and in the event such
services are provided the compensation therefor will be limited to
the lesser of the competitive fee for similar services in the same
geographic area or (i) 5% of gross revenues from each residential


<PAGE>
property (included in such 5% are fees for leasing and related
services), (ii) 6% of gross revenues from each industrial and
commercial property if leasing and related services are performed,
(iii) 3% of gross revenues from each industrial and commercial
property if no leasing and related services are performed, and (iv)
1% of gross revenues from each industrial and commercial property
leased on a long-term (10 years or more) net basis (except for a
one-time initial leasing fee of 3% of the gross revenues on each
lease payable over the first five full years of the original term
of the lease).  The actual amount of such compensation, if any, is
not determinable at this time.

     Front-End Fees consisting of Organizational and Offering
Expenses, selling commissions, Acquisition Fees and Acquisition
Expenses shall in no event exceed 13% of gross offering proceeds.


                                
                                
                                
            INCOME AND LOSSES AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
                                

NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS
     The Partnership Agreement prohibits the reinvestment (or
investment) of Net Cash from Operations available for distribution,
except as a temporary investment pending distribution to Partners. 
The availability of Net Cash from Operations is subject to (i)
payment of the Partnership's operating expenses (without deduction
for depreciation), (ii) amounts set aside to maintain a reasonable
working capital reserve (see "Investment Objectives and Policies-
- -Working Capital Reserve"), (iii) payment of the Partnership's other
current obligations, and (iv) payment of the Adviser Management
Fee.  See "Management Compensation" for details on calculation of
the Adviser Management Fee.

     Distribution of Net Cash from Operations will be made 1% to
the General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners.  See
"Management Compensation" for a discussion of payment of the
Adviser Management Fee to the Adviser from Adjusted Cash from
Operations.  Any Net Cash from Operations received by a Limited
Partner shall count toward his 6% cumulative Preferred Return.
Distributions of Net Cash from Operations to Limited Partners will
be made quarterly, at the discretion of the General Partner and,
except for the first distribution, will be apportioned to the
Limited Partners of record on the last day of the calendar quarter
immediately preceding such distribution in proportion to the number
of Interests owned by each Limited Partner as of that date.  The
first distribution of Net Cash from Operations will be apportioned
to each Limited Partner of record on the last day of the calendar
quarter immediately preceding such distribution in the ratio that 
(i) the number of Interests held by each such Limited Partner
multiplied by the number of days that such Interests were
outstanding through the last day of the calendar quarter
immediately preceding such distribution bears to (ii) the sum for


<PAGE>
all Interests of the product computed in (i).  The ultimate amount
of any of such distributions will depend upon attaining and
thereafter maintaining operating income and expenses of Properties
at levels permitting such distributions.

NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES OR REFINANCINGS
     During the two-year period commencing on the date of this
Prospectus, any cash received on the refinancing of any Property
will not be distributed but will be treated in the same manner as
net proceeds of the offering and reinvested in other Properties.
Thereafter, Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings will not be
invested or reinvested in any property or investment other than the
Properties, except as a temporary investment pending distribution
to Partners.  Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancing, other than as
part of the liquidation of the Partnership, will be distributed as
follows:
          (i) First, 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the
     Limited Partners until the Limited Partners have been returned
     their Original Invested Capital from Net Proceeds from Sales
     or Refinancings, plus their Preferred Return from either
     distributions of Net Cash from Operations or Net Proceeds from
     Sales or Refinancings;
          (ii) Second, to the Adviser so that it will receive any
     unpaid Subordinated Disposition Fees; and
          (iii) Third, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
     General Partner.  

However, distributions in liquidation of the Partnership will be
made in proportion to and in an amount equal to the Partners'
positive capital account balances.  For a discussion of the
calculation of Subordinated Disposition Fees, see "Management
Compensation."

     Distribution of Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings, if
any, will be in such amounts and at such times as the General
Partner may determine.  The amount of each distribution of Net
Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings to Limited Partners will be
apportioned and paid to the Limited Partners of record as of the
last day of the calendar month in which such Net Proceeds from
Sales or Refinancings were received by the Partnership as follows:
          (i) First, an amount equal to the unreturned Original
     Invested Capital of all Limited Partners shall be distributed
     in proportion to the unreturned Original Invested Capital of
     each such Limited Partner;
          (ii) Second, an amount equal to the unpaid Preferred
     Return of all Limited Partners shall be distributed in
     proportion to the unpaid Preferred Return of each such Limited
     Partner;
          (iii) Third, the balance shall be distributed in
     proportion to the number of Interests owned by each Limited
     Partner, except that Net Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings
     from the disposition of the last Property (or Properties if in
     a single transaction) generally will be apportioned in
     proportion to each Limited Partner's positive capital account
     balance.

ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND LOSSES
     On and after the Initial Admittance Date, except as otherwise
provided herein, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit from operations will be allocated 1% to the General Partner
and 99% to the Limited Partners.

     Net gain from the sale or other disposition of a Property is
generally allocated as follows:

          (i) First, to the Partners in an amount up to and in
     proportion with any negative balances in their respective
     capital accounts in excess of each respective Partner's Share
     of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable year
     for which the allocation is made;

          (ii) Second, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the
     General Partner for all taxable years ending before the
     Limited Partners have been returned their Original Invested
     Capital, plus their Preferred Return.  For the taxable year
     during which distributions of Net Proceeds from Sales or
     Refinancings to Limited Partners are sufficient to return to
     the Limited Partners their Original Invested Capital, plus
     their Preferred Return, net gain is allocated 99% to the
     Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner in the minimum
     amount necessary, if any, so that the capital account balances
     of the Limited Partners equal the amounts of their respective
     unrecovered Original Invested Capital plus their unpaid
     Preferred Return less their respective Partner's Share of
     Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of such taxable year;

          (iii) Third, 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the
     General Partner in the minimum amount necessary, if any, so
     that the aggregate balance in the capital accounts of the
     Limited Partners in excess of an amount equal to the excess of
     the sum of their unrecovered Original Invested Capital and
     their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate of the
     Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the
     end of the taxable year for which the allocation is made, and
     the balance in the capital account of the General Partner in
     excess of 1.01% of an amount equal to the excess of the sum of
     the Limited Partners' unrecovered Original Invested Capital
     and their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate of the
     Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the
     end of the taxable year for which the allocation is made, is
     in the ratio of 90 to 10;

          (iv) Fourth, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
     General Partner.

     To the extent ordinary income from recapture of depreciation
is incurred upon the sale or other disposition of a Property, such
ordinary income shall be allocated, to the extent possible, to the
Partners as a portion of their net gain allocated to the extent
such Partners received the benefit of the depreciation deduction
resulting in such ordinary income from recapture of depreciation.

<PAGE>
     Net loss from the sale or other disposition of a Property is
generally allocated between the Limited Partners and the General
Partner as follows:

          (i) First, if any gain has been allocated pursuant to
     subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of the preceding paragraph, then
     100% to the General Partner in the minimum amount necessary,
     if any, so that the aggregate balance in the capital accounts
     of the Limited Partners in excess of an amount equal to the
     excess of the sum of their unrecovered Original Invested
     Capital and their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate
     of the Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as
     of the end of the taxable year for which the allocation is
     made, and the balance in the capital account of the General
     Partner in excess of 1.01% of an amount equal to the excess of
     the sum of the Limited Partners' unrecovered Original Invested
     Capital and their unpaid Preferred Return over the aggregate
     of the Limited Partners' Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as
     of the end of the taxable year for which the allocation is
     made, is in the ratio of 90 to 10;

          (ii) Second, if any gain has been allocated pursuant to
     subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of the preceding paragraph, then
     10% to the General Partner and 90% to the Limited Partners 
     the aggregate balance in the capital accounts of the Limited
     Partners is equal to the excess of the sum of their
     unrecovered Original Invested Capital and their unpaid
     Preferred Return over the aggregate of the Limited Partners'
     Share of Partnership Minimum Gain as of the end of the taxable
     year for which the allocation is made; and

          (iii) Third, 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the
     Limited Partners.

Special rules apply to the allocation of income, gain, loss and
deductions in certain circumstances.  See Section 9.4 of the
Partnership Agreement.

     Except for Interests which are transferred during a taxable
year, in general, income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
allocated to the Limited Partners shall be computed annually and
apportioned to the Limited Partners of record at the end of each
taxable year in proportion to the number of Interests owned by each
Limited Partner as of that date.  Allocations to Limited Partners
attributable to periods before the Final Closing Date shall be
computed by an interim closing of the books as of the end of the
day immediately preceding each admittance date of Additional
Limited Partners and at the end of any taxable year during such
periods and shall be apportioned to the Limited Partners of record 
as of the end of the day immediately preceding each such admittance
date of Additional Limited Partners or on the last day of such
taxable year in proportion to the number of Interests owned by each
such Limited Partner as of each such date.  Allocations of gain and
loss resulting from a sale of a Property shall be apportioned to
those Limited Partners of record on the date the Partnership

<PAGE>
recognizes such gain or loss and who are entitled to allocations of
gain or loss under Section 9.4 of the Partnership Agreement.  In
the event of a transfer of an Interest, each item of Partnership
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to the
transferred Interest is generally allocated on an equal daily basis
to the owner of such Interest on the basis of the number of days
that such person was the owner of such Interest; except that net
gain or net loss from the sale or other disposition of a Property
is allocated to the owner of the Interest as of the date that such
net gain or net loss is recognized by the Partnership.

     There are circumstances in which a Limited Partner in any year
may be allocated more taxable income than he would receive in
distributions of cash.  See "Federal Income Tax Aspects--Taxable
Income in Excess of Cash Distributions."

     The General Partner may amend the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement as appropriate as a result of the
promulgation of final Treasury Regulations under Sections 704 and
706 of the Code, if in the opinion of counsel such an amendment is
advisable to reflect allocations among the Limited Partners and the
General Partner consistent with those regulations.  See "Federal
Income Tax Aspects--Allocations of Income and Loss."  For a more
detailed description of the allocations under the Partnership
Agreement, see Article IX of the Partnership Agreement.


CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

     Each Partner shall have a capital account which shall be
increased by the amount of such Partner's capital contribution to
the Partnership and the amount of any income or gain allocated to
such Partner and shall be decreased by the amount of any
syndication cost, other nondeductible and deductible expense, loss
or deduction allocated to such Partner and the amount of all
distributions to such Partner.  The capital accounts shall be
established and maintained in accordance with federal income tax
principles as set forth in Treasury Regulations.

     The General Partner is required to contribute, immediately
prior to the termination of the Partnership, cash equal to the
lesser of (i) the deficit balance in its capital account or (ii)
the excess of 1.01% of all Limited Partners' Original Invested
Capital over the amount of capital previously contributed by the
General Partner.  A deficit in a Partner's capital account is not
considered an asset of the Partnership.


<PAGE>
SOURCES AND CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS

     See "Investment Objectives and Policies--Working Capital
Reserve" for information pertaining to the characterization of
distributions from the working capital or other reserve as Net
Proceeds from Sales or Refinancings in the event of any
distributions from the working capital or other reserve which
result in the reduction of such reserve below 3% of gross proceeds
from the offering, the amount initially reserved for this purpose.
