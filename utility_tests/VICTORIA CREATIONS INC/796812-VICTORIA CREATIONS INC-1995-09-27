                    SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
                          WASHINGTON, D.C.  20549

                                FORM 12b-25

                                           Commission File Number 0-15238

                        NOTIFICATION OF LATE FILING
[X] Form 10-K
For the Year Ended:  June 30, 1995

Nothing in this form shall be construed to imply that the Commission has 
verified any information contained herein.

                     Part I - Registrant Information 

Full name of registrant:
  VICTORIA CREATIONS, INC.

Address of principal executive office (Street and Number):
  30 Jefferson Park Road   

City, State and Zip Code:
  Warwick, RI 02888

                     Part II - Rule 12b-25 (b) and (c)

(a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this form 
could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;

(b) The subject Annual Report on Form 10-K will be filed on or before the 
fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date;

                           Part III - Narrative

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, could not be 
filed within the prescribed time period.

    During the year ended June 30, 1995, Registrant's Parent Company, 
    United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc., sold one of its operations 
    and shutdown another.  The latter was one of the Parent Company's 
    segments.  In addition, subsequent to fiscal year end, the Registrant 
    and its Parent Company each renegotiated its borrowing arrangements 
    with its current lender.  The shutdown of the segment required that 
    the Registrant's Parent Company's financial statements for applicable 
    prior years be restated to report separately the results of 
    operations and the assets and liabilities of the continuing and the 
    discontinued businesses.  The personnel who prepare the Registrant's 
    filings with the Commission have been occupied in restating the 
    Registrant's Parent Company's financial statements for prior years.  
    They were also involved in the renegotiation of the borrowing 
    arrangements for both companies.  At the same time, the same 
    personnel have been preparing Annual Reports on Form 10-K for both 
    the Registrant and the Registrant's Parent Company.  At this time, 
    additional time is necessary to have the Form 10-K reviewed by all 
    the Registrant's appropriate personnel and its independent auditors 
    to assure adequate disclosure.
