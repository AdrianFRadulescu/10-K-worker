THE COMPANY

Del Webb Corporation is one of the nation's leading developers of age-restricted
active adult  communities.  The Company has  extensive  experience in the active
adult  community  business,  having built and sold more than 50,000 homes at its
Sun City  communities  over the past 35 years.  The  Company is also  delivering
homes at Terravita,  a gate-guarded,  amenity-rich,  master-planned  residential
community in north Scottsdale, Arizona, that is not age-restricted.  The Company
designs,  develops and markets  these  large-scale,  master-planned  residential
communities, primarily for active adults age 55 and over, controlling all phases
of  the  master  plan  development  process  from  land  selection  through  the
construction  and sale of homes.  Within  its  communities,  the  Company is the
exclusive  developer  of homes.  The Company also has  significant  conventional
subdivision homebuilding operations,  which it conducts under the name "Coventry
Homes," in the Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas areas and southern California.

The Company was  incorporated in 1946 under the laws of the State of Arizona and
reincorporated  in 1994 under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The  Company's
principal  executive  offices  are located at 6001 North 24th  Street,  Phoenix,
Arizona 85016 and its telephone  number is (602) 808-8000.  The Company conducts
substantially  all of its activities  through  subsidiaries and, as used in this
Annual  Report,  the  term  "Company"  includes  Del  Webb  Corporation  and its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

Statements in this Annual Report as to acreage, mileage, number and years supply
of future  home sites,  square feet and number of present and future  residents,
employees and shareholders are approximations.

MASTER-PLANNED COMMUNITIES

closings  were taking  place,  two  master-planned  communities  at which it was
taking home sales orders,  but at which closings had not yet commenced,  and two
master-planned communities in earlier stages of development.

  (in thousands)............................      $96-245           $101-235


         Sun City Hilton Head
         -------------------- 
Sun City Hilton Head is located  inland 13 miles from Hilton Head Island,  South
Carolina.  It is a gate-guarded active adult community that is currently planned
for 8,000 homes,  several golf courses, a complex of recreational  buildings and
other  amenities on 5,600  acres,  of which 1,920 acres are owned by the Company
and 3,680 acres are subject to options  expiring in various  years through 2000.
The Company  broke  ground at Sun City Hilton Head in May 1994 and began  taking
new home sales orders in November  1994. In part because Sun City Hilton Head is
located on the East Coast,  distant from the Company's  other  communities,  and
because  of  the  location  of  Sun  City  Hilton  Head  in  relation  to  major
metropolitan  areas, there is not the same local pent-up demand for initial home
sales orders at this  community  as has existed  with  certain of the  Company's
other communities. In addition, rains and flooding severely hampered development
and marketing at this community in fiscal 1995. At June 30, 1995 the Company had
a backlog of 149 home sale  contracts at Sun City Hilton Head.  Home closings at
Sun City Hilton Head began in August 1995. See "Sales Activities."

         Sun City Georgetown
         -------------------
Sun City  Georgetown is an active adult community being developed 30 miles north
of downtown  Austin,  Texas.  It is  currently  planned for 9,500 homes on 5,300
acres, of which 1,850 acres are owned by the Company and 3,450 acres are subject
to options  expiring in various years through 1999.  The Company broke ground at
Sun City Georgetown in the Spring of 1995 and began taking new home sales orders
at this  community on June 15, 1995.  At June 30, 1995 the Company had a backlog
of 122 home sale  contracts at Sun City  Georgetown.  The Company  believes that
this level of initial  home sales  activity  is  attributable  to local  pent-up
demand and will not continue in the future.  Delivery of the first homes at this
community is currently anticipated in the Spring of 1996.

         Communities in Earlier Stages of Development

The following table shows certain information  concerning the two communities in
earlier stages of development at June 30, 1995.

                                      Sun City
                                   MacDonald Ranch               Sun City Grand
                                   ---------------               --------------
Total acres...................            600                        4,000
Homes at completion...........          2,300                        9,500


         Sun City MacDonald Ranch
         ------------------------
Sun City MacDonald Ranch is located in Henderson,  Nevada, near Las Vegas. It is
being  developed as an active adult community with fewer amenities (for example,
an  executive  golf course  instead of a  championship  golf  course) and higher
density than the Company's  other active adult  communities.  This  community is
currently  planned for 2,300 homes on 600 acres. The Company broke ground at Sun
City  MacDonald  Ranch in the Spring of 1995 and plans to begin to take new home
sales orders at this  community in the Fall of 1995.  Home  closings at Sun City
MacDonald  Ranch are not  currently  anticipated  to begin  before the Spring of
1996.

         Sun City Grand
         --------------
Sun City Grand is  located  on 4,000  acres  adjacent  to Sun City  West.  It is
currently planned for 9,500 homes, several golf courses and amenities similar to
those in other Sun Cities.  Development began in the Spring of 1995 and is being
coordinated  with the build-out of Sun City West. The Company does not currently
anticipate that home sales activity will begin at Sun City Grand in fiscal 1996.

POTENTIAL FUTURE COMMUNITIES

The Company believes that the demographic  attributes of its active adult target
market segment of people age 55 and over present  significant  opportunities for
carefully  selected  future active adult  communities.  The Company's plan is to
capitalize on those  opportunities and its experience,  expertise and reputation
by developing active adult communities in strategically selected locations.  The
current business  strategy of the Company includes  conducting  extensive market
research on prospective areas,  including consumer surveys and supply and demand
analyses,  in  connection  with its  evaluation of sites for future active adult
communities.  At any  given  time,  the  Company  may  have  a  number  of  land
acquisitions  for  potential  communities  under study and in various  stages of
investigation or negotiation. The Company is currently considering acquiring the
land for  communities  to be  located  both in areas of the  Country  where  the
Company  has  active  adult  communities  and in  other  areas,  including  full
four-season areas (i.e., areas which experience cold winters), where it does not
have experience in developing communities.

In making  significant land  acquisitions,  the Company  generally  endeavors to
acquire  options on the land to mitigate the risk of holding the land during the
detailed   feasibility  and   entitlement   process.   However,   under  certain
circumstances, the Company acquires such property directly.

In 1992 the  Company  purchased  for $11  million,  5,600 acres of land north of
Phoenix  (currently  known as the  Villages  at Desert  Hills) as the site for a
possible master-planned  community. In April 1995 the Company received a general
plan amendment and  development  master plan approval (the initial  governmental
planning  approvals  required)  for  16,500  homes  on this  property.  However,
development of this property  remains subject to a number of  uncertainties  and
the planning,  entitlement and permitting process is still in a relatively early
stage.

CONVENTIONAL HOMEBUILDING

The Company began its conventional  subdivision  homebuilding  operations in the
Phoenix  area in  1991.  The  Company  expanded  its  conventional  homebuilding
operations to Tucson in fiscal 1994 and to Las Vegas and southern  California in
fiscal 1995.  At June 30, 1995 the Company had a backlog of home sales orders at
26 subdivisions -- 18 in the Phoenix area,  three in the Tucson area, two in the
Las Vegas area and three in southern California.

In order to capitalize on its market knowledge and organizational structure, the
Company's conventional  homebuilding activities are primarily conducted in those
metropolitan  or market areas in which the Company is developing an active adult
community.  Through  June  30,  1995  the  Company's  conventional  homebuilding
operations have generally targeted  first-time and move-up buyers, with the base
price of  homes  offered  for sale at June 30,  1995  ranging  from  $80,000  to
$316,000.  The Company  expects  homes in this price range to be its main target
segment  in the  future,  but it  intends  to  remain  flexible  when  reviewing
potential sites in order to pursue attractive opportunities.

The Company currently expects that community development will continue to be its
primary  business  activity.  For the year  ended  June 30,  1995,  conventional
homebuilding operations generated 18 percent of the Company's revenues.

PRODUCT DESIGN

The Company  designs  homes to suit its market and  endeavors  to conform to the
popular  home  design   characteristics  in  the  particular  geographic  market
involved.  Home  designs  are  periodically  reviewed  and refined or changed to
reflect changing homebuyer tastes in each market.

Homes at the  Company's  communities  generally  range in size from 1,000 square
feet to 3,900 square feet and include two to five  (predominantly two and three)
bedrooms,  two or more baths, kitchen,  living/dining area, family room or nook,
two-car  garages and golf cart space.  Built-in  appliances  are  included.  The
Company offers a program of interior and exterior upgrades,  including different
styles of cabinetry and floor coverings and, at its  communities,  a program for
architectural changes to allow home buyers to further modify their homes.

CONSTRUCTION

The Company generally functions as its own general contractor.  At all stages of
production,  the  Company's  management  personnel  and on-site  superintendents
coordinate  the  activities  of  subcontractors,  consultants  and suppliers and
subject  their work to quality and cost  controls.  Consulting  firms  assist in
project planning and independent  subcontractors  are employed to perform almost
all of the site  development  and  construction  work.  Within its active  adult
communities and, generally,  its conventional  subdivisions,  the Company is the
exclusive  developer  of  homes  and does not sell  vacant  lots to  others  for
residential  construction  purposes.  The time required for  construction of the
Company's homes depends on the weather,  time of year,  local labor  situations,
availability of materials and supplies and other factors. The Company strives to
coordinate the construction of homes with home sales orders to control the costs
and risks associated with completed but unsold inventory. An inventory of unsold
homes under construction is maintained for immediate sale to customers.

SALES ACTIVITIES

At each of its  communities the Company  establishes a large and  well-appointed
sales pavilion and an extensive  complex of furnished model homes.  These models
include  a wide  variety  of single  family  homes,  each of which is  generally
available in several exterior styles.

The  Company's  homes  are sold by its  commissioned  sales  personnel,  who are
available  to  provide   prospective   home  buyers  with  floor  plans,   price
information,  option  selections and tours of models and lots.  All  communities
have co-brokerage programs with independent real estate brokers.  Homes are sold
through sales  contracts,  some of which allow  customers to purchase  homes for
delivery up to one year or more in the  future.  The sales  contracts  generally
require an initial  deposit and an additional  deposit prior to  commencement of
construction.  The Company provides to all home buyers  standardized  warranties
subject to specified limitations.

While more than one factor may  contribute  to a given home sale,  the Company's
experience  indicates  that a  substantial  portion  of the  home  sales  at its
communities  are  attributable  to follow-ups on referrals from residents of its
communities  and,  at  active  adult  communities,  to the  Company's  "Vacation
Getaway" program. This program enables prospective purchasers to visit an active
adult  community and stay (for a modest  charge) in vacation homes for up to one
week to experience the Sun City lifestyle prior to deciding  whether to purchase
a home.

The  Company's   information  is  that  most  homebuyers  at  its  active  adult
communities  generally  visit the  community in which they purchase on more than
one occasion  before buying.  This may affect the success or initial  success of
the  sales  effort  at those  communities  at which a higher  proportion  of the
potential customers do not live within a several-hour  driving distance from the
community.

The Company also markets its  communities  through  billboards,  television  and
radio  commercials,  local and national print  advertising,  direct mailings and
telemarketing.

The  Company  offers  mortgage  financing  for the  purchasers  of  homes at its
communities and  conventional  subdivisions.  The Company sells the mortgages it
generates to third parties.

OTHER REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES

The  Company is  completing  the  development  of The  Foothills,  a  4,140-acre
master-planned  residential land development project located in Phoenix in which
individual land parcels and lots are being sold to other  builder/developers for
conventional housing and related commercial developments.  At June 30, 1995, 424
acres  remained to be sold at The Foothills.  Of these acres,  401 are zoned for
conventional  housing and 23 are zoned for commercial  development.  At June 30,
1995 the Company's  investment in The  Foothills,  net of a valuation  allowance
recorded in fiscal 1991, was $25.9 million.

COMPETITION

The Company  believes  that it  maintains a leading  position  within the active
adult  community  market  in each of the  metropolitan  areas  in which it has a
community that is currently generating revenues.  The Company believes the major
competitive  factors in active adult community home purchases  include location,
lifestyle,  price,  value,  recreational  facilities  and  other  amenities  and
builder/developer  reputation. The Company believes its reputation,  established
by building and selling  more than 50,000  homes over 35 years and  providing an
attractive  lifestyle for adults age 55 and over,  enhances the Company's active
adult community marketing position.

All of the Company's  real estate  operations are subject to direct and indirect
competition.  The Company  competes with numerous  homebuilders  and developers,
certain of which have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company
also competes generally with most homebuilders and residential developers in its
geographic  markets and with resales of homes in the general  resale  market for
such housing, including in its own communities.

For the Company's active adult communities,  there are varying degrees of direct
and increasing  competition from businesses engaged  exclusively or primarily in
the  sale of homes  to  buyers  age 55 and  older  and from  non-age-restricted,
master-planned  communities in these areas.  The Company  competes with new home
sales and resales at these other communities. Sun City Hilton Head competes with
numerous   homebuilders  and  community  developers  in  the  eastern  seaboard,
including  in the Hilton Head area and  Florida.  A large  homebuilder  recently
commenced   developing  a   1,300-home,   age-restricted   community  in  Indio,
California, which is near Sun City Palm Springs.

The Company believes there may be significant  additional future  competition in
active adult community  development,  including  competition  from  conventional
community developers.

CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS

FUTURE  COMMUNITIES.  The  Company's  communities  will be built out over  time.
Therefore,  the medium- and long-term future of the Company will be dependent on
the Company's ability to develop and market future communities successfully.

Acquiring land and committing the financial and managerial  resources to develop
a community on that land involve  significant  risks.  Before these  communities
generate any  revenues,  they require  material  expenditures  for,  among other
things, acquiring land, obtaining development approvals and constructing project
infrastructure  (such as roads and utilities),  recreation centers,  model homes
and sales  facilities.  It generally  takes  several  years for  communities  to
achieve cumulative positive cash flow.

The Company  believes  that the  development  of Sun City  Hilton Head  presents
significant new development and marketing  challenges,  including  acquiring the
necessary  construction  materials  and  labor  in  sufficient  amounts  and  on
acceptable  terms,  adapting the Company's  construction  methods to a different
geography and climate,  and attracting  potential  customers from areas and to a
market in which the Company has not had significant experience.

The Company will incur additional risks to the extent it develops communities in
climates  or other  geographic  areas  in  which  it does  not  have  experience
developing communities or develops a different size or style of community. Among
other things, the Company believes that a significant  portion of the home sales
at its active adult  communities is attributable to referrals from, or sales to,
residents  of those  communities.  The extent of such  referrals or sales at new
communities,  including communities developed in other areas of the Country, may
be less than the Company has enjoyed at the active  adult  communities  where it
currently sells homes.

The  Company  currently  is  managing  the  development  of a greater  number of
projects in a wider  geographical  area than it has previously  developed at any
given time.

LONG-TERM  NATURE OF  PROJECTS;  REAL  ESTATE,  ECONOMIC  AND OTHER  CONDITIONS;
GEOGRAPHIC  CONCENTRATION.  The Company's  communities  are long-term  projects.
Sales activity at the Company's  communities  varies from period to period,  and
the ultimate success of any community cannot necessarily be judged by results in
any particular period or periods. A community may generate  significantly higher
sales levels at inception  (whether  because of local pent-up demand in the area
or  other  reasons)  than it does  during  later  periods  over  the life of the
community.

The Company's  communities  and its other real estate  operations are subject to
substantial  existing and potential  competition,  real estate market conditions
(both where its  communities,  conventional  homebuilding  operations  and other
projects are located and in areas where its  potential  customers  reside),  the
cyclical  nature  of  the  real  estate  business,   general  national  economic
conditions and changing demographic conditions.

Company data indicate that, for the past several years, a significant  number of
the home  purchasers  at its active  adult  communities  in Arizona,  Nevada and
southern  California,  particularly  Sun City Palm  Springs,  were from southern
California.  Four of the Company's  conventional  homebuilding  subdivisions are
located in California, including two in Orange County. Any of those communities,
particularly Sun City Palm Springs, as well as the Company's southern California
conventional  homebuilding  subdivisions,  may be  affected  by  the  continuing
adverse  conditions  in the  southern  California  real  estate  market  and the
southern California economy generally,  including the financial  difficulties of
certain southern California municipalities.

Most of the Company's primary business  operations are concentrated in a limited
number of metropolitan  areas in Arizona,  California and Nevada.  The Company's
geographic  concentration  and limited  number of projects may create  increased
vulnerability to regional economic  downturns or other adverse  project-specific
matters.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS. The Company's business
is subject to extensive federal,  state and local regulatory  requirements,  the
broad  discretion  that  governmental   agencies  have  in  administering  those
requirements and "no growth" or "slow growth" political  policies,  all of which
can prevent,  delay,  make uneconomic or significantly  increase the cost of its
developments.  In  addition,  environmental  concerns  and related  governmental
requirements  have  affected  and will  continue to affect all of the  Company's
community development operations.

In connection with the  development of the Company's  communities and other real
estate projects, particularly those located in California, numerous governmental
approvals and permits are required  throughout  the  development process, and no
assurance  can be  given as to the  receipt  (or  timing  of  receipt)  of these
approvals or permits. In addition,  third parties can file lawsuits  challenging
approvals or permits received,  which could cause substantial  uncertainties and
material delays for the project and, if successful, could result in approvals or
permits being voided.

FINANCING;  LEVERAGE.  Real estate  development is dependent on the availability
and cost of financing.  It generally  takes several years for new communities to
achieve  positive  cumulative  cash  flow.  In periods  of  significant  growth,
therefore,  the Company will require  significant  additional capital resources,
whether from issuances of equity or by incurring  additional  indebtedness.  The
Company's  principal  credit  facility and the indentures for its  publicly-held
debt restrict the  indebtedness  the Company may incur. The availability of debt
financing is also dependent on  governmental  policies and other factors outside
the  control of the  Company.  If the Company is at any time not  successful  in
obtaining sufficient capital to fund its development and expansion expenditures,
some or all of its  projects  may be  significantly  delayed,  resulting in cost
increases  and  adverse  effects  on the  Company's  results of  operations.  No
assurance can be given as to the  availability or cost of any future  financing.
In addition,  the Company's degree of leverage from time to time will affect its
interest incurred and may limit funds available for operations. As a result, the
Company  may be more  vulnerable  to economic  downturns,  which could limit its
ability to withstand adverse changes or capitalize on business opportunities. If
the  Company  is at any time  unable  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  from
operations to service its debt,  refinancing of all or a portion of that debt or
obtaining  additional  financing  may be required to avoid  defaults  (including
cross  defaults) on some or all of its  indebtedness.  There can be no assurance
that any such  refinancing  would be possible or that any  additional  financing
could be obtained,  or obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the
Company.

The Company's real estate  operations  are also dependent upon the  availability
and cost of  mortgage  financing  for  potential  customers,  to the extent they
finance  their  purchase,  and for buyers of the potential  customers'  existing
homes.

CONSTRUCTION.  The  Company  has  from  time to time  experienced  shortages  of
materials or qualified tradespeople or volatile increases in the cost of certain
materials  (particularly increases in the price of lumber and framing, which are
significant  components of home  construction  costs),  resulting in longer than
normal  construction  periods and increased costs not reflected in the prices of
homes for which  home sale  contracts  had been  entered  into up to one year in
advance of scheduled  closing.  Generally,  the Company's home sale contracts do
not contain, or contain limited, provisions for price increases if the Company's
costs of construction increase.

The  Company  relies  heavily  on  local  contractors,  who may be  inadequately
capitalized  or  understaffed.  The  inability  or  failure of one or more local
contractors to perform may result in  construction  delays,  increased costs and
loss of some home sale contracts.

NATURAL  RISKS.  Sun City  Roseville  and Sun City  Hilton  Head are  subject to
significant  seasonal  rainfall  that  can  cause  delays  in  construction  and
development or that can increase costs. Both of these communities were adversely
affected by significantly higher than normal rainfall in fiscal 1995.

Earthquake  faults,  including the San Andreas fault,  run through the Coachella
Valley,  which  includes  Sun City  Palm  Springs  and the  communities  of Palm
Springs,  Indio,  Palm Desert,  La Quinta,  Rancho  Mirage and Indian  Wells.  A
portion of Sun City Palm Springs is also located in a flood plain. The Coachella
Valley Water District has approved the Company's  conceptual  flood control plan
for Sun City Palm Springs and has approved the Company's  specific flood control
plan for the first phase of this project. A major earthquake or flood could have
a material  adverse  impact on the  development of and results of operations for
Sun City Palm  Springs.  Sun City Hilton Head is located in an area which may be
subject to hurricanes. A major hurricane could have a material adverse impact on
the development of and results of operations for Sun City Hilton Head.

As of July 31, 1995 the number of  shareholders of record of common stock of the
Company was 3,329.

The  Company has paid  regular  quarterly  dividends  of $.05 per share for each
quarter  in the last five  fiscal  years.  The  amount  and timing of any future
dividends  is subject to the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors.  Among the
factors which the Board of Directors may consider in determining  the amount and
timing of dividends  are the earnings,  cash needs and capital  resources of the
Company.  In  addition,  the  Company is party to a loan  agreement  and various
indentures  that contain  covenants  restricting  the  Company's  ability to pay
dividends  and acquire its common  stock.  Under the most  restrictive  of these
covenants,  at June  30,  1995  approximately  $16.9  million  of the  Company's
retained  earnings  were  available  for payment of cash  dividends  and for the
acquisition by the Company of its common stock.

The Company repurchased 1,046,751 shares of its common stock in fiscal 1994 (for
an aggregate cost of $13.3 million) and 444 shares of its common stock in fiscal
1995 (for an aggregate cost of $8,000).

In August 1995 the Company publicly sold 2,474,900 shares of its common stock at
a price to the public of $19.50 per share.

(1)   Earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 reflect
      a higher income tax rate (a rate more closely  approximating the statutory
      rate) than for  previous  years as a result of the  Company's  adoption of
      Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 109  effective
      July 1, 1992. In fiscal 1993 the Company recognized a $20 million increase
      in net earnings as a result of a cumulative effect of an accounting change
      from the adoption of SFAS No. 109. Earnings from continuing operations and
      net  earnings  for  fiscal  1991  were  reduced  by a $5  million  pre-tax
      valuation allowance related to the Company's  residential land development
      project.

(2)   The loss from discontinued  operations for fiscal 1993 primarily consisted
      of additional loss provisions  related to the Company's  discontinued land
      development projects.

(3)   The extraordinary gains recognized by the Company in fiscal 1993, 1992 and
      1991 resulted from the extinguishment of debt on discounted bases.

(1)  Net of cancellations.  The Company recognizes revenue at close of escrow.

(2)  The Company  began taking new home sales orders at Sun City Palm Springs in
     July  1992.  Of the 450 new  orders  taken in fiscal  1993 at Sun City Palm
     Springs, 235 were to customers who had made non-binding  reservations prior
     to July 1, 1992.  Home  closings at Sun City Palm Springs  began in October
     1992.

(3)  The Company began taking new home sales orders at Sun City Roseville in May
     1994, at Sun City Hilton Head in November  1994, at Sun City  Georgetown in
     June 1995 and at  Terravita  in November  1993.  Home  closings at Sun City
     Roseville  began  in  February  1995 and at  Terravita  in July  1994.

(4)  A majority  of the  backlog at June 30, 1995 is  currently  anticipated  to
     result in  revenues  in the next 12  months.  However,  a  majority  of the
     backlog at June 30, 1995 is contingent  upon the  availability of financing
     for the  customer,  sale of the  customer's  existing  residence  or  other
     factors.  Also,  as a practical  matter,  the  Company's  ability to obtain
     damages for breach of  contract  by a  potential  home buyer are limited to
     retaining all or a portion of the deposit received. In the years ended June
     30, 1995, 1994 and 1993  cancellations of home sales orders as a percentage
     of new home sales orders  written  during the year were 18.3 percent,  15.6
     percent and 14.1 percent, respectively.

Home closings at Terravita and Sun City  Roseville  accounted for $107.8 million
and $58.9 million, respectively, of the increase in revenues for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1995 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The Company
had not yet  begun  delivering  homes  at  these  communities  in  fiscal  1994.
Increased  home  closings (due to a higher  beginning  backlog) at the Company's
more mature active adult  communities (Sun City West, Sun City Tucson,  Sun City
Las Vegas and Sun City Palm Springs) accounted for $14.0 million of the increase
in  revenues.   Increased  home  closings  at  Coventry  Homes,   the  Company's
conventional homebuilding operation, accounted for $45.5 million of the increase
in  revenues.  Coventry  Homes'  increased  home  closings  were  due both to an
increase in  Phoenix-area  operations  and to the  expansion  of  operations  in
the Tucson and Las Vegas areas and southern California.

Increases in the average  revenue per home closing at the Company's  more mature
active adult  communities  and Coventry  Homes  accounted  for $33.8 million and
$19.0 million,  respectively,  of the increase in revenues.  These  increases in
average  revenues per home closing were  partially due to sales price  increases
implemented by the Company and partially due to market-driven changes in product
mix.

Land sales and other  revenues were $14.0 million  higher in fiscal 1995 than in
fiscal 1994.

Increased home closings at the Company's  active adult  communities and Coventry
Homes  accounted  for $60.3  million  and $18.3  million,  respectively,  of the
increase in revenues for fiscal 1994  compared to the fiscal year ended June 30,
1993.  Increases in the average revenue per home closing at the Company's active
adult  communities  and Coventry  Homes  accounted  for $20.2  million and $17.3
million,  respectively,  of the increase in revenues. These increases in average
revenue per home closing were partially due to sales price increases implemented
by the  Company and  partially  due to a greater  percentage  of sales of larger
active adult  community  homes or at more  expensive  conventional  homebuilding
subdivisions.  The  Company  experienced  decreased  home  closings  and average
revenue per home  closing at Sun City Palm  Springs for fiscal 1994  compared to
fiscal  1993,  primarily  due to a  decrease  in net new  orders  and a  greater
percentage of sales of smaller homes.

COST OF SALES.  The  increase in cost of sales to $646.1  million in fiscal 1995
compared to $404.2  million in fiscal 1994 was  primarily due to the increase in
home  closings.  As a percentage  of revenues,  cost of sales  increased to 80.4
percent for fiscal 1995 compared to 79.2 percent for fiscal 1994.  This increase
was  the  result  of a  variety  of  factors,  including  changes  in the mix of
contributions by various communities and Coventry Homes,  increased amortization
of capitalized  interest to cost of sales and decreased base housing  margins at
Sun City Tucson.  Increased  borrowings and higher interest rates resulted in an
increase in amortization of capitalized interest to 4.8 percent of total cost of
sales  for  fiscal  1995  compared  to 4.5  percent  for  fiscal  1994.  Pricing
strategies  employed by the Company to  facilitate  the  completion  of Sun City
Tucson resulted in a decrease in base housing  margins at that  community.  On a
period-to-period  basis, cost of sales as a percentage of revenues will vary due
to, among other things,  changes in product mix,  differences between individual
communities,  lot premiums,  upgrades and extras,  price  increases,  changes in
construction  costs and changes in the amortization of capitalized  interest and
other common costs.  Management  anticipates that (i) continued increases in the
amortization  of  capitalized  interest to cost of sales  resulting  from higher
levels of indebtedness  and increases in land held for  longer-term  development
(with respect to which land the Company cannot  allocate  capitalized  interest)
and (ii) changes in estimates on which the amortization of other common costs is
based will result in a greater  percentage  of  capitalized  interest  and other
common  costs being  amortized  to cost of sales in the next fiscal year than in
prior years.

Because the Company capitalizes  interest and amortizes  capitalized interest as
home  closings  occur over the lives of its projects and the Company has several
communities at which  closings have not yet begun, a significant  portion of the
reduction  in interest  costs  resulting  from the use of proceeds of the August
1995 public offering of 2,474,900  shares of common stock to repay  indebtedness
will not be reflected in reported  earnings for the Company's  fiscal year ended
June 30, 1996 and some portion will not be reflected in the following  year. See
"Liquidity and Financial Condition of the Company."

The  increase  in cost of sales in  fiscal  1994  compared  to  fiscal  1993 was
primarily due to increased  home  closings at all locations  other than Sun City
Palm Springs. The Company also experienced an increase in its cost of sales as a
percentage  of  revenues  from 77.4  percent in fiscal  1993 to 79.2  percent in
fiscal 1994,  primarily  reflecting  the impact of higher lumber costs.  Average
framing lumber  composite  prices were 22 percent higher for the 12 months ended
June 30,  1994 than for the 12 months  ended  June 30,  1993.  For the  Company,
framing  costs  represented  14.8 percent of total cost of sales for fiscal 1994
compared to 12.1 percent for fiscal 1993. These lumber cost increases  adversely
impacted the Company because homes with fixed sales prices  established in sales
contracts  entered into up to a year earlier were  constructed  and delivered at
higher  than  anticipated  costs.  In an effort to reduce the  effects of rising
costs,  the  Company   implemented   sales  price  increases  and  entered  into
fixed-price framing contracts for a significant portion of its homes constructed
through December 1994.

SELLING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES.  Of the  increase  in selling,
general and administrative expenses to $113.2 million in fiscal 1995 as compared
to $79.7 million in fiscal 1994,  $9.2 million was  attributable to higher sales
and  marketing   expenses  and  $7.9  million  was   attributable  to  increased
commissions on the higher revenues. The balance of the increase was attributable
to a variety of general and administrative expenses. Since a significant portion
of  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  is fixed,  the  increase in
revenues  for  fiscal  1995  resulted  in a  decrease  in  these  expenses  as a
percentage of revenues as compared to fiscal 1994.

Of the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $79.7 million
in fiscal 1994 as compared to $62.6  million in fiscal  1993,  $3.0  million was
attributable  to  increased  sales and  marketing  expenses and $3.8 million was
attributable to increased commissions on the increased revenues.  The balance of
the  increase  was  attributable  to a variety  of  general  and  administrative
expenses. The increase in revenues from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994 also resulted
in a decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenues.

OTHER  EXPENSE,  NET.  Included  in other  expense,  net in fiscal 1993 was $2.0
million of previously  capitalized costs related to an option the Company had to
purchase  land  near  Austin,  Texas as the  site of a  potential  active  adult
community, partially offset by $1.1 million of other income.

INCOME  TAXES.  The increase in income taxes to $15.3  million in fiscal 1995 as
compared to $9.2 million in fiscal 1994 was due to the increase in earnings from
continuing  operations before income taxes. The effective tax rate in both years
was 35 percent.  The  increase in income taxes to $9.2 million in fiscal 1994 as
compared to $7.9 million in fiscal 1993 was due to the increase in earnings from
continuing  operations  before income taxes and an increase in the effective tax
rate from 32 percent to 35 percent.

For financial  reporting and cash flow  purposes,  a recent state tax law change
and, possibly,  certain other matters are currently anticipated to result in the
Company's  effective  tax  rate  being  less in  future  periods  than it  would
otherwise have been.

LOSS FROM  DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  The non-cash  provision  for  discontinued
operations recorded by the Company in fiscal 1993 was attributable to the change
in carrying  values of the Company's two commercial  land  development  projects
from net  realizable  values to market values,  net of  anticipated  holding and
disposal costs, and to the settlement of other matters.

EXTRAORDINARY  GAIN. The extraordinary  gain recognized by the Company in fiscal
1993  resulted  from the  extinguishment  of a  portion  of notes  payable  on a
discounted basis.

CUMULATIVE  EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING  CHANGE.  The $20 million  cumulative effect of
accounting  change  in fiscal  1993  resulted  from the  Company's  adoption  of
Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 109,  Accounting  for Income
Taxes, effective July 1, 1992.

NET NEW ORDER  ACTIVITY AND  BACKLOG.  Net new orders  increased  9.4 percent in
fiscal 1995 compared to fiscal 1994. This increase was attributable to new sales
orders at Sun City Roseville,  Sun City Hilton Head, Sun City Georgetown and the
expansion of Coventry Homes' conventional  subdivision  homebuilding operations.
The Company did not have a full year of sales  activity at Sun City Roseville in
fiscal  1994 and began home sales  activity at Sun City Hilton Head and Sun City
Georgetown in fiscal 1995. At the more mature  communities of Sun City West, Sun
City Las  Vegas,  Sun City  Tucson  and Sun City Palm  Springs,  net new  orders
decreased  by 14.8  percent,  due  primarily  to  exceptionally  high new  order
activity at Sun City West and Sun City Las Vegas in the prior year,  the winding
down of new order  activity at Sun City Tucson as  build-out  of that  community
approaches  and the  effect  on Sun  City  Palm  Springs  of  continued  adverse
conditions in the southern California economy.

Cancellations  of home sales  orders as a  percentage  of new home sales  orders
written  increased to 18.3 percent for fiscal 1995  compared to 15.6 percent for
fiscal 1994 and 14.1  percent for fiscal  1993.  The  increases  were  primarily
attributable to Sun City Roseville and Terravita,  which experienced  strong new
order  activity but higher  cancellation  percentages  than the  Company's  more
mature active adult communities. Management believes that cancellations at these
new  communities  may have been higher than they would  otherwise have been as a
result of extended home delivery  periods  resulting from new orders taken prior
to site and amenity development.

The number of homes in backlog at June 30, 1995 was 8.2  percent  higher than at
June 30, 1994.  This  increase was  primarily  attributable  to the inclusion of
homes  under  contract  at Sun City  Hilton  Head and Sun  City  Georgetown  and
increases in backlog at Sun City Roseville and Coventry Homes,  partially offset
by declines in homes under contract at the Company's more mature communities.

Net new orders  increased  38.1 percent in fiscal 1994  compared to fiscal 1993,
primarily reflecting increased sales orders for Coventry Homes (resulting from a
larger number of subdivisions than in fiscal 1993), new sales orders at Sun City
Roseville  (at which the Company  began taking new sales orders in May 1994) and
new sales  orders at  Terravita  (at which the  Company  began  taking new sales
orders in November 1993).  The Company also  experienced  increased sales orders
atall operating active adult communities except Sun City Palm Springs, where net
new orders  were  affected  by  continued  adverse  conditions  in the  southern
California economy. The number of homes under contract at June 30, 1994 was 56.6
percent higher than at June 30, 1993.  This increase was primarily  attributable
to the initial  sales orders at Sun City  Roseville and Terravita and to an 88.6
percent increase for Coventry Homes.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY
------------------------------------------------
In November  1994 the Company  negotiated  an amendment to its senior  unsecured
revolving  credit  facility to  increase  the amount of the  facility  from $125
million to $175  million.  In June 1995 the senior  unsecured  revolving  credit
facility  was  further  amended to increase  the amount of the  facility to $300
million,  which will  provide  greater  flexibility  in the nature and timing of
future development expenditures.  In connection with this amendment, the Company
repaid  its  secured  Coventry  Homes  bank debt and  reduced  the amount of its
short-term lines of credit from $20 million to $10 million. At June 30, 1995 the
Company had $18.9 million of cash and short-term  investments and $141.5 million
and $8.3 million of unused borrowing  capacity under its $300 million  unsecured
revolving  credit  facility  and $10  million  of  short-term  lines of  credit,
respectively.

In August 1995 the Company  publicly sold 2,474,900  shares of its common stock.
The net  proceeds of  approximately  $45 million were used to repay a portion of
the indebtedness  outstanding  under the Company's $300 million senior unsecured
revolving  credit  facility.  The Company  intends to reborrow  under the senior
unsecured  revolving  credit  agreement  from time to time as  necessary to fund
development  of  existing  and new  projects  and for  other  general  corporate
purposes.

Management believes that the Company's current borrowing capacity, when combined
with existing cash and short-term  investments  and currently  anticipated  cash
flows  from  the  Company's  operating  communities,  conventional  homebuilding
activities and residential  land development  project,  will provide the Company
with  adequate  capital  resources to fund the Company's  currently  anticipated
operating  requirements  for the next 12 months.  Cash flows from the  Company's
operating  communities,  however,  are expected to be negatively impacted by the
decline in net new order  activity  and  backlog at the  Company's  more  mature
active adult communities.

The Company's senior unsecured  revolving credit facility and the indentures for
the Company's  publicly-held debt contain restrictions which could, depending on
the circumstances,  affect the Company's ability to borrow in the future. If the
Company at any time is not  successful in obtaining  sufficient  capital to fund
its then planned  development  and  expansion  expenditures,  some or all of its
projects  may be  significantly  delayed.  Any such delay  could  result in cost
increases and may adversely affect the Company's results of operations.

The cash flow for each of the  Company's  communities  can differ  substantially
from reported  earnings,  depending on the status of the development  cycle. The
initial years of development or expansion require  significant cash outlays for,
among other things, land acquisition, obtaining master plan and other approvals,
construction of amenities (including golf courses and recreation centers), model
homes,  sales and administration  facilities,  major roads,  utilities,  general
landscaping and interest. Since these costs are capitalized,  this can result in
income  reported for  financial  statement  purposes  during those initial years
significantly   exceeding  cash  flow.  However,  after  the  initial  years  of
development  or  expansion,  when  these  expenditures  are made,  cash flow can
significantly exceed income reported for financial statement purposes,  as costs
of sales includes  amortization  charges for  substantial  amounts of previously
expended costs.

During  fiscal  1995 the  Company  generated  $212.4  million  of net cash  from
community  sales  activities,  used $100.3  million of cash for land and lot and
amenity  development  at  operating  communities,  paid $98.2  million for costs
related to communities in the pre-operating stage, used $6.5 million of net cash
for  conventional  homebuilding  operations  and used $65.0  million of cash for
other operating activities.

The Company  believes  that, of the $820.4  million of cash spent by the Company
during  fiscal 1995 for land  acquisitions,  lot and amenity  development,  home
construction and other operating activities, approximately $135.9 million was to
some extent  discretionary as to timing and precedes the actual  construction of
homes from which cash can be generated upon closing of home sale contracts. This
$135.9  million  was  comprised  of $98.2  million  related to  projects  in the
pre-operating  stage  and  $37.7  million  for  land  acquisitions  and  amenity
development at operating communities.

At June 30, 1995,  under the most  restrictive of the covenants in the Company's
debt agreements, $16.9 million of the Company's retained  earnings was available
for  payment of cash  dividends  and for the  acquisition  by the Company of its
common stock.

IMPACT OF INFLATION
-------------------
Operations  of the Company can be  impacted  by  inflation.  Home and land sales
prices can increase,  but inflation can also cause  increases in interest  costs
and the costs of land,  raw  materials  and  subcontracted  labor.  Unless  such
increased  costs are recovered  through higher sales prices,  operating  margins
will decrease.  High mortgage interest rates may also make it more difficult for
the Company's  potential customers to sell their existing homes in order to move
to one of the  Company's  communities  or to finance the  purchases of their new
homes.

ACCOUNTING STANDARD NOT YET ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY
--------------------------------------------------
The  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  recently  issued  SFAS  No.  121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of, which the Company  will be required to implement  effective  for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997.

This statement  requires that long-lived  assets must be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may not be  recoverable.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) from an asset to be held and used is
less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss must be recognized
in the amount of the  difference  between  the  carrying  value and fair  value.
Assets to be disposed  of must be valued at the lower of carrying  value or fair
value less costs to sell.

Management  believes  that if this standard  were to be  implemented  currently,
there  would  not be an  impairment  loss;  however,  until  it is  implemented,
management  will  periodically  reassess the Company's  situation in relation to
SFAS No. 121.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

Financial Statements

Del Webb  Corporation is  responsible  for the  preparation,  integrity and fair
presentation of its published  financial  statements.  The financial  statements
that follow have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
principles and, as such,  include amounts based on judgements and estimates made
by management.  The Company also prepared the other information  included in the
annual  report and is  responsible  for its  accuracy and  consistency  with the
financial statements.

The financial  statements have been audited by the independent  accounting firm,
KPMG Peat  Marwick  LLP,  which was given  access to all  financial  records and
related data,  including  minutes of all meetings of shareholders,  the board of
directors  and  committees  of  the  board.   The  Company   believes  that  all
representations  made to the independent  auditors during their audit were valid
and  appropriate.  KPMG Peat  Marwick  LLP's audit  report is  presented  on the
following page.

Internal Control System

The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial  reporting and
over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
which is designed to provide  reasonable  assurance to the Company's  management
and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
statements  and such  asset  safeguarding.  The  system  includes  a  documented
organizational  structure and division of responsibility,  established  policies
and procedures  (including a code of conduct) which are communicated  throughout
the Company, and the selection,  training and development of employees. Internal
auditors  monitor  the  operation  of the  internal  control  system  and report
findings and  recommendations  to  management  and the board of  directors,  and
corrective  actions  are  taken  to  correct  deficiencies  if and as  they  are
identified.  The board,  operating through its audit committee which is composed
of  directors  who  are not  officers  or  employees  of the  Company,  provides
oversight to the financial reporting and asset safeguarding process.

Even an effective  internal  control  system,  no matter how well designed,  has
inherent  limitations  -- including  the  possibility  of the  circumvention  or
overriding of controls -- and therefore  can provide only  reasonable  assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and asset safeguarding. Further,
because of changes in conditions, internal control system effectiveness may vary
over time.

The Company assessed its internal control system as of June 30, 1995 in relation
to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in
"Internal Control -- Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment,  the Company
believes  that,  as of June 30,  1995,  its  system  of  internal  control  over
financial  reporting  and  over  safeguarding  of  assets  against  unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition met those criteria.

                          Independent Auditors' Report




The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Del Webb Corporation:

We have audited the  consolidated  financial  statements of Del Webb Corporation
and  subsidiaries  as listed in the  accompanying  index. In connection with our
audits  of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  we also have  audited  the
financial   statement   schedule  listed  in  the  accompanying   index.   These
consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  statement  schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Del Webb Corporation
and  subsidiaries  as of June  30,  1995  and  1994,  and the  results  of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended June 30, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also in our opinion,  the related financial statement schedule,  when considered
in relation to the basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes effective July 1, 1992.

                     DEL WEBB CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                          June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993


(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a)  Principles of Consolidation
          ---------------------------

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Del Webb
          Corporation  and  its   Subsidiaries   ("Company").   All  significant
          intercompany   transactions  and  accounts  have  been  eliminated  in
          consolidation.

          The  Company's   continuing   operations   include  its   communities,
          conventional  homebuilding operations and residential land development
          project.  The Company's  communities are  large-scale,  master-planned
          residential  communities  at which the Company  controls all phases of
          the master plan  development  process from land selection  through the
          construction and sale of homes. Within its communities, the Company is
          the  exclusive   developer  of  homes.   The  Company's   conventional
          homebuilding  operations  encompass the construction and sale of homes
          in subdivisions.  The Company's  residential land development  project
          operations  include the sale of  individual  land  parcels and lots to
          other  builders and developers  for  conventional  housing and related
          commercial  development.  The Company's  commercial  land  development
          projects are accounted for as discontinued operations.

     (b)  Real Estate Inventories
          -----------------------
          Real estate inventories include  undeveloped land,  partially improved
          land,  amenities  and homes on  finished  lots,  in various  stages of
          completion.  These assets include direct  construction costs for homes
          and common costs.  Common costs include land,  general and subdivision
          land  development  costs,  model and vacation  home costs in excess of
          normal direct  construction  costs,  costs of community sales centers,
          costs  of  assets  (such  as  golf  courses  and  recreation  centers)
          contributed to the community  associations,  costs of subsidizing  the
          community  associations,  other  costs  (such as  property  taxes  and
          pre-operating costs) and development period interest, all of which are
          capitalized.  The capitalized  costs and estimated future common costs
          are allocated,  on a community by community  basis, to residential and
          commercial  lots based upon the  estimated  relative  sales value that
          each lot has to the estimated aggregate sales value of all lots in the
          community. Cost of sales includes the direct construction costs of the
          home and an allocation of common costs. Sales commissions, advertising
          and other  marketing  expenses  are  included in selling,  general and
          administrative  expenses.  The Company  recognizes revenue at close of
          escrow.

          The Company reviews the valuation of its real estate  inventories on a
          continual  basis.  For  financial  reporting  purposes,   real  estate
          inventories  not held for bulk  sale must be  carried  at the lower of
          historical  cost or estimated net realizable  value.  Real estate held
          for bulk  sale must be  carried  at the  lower of  historical  cost or
          estimated market value. Net realizable value differs from market value
          in that,  among  other  things,  market  value  is based on the  price
          obtainable  in a bulk  cash  sale at the  present  time,  considers  a
          potential purchaser's  requirement for future profit and discounts the
          timing of expected cash receipts at a market rate of interest, whereas
          net  realizable  value  is the  price  obtainable  in the  future  for
          individual  parcels as  improved,  net of disposal  and holding  costs
          (including  interest  at an  estimated  cost of funds  rate),  without
          provision  for  future  profit and  without  discounting  future  cash
          receipts to present value.

     (c)  Cash and Short-Term Investments
          -------------------------------
          The   Company's   policy  is  to  invest   its  cash  in   high-grade,
          income-producing short-term investments.  Accordingly, uninvested cash
          balances are generally kept at minimum levels.  Short-term investments
          are  valued  at the lower of cost or market  and  principally  include
          overnight   repurchase   agreements,   certificates   of  deposit  and
          commercial paper with an original maturity of less than 90 days.

     (d)  Depreciation
          ------------
          Depreciation is computed using  principally the  straight-line  method
          for  financial  statement  purposes  and  accelerated  methods for tax
          purposes, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

     (e)  Income Taxes
          ------------
          Prior to July 1,  1992  the  Company  accounted  for  income  taxes in
          accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS")
          No. 96,  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes.  In fiscal  1993 the  Company
          adopted SFAS No. 109,  Accounting  for Income  Taxes.  The  cumulative
          effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of $20 million is
          reported in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 1993.

          Under the asset and  liability  method of SFAS No. 109,  deferred  tax
          assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax  consequences
          attributable to differences  between the financial  statement carrying
          amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
          bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
          tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which
          those  temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
          Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities
          of a change in tax rates is recognized in the  consolidated  statement
          of earnings as an adjustment  to the effective  income tax rate in the
          period that includes the enactment date.

     (f)  Earnings per Share
          ------------------
          Earnings  per share is  determined  by  dividing  net  earnings by the
          weighted  average  number  of  common  and  common  equivalent  shares
          outstanding  during the year.  Common  equivalent  shares of  382,000,
          219,000 and 292,000  included in the computation of earnings per share
          for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,  represent the effect of
          stock options.

     (g)  Statements of Cash Flows
          ------------------------
          In the  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  the  Company  defines  operating
          communities as communities  generating  revenue through home closings.
          Communities in the  pre-operating  stage are those  not yet generating
          home sales revenues.

     (h)  Warranty Costs
          --------------
          Estimated  future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales when the
          revenues from home closings are recognized.

     (i)  Financial Instruments
          ---------------------
          In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  invests in various
          financial assets and incurs various financial liabilities. The Company
          does not  trade  in  derivative  financial  instruments,  although  it
          occasionally  enters into agreements  involving  derivative  financial
          instruments  for  purposes  other than  trading.  At June 30, 1995 the
          Company had two  financial  instruments  that are included  within the
          definition  of  derivative  financial  instruments.   These  financial
          instruments are described below.

          The  Company has a currency  exchange  agreement  entered  into with a
          major bank in 1986  simultaneously  with the  issuance  outside of the
          United  States of 50  million  Subordinated  Swiss  Franc  Bonds  ($24
          million)  due  February  1996.  The  agreement  was  entered  into  to
          eliminate the Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  As
          of June 30,  1995 the  outstanding  Bonds  and the  currency  exchange
          agreement  have  been  reduced  to 26.7  million  Swiss  Fancs  ($12.8
          million).

          The Company also has an interest rate swap  agreement  which calls for
          an interest  rate  conversion  with a notional  amount of $20 million.
          This swap agreement was entered into to manage the Company's  interest
          rate risk. It requires fixed interest  payments on the notional amount
          at a rate of 10.5 percent  annually  until  February 1996. The Company
          receives  semi-annual  interest payments based on the six-month London
          interbank  offered rate (LIBOR)  until  February  1996. As a result of
          this  agreement,  the Company  incurred  net  interest  of $1.0,  $1.4
          million  and $1.4  million for the fiscal  years ended June 30,  1995,
          1994 and 1993, respectively.  A one percent decrease (increase) in the
          LIBOR  would  have  resulted  in a  $200,000  increase  (decrease)  in
          interest per year.

          The fair value estimates of financial  instruments presented in note 5
          have been determined by the Company using available market information
          and  valuation   methodologies  deemed  appropriate  by  the  Company.
          Considerable  judgement  is  required in  interpreting  market data to
          develop the  estimates  of fair value.  Accordingly,  these fair value
          estimates  are not  necessarily  indicative of the amounts the Company
          might pay or receive in actual market  transactions.  Potential  taxes
          and other  transaction  costs have not been  considered  in estimating
          fair value. As substantially  all of the Company's  assets  (including
          real estate  inventories,  property and equipment and deferred  income
          taxes) are not financial instruments, the disclosures in note 5 do not
          reflect the value of the Company as a whole.

          The fair  values of the  Company's  publicly  held debt are  estimated
          based on the quoted bid prices for these debt  instruments on June 30,
          1995. The carrying amounts of the Company's remaining debt approximate
          the  estimated   fair  values  because  they  are  at  interest  rates
          comparable to rates  currently  available to the Company for debt with
          similar  terms  and  remaining  maturities.  The  fair  values  of the
          Company's  interest rate swap agreement and foreign currency  exchange
          agreement are the amounts at which these off-balance sheet instruments
          could  be  settled,   based  on   estimates   obtainedfrom   financial
          institutions.  For  all  other  financial  instruments,  the  carrying
          amounts  approximate  the fair values because of the short maturity of
          these instruments.

     At June  30,  1994  the  Company  classified  the  unamortized  cost of its
     vacation homes  (aggregating  $16.6 million) as property and equipment as a
     result of its  intent to  operate  the homes.  In fiscal  1995 the  Company
     decided  to return to  marketing  the homes for sale as  individual  units.
     Accordingly,  the homes were  reclassified  from  property and equipment to
     real estate inventories.

================================================================================

     In April 1992 the Company  completed a public  offering of $100  million of
     Senior Notes,  which are shown net of unamortized  deferred financing costs
     and  discount.  The  Notes  are due on  March  31,  2000  and have a stated
     interest rate of 10 percent per year. Interest is payable  semi-annually on
     March 31 and September 30. The annual effective interest rate of the Notes,
     after giving effect to the  amortization  of deferred  financing  costs and
     discount,  is 11.6 percent.  The Notes may be redeemed by the Company after
     March  31,  1997  at 100  percent  of the  principal  amount  of the  Notes
     redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

     In March 1993 the Company  completed a public  offering of $100  million of
     Senior Subordinated Debentures, which are shown net of unamortized deferred
     financing costs and discount. These Debentures are due on March 1, 2003 and
     have a stated interest rate of 9 3/4 percent per year.  Interest is payable
     semi-annually  on March 1 and  September 1. The annual  effective  interest
     rate of the Debentures, after giving effect to the amortization of deferred
     financing  costs and  discount,  is 10.3  percent.  The  Debentures  may be
     redeemed by the Company on or after March 1, 1998, 1999 and 2000 at 104.875
     percent, 102.4375 percent and 100 percent,  respectively,  of the principal
     amount of the Debentures redeemed,  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
     redemption date.

     In February 1994 the Company completed a public offering of $100 million of
     Senior Subordinated Debentures, which are shown net of unamortized deferred
     financing  costs.  These Debentures are due on February 15, 2006 and have a
     stated   interest  rate  of  9  percent  per  year.   Interest  is  payable
     semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The annual  effective  interest
     rate of the Debentures, after giving effect to the amortization of deferred
     financing  costs,  is 9.3 percent.  The  Debentures  may be redeemed by the
     Company  on or  after  February  15,  1999,  2000,  2001,  2002 and 2003 at
     104.500,  103.375, 102.250, 101.125 and 100 percent,  respectively,  of the
     principal  amount of the  Debentures  redeemed,  plus  accrued  and  unpaid
     interest to the redemption date.

     In February  1986 the Company  issued 50 million  Subordinated  Swiss Franc
     Bonds ($24 million) outside of the United States and simultaneously entered
     into a currency exchange agreement.  The Bonds are due in February 1996 and
     are shown net of unamortized deferred financing costs. The annual effective
     interest  rate of the Bonds,  after giving  effect to the  amortization  of
     deferred  financing costs and the cost of the currency exchange  agreement,
     is 12.5 percent.

     In March 1994 the  Company  established  a $125  million  senior  unsecured
     revolving  credit facility to replace a $50 million senior unsecured credit
     agreement and a $28 million  revolving credit agreement for the development
     of one of the  Company's  active  adult  communities  and to  increase  its
     borrowing capacity under credit  facilities.  At the same time, the Company
     also  paid  an $8.9  million  term  loan.  In  November  1994  the  Company
     negotiated an amendment to the senior  unsecured  revolving credit facility
     to increase the amount of the facility  from $125 million to $175  million.
     In June 1995 the facility was futher  amended to increase the amount of the
     facility to $300 million.  In connection with this  amendment,  the Company
     repaid the secured bank debt of its  conventional  homebuilding  operations
     and reduced the amount of its  short-term  lines of credit from $20 million
     to $10  million.  If the  revolving  credit  facility  is not  subsequently
     amended,  its  capacity  will  begin  declining  in June 1997  through  its
     maturity in December 1999.  Borrowings under this facility bear interest at
     the prime rate or, if the Company selects, at the Eurodollar rate plus 1.95
     percent.

     The senior  unsecured  revolving credit facility and the indentures for the
     Company's  publicly-held  debt contain covenants which,  taken together and
     among other things,  limit  investments in unentitled land and unsold homes
     under construction,  conventional  homebuilding  assets,  dividends,  stock
     repurchases, incurrence of indebtedness and certain acquisitions, and which
     could,  depending on the  circumstances,  affect the  Company's  ability to
     borrow in the future.

     At June 30, 1995 the Company had $141.5  million and $8.3 million of unused
     borrowing  capacity  under  the $300  million  unsecured  revolving  credit
     facility and $10 million of short-term lines of credit, respectively.

     At June 30,  1995,  under  the most  restrictive  of the  covenants  in the
     Company's debt agreements, $16.9 million of the Company's retained earnings
     was available for payment of cash dividends and for the  acquisition by the
     Company of its common stock.

     The estimated fair values at June 30, 1995 of the Company's Senior Notes, 9
     3/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures,  9% Senior Subordinated Debentures and
     Subordinated  Swiss Franc Bonds were $103.1 million,  $96.6 million,  $91.0
     million and $23.2 million,  respectively.  The estimated fair value at June
     30, 1995 of the interest rate swap agreement represented an unrealized loss
     of $0.8 million.  The estimated  fair value at June 30, 1995 of the foreign
     currency exchange agreement  reflected an unrealized gain of $10.4 million,
     although  this was offset by the  increase  in the fair value over the book
     value of the Subordinated Swiss Franc Bonds.

     The principal  payment  requirements  on debt for the next five years ended
     June 30 are as follows:

                        1996            $  28,323,000
                        1997            $   9,205,000

===============================================================================

     Included  in  deferred  income tax  expense  for  fiscal  1995 and 1994 are
     reductions  in the deferred tax asset  valuation  allowance of $2.7 million
     and $1.1 million,  respectively.  These reductions resulted from additional
     years of operating earnings  generated by the Company,  which increased the
     portion of the gross  deferred  tax asset that the Company  believed  would
     more likely than not be realized.

     Carryforwards
     -------------
     For  federal  income tax  purposes,  at June 30,  1995 the  Company had tax
     credit  carryforwards  of $4.6  million  that expire  beginning in the year
     ending June 30, 1997.

(7)  REINCORPORATION

     In  November  1994 the  Company  changed  its state of  incorporation  from
     Arizona to Delaware.  In connection with this  reincorporation,  the common
     stock  changed from common  stock  without par value to common stock with a
     par value of $.001 per share,  which  resulted  in a  consolidated  balance
     sheet  reclassification  within  shareholders'  equity from common stock to
     additional  paid-in  capital.  There was no  impact on total  shareholders'
     equity as a result of the reincorporation.

(8)  COMMON STOCK RESERVED

     The Company has four stock option plans:  the 1981 Stock Option Plan (under
     which no grants can be made  subsequent  to December  31,  1991),  the 1986
     Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan and the 1991 and 1993
     Executive Long-Term Incentive Plans (1991 ELTIP and 1993 ELTIP, which cover
     both options and  restricted  stock  grants).  Options  under each of these
     plans are  granted to key  employees  to purchase  shares of the  Company's
     common stock at a price not less than the current  market price at the date
     of the grant.  The options are exercisable  over a ten-year period from the
     date of the grant.  In July 1991 the SAR component of the 1986 Stock Option
     Plan was  eliminated  and all  outstanding  stand alone SARs were converted
     into  non-qualified  stock  options.  For the 1981 and 1986 plans,  600,000
     shares are authorized for grant. Shares authorized for grant under the 1991
     ELTIP total 750,000. Shares authorized for grant under the 1993 ELTIP total
     1,200,000,  of which no more than 450,000 may be used for restricted  stock
     grants.

     The Company has the 1991 Directors'  Stock Plan, under which options may be
     granted to the Directors of the Company to purchase shares of the Company's
     common stock at a price not less than the current  market price at the date
     of grant.  Under this plan the  Directors may elect to defer some or all of
     their annual  retainers  and receive  restricted  stock or stock options at
     prices that,  when combined with the amounts of deferred  retainers,  equal
     the current market price at the date of the grant.  Shares authorized under
     this plan total 75,000.

     The Company also has two restricted  stock plans (the 1986 Restricted Stock
     Plan and the 1989 Restricted  stock Plan) under which the Company's  common
     stock is granted to key  personnel  under  certain  restrictions.  For each
     plan, 175,000 shares are authorized for grant. Grants are issued at no cost
     to the employee.

     Activity in the stock option plans for the years ended June 30, 1995,  1994
     and 1993 is summarized as follows:

     discontinued  operations  of $12.8  million,  net of a tax  benefit of $8.2
     million,  to reflect  the change in carrying  values of its two  commercial
     land development  projects from net realizable values to market values, net
     of holding and disposal  costs,  and to provide for the settlement of other
     matters.

     The  principal  payment  requirements  on  real  estate  notes  payable  of
     discontinued  operations  are $1.1  million  per year for each of the three
     years  ending June 30,  1998 and $0.8  million for the year ending June 30,
     1999.

(13) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

     The Company is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
     course of  business.  While it is not  feasible  to  predict  the  ultimate
     disposition  of these matters,  it is the opinion of management  that their
     outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the financial  condition
     of the Company.

     The Company has issued  surety  bonds,  guarantees  and standby  letters of
     credit aggregating $154.9 million at June 30, 1995.

     The Company  leases from third  parties,  under  operating  leases,  office
     space,  apartment  units  which it rents to  prospective  customers  at its
     active adult  communities,  automobiles  and certain other  equipment.  The
     leases are  generally  renewable  at the  Company's  option for  additional
     periods.  Total rent expense incurred by the Company was $4.8 million, $3.7
     million and $3.3 million for the years ended June 30, 1995,  1994 and 1993,
     respectively.

     Minimum  lease  payments  to be made by the Company  under  non-cancellable
     lease agreements are as follows:

                                FIRST AMENDMENT
                          TO THE DEL WEBB CORPORATION
                  SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN NO. 1



         The Del Webb Corporation  Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plan No. 1
(the  "Plan"),  which was  originally  effective as of January 1, 1986,  and was
restated  effective as of April 20, 1993, is hereby further  amended as follows,
effective as of July 1, 1995:

            1. Section  2.1(a) of the Plan  is  amended by the  addition  of the
following sentence to the end thereof:
                  
            Any Participation  Agreement in effect prior to the adoption of this
            amended and  restated  Plan shall  continue in full force and effect
            until subsequently modified or replaced.

            2. Section  4.2(b) of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as
follows:

                    (b) High Average  Compensation.  "High Average Compensation"
               means the sum of the  Participant's  annual  total of salary  and
               incentive    compensation,    before   reduction   for   deferred
               compensation and 401(k)  contributions,  in the five (5) calendar
               years  out  of  the  seven  (7)  consecutive  calendar  years  of
               employment  with the  Employer in which such total is the highest
               divided  by  five  (5).   Where  the  actual   (not   annualized)
               compensation paid to a Participant during a partial calendar year
               is greater than the compensation paid to the Participant during a
               completed  calendar  year,  such partial year may be utilized for
               purposes of this provision.  Notwithstanding the above, incentive
               compensation  payments made in July, 1991, for the period January
               1,  1991,  to  June  30,  1991,  shall  not  be  included  in the
               computations of High Average Compensation.

            3. Section 4.5(d) of the Plan is amended in  its entirety to read as
follows:

                    (d)  Accelerated  Distribution.  Notwithstanding  any  other
               provision  of the Plan,  at any time after a Change in Control or
               any time following termination of employment, a Participant shall
               be entitled to receive, upon written request to the Committee,  a
               lump  sum  distribution  of all  or a  portion  of the  Actuarial
               Equivalent of the  Participant's  unpaid benefits under this Plan
               on the date on which the Committee  receives the written request.
               Each accelerated distribution shall be subject to a penalty equal
               to ten  percent  (10%) of the  amount  that  would  otherwise  be
               distributed   and  that  amount   shall  be   forfeited   by  the
               Participant.  The amount payable under this section shall be paid
               in a lump sum within  sixty-five  (65) days following the receipt
               of the notice by the Committee from the Participant. In the event
               a Participant  requests and obtains an  accelerated  distribution
               under this Section  4.5(d) and remains  employed by the Employer,
               participation  will  cease  and there  will be no future  benefit
               accruals under this plan.

                    In the event of a Participant's death and subsequent benefit
               payments to the  designated  beneficiary,  such  beneficiary  may
               request a distribution under this Section 4.5(d).

            4. Article  VIII is amended by  adding the following new Section 8.3
to the end thereof:
                          
                    8.3  Modifications  for  Particular  Participants.   In  the
               exercise of its  discretion,  the Board may modify or  supplement
               the  provisions  of  this  Plan  as it  applies  to a  particular
               Participant.  No  modification  or supplement  will be effective,
               however,   unless   it  is   reflected   in   the   Participant's
               Participation  Agreement,  or provided for in a  resolution  duly
               adopted by the Board, or reflected in any other written  document
               which is  executed  by an  officer  of the  Company  who has been
               specifically authorized to execute said written document pursuant
               to a resolution duly adopted by the Board.

            5. Except as otherwise  provided above,  the provisions of the Plan,
as amended and restated  effective as of April 20, 1993,  shall continue in full
force and effect.


            IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Del Webb  Corporation  has  caused  this First
Amendment to be executed by its duly authorized  representative on this 13th day
of July, 1995.

       2.1 Loans-General.

              (a)  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  this
       Agreement,  at any time  and from  time to time  from  the  Closing  Date
       through and  including the Banking Day prior to the Maturity  Date,  each
       Bank shall,  pro rata according to that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the then
       applicable  Commitments,  make  Advances to  Borrower in such  amounts as
       Borrower may request that do not exceed in the  aggregate at any one time
       outstanding the amount of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the  Commitments;
       provided that, giving effect to the Loan of which such Advance is a part,
       (i) the then outstanding principal  indebtedness  evidenced by the Line A
       Notes plus the  Aggregate  Effective  Amount  shall not exceed the Line A
       Commitment and (ii) the then outstanding principal indebtedness evidenced
       by the Line B Notes  shall not exceed the Line B  Commitment.  Subject to
       the limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
       under the Commitments without premium or penalty.

              (b) Subject to the next sentence, each Loan shall be made pursuant
       to a Request for Loan which shall  specify the requested (i) date of such
       Loan, (ii) type of Loan, (iii) amount of such Loan, (iv) in the case of a
       Eurodollar  Rate Loan, the Interest  Period for such Loan and (v) whether
       such Loan is to be made under the Line A or Line B Commitment. Unless the
       Agent has notified, in its sole and absolute discretion,  Borrower to the
       contrary,  a Eurodollar  Rate Loan (but not a Reference Rate Loan) may be
       requested by telephone by a  Responsible  Official of Borrower,  in which
       case Borrower shall confirm such request by promptly delivering a Request
       for Loan in person or by telecopier  conforming to the preceding sentence
       to the  Agent.  Borrower  and the Agent may enter  into a  memorandum  of
       understanding  setting  forth  specific  procedures  for such  telephonic
       requests;  if the  Agent  complies  with such  procedures  (or if no such
       memorandum is entered  into),  Agent shall incur no liability  whatsoever
       hereunder in acting upon any telephonic request for loan purportedly made
       by a Responsible  Official of Borrower,  which hereby agrees to indemnify
       the Agent from any loss,  cost,  expense or  liability  as a result of so
       acting.

              (c) Promptly  following  receipt of a Request for Loan,  the Agent
       shall notify each Bank by telephone or  telecopier  (and if by telephone,
       promptly  confirmed by  telecopier) of the date and type of the Loan, the
       applicable  Interest Period, the applicable  Commitment,  and that Bank's
       Pro Rata  Share of the Loan.  Not later than 11:00  a.m.,  San  Francisco
       time,  on the date  specified for any Loan (which must be a Banking Day),
       each  Bank  shall  make  its Pro Rata  Share  of the Loan in  immediately
       available  funds  available  to the  Agent at the  Agent's  Office.  Upon
       satisfaction or waiver of the applicable  conditions set forth in Article
       8, all Advances shall be credited on that date in  immediately  available
       funds to the Designated Deposit Account.

              (d) Unless the Majority Banks  otherwise  consent,  each Reference
       Rate Loan shall be an integral  multiple of  $1,000,000  and shall be not
       less  than  $1,000,000  and each  Eurodollar  Loan  shall be an  integral
       multiple of $1,000,000 and shall be not less than $10,000,000.

              (e) The  Advances  made by each Bank  shall be  evidenced  by that
       Bank's Line A Note or Line B Note, as applicable.

              (f) A Request for Loan shall be irrevocable upon the Agent's first
       notification thereof.

              (g) If no  Request  for  Loan  (or  telephonic  request  for  loan
       referred to in the second sentence of Section 2.1(b),  if applicable) has
       been made within the requisite  notice  periods set forth in Sections 2.2
       or 2.3 in connection  with a Loan which, if made and giving effect to the
       application of the proceeds  thereof,  would not increase the outstanding
       principal  Indebtedness evidenced by the Line A Notes or Line B Notes, as
       applicable,  then Borrower shall be deemed to have  requested,  as of the
       date upon which the  related  then  outstanding  Loan is due  pursuant to
       Section  3.1(e)(i),  a Reference Rate Loan under the Line A Commitment or
       Line B  Commitment,  as  applicable,  in an  amount  equal to the  amount
       necessary to cause the outstanding  principal  Indebtedness  evidenced by
       the  Notes to  remain  the same and the  Banks  shall  make the  Advances
       necessary to make such Loan notwithstanding Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2.

              (h) If a Loan is to be made on the same date that  another Loan is
       due and  payable,  Borrower or the Banks,  as the case may be, shall make
       available to the Agent the net amount of funds giving effect to both such
       Loans and the effect for purposes of this Agreement  shall be the same as
       if separate  transfers  of funds had been made with  respect to each such
       Loan,  provided that no such netting of payments  shall be made of a Loan
       under the Line A  Commitment  against the  repayment  of a Loan under the
       Line B Commitment.

       2.2 Reference  Rate Loans.  Each request by Borrower for a Reference Rate
Loan shall be made pursuant to a Request for Loan,  with a concurrent  telephone
notification,  received by the Agent, at the Agent's Office (and such additional
office of the Agent as it may designate from time to time),  not later than 1:00
p.m.  San  Francisco  time,  at least one (1) Banking Day before the date of the
requested  Reference Rate Loan. All Loans shall constitute  Reference Rate Loans
unless properly designated or redesignated as a Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to
Section 2.3.

       2.3 Eurodollar Rate Loans.

              (a) Each request by Borrower  for a Eurodollar  Rate Loan shall be
       made  pursuant to a Request for Loan (or  telephonic or other request for
       loan referred to in the second sentence of Section 2.1(b), if applicable)
       received by the Agent, at the Agent's Office (and such additional  office
       of the Agent as it may designate from time to time),  not later than 9:00
       a.m.,  San  Francisco  time, at least three (3)  Eurodollar  Banking Days
       before the first day of the applicable Eurodollar Period.

              (b) On the date which is two (2)  Eurodollar  Banking  Days before
       the first  day of the  applicable  Eurodollar  Period,  the  Agent  shall
       confirm  its  determination  of the  applicable  Eurodollar  Rate  (which
       determination  shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest  error) and
       promptly  shall  give  notice  of the same to  Borrower  and the Banks by
       telephone  or  telecopier  (and if by  telephone,  promptly  confirmed by
       telecopier).

              (c) Unless the Agent and the Majority Banks otherwise consent,  no
       more than four (4) Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall be outstanding at any one
       time.

              (d) Unless the Agent and the Majority Banks otherwise consent,  no
       Eurodollar  Rate Loan may be requested  during the existence of a Default
       or Event of Default.

              (e) Nothing  contained  herein shall  require any Bank to fund any
       Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market.

       2.4 Voluntary Reduction of Commitments. Borrower shall have the right, at
any time and from time to time,  without penalty or charge,  upon at least three
(3) Banking Days prior written  notice by a Responsible  Official of Borrower to
the Agent,  voluntarily to reduce,  permanently  and  irrevocably,  in aggregate
principal  amounts  in an  integral  multiple  of  $1,000,000  but not less than
$5,000,000,  or to terminate,  all of the then undisbursed portion of the Line A
Commitment or Line B Commitment, provided that any such reduction or termination
shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued and unpaid  commitment  fees with
respect to the portion of the Commitments being reduced or terminated. The Agent
shall  promptly  notify the Banks of any  reduction of a  Commitment  under this
Section 2.4.

       2.5  Automatic   Reduction  of   Commitments.   The   Commitments   shall
automatically  reduce on the Commitment Reduction Date by an amount equal to the
Commitment Reduction Amount and shall further  automatically reduce at the close
of business on each Quarterly  Payment Date  following the Commitment  Reduction
Date by 10% of the Adjusted  Commitments.  For purposes of this Section 2.5, the
Line A  Commitment  shall first be reduced to zero,  and  thereafter  the Line B
Commitment shall be reduced.

       2.6 Optional  Termination of  Commitments.  Following the occurrence of a
Change in Control,  the Majority Banks may in their sole and absolute discretion
elect, at any time until sixty (60) days immediately  subsequent to the later of
(a) such occurrence and (b) receipt of Borrower's written notice to the Agent of
such  occurrence,  to terminate the  Commitments,  in which case the Commitments
shall be terminated and reduced to zero effective on the date of such election.

       2.7  Automatic   Termination  of  Commitments.   The  Commitments   shall
automatically  terminate  and be  reduced  to  zero  upon  the  occurrence  of a
Disposition  consisting  of (a)  all or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of
Borrower,  or (b) all or substantially all of the capital stock of any Guarantor
Subsidiary (except a Guarantor  Subsidiary holding solely the assets of the Glen
Harbor Project or the Spring Creek Project),  or (c) all or substantially all of
the assets of any Guarantor  Subsidiary (not including those assets constituting
the Glen Harbor Project or Spring Creek Project).

       2.8 Agent's  Right to Assume Funds  Available  for  Advances.  Unless the
Agent  shall have been  notified  by any Bank no later than the  Banking  Day or
Eurodollar Banking Day, as applicable,  prior to the funding by the Agent of any
Loan that such Bank does not intend to make  available  to the Agent such Bank's
portion of the total  amount of such Loan,  the Agent may assume  that such Bank
has made  such  amount  available  to the  Agent on the date of the Loan and the
Agent may,  in  reliance  upon such  assumption,  make  available  to Borrower a
corresponding amount. If the Agent has made funds available to Borrower based on
such assumption and such  corresponding  amount is not in fact made available to
the  Agent  by  such  Bank,   the  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  such
corresponding  amount on demand  from such Bank.  If such Bank does not pay such
corresponding  amount  forthwith  upon the Agent's  demand  therefor,  the Agent
promptly shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall pay such corresponding  amount
to the  Agent.  The Agent  also  shall be  entitled  to  recover  from such Bank
interest on such corresponding  amount in respect of each day from the date such
corresponding  amount was made  available  by the Agent to  Borrower to the date
such  corresponding  amount is recovered by the Agent, at a rate per annum equal
to the daily Federal Funds Rate.  Nothing  herein shall be deemed to relieve any
Bank from its obligation to fulfill its share of the Commitments or to prejudice
any rights  which the Agent or Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of
any default by such Bank hereunder.

       2.9 Adjusting Purchase Payments.  Principal amounts outstanding under the
Line A Commitment or the Line B Commitment of the Original Loan Agreement on the
effective date of this  Agreement (the  "Carryover  Principal  Balance")  remain
outstanding  under the Line A Commitment  or Line B Commitment,  as  applicable,
hereunder.  Concurrently with the effectiveness of this Agreement and the making
of the initial  Loan as provided in Section 8.1, the Banks agree to purchase and
sell  undivided  interests  in the  Carryover  Principal  Balance  by  making or
receiving  Adjusting  Purchase  Payments  as  specified  in  Schedule  2.9  (the
"Adjusting Purchase Payment(s)") so that the Carryover Principal Balance will be
properly allocated and owing to the Banks under the Notes in accordance with the
Pro-Rata  Shares  specified  in  Schedule  1.2.  Each Bank  making an  Adjusting
Purchase  Payment shall deliver it to the Agent together with its funding of its
initial Advance, and the Agent shall forward such Adjusting Purchase Payments to
the Banks  entitled  thereto  promptly  after  receipt  in  accordance  with the
allocations  specified in Schedule 2.9. On the effective date of this Agreement,
in addition to any other Advances that may be made, each Bank shall be deemed as
having  made an  Advance in the amount of its  Pro-Rata  Share of the  Carryover
Principal Balance.

       2.10  Substitute  Credit  Facility.  Borrower  hereby  requests,  and the
parties  hereto agree,  that the Line B Commitment  constitutes a restatement of
the Line B Commitment  under the Original Loan Agreement and, as such,  shall be
made  available as and shall be designated as a Substitute  Credit  Facility (as
that term is defined in the  Indenture  evidencing  the Public Senior Debt) with
respect to the Substituted Credit Facilities.

       2.11 Senior Debt.  Without  limitation,  all  outstanding  principal  and
interest under the Notes  constitutes  "Senior Debt", as that term is defined in
the Indenture for the Public 9-3/4% Senior  Subordinated Debt, the Indenture for
the Public 9.00% Senior  Subordinated  Debt and the Public Bond Issue  Agreement
for the Swiss Franc Debt.

       2.12 Letters of Credit.

              (a) Subject to the terms and  conditions  hereof,  at any time and
       from time to time from the Closing Date through the  Maturity  Date,  the
       Issuing  Bank  shall  issue  such  Letters  of  Credit  under  the Line A
       Commitment  as  Borrower  may  request by a Request for Letter of Credit;
       provided that (i) giving effect to all such Letters of Credit, the sum of
       (A) the aggregate  principal  amount  outstanding  under the Line A Notes
       plus  (B) the  Aggregate  Effective  Amount  does  not  exceed  the  then
       applicable  Line A Commitment  and (ii) the  Aggregate  Effective  Amount
       shall not exceed  $5,000,000.  Each  Letter of Credit  shall be in a form
       acceptable to the Issuing  Bank.  The expiry date of any Letter of Credit
       shall not extend more than one (1) year beyond its issuance  date (unless
       otherwise  agreed by the  Issuing  Bank) nor,  in any  event,  beyond the
       Maturity Date. A Request for Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable absent
       the consent of the Issuing Bank.

              (b) Each  Request for Letter of Credit  shall be  submitted to the
       Issuing  Bank,  with a copy to the Agent,  at least five (5) Banking Days
       prior to the date upon which the related  Letter of Credit is proposed to
       be issued.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Issuing Bank whether such
       Request  for Letter of  Credit,  and the  issuance  of a Letter of Credit
       pursuant  thereto,  conforms to the requirements of this Agreement.  Upon
       receipt of favorable  notice from the Agent,  and promptly  after issuing
       each Letter of Credit,  the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent,
       and the Agent shall  promptly  notify the Banks,  of the amount and terms
       thereof.

              (c) Upon the  issuance  of a Letter of Credit,  each Bank shall be
       deemed to have  purchased a  participation  in such Letter of Credit from
       the Issuing  Bank in a  proportion  of the total equal to that Bank's Pro
       Rata  Share.  Without  limiting  the  scope  and  nature  of each  Bank's
       participation  in any Letter of Credit,  to the extent  that the  Issuing
       Bank has not been  reimbursed by Borrower for any payment  required to be
       made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall, pro
       rata according to its Pro Rata Share,  reimburse the Issuing Bank through
       the Agent  promptly  upon  demand  for the  amount of such  payment.  The
       obligation  of each  Bank to so  reimburse  the  Issuing  Bank  shall  be
       absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of
       an  Event  of  Default  or  any  other  occurrence  or  event.  Any  such
       reimbursement  shall not relieve or otherwise  impair the  obligation  of
       Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made
       by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit  together with interest as
       hereinafter  provided.  Each Bank that has  reimbursed  the Issuing  Bank
       pursuant to this Section  2.12(c) for its  Pro-Rata  Share of any payment
       made by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit shall thereupon acquire
       a pro-rata  participation,  to the extent of such  reimbursement,  in the
       claim of the Issuing  Bank against  Borrower  under  Section  2.12(d) and
       shall share,  in  accordance  with that  pro-rata  participation,  in any
       payment made by Borrower with respect to such claim.

              (d)  Borrower  agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank through the Agent
       an amount  equal to any payment  made by the Issuing Bank with respect to
       each Letter of Credit no later than one (1) Banking Day after demand made
       by the Issuing Bank therefor,  together with interest on such amount from
       the date of any payment made by the Issuing Bank. Interest on such amount
       shall accrue at the Reference Rate until the second Banking Day following
       the  payment  made by the  Issuing  Bank with  respect  to the  Letter of
       Credit,  and at the Default Rate thereafter.  The principal amount of any
       such payment by Borrower  shall be used to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
       the  payment  made by it under the  Letter  of  Credit.  Should  Borrower
       request a Loan under the Line A Commitment for the purpose of making such
       payment and make written  request to the Agent to pay the proceeds of the
       Loan directly to the Issuing Bank, then the amount to be so paid shall be
       deducted  from the  Aggregate  Effective  Amount for  purposes of Section
       2.1(a) in connection with such Request for Loan.

              (e) If  Borrower  fails to make the  payment  required  by Section
       2.12(d)  within  the  time  period  therein  set  forth,  in  lieu of the
       reimbursement  to the Issuing Bank under Section 2.12(c) the Issuing Bank
       may  (but is not  required  to),  without  notice  to or the  consent  of
       Borrower,  instruct  the Agent to cause  Advances to be made by the Banks
       under the Line A Commitment  in an  aggregate  amount equal to the amount
       paid by the Issuing  Bank with  respect to that Letter of Credit and, for
       this  purpose,  the  conditions  precedent  set forth in Articles 2 and 8
       shall not  apply.  The  proceeds  of such  Advances  shall be paid to the
       Issuing  Bank to reimburse it for the payment made by it under the Letter
       of Credit.

              (f)  The  issuance  of any  supplement,  modification,  amendment,
       renewal,  or  extension to or of any Letter of Credit shall be subject to
       such preconditions as the Issuing Bank may establish.

       amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
       shall  be  absolute,  unconditional,  and  irrevocable,  subject  only to
       performance  by the Issuing  Bank of its  obligations  to Borrower  under
       California  Uniform  Commercial Code Section 5109.  Without  limiting the
       foregoing,  subject to California  Uniform  Commercial Code Section 5109,

       circumstances:

                    (3) the existence of any claim,  setoff,  defense,  or other
              rights  which  Borrower  may have at any time  against the Issuing
              Bank, the Agent,  the Co-Agent or any Bank, any beneficiary of the
              Letter of Credit  (or any  persons or  entities  for whom any such
              beneficiary  may  be  acting)  or any  other  Person,  whether  in
              connection with the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other
              agreement  or  instrument   relating  thereto,  or  any  unrelated
              transactions;

                    (4) any demand,  statement,  or any other document presented
              under the  Letter  of Credit  proving  to be  forged,  fraudulent,
              invalid,  or insufficient in any respect or any statement  therein
              being untrue or  inaccurate  in any respect  whatsoever so long as
              any such document  appeared to comply with the terms of the Letter
              of Credit;

                    (5)  payment by the  Issuing  Bank in good  faith  under the
              Letter  of  Credit  against   presentation   of  a  draft  or  any

              terms of the Letter of Credit;

                    (6) the existence,  character, quality, quantity, condition,

              represented by documents  presented in connection  with any Letter
              of Credit or for any difference  between any such property and the
              character, quality, quantity, condition, or value of such property
              as described in such documents;

                    (7) the time, place,  manner, order or contents of shipments

                    (10) any error in the  transmission of any message  relating
              to a Letter of Credit not caused by the Issuing Bank, or any delay
              or interruption in any such message;

              the Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter of Credit;

              Issuing Bank;

                    (13) so long as the  Issuing  Bank in good faith  determines
              that the contract or document  appears to comply with the terms of
              the Letter of Credit,  the form,  accuracy,  genuineness  or legal
              effect of any  contract  or document  referred to in any  document
              submitted  to the  Issuing  Bank in  connection  with a Letter  of
              Credit; and

                    (14)  where the  Issuing  Bank has  acted in good  faith and
              observed   general   banking   usage,   any  other   circumstances
              whatsoever.

              (h) The Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the protection  accorded
       to the Agent pursuant to Section 10.7.

              (i) The  Uniform  Code of Practice  for  Documentary  Credits,  as
       published in its most  current  version by the  International  Chamber of
       Commerce,  shall be deemed a part of this  Section and shall apply to all
       Letters of Credit to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law.

              (j)  Concurrently  with the  issuance  of each  Letter of  Credit,
       Borrower  shall  pay a letter of credit  origination  fee to the  Issuing
       Bank, for the sole account of the Issuing Bank, in an amount  established
       from time to time by the  Issuing  Bank.  Borrower  shall also pay to the
       Agent for the ratable  account of the Banks in accordance  with their Pro
       Rata Shares,  a standby  letter of credit fee in an amount equal to 1.25%
       per annum times the face amount of such Letter of Credit, which fee shall
       be payable  quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date after the
       issuance of the Letter of Credit and on the  termination or expiration of
       such Letter of Credit.  The Agent shall  promptly  make  available to the
       Banks in immediately  available  funds,  pro-rata  according to their Pro
       Rata Shares,  the standby letter of credit fees which are for the account
       of the Banks.  Borrower shall also pay transfer fees, check fees, foreign
       currency exchange fees and costs, and such other fees as the Issuing Bank
       normally  charges  in  connection  with  standby  letters  of credit  and
       activity pursuant thereto,  which fees shall be solely for the account of
       the Issuing Bank.

              (k) To the extent of any  inconsistency  between the provisions of
       this  Agreement  regarding  Letters of Credit and those of Exhibit G, the
       provisions of this  Agreement  shall  govern,  provided that the grant of
       additional  (though not contrary)  rights or remedies to the Issuing Bank
       under  Exhibit  G  shall  not  be  construed  as  inconsistent  with  the
       provisions of this Agreement.

       provided for herein before and after default,  before and after maturity,
       before and after judgment,  and before and after the  commencement of any

       accrued during each Monthly  Interest  Period on each Reference Rate Loan
       shall be due and payable on the next succeeding  Monthly Payment Date and

       Majority Banks may determine that any or all then outstanding  Eurodollar
       Rate Loans shall be converted to Reference  Rate Loans.  Such  conversion
       shall be effective  upon notice to Borrower  from the Majority  Banks (or
       from the Agent on behalf of the  Majority  Banks) and shall  continue  so
       long as such Default or Event of Default continues to exist.

              (e) If not sooner paid,  the principal  Indebtedness  evidenced by

                   (i) the principal  amount of each  Eurodollar Rate Loan shall
              be payable on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan;

                   (ii)  the  amount,  if any,  by  which  (A)  the  outstanding
              principal  Indebtedness  evidenced  by the  Line A Notes  plus the
              Aggregate  Effective  Amount  at  any  time  exceeds  the  Line  A

              by the  Line B Notes at any time  exceeds  the Line B  Commitment,
              shall  be  payable  immediately,  and  shall  be  applied  to  the
              applicable  Notes or, if no amount is then  outstanding  under the
              applicable Notes,  shall be applied and held in a manner specified
              in Section 9.2(a)(2); and

                   (iii) the principal Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall
              in any event be payable on the Maturity Date.

              (f) The  principal  Indebtedness  under the Notes may, at any time
       and from time to time, voluntarily be paid or prepaid in whole or in part
       without  premium or penalty,  except that with  respect to any  voluntary
       prepayment under this Section 3.1(f), (i) any partial prepayment shall be

       before the date of  prepayment,  which notice shall identify the date and
       amount of the  prepayment  and the Loan(s) being  prepaid,  and (iii) any
       payment or prepayment of all or any part of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a
       day other than the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period shall be
       subject to Section 3.6(d).

       3.2 Arrangement, Agency and Co-Agency Fees. Borrower shall pay to Bank of

       according  to their Pro Rata Shares of the  Commitments,  a facility  fee
       equal  to  0.125%  per  annum  times  the  average  daily  amount  of the
       Commitments.  The facility  fee shall be payable  quarterly in arrears on
       each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date.

              (b)  Commitment  Fees.  From and after the Closing Date,  Borrower

       average  daily  amount by which  the  Commitments  exceed  the sum of the
       aggregate  principal   Indebtedness  evidenced  by  the  Notes  plus  the
       Aggregate Effective Amount. The commitment fee shall be payable quarterly
       in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date.

                  Notes plus the Aggregate Effective 
                  Amount exceeds 66% of the Commitments.        0.1875%

                  For such days that the aggregate
                  principal indebtedness evidenced by the

                  For such days that the aggregate
                  principal indebtedness evidenced by the

       3.5 Increased  Commitment  Costs.  If any Bank shall  determine  that the
introduction  after the Closing Date of any applicable law, rule,  regulation or
guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any change in the
interpretation  or   administration   thereof  by  any  central  bank  or  other
Governmental  Agency charged with the interpretation or administration  thereof,
or compliance by such Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) or any corporation
controlling  the Bank,  with any  request,  guidelines  or  directive  regarding
capital  adequacy  (whether or not having the force of law) of any such  central
bank or other authority,  affects or would affect the amount of capital required
or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any  corporation  controlling  such
Bank and (taking into consideration  such Bank's or such corporation's  policies
with  respect to capital  adequacy  and such Bank's  desired  return on capital)
determines  that the amount of such capital is increased,  or the rate of return
on capital is reduced, as a consequence of its obligations under this Agreement,
then, within five (5) Banking Days after demand of such Bank, Borrower shall pay
to such Bank,  from time to time as specified by such Bank,  additional  amounts

              maintains its principal office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B)
              any jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
              "doing  business"  (unless it would not be doing  business in such
              jurisdiction  (or  political   subdivision   thereof)  absent  the
              transactions  contemplated  hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes or
              other taxes based on gross income  imposed by the United States of
              America  (other  than  withholding  taxes and taxes based on gross

              administration  of any law, rule or regulation by any Governmental
              Agency after the date of this  Agreement) or (iii) any withholding
              taxes or other taxes based on gross  income  imposed by the United
              States of  America  for any  period  with  respect to which it has
              failed to  provide  Borrower  with the  appropriate  form or forms
              required  by  Section  11.19,  to the  extent  such forms are then
              required by applicable Laws;

                   (2) shall impose,  modify or deem  applicable any reserve not
              applicable  or deemed  applicable  on the date hereof  (including,
              without limitation,  any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors
              of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  but  excluding  the  Eurodollar
              Reserve   Percentage   taken  into  account  in  calculating   the
              Eurodollar Rate), special deposit, capital or similar requirements

              Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  its  obligation to make  Eurodollar  Rate
              Advances or this Agreement,  or shall otherwise  affect any of the
              same;

       and the  result of any of the  foregoing,  as  determined  by such  Bank,
       increases  the cost to such  Bank or its  Eurodollar  Lending  Office  of
       making or maintaining  any  Eurodollar  Rate Advance or in respect of any
       Eurodollar  Rate Advance,  any of its Notes  evidencing  Eurodollar  Rate
       Loans or its obligation to make  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or reduces the

       Notes  evidencing  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans  or  its  obligation  to  make
       Eurodollar Rate Advances  (assuming such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office
       had  funded  100%  of its  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance  in  the  Designated
       Eurodollar  Market),  then,  within five (5) Banking Days after demand by
       such Bank  (with a copy to the  Agent),  Borrower  shall pay to such Bank
       such  additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such

       Lending  Office had funded  100% of its  Eurodollar  Rate  Advance in the
       Designated  Eurodollar  Market).  Borrower hereby  indemnifies  each Bank
       against,  and agrees to hold each Bank harmless  from and reimburse  such
       Bank within five (5) Banking Days after demand for (without  duplication)
       all costs, expenses, claims, penalties,  liabilities,  losses, legal fees
       and damages  incurred or sustained by each Bank in  connection  with this
       Agreement, or any of the rights, obligations or transactions provided for
       or contemplated herein, as a result of the existence or occurrence of any
       Special  Eurodollar  Circumstance.  A  statement  of  any  Bank  claiming
       compensation  under this  subsection  and  setting  forth the  additional
       amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder  shall be  conclusive in the
       absence of  manifest  error.  Each Bank  agrees to  endeavor  promptly to
       notify Borrower of any event of which it has actual knowledge,  occurring
       after the Closing  Date,  which will  entitle  such Bank to  compensation
       pursuant to this Section,  and agrees to designate a different Eurodollar
       Lending Office if such  designation will avoid the need for or reduce the
       amount of such  compensation  and will not, in the judgment of such Bank,
       otherwise be materially  disadvantageous to such Bank. If any Bank claims
       compensation under this Section,  Borrower may at any time, upon at least
       four (4) Eurodollar Banking Days' prior notice to the Agent and such Bank
       and upon  payment in full of the  amounts  provided  for in this  Section
       through the date of such  payment  plus any  prepayment  fee  required by
       Section 3.6(d), pay in full the affected Eurodollar Rate Advances of such
       Bank or request  that such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  be  converted  to
       Reference Rate Advances.

              (b) If, after the date hereof,  the existence or occurrence of any
       Special Eurodollar  Circumstance  shall, in the opinion of any Bank, make
       it unlawful,  impossible or impracticable for such Bank or its Eurodollar
       Lending  Office to make,  maintain or fund its portion of any  Eurodollar
       Rate Loan, or materially  restrict the authority of such Bank to purchase
       or sell, or to take  deposits of,  Dollars in the  Designated  Eurodollar
       Market,  or  to  determine  or  charge  interest  rates  based  upon  the
       Eurodollar  Rate,  and such Bank  shall so notify  the  Agent,  then such
       Bank's obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended for
       the duration of such illegality,  impossibility or  impracticability  and
       the Agent  forthwith  shall give  notice  thereof to the other  Banks and
       Borrower.  Upon receipt of such notice, the outstanding  principal amount
       of such Bank's  Eurodollar Rate Advances,  together with accrued interest
       thereon, automatically shall be converted to Reference Rate Advances with
       Interest  Periods  corresponding  to the  Eurodollar  Loans of which such
       Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  were a part on either (1) the last day of the
       Eurodollar  Period(s) applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advances if such
       Bank may  lawfully  continue to maintain  and fund such  Eurodollar  Rate
       Advances to such day(s) or (2)  immediately if such Bank may not lawfully
       continue  to fund and  maintain  such  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances to such
       day(s),  provided that in such event the conversion  shall not be subject
       to payment of a prepayment fee under Section 3.6(d).  Each Bank agrees to
       endeavor  promptly to notify Borrower of any event of which it has actual
       knowledge,  occurring after the Closing Date,  which will cause that Bank
       to notify the Agent under this Section 3.6(b),  and agrees to designate a
       different  Eurodollar  Lending Office if such  designation will avoid the
       need  for such  notice  and  will  not,  in the  judgment  of such  Bank,
       otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Bank. In the event that any Bank is
       unable,  for the reasons set forth above,  to make,  maintain or fund its
       portion of any Eurodollar  Rate Loan, such Bank shall fund such amount as
       a Reference  Rate  Advance  for the same period of time,  and such amount
       shall be treated in all respects as a Reference  Rate  Advance.  Any Bank
       whose  obligation to make  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances has been  suspended
       under this Section 3.6(b) shall promptly notify the Agent and Borrower of
       the cessation of the Special  Eurodollar  Circumstance which gave rise to
       such suspension.

              (c) If, with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan:

                   (1) the  Agent  reasonably  determines  that,  by  reason  of
              circumstances affecting the Designated Eurodollar Market generally
              that are beyond the reasonable  control of the Banks,  deposits in
              Dollars (in the  applicable  amounts) are not being offered to any
              Bank  in the  Designated  Eurodollar  Market  for  the  applicable
              Eurodollar Period; or

                   (2) the Majority  Banks advise the Agent that the  Eurodollar
              Rate as  determined  by the  Agent  (i)  does  not  represent  the
              effective  pricing  to such Banks for  deposits  in Dollars in the
              Designated  Eurodollar  Market  in the  relevant  amount  for  the
              applicable  Eurodollar  Period,  or (ii) will not  adequately  and
              fairly  reflect  the cost to such Banks of making  the  applicable
              Eurodollar Rate Advances;

       then the Agent  forthwith  shall give notice  thereof to Borrower and the
       Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies Borrower that the circumstances
       giving rise to such  suspension  no longer exist,  the  obligation of the
       Banks to make any future Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.  If
       at the time of such notice  there is then pending a Request for Loan that
       specifies a Eurodollar  Rate Loan,  such Request for Loan shall be deemed
       to specify a Reference Rate Loan.

              (d) Upon payment or  prepayment  of any  Eurodollar  Rate Advance,
       (other than as the result of a conversion required under Section 3.6(b)),
       on a day  other  than the last day in the  applicable  Eurodollar  Period
       (whether  voluntarily,  involuntarily,  by  reason  of  acceleration,  or
       otherwise),  or upon the failure of Borrower (for a reason other than the
       failure  of a Bank to make an  Advance)  to  borrow on the date or in the
       amount  specified  for a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan in any  Request for Loan,
       Borrower shall pay to the  appropriate  Bank within five (5) Banking Days
       after demand a  prepayment  fee or failure to borrow fee, as the case may
       be,  (determined as though 100% of the  Eurodollar  Rate Advance had been
       funded in the Designated Eurodollar Market) equal to the sum of:

                   (1) principal  amount of the Eurodollar  Rate Advance prepaid
              or not borrowed, as the case may be, times [number of days between
              the date of prepayment or failure to borrow,  as  applicable,  and
              the last day in the applicable Eurodollar Period], divided by 360,
              times the  applicable  Interest  Differential  (provided  that the
              product of the foregoing formula must be a positive number); plus

                   (2)  all   out-of-pocket   expenses   incurred  by  the  Bank
              reasonably attributable to such payment,  prepayment or failure to
              borrow.

       Each Bank's  determination  of the amount of any  prepayment  fee payable
       under this Section  3.6(d) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
       error.

       3.7 Late Payments. If any installment of principal or interest or any fee
or cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document to the Agent or any Bank
is not paid  when  due,  it shall  thereafter  bear  interest  at a  fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the sum of the Reference Rate plus
3%, to the fullest  extent  permitted  by  applicable  Laws.  Accrued and unpaid
interest on past due amounts (including,  without  limitation,  interest on past
due  interest)  shall be  compounded  monthly,  on the last day of each calendar
month, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

       3.8  Computation  of  Interest  and  Fees.  Computation  of  interest  on
Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  Reference  Rate Loans and all fees under this Agreement
shall be  calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.  Borrower  acknowledges that such latter  calculation  method will
result in a higher  yield to the Banks  than a method  based on a year of 365 or
366 days.  Interest  shall  accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is
made.  Interest shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof,  for the day
on which the Loan or such  portion is paid,  except that any Loan that is repaid
on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.

       3.9 Non-Banking  Days. If any payment to be made by Borrower or any other
Party under any Loan Document  shall come due on a day other than a Banking Day,
payment shall instead be considered due on the next  succeeding  Banking Day and
the extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.

       3.10 Manner and Treatment of Payments.

              (a) Each payment  hereunder  (except payments pursuant to Sections
       3.5, 3.6, 11.3,  11.10 and 11.20) or on the Notes or under any other Loan
       Document  shall be made to the  Agent,  at the  Agent's  Office,  for the
       account  of each of the  Banks  or the  Agent,  as the  case  may be,  in
       immediately   available  funds  (for  which  evidence  may  be  given  by
       notification of a Fed Funds reference  number) not later than 11:00 a.m.,
       San Francisco  time, on the day of payment (which must be a Banking Day).
       All  payments  received  after 11:00 a.m.,  San  Francisco  time,  on any
       Banking Day, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Banking Day.
       The amount of all payments  received by the Agent for the account of each
       Bank shall be  immediately  paid by the Agent to the  applicable  Bank in
       immediately  available  funds and, if such  payment  was  received by the
       Agent by 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on a Banking Day and not so made
       available  to the account of a Bank on that  Banking Day, the Agent shall
       reimburse  that Bank for the cost to such Bank of  funding  the amount of
       such payment at the Federal  Funds Rate.  All  payments  shall be made in
       lawful money of the United States of America.

              (b) Each  payment  or  prepayment  on account of any Loan shall be
       applied pro rata according to the outstanding  Advances made by each Bank
       comprising such Loan.

              (c) Each  payment of any amount  payable by  Borrower or any other
       Party under this  Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free
       and clear of, and without reduction by reason of, any taxes,  assessments
       or other  charges  imposed by any  Governmental  Agency,  central bank or
       comparable authority, excluding, in the case of each Bank, the Agent, the
       Co-Agent and each  Eligible  Assignee,  and any  Affiliate or  Eurodollar
       Lending Office  thereof,  (i) taxes imposed on or measured in whole or in
       part by its overall net income, gross income or gross receipts or capital
       and franchise taxes imposed on it, by (A) any  jurisdiction (or political
       subdivision  thereof) in which it is organized or maintains its principal
       office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or political
       subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing business" (unless it would not
       be doing business in such jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof)
       absent the transactions  contemplated hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes
       or other  taxes  based on gross  income  imposed by the United  States of
       America  (other than  withholding  taxes and taxes based on gross  income
       resulting  from  or  attributable  to any  change  in any  law,  rule  or
       regulation or any change in the  interpretation  or administration of any
       law, rule or regulation by any Governmental Agency after the date of this
       Agreement) or (iii) any  withholding  taxes or other taxes based on gross
       income  imposed by the  United  States of  America  for any  period  with
       respect to which it has failed to provide  Borrower with the  appropriate
       form or forms  required  by Section  11.19,  to the extent such forms are
       then  required  by  applicable  Laws,  (all  such   non-excluded   taxes,
       assessments or other charges being  hereinafter  referred to as "Taxes").
       To the extent that Borrower is obligated by  applicable  Laws to make any
       deduction or  withholding  on account of Taxes from any amount payable to
       any Bank under this Agreement,  Borrower shall (i) make such deduction or
       withholding and pay the same to the relevant Governmental Agency and (ii)
       pay such additional amount to that Bank as is necessary to result in that
       Bank's receiving a net after-Tax amount equal to the amount to which that
       Bank would have been entitled under this Agreement  absent such deduction
       or withholding.  If and when receipt of such payment results in an excess
       payment or credit to that Bank on account of such Taxes,  that Bank shall
       promptly  refund such  excess to  Borrower.

       3.11  Funding  Sources.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall be  deemed to
obligate any Bank to obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any  particular
place or  manner  or to  constitute  a  representation  by any Bank  that it has
obtained  or will  obtain the funds for any Loan or  Advance  in any  particular
place or manner.

       3.12 Failure to Charge Not Subsequent  Waiver.  Any decision by the Agent
or any Bank not to require payment of any interest  (including  interest arising
under Section 3.7),  fee, cost or other amount  payable under any Loan Document,
or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method, on any occasion shall
in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of the  Agent's  or such  Bank's  right to
require full payment of any interest  (including  interest arising under Section
3.7), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document, or to calculate
an  amount  payable  by  another  method  that  is not  inconsistent  with  this
Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion.

       3.13 Agent's Right to Assume  Payments  Will be Made by Borrower.  Unless
the Agent shall have been  notified  by Borrower  prior to the date on which any
payment to be made by Borrower hereunder is due that Borrower does not intend to
remit such payment,  the Agent may, in its discretion,  assume that Borrower has
remitted  such payment when so due and the Agent may, in its  discretion  and in
reliance upon such assumption,  make available to each Bank on such payment date
an amount equal to such Bank's share of such  assumed  payment.  If Borrower has
not in fact  remitted  such payment to the Agent,  each Bank shall  forthwith on
demand repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed  payment made  available to
such  Bank,  together  with  interest  thereon  in  respect of each day from and
including  the date such amount was made  available by the Agent to such Bank to
the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

       3.14 Fee  Determination  Detail.  The Agent,  and any Bank, shall provide
reasonable  detail to Borrower  regarding  the manner in which the amount of any
payment  to the Agent and the  Banks,  or that  Bank,  under  Article 3 has been
determined, concurrently with demand for such payment.

       3.15 Survivability.  All of Borrower's obligations under Sections 3.5 and
3.6  shall  survive  for  ninety  (90)  days  following  the date on  which  the
Commitments  are  terminated and all Loans  hereunder are fully paid.  Following
such termination and repayment,  and the expiration of any bankruptcy preference
or similar period, each Bank shall cancel and return its Notes to Borrower.

       3.16 Accruals Under Original Loan Documents.

              (a) The accrual of interest and fees payable by Borrower under the
       Original Loan Documents  shall be calculated as provided  therein through
       the  effective  date  of  this  Agreement.  Such  fees  include,  without
       limitation,  those specified in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of the Original
       Loan Agreement.  All such accrued interest and fees through the effective
       date  of this  Agreement  shall,  notwithstanding  any  provision  of the
       Original  Loan  Documents  or hereunder  to the  contrary,  be due on the
       effective  date of this Agreement and shall be payable  immediately  upon
       submission of an invoice therefor to Borrower by the Agent.  Upon receipt
       by the Agent, all such amounts shall be promptly distributed by the Agent
       in accordance with the terms of the Original Loan Documents.

              (b) To the extent that  Borrower  has prepaid a Facility Fee under
       Section 3.3 of the Original Loan Agreement applicable to a period of time
       following the Closing Date (and in place of the remedies specified in the
       last  sentence of such  Section),  Borrower  shall be  credited  for such
       prepayment against the first Facility Fee payment owing after the Closing
       Date  pursuant to Section  3.4(a) of this  Agreement.  The shares of such
       first  Facility  Fee  payment  paid by the  Agent to the  Banks  shall be
       adjusted  to  reflect  the  shares  of the  prepayment  credit  that  are
       applicable to certain of the Banks.

                                   Article 4
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         ------------------------------

       Borrower  represents and warrants to the Banks, as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date, that:

       4.1 Existence and Qualification; Power; Compliance With Laws. Borrower is
a corporation duly formed,  validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of Delaware.  Borrower is duly qualified or registered to transact  business and
is in good  standing  in each  other  jurisdiction  in which the  conduct of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its Properties makes such  qualification
or  registration  necessary,  except where the failure so to qualify or register
and to be in good  standing  would not  constitute  a Material  Adverse  Effect.
Borrower  has all  requisite  corporate  power  and  authority  to  conduct  its
business,  to own and lease its  Properties and to execute and deliver each Loan
Document to which it is a Party and to perform its Obligations.  All outstanding
shares of capital stock of Borrower are duly authorized,  validly issued,  fully
paid,  non-assessable  and no  holder  thereof  has  any  enforceable  right  of
rescission under any applicable state or federal securities Laws. Borrower is in
compliance  with  all  Laws  and  other  legal  requirements  applicable  to its
business, has obtained all authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses
and  permits  from,  and  has  accomplished  all  filings,   registrations   and
qualifications  with, or obtained exemptions from any of the foregoing from, any
Governmental  Agency that are  necessary  for the  transaction  of its business,
except  where the  failure  so to  comply,  file,  register,  qualify  or obtain
exemptions does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.2  Authority;  Compliance  With Other  Agreements and  Instruments  and
Government Regulations. The execution,  delivery and performance by Borrower and
each Guarantor Subsidiary of the Loan Documents to which it is a Party have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate and/or partnership action, and do not
and will not:

              (a) Require any consent or approval not heretofore obtained of any
       partner,  director,  stockholder,  security  holder or  creditor  of such
       Party;

              (b)  Violate  or  conflict  with  any  provision  of such  Party's
       charter, articles of incorporation or bylaws, as applicable;

              (c) Result in or require the  creation or  imposition  of any Lien
       upon or with  respect to any  Property  now owned or leased or  hereafter
       acquired by such Party;

              (d)  Violate  any  Requirement  of Law  applicable  to such Party,
       subject to  obtaining  the  authorizations  from,  or filings  with,  the
       Governmental Agencies described in Schedule 4.3;

              (e) Result in a breach of or constitute a default under,  or cause
       or permit the acceleration of any obligation owed under, any indenture or
       loan or credit  agreement or any other  Contractual  Obligation  to which
       such Party is a party or by which such  Party or any of its  Property  is
       bound or affected;

and none of Borrower or any Guarantor  Subsidiary is in violation of, or default
under, any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation,  or any indenture, loan
or credit agreement described in Section 4.2(e), in any respect that constitutes
a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.3 No Governmental  Approvals Required.  Except as set forth in Schedule
4.3 or previously obtained or made, no authorization,  consent, approval, order,
license or permit from,  or filing,  registration  or  qualification  with,  any
Governmental  Agency  is or  will be  required  to  authorize  or  permit  under
applicable  Laws the  execution,  delivery and  performance  by Borrower and the
Guarantor  Subsidiaries  of the Loan  Documents  to  which  it is a  Party.  All
authorizations  from,  or filings with,  any  Governmental  Agency  described in
Schedule 4.3 will be  accomplished  as of the Closing Date or such other date as
is specified in Schedule 4.3.

       4.4 Subsidiaries.

              (a) Schedule 4.4 hereto  correctly  sets forth the names,  form of
       legal entity,  number of shares of capital stock issued and  outstanding,
       number of shares  owned by  Borrower  or a  Subsidiary  (specifying  such
       owner)  and   jurisdictions  of  organization  of  all  Subsidiaries  and
       specifies   which  thereof,   as  of  the  Closing  Date,  are  Guarantor
       Subsidiaries.  Except as described in Schedule 4.4, Borrower does not own
       any capital stock, equity interest or debt security which is convertible,
       or  exchangeable,  for capital  stock or equity  interests in any Person.
       Unless otherwise indicated in Schedule 4.4, all of the outstanding shares
       of capital stock, or all of the units of equity interest, as the case may
       be, of each Subsidiary are owned of record and  beneficially by Borrower,
       there are no  outstanding  options,  warrants or other rights to purchase
       capital  stock of any such  Subsidiary,  and all such  shares  or  equity
       interests  so owned are duly  authorized,  validly  issued,  fully  paid,
       non-assessable,  and were issued in compliance with all applicable  state
       and  federal  securities  and other  Laws,  and are free and clear of all
       Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

              (b) Each Subsidiary is a corporation or limited  partnership  duly
       formed,  validly  existing  and in good  standing  under  the Laws of its
       jurisdiction  of  organization,  is duly  qualified  to do  business as a
       foreign organization and is in good standing as such in each jurisdiction
       in which the conduct of its  business or the  ownership or leasing of its
       properties makes such  qualification  necessary (except where the failure
       to be so duly  qualified  and in good  standing  does  not  constitute  a
       Material  Adverse  Effect),  and has all requisite power and authority to
       conduct its business and to own and lease its Properties.

              (c) Each  Subsidiary  is in  compliance  with  all Laws and  other
       requirements   applicable   to  its   business   and  has   obtained  all
       authorizations,  consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits from,
       and each such Subsidiary has accomplished all filings, registrations, and
       qualifications  with,  or obtained  exemptions  from any of the foregoing
       from, any  Governmental  Agency that are necessary for the transaction of
       its business,  except where the failure to be in such compliance,  obtain
       such authorizations,  consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits,
       accomplish such filings,  registrations,  and  qualifications,  or obtain
       such exemptions, does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.5  Financial  Statements.  Borrower has  furnished to the Banks (a) the
audited  consolidated  financial statements of Borrower and its Subsidiaries for
the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 1994 and (b) the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  for the Fiscal Quarter ended March
31,  1995.  The  financial  statements  described  in clauses (a) and (b) fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition,  results of operations
and changes in financial  position of Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  as of such
dates and for such periods,  in conformity  with Generally  Accepted  Accounting
Principles, consistently applied.

       4.6 No Other Liabilities;  No Material Adverse Changes.  Borrower and its
Subsidiaries do not have any material liability or material contingent liability
not  reflected  or disclosed in the  financial  statements  described in Section
4.5(b),  other  than  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  arising  in the
ordinary course of business since the date of such financial statements. Neither
Borrower  nor  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  has,  as of  the  Closing  Date,  any
Indebtedness  other than under the Loan  Documents  or as  described on Schedule

subsequent to the Closing Date, since the Closing Date.

       4.7 Title to Property.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries have valid title to
the Property reflected in the financial  statements described in Section 4.5(b),

disposed of in the  ordinary  course of  business,  free and clear of all Liens,
other than Liens  described in Schedule  6.8 or  otherwise  permitted by Section

all  material  trademarks,  trade names,  copyrights,  patents,  patent  rights,
computer  software,  licenses and other  Intangible  Assets that are used in the
conduct of their  businesses as now operated,  and no such Intangible  Asset, to
the best knowledge of Borrower,  conflicts with the valid trademark, trade name,
copyright,  patent,  patent right or Intangible Asset of any other Person to the
extent that such conflict constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

       4.9  Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act.  Neither  Borrower  nor  any
Subsidiary  is a "holding  company",  or a  "subsidiary  company"  of a "holding
company",  or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"

matter  and  amount  (subject  to  applicable  deductibles  and  retentions)  by
insurance  for which the  insurance  carrier  has not  asserted  lack of subject
matter  coverage  or reserved  its right to do so, (b) any matter,  or series of
related  matters,  involving a claim against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries

forth  in  Schedule  4.10,   there  are  no  actions,   suits,   proceedings  or
investigations pending as to which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have been
served or have received notice or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, threatened
against or affecting  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any Property of any
of them before any Governmental Agency.

       4.11 Binding Obligations. Each of the Loan Documents to which Borrower or

by such Party, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party,
enforceable  against  such  Party  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as
enforcement  may be  limited  by  Debtor  Relief  Laws or  equitable  principles
relating to the granting of specific performance and other equitable remedies as
a matter of judicial discretion.

       4.12 No  Default.  No event  has  occurred  and is  continuing  that is a
Default or Event of Default.

              ERISA  and  any  other   applicable   Laws  to  the  extent   that
              noncompliance  could  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material
              Adverse Effect;

                   (ii) such  Pension  Plan has not  incurred  any  "accumulated
              funding  deficiency"  (as  defined in Section  302 of ERISA)  that
              could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                   (iii) no  "reportable  event" (as defined in Section  4043 of
              ERISA) has occurred  that could  reasonably  be expected to have a
              Material Adverse Effect; and

                   (iv) neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
              in any non-exempt "prohibited  transaction" (as defined in Section
              4975 of the Code)  that could  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
              Material Adverse Effect.

              (b) Neither  Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries has incurred or
       expects to incur any withdrawal  liability to any Multiemployer Plan that
       could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries is or is required to be registered as an "investment company" under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.

       4.15  Disclosure.  No written  statement  made by a Senior Officer to the
Agent or any Bank in connection with this  Agreement,  or in connection with any
Loan, as of the date thereof  contained any untrue  statement of a material fact
or omitted a material fact  necessary to make the statement  made not misleading
in light of all the circumstances existing at the date the statement was made.

       4.16 Tax  Liability.  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  have filed all tax
returns which are required to be filed, and have paid, or made provision for the
payment of, all taxes with  respect to the  periods,  Property  or  transactions
covered by said returns,  or pursuant to any assessment  received by Borrower or
any of its  Subsidiaries,  except (a) such taxes, if any, as are being contested
in good faith by appropriate  proceedings and as to which adequate reserves have
been  established and maintained and (b) immaterial taxes so long as no material
item or  portion  of  Property  of  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  is in
jeopardy of being seized, levied upon or forfeited.

       4.17 Strategic  Plan. The Strategic Plan was prepared in accordance  with
Borrower's  customary  procedures  therefor and, in the case of the first year's
budget,  was  approved  by  Borrower's  board of  directors  and, in the case of
subsequent  years,  represents the final version thereof for such years that was
reviewed by Borrower's board of directors.

       4.18 Hazardous Materials. To the best knowledge of Borrower, no condition
exists that  violates any  Hazardous  Material Law  affecting  any Real Property
except for such violations that would not  individually or in the aggregate have
a Meterial Adverse Effect.  No Real Property now owned by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any portion thereof, is or has been utilized by Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries as a site for the manufacture of any Hazardous Materials. To
the  extent  that any  Hazardous  Materials  are  used,  generated  or stored by
Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries on any Real Property,  or transported  from
such Real Property by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, such use, generation,
storage and  transportation  are in compliance in all material respects with all
Hazardous Materials Laws.

       fair equivalent value to the Property sold;  provided,  however,  that no
       Property  shall be sold by way of  Disposition  (nor  shall  there be any
       related sales of Property) if the value of the Property sold is in excess
       of $5,000,000.

              (c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of this Section 6.3

ended Fiscal Quarter without causing a violation of Section 6.11 as of such last
day of such Fiscal Quarter and (b) in the case of a Distribution by Borrower (i)

Borrower has not  theretofore  received  written notice from the Agent or a Bank
that a Default has occurred and such Default remains  uncured,  provided however
that a Distribution may be made if such  Distribution  constitutes a dividend on
capital stock of Borrower that was otherwise  permissible to be made at the time
it was declared  payable by  Borrower's  board of directors  and that is in fact
paid within 60 days after such declaration.

              Material Adverse Effect.

              (b) Withdraw, completely or partially, from any Multiemployer Plan
       if to do so could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse

       failure; or

              (c) Borrower  fails to comply with any of the covenants  contained
       in Sections 5.2, 5.9, 6.1,  6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7,  6.11,  6.12,  6.13,

       or 6.16 only,  ten (10) days have  elapsed  without  cure after  either a

       Agent shall have given Borrower notice of such failing; or

              (d) Borrower, any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries or any other Party
       fails to  perform  or  observe  any  other  covenant  or  agreement  (not
       specified  in  clauses  (a),  (b) or (c)  above)  contained  in any  Loan
       Document on its part to be  performed  or  observed  within ten (10) days
       after the giving of notice by the Agent on behalf of the  Majority  Banks
       of such Default; or

              (e) Any  representation  or  warranty  of  Borrower  or any of its
       Subsidiaries  made in any Loan Document,  or in any  certificate or other

              (f) Borrower or any of its Guarantor Subsidiaries (i) fails to pay

       Non-Recourse  Debt  specified  in Section  6.8(d)),  or any  guaranty  of
       present or future  Indebtedness for borrowed money of $1,500,000 or more,
       on its part to be paid,  when due (or within any  stated  grace  period),

       Non-Recourse  Debt  specified in Section  6.8(d)),  or of any guaranty of
       present or future  indebtedness for borrowed money of $1,500,000 or more,

       thereof (or an agent or trustee on its or their  behalf) has the right to
       declare such indebtedness due before the date on which it otherwise would
       become due; or

              (g) Any event  occurs  which  gives the  holder or  holders of any
       Subordinated  Obligation  (or an agent or trustee on its or their behalf)
       the right to declare  such  indebtedness  due before the date on which it
       otherwise would become due, or the right to require the issuer thereof to

       any Subordinated Obligation; or

              (h) Any  Loan  Document,  at any  time  after  its  execution  and
       delivery  and for any  reason  other than the  agreement  of the Banks or
       satisfaction  in full of all the  Obligations  ceases to be in full force
       and effect or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be null
       and void,  invalid or  unenforceable  in any respect  which,  in any such
       event in the  reasonable  opinion of the Majority  Banks,  is  materially
       adverse to the interests of the Banks;  or any Party thereto  denies that
       it has any or further liability or obligation under any Loan Document, or
       purports to revoke, terminate or rescind same; or

              (i) A final  judgment  against  Borrower  or any of its  Guarantor
       Subsidiaries  is entered for the payment of money in excess of $1,000,000
       and,  absent  procurement of a stay of execution,  such judgment  remains
       unsatisfied  for  thirty  (30)  calendar  days after the date of entry of
       judgment,  or in any event  later than five (5) days prior to the date of
       any proposed  sale  thereunder;  or any writ or warrant of  attachment or
       execution  or  similar  process  is issued or levied  against  all or any
       material  part of the  Property of any such  Person and is not  released,
       vacated or fully bonded  within thirty (30) calendar days after its issue
       or levy; or

              (j) Borrower or any of its  Guarantor  Subsidiaries  (other than a
       Guarantor  Subsidiary that holds as its principal assets the Spring Creek
       Project  or the  Glen  Harbor  Project)  institutes  or  consents  to the
       institution of any proceeding under a Debtor Relief Law relating to it or
       to all or any part of its Property, or is unable or admits in writing its
       inability to pay its debts as they mature, or makes an assignment for the
       benefit of creditors;  or applies for or consents to the  appointment  of
       any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator,  liquidator, rehabilitator
       or similar officer for it or for all or any part of its Property;  or any
       receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator,  liquidator,  rehabilitator or
       similar  officer is appointed  without the application or consent of that
       Person and the appointment  continues  undischarged or unstayed for sixty
       (60) calendar days; or any proceeding  under a Debtor Relief Law relating
       to any such Person or to all or any part of its  Property  is  instituted
       without the consent of that Person and continues  undismissed or unstayed
       for sixty (60) calendar days; or

              (k) The  occurrence of an Event of Default (as such term is or may
       hereafter be  specifically  defined in any other Loan Document) under any
       other Loan Document; or

              (l) Any determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction
       that the Public 9-3/4% Senior  Subordinated Debt, the Public 9.00% Senior
       Subordinated  Debt,  the  Swiss  Franc  Debt  or any  other  Subordinated
       Obligation  is not  subordinated  in  accordance  with  its  terms to the
       principal or interest under the Notes; or

              (m)  Any  Pension  Plan  maintained  by  Borrower  or  any  of its
       Subsidiaries  is  determined  to  have a  material  "accumulated  funding
       deficiency"  as that  term is  defined  in  Section  302 of ERISA and the
       result is a Material Adverse Effect.

       9.2 Remedies Upon Event of Default.  Without limiting any other rights or
remedies of the Agent or the Banks provided for elsewhere in this Agreement,  or
the Loan Documents,  or by applicable Law, or in equity, or otherwise:

              (a) Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance,  of any Event
       of Default other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(j):

                   (1) the commitment to make Advances and all other obligations
              of the Agent or the Banks and all rights of Borrower and any other
              Parties under the Loan Documents shall be suspended without notice
              to  or  demand  upon  Borrower,  which  are  expressly  waived  by
              Borrower,  except that all of the Banks or the Majority  Banks (as
              the case may be, in  accordance  with  Section  11.2) may waive an
              Event of Default or, without  waiving,  determine,  upon terms and
              conditions  satisfactory  to the Banks or Majority  Banks,  as the
              case  may be,  to  reinstate  the  Commitments  and  make  further
              Advances,  which waiver or  determination  shall apply equally to,
              and shall be binding upon, all the Banks;

                   (2) the Issuing  Bank may,  with the approval of the Majority
              Banks,  demand immediate payment by Borrower of an amount equal to
              the aggregate drawable face amount of all then outstanding Letters
              of Credit to be held by the  Issuing  Bank in an  interest-bearing
              cash  collateral  account as  collateral  hereunder,  and Borrower
              hereby  grants to the Agent,  on behalf of the  Banks,  a security
              interest  in such  funds  and  any  such  account  to  secure  the
              Obligations; and

                   (3) the  Majority  Banks may  request  the Agent to,  and the
              Agent thereupon  shall,  terminate the Commitments  and/or declare
              all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest
              accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the
              Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same
              shall become and be forthwith  due and payable,  without  protest,
              presentment,  notice of dishonor,  demand or further notice of any
              kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower.

              (b) Upon the  occurrence  of any  Event of  Default  described  in
       Section 9.1(j):

                   (1) the commitment to make Advances and all other obligations
              of the Agent or the Banks and all rights of Borrower and any other
              Parties under the Loan Documents shall terminate without notice to
              or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower;

                   (2) an amount equal to the aggregate  drawable face amount of
              all then  outstanding  Letters of Credit shall be immediately  due
              and payable to the Issuing Bank  without  notice to or demand upon
              Borrower,  which are expressly  waived by Borrower,  to be held by
              the Issuing Bank in an interest-bearing cash collateral account as
              collateral hereunder,  and Borrower hereby grants to the Agent, on
              behalf of the  Banks,  a security  interest  in such funds and any
              such account to secure the Obligations; and

                   (3) the unpaid  principal of all Notes,  all interest accrued
              and unpaid  thereon and all other  amounts  payable under the Loan
              Documents  shall be forthwith  due and payable,  without  protest,
              presentment,  notice of dishonor,  demand or further notice of any
              kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower.

              (c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Agent or (but
       only upon  directive  of the  Majority  Banks) any of the Banks,  without
       notice to (except as  expressly  provided  for in any Loan  Document)  or
       demand upon Borrower,  which are expressly  waived by Borrower (except as
       to notices expressly  provided for in any Loan Document),  may proceed to
       protect,  exercise  and enforce the rights and  remedies of the Agent and
       the Banks under the Loan Documents  against  Borrower and any other Party
       and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Law or equity.

              (d) The order and manner in which the Banks'  rights and  remedies
       are to be exercised  shall be determined  by the Majority  Banks in their
       sole discretion, and all payments received by the Agent and the Banks, or
       any of them, shall be applied first to the costs and expenses  (including
       attorneys'  fees and  disbursements  and the allocated costs of attorneys
       employed by the Agent) of the Agent and of the Banks, and thereafter paid
       pro  rata  to the  Banks  in the  same  proportions  that  the  aggregate
       Obligations  owed to each  Bank  under  the  Loan  Documents  bear to the
       aggregate  Obligations  owed under the Loan  Documents  to all the Banks,
       without  priority or preference  among the Banks.  Regardless of how each
       Bank may treat  payments for the purpose of its own  accounting,  for the
       purpose  of  computing  Borrower's  Obligations  hereunder  and under the
       Notes,  payments shall be applied first, to the costs and expenses of the
       Agent and the  Banks,  as set forth  above,  second,  to the  payment  of
       accrued and unpaid interest due under any Loan Documents to and including
       the date of such application (ratably, and without duplication, according
       to the accrued and unpaid interest due under each of the Loan Documents),
       and third, to the payment of all other amounts  (including  principal and
       fees) then owing to the Agent or the Banks under the Loan  Documents.  No
       application  of  payments  will cure any  Event of  Default,  or  prevent
       acceleration,  or continued  acceleration,  of amounts  payable under the
       Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights
       or remedies of the Banks hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity.

                                   Article 10
                                   THE AGENT
                                   ---------



       10.1  Appointment and  Authorization.  Subject to Section 10.8, each Bank
hereby  irrevocably  appoints  and  authorizes  the Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan  Documents as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms  thereof or are  reasonably  incidental,  as
determined by the Agent, thereto. This appointment and authorization is intended
solely for the purpose of  facilitating  the servicing of the Loans and does not
constitute appointment of the Agent as trustee for any Bank or as representative
of any Bank for any other purpose and, except as  specifically  set forth in the
Loan  Documents to the  contrary,  the Agent shall take such action and exercise
such powers only in an administrative and ministerial capacity.

       10.2 Agent and Affiliates. Bank of America (and each successor Agent) has
the same rights and powers  under the Loan  Documents  as any other Bank and may
exercise the same as though it was not the Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks"
includes Bank of America in its individual  capacity.  Bank of America (and each
successor  Agent) and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking,  trust or other business with Borrower,
any Subsidiary  thereof, or any Affiliate of Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof,
as if it was not the Agent  and  without  any duty to  account  therefor  to the
Banks.  Bank of America (and each successor Agent) need not account to any other
Bank for any monies received by it for  reimbursement  of its costs and expenses
as Agent hereunder,  or (except as expressly  provided elsewhere herein) for any
monies received by it in its capacity as a Bank  hereunder.  The Agent shall not
be  deemed  to hold a  fiduciary  relationship  with  any  Bank  and no  implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

       10.3  Proportionate  Interest in any Collateral.  The Agent, on behalf of
all the Banks, shall hold in accordance with the Loan Documents all items of any
collateral or interests  therein  received or held by the Agent.  Subject to the
Agent's and the Banks'  rights to  reimbursement  for their  costs and  expenses
hereunder  (including  attorneys' fees and disbursements and other  professional
services and the allocated  costs of attorneys  employed by the Agent or a Bank)
and subject to the  application of payments in accordance  with Section  9.2(d),
each Bank shall have an interest in the Banks'  interest  in any  collateral  or
interests  therein in the same proportions  that the aggregate  Obligations owed
such Bank under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate  Obligations owed under
the Loan Documents to all the Banks,  without  priority or preference  among the
Banks.

       10.4 Banks' Credit Decisions. Each Bank agrees that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Bank or the directors,  officers,
agents, employees or attorneys of the Agent or of any other Bank, and instead in
reliance  upon  information  supplied to it by or on behalf of Borrower and upon
such other  information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own independent
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also agrees
that it shall, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Bank
or the directors,  officers,  agents,  employees or attorneys of the Agent or of
any  other  Bank,  continue  to make its own  independent  credit  analyses  and
decisions in acting or not acting under the Loan Documents. 

       10.5 Action by Agent.

              (a) The Agent may  assume  that no  Default  has  occurred  and is
       continuing,  unless the Agent has received  notice from Borrower  stating
       the nature of the Default or has received  notice from a Bank stating the
       nature of the  Default and that such Bank  considers  the Default to have
       occurred and to be continuing.

              (b) The Agent has only those  obligations under the Loan Documents
       as are expressly set forth therein.

              (c) Both before and after any Default, the Agent shall be required
       to act or not act upon the  instructions of the Majority Banks (or all of
       the Banks, to the extent required by Section 11.2) and those instructions
       shall be  binding  upon the Agent and all the  Banks,  provided  that the
       Agent  shall  not be  required  to act or not  act if to do so  would  be
       contrary to any Loan  Document or to applicable  Law or would result,  in
       the  reasonable  judgment  of the Agent,  in a risk of  liability  to the
       Agent.  The Agent may,  without the consent of the Majority  Banks,  take
       such actions and exercise  such  discretion  as is specified  herein.  In
       addition,  should the Agent  propose a course of conduct  with respect to
       the  administration  of the Loan  Documents  in  writing to the Banks and
       should the Majority Banks (or any of the Banks, if unanimous  approval of
       such action is required  under Section  11.2) fail,  for five (5) Banking
       Days after the receipt of notice from the Agent of the proposed course of
       action,  to instruct the Agent to the  contrary,  then the Agent,  in its
       sole discretion, may act or not act as the Agent deems advisable pursuant
       to such course of conduct.

              (d) The Agent shall have no liability  to any Bank for acting,  or
       not acting,  as  instructed by the Majority  Banks (or all the Banks,  if
       required  under  Section 11.2) or as permitted  under clause (c),  above,
       notwithstanding any other provision hereof.

       10.6  Liability  of Agent.  Either  the  Agent nor any of its  directors,
officers, agents, employees or attorneys shall be liable for any action taken or
not taken by them under or in  connection  with the Loan  Documents,  except for
their own gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct.  Without  limitation on the
foregoing,  the  Agent  and  its  directors,  officers,  agents,  employees  and
attorneys:

              (a) May treat the payee of any Note as the  holder  thereof  until
       the Agent receives notice of the assignment or transfer thereof,  in form
       satisfactory to the Agent,  signed by the payee,  and may treat each Bank
       as the owner of that Bank's  interest in the Obligations for all purposes
       of this Agreement  until the Agent  receives  notice of the assignment or
       transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the Agent, signed by that Bank.

              (b) May  consult  with legal  counsel  (including  in-house  legal
       counsel),   accountants   (including  in-house   accountants)  and  other
       professionals   or  experts  selected  by  it,  or  with  legal  counsel,
       accountants  or other  professionals  or experts for Borrower  and/or its
       Subsidiaries  or the Banks,  and shall not be liable for any action taken
       or not taken by it in good  faith in  accordance  with any advice of such
       legal counsel, accountants or other professionals or experts.

              (c)  Shall  not be  responsible  to any  Bank  for any  statement,
       warranty or  representation  made in any of the Loan  Documents or in any
       notice, certificate, report, request or other statement (written or oral)
       given or made in connection with any of the Loan Documents.

              (d)  Except  to  the  extent  expressly  set  forth  in  the  Loan
       Documents,  shall have no duty to ask or inquire as to the performance or
       observance  by  Borrower  or  its  Subsidiaries  of  any  of  the  terms,
       conditions  or covenants  of any of the Loan  Documents or to inspect any
       collateral  or  the  Property,  books  or  records  of  Borrower  or  its
       Subsidiaries.

              (e) Will  not be  responsible  to any Bank for the due  execution,
       legality,   validity,   enforceability,    genuineness,    effectiveness,
       sufficiency  or value of any  Loan  Document,  any  other  instrument  or
       writing  furnished  pursuant thereto or in connection  therewith,  or any
       collateral.

              (f) Will not  incur  any  liability  by  acting  or not  acting in
       reliance upon any Loan Document, notice, consent, certificate, statement,
       request or other  instrument or writing  believed by it to be genuine and
       signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

              (g) Will not incur any  liability  for any  arithmetical  error in
       computing  any amount paid or payable by Borrower  or any  Subsidiary  or
       Affiliate  thereof or paid or payable to or received or  receivable  from
       any  Bank  under  any  Loan  Document,   including,  without  limitation,
       principal,   interest,  commitment  fees,  Advances  and  other  amounts;
       provided that,  promptly upon discovery of such an error in  computation,
       the Agent, the Banks and (to the extent  applicable)  Borrower and/or its
       Subsidiaries or Affiliates  shall make such  adjustments as are necessary
       to correct  such error and to restore  the parties to the  position  that
       they would have occupied had the error not occurred.

       10.7 Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share of the  Commitments,  indemnify and hold the Agent and its directors,
officers,   agents,  employees  and  attorneys  harmless  against  any  and  all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature  whatsoever  (including,
without  limitation,  attorneys' fees and  disbursements  and allocated costs of
attorneys employed by the Agent) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against it or them in any way  relating to or arising out of the Loan  Documents
(other  than  losses  incurred  by reason of the  failure of Borrower to pay the
indebtedness represented by the Notes) or any action taken or not taken by it as
Agent thereunder, except such as result from its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Without limitation on the foregoing,  each Bank shall reimburse the
Agent upon  demand for that Bank's Pro Rata Share of any  out-of-pocket  cost or
expense incurred by the Agent in connection with the  negotiation,  preparation,
execution, delivery, amendment, waiver, restructuring, reorganization (including
a bankruptcy  reorganization),  enforcement or attempted enforcement of the Loan
Documents, to the extent that Borrower or any other Party is required by Section
11.3 to pay that cost or expense but fails to do so upon  demand.  If payment is
made by  Borrower or another  Party to the Agent for such cost or expense  after
reimbursement  to the Agent by a Bank,  the Agent shall  reimburse such Bank, as
applicable.  Nothing in this Section 10.7 shall entitle the Agent to recover any
amount from the Banks if and to the extent that such amount has theretofore been
recovered from Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

       10.8 Successor  Agent.  The Agent may, and at the request of the Majority
Banks  shall,  resign as Agent  upon  thirty  (30) days  notice to the Banks and
Borrower. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Agreement,  the Majority
Banks  shall  appoint  from among the Banks a successor  managing  agent for the
Banks,  which  successor  managing agent shall be approved by Borrower (and such
approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld). If no successor managing agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent
may appoint,  after consulting with the Banks and Borrower, a successor managing
agent from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
managing agent hereunder, such successor managing agent shall succeed to all the
rights,  powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean
such successor managing agent and the retiring Agent's  appointment,  powers and
duties as Agent shall be  terminated.  After any  retiring  Agent's  resignation
hereunder as Agent,  the provisions of this Article 10, and Sections 11.3, 11.10
and 11.20,  shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

       10.9 No  Obligations  of Borrower.  Nothing  contained in this Article 10
shall be deemed to impose upon Borrower any obligation in respect of the due and
punctual  performance  by the Agent of its  obligations  to the Banks  under any
provision of this  Agreement,  and Borrower shall have no liability to the Agent
or any of the  Banks  in  respect  of any  failure  by the  Agent or any Bank to
perform any of its  obligations to the Agent or the Banks under this  Agreement.
Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  where any provision of this
Agreement  relating  to the  payment of any amounts due and owing under the Loan
Documents provides that such payments shall be made by Borrower to the Agent for
the account of the Banks, Borrower's obligations to the Banks in respect of such
payments shall be deemed to be satisfied upon the making of such payments to the
Agent in the manner provided by this Agreement.

                                   Article 11
                                 MISCELLANEOUS
                                 -------------


       11.1 Cumulative Remedies; No Waiver. The rights,  powers,  privileges and
remedies of the Agent and the Banks provided herein or in any Note or other Loan
Document are  cumulative  and not  exclusive of any right,  power,  privilege or
remedy  provided by Law or equity.  No failure or delay on the part of the Agent
or any Bank in exercising any right,  power,  privilege or remedy may be, or may
be deemed to be, a waiver thereof; nor may any single or partial exercise of any
right, power,  privilege or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of the
same or any other right, power, privilege or remedy. The terms and conditions of
Article 8 hereof are  inserted  for the sole benefit of the Agent and the Banks;
the same may be waived in whole or in part, with or without terms or conditions,
in respect of any Loan without  prejudicing  the Agent's or the Banks' rights to
assert them in whole or in part in respect of any other Loan.

       11.2  Amendments;  Consents.  No  amendment,  modification,   supplement,
extension, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan  Document,  no  approval  or  consent  thereunder,  and no  consent  to any
departure  by  Borrower  or any  other  Party  therefrom,  may in any  event  be
effective  unless in writing  signed by the Majority  Banks (and, in the case of
any  amendment,  modification  or supplement of or to any Loan Document to which
Borrower is a Party, signed by Borrower), and then only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose given;  and, without the approval in writing of all
the  Banks,  no  amendment,  modification,  supplement,  termination,  waiver or
consent may be effective:

              (a) To  amend  or  modify  (i) the  amount  or  payment  terms  of
       principal  or  interest  payable  on the  Notes,  (ii) the  amount of the
       Commitments, (iii) the amount or payment terms of any commitment or other
       fee or amount payable to the Banks generally under the Loan Documents;

              (b)  To  extend  the  term  of the  Commitments  or to  release  a
       guarantor  under the Subsidiary  Guaranty  (except as provided in Section
       5.10);

              (c) To amend the provisions of the definition of "Majority Banks",
       Section 9.2(d), 10.3, 11.2, 11.9 or 11.10; or

              (d) To  amend  any  provision  of this  Agreement  that  expressly
       requires the consent or approval of all the Banks.

Any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent pursuant
to this Section 11.2 shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon,  all the
Banks and the Agent. The provisions of Article 10 and the provisions of the Loan
Documents dealing with the rights and  responsibilities  of the Agent may not be
amended without the consent of the Agent.

       11.3  Costs,  Expenses  and Taxes.  Borrower  shall pay  within  five (5)
Banking Days after demand,  accompanied by an invoice  therefor,  the reasonable
costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
syndication,  execution  and delivery of the Loan  Documents  and any  amendment
thereto or waiver thereof. Borrower shall also pay on demand,  accompanied by an
invoice  therefor,  the reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Banks
in connection with the refinancing,  restructuring,  reorganization (including a
bankruptcy  reorganization) and enforcement or attempted enforcement of the Loan
Documents,  and any matter  related  thereto.  The foregoing  costs and expenses
shall include filing fees, recording fees, title insurance fees, appraisal fees,
search  fees,  and other  out-of-pocket  expenses  and the  reasonable  fees and
out-of-pocket  expenses  of any  legal  counsel  (including  allocated  costs of
in-house legal counsel  employed by the Agent or any Bank),  independent  public
accountants and other outside experts retained by the Agent or any Bank, whether
or not such costs and expenses are incurred or suffered by the Agent or any Bank
in  connection  with or  during  the  course  of any  bankruptcy  or  insolvency
proceedings of Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof. Such costs and expenses shall
also  include,  in the case of any  amendment  or  waiver  of any Loan  Document
requested  by  Borrower,  the  administrative  costs  of  the  Agent  reasonably
attributable  thereto.  Borrower  shall  pay any and all  documentary  and other
taxes,  excluding,  in the case of each  Bank,  the  Agent,  and  each  Eligible
Assignee,  and any Affiliate or Eurodollar  Lending  Office  thereof,  (i) taxes
imposed on or measured  in whole or in part by its  overall  net  income,  gross
income or gross  receipts or capital and  franchise  taxes imposed on its by (A)
any jurisdiction (or political  subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or
maintains  its  principal  office  or  Eurodollar  Lending  Office  or  (B)  any
jurisdiction (or political  subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing business"
(unless  it would  not be doing  business  in such  jurisdiction  (or  political
subdivision  thereof) absent the  transactions  contemplated  hereby),  (ii) any
withholding  taxes or other  taxes based on gross  income  imposed by the United
States of America (other than withholding  taxes and taxes based on gross income
resulting from or  attributable  to any change in any law, rule or regulation or
any  change  in the  interpretation  or  administration  of  any  law,  rule  or
regulation  by any  governmental  authority) or (iii) any  withholding  taxes or
other taxes based on gross  income  imposed by the United  States of America for
any period  with  respect to which it has  failed to provide  Borrower  with the
appropriate  form or forms required by Section  11.19,  to the extent such forms
are then required by applicable Laws, and all costs, expenses,  fees and charges
payable or determined  to be payable in connection  with the filing or recording
of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or writing to
be delivered  hereunder or  thereunder,  or in connection  with any  transaction
pursuant hereto or thereto, and shall reimburse, hold harmless and indemnify the
Agent and the Banks from and  against  any and all loss,  liability  or legal or
other  expense with respect to or resulting  from any delay in paying or failure
to pay any such tax, cost, expense, fee or charge or that any of them may suffer
or  incur  by  reason  of  the  failure  of  any  Party  to  perform  any of its
Obligations. Any amount payable to the Agent or any Bank under this Section 11.3
shall bear  interest from the tenth day following the date of demand for payment
at the Default Rate.

       11.4 Nature of Banks' Obligations. The obligations of the Banks hereunder
are  several  and not  joint or joint and  several.  Nothing  contained  in this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  and no action  taken by the Agent or the
Banks or any of them  pursuant  hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make
the Banks a partnership, an association, a joint venture or other entity, either
among  themselves  or with  Borrower or any  Affiliate of Borrower.  Each Bank's
obligation to make any Advance pursuant hereto is several and not joint or joint
and  several.  A default by any Bank will not increase the Pro Rata Share of the
Commitments  attributable  to any other Bank. Any Bank not in default may, if it
desires,  assume  in  such  proportion  as the  nondefaulting  Banks  agree  the
obligations  of any Bank in default,  but is not  obligated  to do so. The Agent
agrees  that it will use its best  efforts  either to induce the other  Banks to
assume  the  obligations  of a  Bank  in  default  or to  obtain  another  Bank,
reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, to replace such a Bank in default.

       11.5 Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and
warranties contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate
or other writing  delivered by or on behalf of any one or more of the Parties to
any Loan  Document,  will  survive  the  making of the Loans  hereunder  and the
execution and delivery of the Notes, and have been or will be relied upon by the
Agent and each Bank,  notwithstanding any investigation made by the Agent or any
Bank or on their behalf.

       11.6  Notices.  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  in  the  Loan
Documents, all notices, requests,  demands,  directions and other communications
provided for  hereunder or under any other Loan  Document must be in writing and
must be mailed, telegraphed, telecopied or delivered to the appropriate party at
the  address  set  forth  on the  signature  pages  of this  Agreement  or other
applicable Loan Document or, as to any party to any Loan Document,  at any other
address as may be designated by it in a written notice sent to all other parties
to such Loan Document in accordance with this Section 11.6.  Except as otherwise
expressly  provided  in any  Loan  Document,  if any  notice,  request,  demand,
direction or other  communication  required or permitted by any Loan Document is
given by mail it will be  effective  on the  earlier  of  receipt  or the  third
calendar day after deposit in the United States mail with first class or airmail
postage prepaid; if given by telegraph or cable, when delivered to the telegraph
company with charges prepaid; if given by telecopier,  when sent; or if given by
personal delivery (including delivery by courier),  when delivered.  If a notice
is being given of the  occurrence  of a Default or Event of Default,  the Person
giving the notice shall use reasonable efforts to either give or supplement such
notice with a notice by telecopy.

       11.7 Execution of Loan Documents.  Unless the Agent  otherwise  specifies
with  respect  to any Loan  Document,  (a) this  Agreement  and any  other  Loan
Document may be executed in any number of  counterparts  and any party hereto or
thereto may execute any  counterpart,  each of which when executed and delivered
will be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts of this Agreement
or any other Loan  Document,  as the case may be,  when taken  together  will be
deemed  to be but one and the  same  instrument  and (b)  execution  of any such
counterpart  may be evidenced by a telecopier  transmission  of the signature of
such party.  The  execution of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document by any
party hereto or thereto will not become effective until  counterparts  hereof or
thereof,  as the case may be, have been  executed  by all the parties  hereto or
thereto.

       11.8 Binding Effect; Assignment.

              (a) This  Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower
       is a Party will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, the
       Agent, the Co-Agent,  each of the Banks, and their respective  successors
       and  assigns,   except  that  Borrower  may  not  assign  its  rights  or
       responsibilities  hereunder  or  thereunder  or any  interest  herein  or
       therein  without the prior  written  consent of all the Banks.  Each Bank
       represents  that  it is  not  acquiring  its  Note  with  a  view  to the
       distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as
       amended (subject to any requirement that disposition of such Note must be
       within the  control of such  Bank).  Any Bank may at any time  pledge its
       Note or any other  instrument  evidencing its rights as a Bank under this
       Agreement to a Federal  Reserve  Bank,  but no such pledge shall  release
       that Bank from its obligations hereunder or grant to such Federal Reserve
       Bank the rights of a Bank hereunder absent foreclosure of such pledge.

              (b) From time to time  following the Closing  Date,  each Bank may
       assign to one or more Eligible  Assignees a portion of its Pro Rata Share
       of the Commitments;  provided that (i) in no event shall an assignment be
       made that would  reduce the  remaining  Pro Rata Share of the  Commitment
       held by the assigning Bank below  $10,000,000 (ii) such Eligible Assignee
       shall be  subject  to the  prior  reasonable  approval  of the  Agent and
       Borrower,  (iii)  such  assignment  shall be  evidenced  by a  Commitment
       Assignment  and  Acceptance,  a copy of which shall be  furnished  to the
       Agent as hereinbelow provided, (iv) the assignment shall not assign a Pro
       Rata Share of the Commitments  equivalent to less than  $10,000,000,  (v)
       any such  assignment must be made pro-rata with respect to the Line A and
       Line B Commitments,  and (vi) the effective  date of any such  assignment
       shall be as specified in the Commitment  Assignment and  Acceptance,  but
       not earlier  than the date which is five (5) Banking  Days after the date
       the Agent has received the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance. Upon the
       effective date of such Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible
       Assignee  named  therein  shall  be a  Bank  for  all  purposes  of  this
       Agreement,  with the Pro Rata Share of the Commitments  therein set forth
       and, to the extent of such Pro Rata Share,  the  assigning  Bank shall be
       released  from its further  obligations  under this  Agreement.  Borrower
       agrees  that it  shall  execute  and  deliver  (against  delivery  by the
       assigning  Bank to Borrower of its Notes) to such  assignee  Bank,  Notes
       evidencing  that assignee  Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Line A and Line B
       Commitments,  and to the assigning Bank,  Notes  evidencing the remaining
       balance Pro Rata Share  retained  by the  assigning  Bank.  Other than as
       specifically permitted under Sections 11.8(a), 11.8(b), or 11.8(e), or as
       may be approved by the  Majority  Banks,  no Bank shall be  permitted  to
       assign or otherwise transfer (including by participation) its interest in
       the Commitments, any Loan or any of the Loan Documents.

              (c) By  executing  and  delivering  a  Commitment  Assignment  and
       Acceptance,  the Eligible  Assignee  thereunder  acknowledges  and agrees
       that: (i) other than the representation and warranty that it is the legal
       and  beneficial  owner of the Pro Rata  Share  of the  Commitments  being
       assigned  thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Bank
       has made no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
       respect to any statements,  warranties or  representations  made in or in
       connection  with this  Agreement or the  execution,  legality,  validity,
       enforceability, genuineness or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
       Loan  Document;  (ii) the assigning  Bank has made no  representation  or
       warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with  respect to the  financial
       condition of Borrower or the performance by Borrower of the  Obligations;
       (iii) it has received a copy of this  Agreement,  together with copies of
       the most recent financial  statements  delivered  pursuant to Section 7.1
       and such other documents and information as it has deemed  appropriate to
       make its own credit  analysis and decision to enter into such  Commitment
       Assignment  and  Acceptance;  (iv) it  will,  independently  and  without
       reliance  upon the  Agent,  the  Co-Agent  or any Bank and  based on such
       documents  and  information  as it shall  deem  appropriate  at the time,
       continue to make its own credit  decisions in taking or not taking action
       under this  Agreement;  (v) it appoints and  authorizes the Agent to take
       such  action and to  exercise  such powers  under this  Agreement  as are
       delegated  to the Agent by this  Agreement;  and (vi) it will  perform in
       accordance with their terms all of the obligations  which by the terms of
       this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.

              (d) The Agent shall  maintain at the Agent's Office a copy of each
       Commitment  Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it. After receipt of a
       completed  Commitment  Assignment and Acceptance executed by any Bank and
       an Eligible  Assignee,  and receipt of an  assignment  fee of $2,500 from
       such Eligible  Assignee,  Agent shall,  promptly  following the effective
       date  thereof,  provide to Borrower and the Banks a revised  Schedule 1.2
       giving effect thereto.

              (e) Each  Bank may from  time to time  grant  participations  to a
       commercial bank Affiliate of such Bank in a portion of its Pro-Rata Share
       of the Commitments;  provided,  however, that (i) such Bank's obligations
       under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Bank shall remain
       solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto for the  performance of
       such  obligations,  (iii)  the  participating  banks or  other  financial
       institutions  shall not be a Bank hereunder for any purposes  except,  if
       the  participation  agreement so  provides,  for the purposes of Sections
       3.5, 3.6, 11.10 and 11.21,  (iv) Borrower,  the Agent and the other Banks
       shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with such Bank in connection
       such  Bank's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and (v) the
       holder  of  such   participation   shall  not  be   provided   under  its
       participation  agreement with consent or approval  rights with respect to
       any matters  concerning  the Loan Documents or the Loans except for those
       matters  designated  as  requiring  the consent or approval of all of the
       Banks under Section 11.2.

       11.9 Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Bank severally  agrees that if it, through
the  exercise  of any right of setoff,  banker's  lien or  counterclaim  against
Borrower,  or otherwise,  receives payment of the Obligations held by it that is
ratably more than any other Bank, through any means,  receives in payment of the
Obligations  held by that Bank,  then,  subject to applicable Laws: (a) The Bank
exercising  the right of setoff,  banker's  lien or  counterclaim  or  otherwise
receiving   such  payment   shall   purchase,   and  shall  be  deemed  to  have
simultaneously purchased, from the other Bank a participation in the Obligations
held by the other Bank and shall pay to the other  Bank a  purchase  price in an
amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each Bank after the exercise
of the right of  setoff,  banker's  lien or  counterclaim  or receipt of payment
shall be in the same  proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right
of setoff,  banker's lien or  counterclaim  or receipt of payment;  and (b) Such
other  adjustments  and purchases of  participations  shall be made from time to
time as shall be  equitable  to ensure  that all of the Banks  share any payment
obtained in respect of the  Obligations  ratably in accordance  with each Bank's
share of the Obligations  immediately prior to, and without taking into account,
the payment;  provided that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment
obtained  as a result of the  exercise  of the right of setoff,  banker's  lien,
counterclaim  or otherwise is thereafter  recovered from the purchasing  Bank by
Borrower or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrower,
the  purchase of a  participation  shall be  rescinded  and the  purchase  price
thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery,  but without  interest.
Each Bank that purchases a  participation  in the  Obligations  pursuant to this
Section  11.9  shall  from and  after  the  purchase  have the right to give all
notices,  requests,  demands,  directions  and other  communications  under this
Agreement with respect to the portion of the  Obligations  purchased to the same
extent as though the purchasing  Bank were the original owner of the Obligations
purchased.

       11.10 Indemnity by Borrower.  Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless the Agent,  the Co-Agent and each Bank and their  directors,  officers,
agents, and employees (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against: (a) Any
and all claims,  demands,  actions or causes of action (except a claim,  demand,
action,  or cause of action  for any  amount  excluded  from the  definition  of
"Taxes" in Section  3.10(c))  if the  claim,  demand,  action or cause of action
arises out of or relates to any act or omission  (or alleged act or omission) of
Borrower,  its  Affiliates  or any of its  officers,  directors or  shareholders
relating  to the  Commitments,  the use or  contemplated  use of proceeds of any
Loan, or the  relationship of Borrower and the Banks under this  Agreement;  (b)
Any  administrative  or  investigative  proceeding  by any  Governmental  Agency
arising  out of or  related  to a claim,  demand,  action  or  cause  of  action
described in clause (a) above; and (c) Any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees  and the  allocated  costs  of  attorneys
employed  by any  Indemnitee  and  disbursements  of such  attorneys  and  other
professional  services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the
assertion of any foregoing claim,  demand,  action or cause of action;  provided
that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to  indemnification  for any loss caused by
its own gross negligence or willful  misconduct or for any loss asserted against
it by another  Indemnitee.  If any claim,  demand,  action or cause of action is
asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify Borrower,
but the  failure to so  promptly  notify  Borrower  shall not affect  Borrower's
obligations  under  this  Section  unless  such  failure  materially  prejudices
Borrower's right to participate in the contest of such claim, demand,  action or
cause of action,  as hereinafter  provided.  Such  Indemnitee may (and shall, if
requested by Borrower in writing) contest the validity, applicability and amount
of such claim,  demand,  action or cause of action and shall permit  Borrower to
participate  in  such  contest.  Any  Indemnitee  that  proposes  to  settle  or
compromise  any claim or proceeding for which Borrower may be liable for payment
of indemnity  hereunder shall give Borrower  written notice of the terms of such
proposed  settlement  or  compromise   reasonably  in  advance  of  settling  or
compromising  such claim or proceeding and shall obtain Borrower's prior consent
(which  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  In  connection  with any  claim,
demand,  action or cause of action  covered by this Section  11.10  against more
than one Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees shall be represented by the same legal
counsel  (which  may be a law  firm  engaged  by the  Indemnitees  or  attorneys
employed by an  Indemnitee or a combination  of the  foregoing)  selected by the
Indemnitees and reasonably acceptable to Borrower;  provided, that if such legal
counsel determines in good faith that representing all such Indemnitees would or
could  result  in a  conflict  of  interest  under  Laws or  ethical  principles
applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense or  counterclaim is available
to an  Indemnitee  that is not  available to all such  Indemnitees,  then to the
extent  reasonably  necessary  to avoid such a conflict of interest or to permit
unqualified  assertion of such a defense or counterclaim,  each Indemnitee shall
be  entitled  to  separate  representation  by legal  counsel  selected  by that
Indemnitee  and reasonably  acceptable to Borrower,  with all such legal counsel
using reasonable  efforts to avoid unnecessary  duplication of effort by counsel
for all  Indemnitees;  and further  provided  that the Agent (as an  Indemnitee)
shall at all times be  entitled to  representation  by  separate  legal  counsel
(which may be a law firm or attorneys  employed by the Agent or a combination of
the foregoing).  Any obligation or liability of Borrower to any Indemnitee under
this Section 11.10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement
and the  repayment  of all Loans and the  payment and  performance  of all other
Obligations owed to the Banks.

       11.11 Nonliability of the Banks. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:

              (a) Any inspections of any Property of Borrower made by or through
       the Agent or the Banks are for  purposes  of  administration  of the Loan
       only and Borrower is not  entitled to rely upon the same  (whether or not
       such inspections are at the expense of Borrower);

              (b) By accepting or  approving  anything  required to be observed,
       performed,  fulfilled or given to the Agent or the Banks  pursuant to the
       Loan  Documents,  neither the Agent nor the Banks shall be deemed to have
       warranted or represented  the  sufficiency,  legality,  effectiveness  or
       legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof,
       and such  acceptance or approval  thereof shall not constitute a warranty
       or  representation  to anyone  with  respect  thereto by the Agent or the
       Banks;

              (c) The relationship  between  Borrower,  on the one hand, and the
       Agent,  the Co-Agent and/or any of the Banks, on the other, is, and shall
       at all times remain,  solely that of a borrower and lenders;  neither the
       Agent,  the  Co-Agent  nor the  Banks  shall  under any  circumstance  be
       construed  to  be  partners  or  joint   venturers  of  Borrower  or  its
       Affiliates; neither the Agent, the Co-Agent nor the Banks shall under any
       circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence  (other than
       as specified in Section 11.22) or trust or a fiduciary  relationship with
       Borrower or its  Affiliates,  or to owe any fiduciary duty to Borrower or
       its Affiliates;  neither the Agent,  the Co-Agent nor the Banks undertake
       or assume any  responsibility  or duty to Borrower or its  Affiliates  to
       select, review, inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrower
       or its Affiliates of any matter in connection  with their Property or the
       operations  of Borrower or its  Affiliates;  Borrower and its  Affiliates
       shall rely entirely upon their own judgment with respect to such matters;
       and any review, inspection,  supervision,  exercise of judgment or supply
       of  information  undertaken or assumed by the Agent,  the Co-Agent or the
       Banks in connection with such matters is solely for the protection of the
       Agent,  the  Co-Agent  and the Banks and neither  Borrower  nor any other
       Person is entitled to rely thereon; and

              (d)  Neither  the  Agent,  the  Co-Agent  nor the  Banks  shall be
       responsible  or liable to any Person for any loss,  damage,  liability or
       claim of any kind  relating  to injury or death to  Persons  or damage to
       Property caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of Borrower and/or
       its Affiliates and Borrower hereby  indemnifies and holds the Agent,  the
       Co-Agent and the Banks harmless from any such loss, damage,  liability or
       claim.

       11.12 No Third Parties Benefited.  This Agreement is made for the purpose
of  defining  and  setting  forth  certain  obligations,  rights  and  duties of
Borrower,  the Agent,  the Co-Agent and the Banks in connection  with the Loans,
and is made for the sole  benefit of Borrower,  the Agent,  the Co-Agent and the
Banks,  and the Agent's,  the Co-Agent's and the Banks'  successors and assigns.
Except as provided in Sections  11.8 and 11.10,  no other  Person shall have any
rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof.

       11.13 Further  Assurances.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall, at their
expense and without  expense to the Banks or the Agent,  do, execute and deliver
such  further  acts and  documents  as any Bank or the  Agent  from time to time
reasonably  requires for the assuring and confirming unto the Banks or the Agent
of the rights  hereby  created or  intended  now or  hereafter  so to be, or for
carrying out the intention or  facilitating  the performance of the terms of any
Loan Document.

       11.14  Integration.   This  Agreement,   together  with  the  other  Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior  agreements,  written or oral, on
the subject matter hereof.  In the event of any conflict  between the provisions
of this Agreement and those of any other Loan  Document,  the provisions of this
Agreement shall control and govern;  provided that the inclusion of supplemental
rights or remedies in favor of the Agent or the Banks in any other Loan Document
shall not be deemed a  conflict  with this  Agreement.  Each Loan  Document  was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
with the fair meaning thereof.

       11.15 Governing Law.  Except to the extent  otherwise  provided  therein,
each  Loan  Document  shall be  governed  by,  and  construed  and  enforced  in
accordance with, the local Laws of California.

       11.16 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that
is held to be  inoperative,  unenforceable  or invalid as to any party or in any
jurisdiction   shall,  as  to  that  party  or  jurisdiction,   be  inoperative,
unenforceable  or invalid  without  affecting  the  remaining  provisions or the
operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to any other party or
in any other jurisdiction,  and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents
are declared to be severable.  

       11.17  Headings.  Article and Section  headings in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents are included for  convenience of reference only and are not
part of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other purpose.

       11.18 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of the Loan Documents.

       11.19 Foreign Banks.  Each Bank that is incorporated  under the Laws of a
jurisdiction  other than the United States of America or any state thereof shall
deliver to  Borrower  (with a copy to the Agent),  within  twenty days after the
Closing  Date (or after  accepting an  assignment  interest  herein  pursuant to
Section 11.8, if applicable) two duly completed copies,  signed by a Responsible
Official,  of either Form 1001  (relating  to such Person and  entitling it to a
complete exemption from withholding on all payments to be made to such Person by
Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement) or Form 4224 (relating to all payments to
be made to such Person by Borrower  pursuant  to this  Agreement)  of the United
States Internal Revenue Service or such other evidence (including, if reasonably
necessary,  Form W-9) satisfactory to Borrower and the Agent that no withholding
under the  federal  income tax laws is  required  with  respect to such  Person.
Thereafter and from time to time,  each such Person shall (a) promptly submit to
Borrower (with a copy to the Agent),  such  additional duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such  successor  forms as shall be adopted  from
time to time by the relevant  United States taxing  authorities)  as may then be
available  under then current United States laws and  regulations  to avoid,  or
such  evidence as is  satisfactory  to Borrower  and the Agent of any  available
exemption from, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be
made to such Person by Borrower  pursuant  to this  Agreement  and (b) take such
steps  as shall  not be  materially  disadvantageous  to it,  in the  reasonable
judgment  of  such  Bank,  and as may be  reasonably  necessary  (including  the
re-designation  of  its  Eurodollar   Lending  Office,  if  any)  to  avoid  any
requirement  of applicable  laws that Borrower make any deduction or withholding
for taxes from amounts payable to such Person.

       11.20 Hazardous Material Indemnity.  Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify,
hold harmless and defend (by counsel  reasonably  satisfactory to the Agent) the
Agent,  the  Co-Agent  and each of the  Banks and  their  respective  directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all
claims, losses, damages, liabilities,  fines, penalties, charges, administrative
and judicial  proceedings and orders,  judgments,  remedial action requirements,
enforcement  actions  of any  kind,  and all  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in
connection  therewith  (including but not limited to reasonable  attorneys' fees
and the allocated costs of attorneys  employed by the Agent, the Co-Agent or any
Bank,  and  expenses  to the extent  that the defense of any such action has not
been assumed by Borrower),  arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,
out of  (i)  the  presence  on or  under  any  Real  Property  of any  Hazardous
Materials, or any releases or discharges of any Hazardous Materials on, under or
from any Real Property and (ii) any activity  carried on or undertaken on or off
any Real Property by Borrower or any of its predecessors in title, whether prior
to or  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  whether  by  Borrower  or any
predecessor in title or any employees,  agents, contractors or subcontractors of
Borrower or any predecessor in title, or any third persons at any time occupying
or present on any Real  Property,  in connection  with the handling,  treatment,
removal,  storage,  decontamination,  clean-up,  transport  or  disposal  of any
Hazardous  Materials  at any  time  located  or  present  on or  under  any Real
Property.   The  foregoing   indemnity  shall  further  apply  to  any  residual
contamination on or under any Real Property, or affecting any natural resources,
and to any  contamination  of any  property  or  natural  resources  arising  in
connection with the generation, use, handling, storage, transport or disposal of
any such Hazardous Materials, and irrespective of whether any of such activities
were or will be undertaken in accordance with applicable Laws, but the foregoing
indemnity  shall not apply to  Hazardous  Materials  on any Real  Property,  the
presence  of which is caused  solely by the Agent,  the  Co-Agent  or the Banks.
Borrower  hereby  acknowledges  and  agrees  that,   notwithstanding  any  other
provision of this  Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary,
the  obligations  of Borrower  under this Section  shall be  unlimited  personal
corporate  obligations of Borrower and shall not be secured by any deed of trust
on any Real Property.

       11.21 Reference to Arbitration.

              (a) Mandatory  Arbitration.  Any  controversy or claim between any
       Party or group of Parties,  on the one hand, and the Agent,  the Co-Agent
       or any Bank, or any group thereof,  on the other hand,  including but not
       limited to those  arising  out of or relating  to this  Agreement  or any
       agreements  or  instruments  relating  hereto or delivered in  connection
       herewith and any claim based on or arising from an alleged tort, shall at
       the request of any party be determined by  arbitration.  The  arbitration
       shall be conducted in accordance  with the United States  Arbitration Act
       (Title 9, U.S. Code), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this
       Agreement,  and under the  Commercial  Rules of the American  Arbitration
       Association  ("AAA").  The  arbitrators  shall give effect to statutes of
       limitation in determining any claim. Any controversy  concerning  whether
       an issue is arbitrable shall be determined by the  arbitrators.  Judgment
       upon  the   arbitration   award  may  be  entered  in  any  court  having
       jurisdiction.  The  institution and maintenance of an action for judicial
       relief  or  pursuit  of a  provisional  or  ancillary  remedy  shall  not
       constitute a waiver of the right of any party,  including the  plaintiff,
       to submit the  controversy  or claim to  arbitration  if any other  party
       contests such action for judicial relief.

              (b) Real  Property  Collateral.  Should real  property  collateral
       hereafter  be  taken  by the  Banks  to  secure  the  Obligations,  then,
       notwithstanding  the  provisions of Section  11.21(a),  no controversy or
       claim  shall be  submitted  to  arbitration  without  the  consent of all
       parties if, at the time of the proposed  submission,  such controversy or
       claim  arises  from or  relates  to an  obligation  to the Bank  which is
       secured by such real property  collateral.  If all parties do not consent
       to  submission  of  such a  controversy  or  claim  to  arbitration,  the
       controversy or claim shall be determined as provided in Section 11.21(c).

              (c)  Judicial  Reference.  A  controversy  or  claim  which is not
       submitted to arbitration as provided and limited in Sections 11.21(a) and
       (b) shall,  at the request of any party,  be determined by a reference in
       accordance with  California Code of Civil Procedure  Sections 638 et seq.
       If such an election is made,  the parties shall  designate to the court a
       referee or referees  selected  under the  auspices of the AAA in the same
       manner as  arbitrators  are selected in  AAA-sponsored  proceedings.  The
       presiding  referee  of the  panel,  or the  referee  if there is a single
       referee,  shall be an active attorney or retired judge. Judgment upon the
       award  rendered by such referee or referees shall be entered in the court
       in which such proceeding was commenced in accordance with California Code
       of Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645.

              (d) Provisional Remedies,  Self-Help and Foreclosure. No provision
       of this  Section  11.21  shall  limit  the  right  of any  party  to this
       Agreement to exercise  self-help  remedies  such as setoff,  to foreclose
       against  collateral or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a
       court of competent  jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of
       any  arbitration or other  proceeding.  The exercise of a remedy does not
       waive  the right of any party to  resort  to  arbitration  or  reference.
       Should real property collateral hereafter be taken by the Banks to secure
       the Obligations,  then, at the Banks' option,  foreclosure under any deed
       of trust or mortgage may be  accomplished  either by exercise of power or
       sale under the deed of trust or mortgage or by judicial foreclosure.

       11.22  Confidentiality.   Each  Bank  agrees  to  hold  any  confidential
information  that  it may  receive  from  Borrower  or  Agent  pursuant  to this
Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure: (a) To other Banks; (b) To legal
counsel and accountants or other professional  advisors to Borrower or any Bank,
provided  that  the  recipient  has  accepted  such  information  subject  to  a
confidentiality  agreement  substantially  similar to this Section 11.22; (c) To
regulatory  officials having jurisdiction over that Bank; (d) As required by Law
or legal process or in connection  with any legal  proceeding to which that Bank
is involved  and that relates in some manner to the Loan  Documents;  and (e) To
another  financial  institution  in connection  with a  disposition  or proposed
disposition  to  that  financial  institution  of all or  part  of  that  Bank's
interests  hereunder or a participation  interest in one of its Notes,  provided
that the recipient has accepted such  information  subject to a  confidentiality
agreement  substantially  similar to this  Section  11.22.  For  purposes of the
foregoing,  "confidential  information"  shall  mean  the  Strategic  Plan,  the
information   provided   pursuant  to  Section  7.1(c)  and  any  other  written
information  respecting Borrower or its Subsidiaries  provided to the applicable
Bank and  designated  thereon to be  confidential,  other  than (i)  information
previously filed with any Governmental  Agency and available to the public, (ii)
information  previously published in any public medium from a source other than,
directly or indirectly,  that Bank, and (iii) information  disclosed by Borrower
to any Person not associated with Borrower without a  confidentiality  agreement
substantially  similar to this Section  11.22.  Nothing in this Section shall be
construed to create or give rise to any fiduciary  duty on the part of the Agent
or the Banks to Borrower.

       11.23 Co-Agent.  Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied,  and will
not rely,  upon the  Co-Agent  in deciding  to enter into this  Agreement  or in
taking or not taking any action  hereunder.  The  Co-Agent  shall have no right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or the
other  Loan  Documents  other  than  those  applicable  to all  Banks and in its
capacity as such.

       11.24 Purported Oral Amendments.  BORROWER  EXPRESSLY  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY ONLY BE AMENDED OR MODIFIED,  OR
THE  PROVISIONS  HEREOF OR THEREOF WAIVED OR  SUPPLEMENTED,  BY AN INSTRUMENT IN
WRITING THAT COMPLIES WITH SECTION 11.2.  BORROWER  AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT RELY
ON ANY COURSE OF DEALING,  COURSE OF PERFORMANCE,  OR ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS
BY ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENT OR ANY BANK THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION
11.2  TO  EFFECT  AN  AMENDMENT,  MODIFICATION,  WAIVER  OR  SUPPLEMENT  TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

       IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed as of the date first above written.

<DESCRIPTION>FIRST AMENDMENT TO RETIREMENT PLAN NO. 2
<TEXT>



                              FIRST AMENDMENT
                        TO THE DEL WEBB CORPORATION
               SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN NO. 2



         The Del Webb Corporation  Supplemental  Executive Retirement Plan No. 2
(the  "Plan"),  which was  originally  effective as of January 1, 1989,  and was
restated  effective as of April 20, 1993, is hereby further  amended as follows,
effective as of July 1, 1995:

            1. Section  2.1(a)  of the Plan is  amended by the  addition  of the
following sentence to the end thereof:

               Any  Participation  Agreement  in effect prior to the adoption of
               this amended and restated  Plan shall  continue in full force and
               effect until subsequently modified or replaced.

            2. Section  4.2(b) of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as
follows:

                    (b) High Average  Compensation.  "High Average Compensation"
                means the sum of the  Participant's  annual  total of salary and
                incentive   compensation,    before   reduction   for   deferred
                compensation and 401(k) contributions,  in the five (5) calendar
                years  out  of the  seven  (7)  consecutive  calendar  years  of
                employment  with the Employer in which such total is the highest
                divided  by  five  (5).   Where  the  actual  (not   annualized)
                compensation  paid to a  Participant  during a partial  calendar
                year is greater than the  compensation  paid to the  Participant
                during a  completed  calendar  year,  such  partial  year may be
                utilized for  purposes of this  provision.  Notwithstanding  the
                above,  incentive  compensation payments made in July, 1991, for
                the  period  January  1, 1991,  to June 30,  1991,  shall not be
                included in the computations of High Average Compensation.

            3.  Section 4.5(d) of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as
follows:

                    (d)  Accelerated  Distribution.  Notwithstanding  any  other
                provision of the Plan,  at any time after a Change in Control or
                any time  following  termination  of  employment,  a Participant
                shall be  entitled  to  receive,  upon  written  request  to the
                Committee,  a lump sum  distribution  of all or a portion of the
                Actuarial  Equivalent of the Participant's unpaid benefits under
                this  Plan on the  date on  which  the  Committee  receives  the
                written request. Each accelerated  distribution shall be subject
                to a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount that would
                otherwise be  distributed  and that amount shall be forfeited by
                the Participant.  The amount payable under this section shall be
                paid in a lump sum within  sixty-five  (65) days  following  the
                receipt of the notice by the Committee from the Participant.  In
                the event a  Participant  requests  and  obtains an  accelerated
                distribution  under this Section 4.5(d) and remains  employed by
                the  Employer,  participation  will  cease and there  will be no
                future benefit accruals under this plan.

                    In the event of a Participant's death and subsequent benefit
                payments to the designated  beneficiary,  such  beneficiary  may
                request a distribution under this Section 4.5(d).

            4.  Article VIII is amended by adding the following  new Section 8.3
to the end thereof:

                    8.3  Modifications  for  Particular  Participants.   In  the
                exercise of its  discretion,  the Board may modify or supplement
                the  provisions  of this  Plan  as it  applies  to a  particular
                Participant.  No  modification  or supplement will be effective,
                however,   unless   it  is   reflected   in  the   Participant's

                            RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN

                             (Amended and Restated
                        Effective as of January 1, 1995)


                         Article 1. Restatement of Plan
                         ------------------------------

     1.1  RESTATEMENT  OF THE  PLAN.  Effective  January  1,  1976,  DEL E. WEBB
CORPORATION established the "Retirement Savings Plan for the Employees of Del E.
Webb Corporation",  now known as the "Retirement  Savings Plan for the Employees
of Del Webb Corporation" (the "Plan"),  covering its Employees and the Employees
of participating  affiliates.  DEL E. WEBB CORPORATION later changed its name to
DEL WEBB CORPORATION and it recently  reincorporated in Delaware by merging into
a Delaware corporation that bears the same name, assumed its role as the sponsor
of the Plan,  and is referred to in this document as the "Company." The Plan was
most recently amended and restated in its entirety,  effective  January 1, 1987.
The Plan was  subsequently  amended on six separate  occasions.  By execution of
this document,  the Company hereby amends and restates the Plan in its entirety,
effective January 1, 1995.

     1.2  PURPOSE OF THE PLAN.  This Plan is intended  to  encourage  and assist
Eligible  Employees  in  adopting  a  regular  program  of  savings  to  provide
additional  security  for  their  retirement.  For tax  purposes,  this  Plan is
intended to qualify as a profit  sharing plan with a qualified  cash or deferred
arrangement and  nondiscriminatory  matching  contributions.  In accordance with
Code section  401(a)(27),  the  determination  that the Plan is a profit sharing
plan shall be made without regard to whether the Company actually has current or
accumulated profits.

     1.3  APPLICABILITY  OF THE PLAN.  Except as otherwise  stated  herein,  the
provisions of this restatement are applicable only to Eligible  Employees in the
employ of the Company and Affiliates on or after January 1, 1995.


                             Article 2. Definitions
                             ----------------------

     2.1 DEFINITIONS.  Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall have
the respective meanings set forth below unless otherwise required by the context
in which they are used:

     (a)  "Account,  Accounts" shall mean the Account or Accounts maintained for
          each Participant which represent the Participant's total proportionate
          interest in the Trust Fund as of any date and which consist of the sum
          of the following:

          (1)  "Basic Pretax Savings Account" shall mean a Participant's Account
               to which Basic Pretax  Savings  Contributions  have been credited
               under the Plan,  as  adjusted  from time to time as  provided  in
               Article 8.

          (2)  "Company   Contributions  Account"  shall  mean  a  Participant's
               Account  to which  Company  Contributions  made on  behalf of the
               Participant for periods  beginning on and after July 1, 1983 have
               been  credited,  as  adjusted  from time to time as  provided  in
               Article 8.

          (3)  "Frozen  Account"  for  purposes  of this  Plan  shall  mean  the
               Participant's  account  to which  amounts  have been  transferred
               directly from the  predecessor  profit  sharing plan known as the
               "Restated  Profit Sharing Plan and Trust Agreement" that Del Webb
               Corporation  originally  established in 1949 and later maintained
               as  a  "frozen"  plan   following  the   discontinuance   of  all
               contributions to such plan in 1976, as such Frozen Account may be
               adjusted from time to time as provided in Article 8.

          (4)  "Loan   Account"   shall  mean  the  account   representing   the
               outstanding  balance of any loan to a Participant  as provided in
               section 6.11.

          (5)  "Prior Account" shall mean a  Participant's  Account to which all
               Company Contributions made on behalf of the Participant under the
               prior  version  of this Plan for  periods  prior to July 1, 1983,
               have been credited,  and to which any amounts transferred to this
               Plan  on  behalf  of  the  Participant  pursuant  to  a  rollover
               described in section 5.13 have also been credited,  as such Prior
               Account may be adjusted  from time to time as provided in Article
               8.  The  Committee  may  require  that  separate  subaccounts  be
               maintained to  differentiate  amounts  attributable  to transfers
               from the  Prior  Plan and  other  amounts  credited  to the Prior
               Account,  or it may instead use the  Rollover  Account in lieu of
               the  Prior  Account  to  account  for  amounts   attributable  to
               transfers from the Prior Plan and/or rollover  contributions made
               pursuant to section 5.13.

          (6)  "Rollover  Account" shall mean a  Participant's  Account to which
               rollover  contributions  made  pursuant to section 5.13 have been
               credited, as adjusted from time to time as provided in Article 8.

          (7)  "Unmatched  Pretax Savings  Account"  shall mean a  Participant's
               Account to which Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions have been
               credited  under  the  Plan,  as  adjusted  from  time  to time as
               provided in Article 8.

     (b)  "Active  Participant"  shall  mean a  Participant  who (i) at any time
          during  the Plan  Year is  eligible  to  elect to make a Basic  Pretax
          Savings  Contribution  pursuant  to section  4.1,  and (ii) either (a)
          continues to be an Employee  (including one who is temporarily  absent
          due to seasonal  adjustments or layoff) on the earlier of (1) the date
          that a  discretionary  Company  Contribution  is made for a particular
          Plan Year or (2) the last  working day of the Plan Year,  or (b) dies,
          incurs  a  disability,  or  retires  at or  after  age 65  during  the
          applicable period in subparagraph (a) above while still an Employee.

     (c)  "Affiliate"  shall  mean a  corporation  or  other  employer  which is
          controlled  by or under common  control  with the Company,  within the
          meaning of sections  414 and 1563 of the Code.  The  determination  of
          control  shall be made  without  reference  to  paragraphs  (a)(4) and
          (e)(3)(c) of section 1563,  and solely for the purpose of applying the
          limitations  of  sections  5.8 through  5.10 of this Plan,  the phrase
          "more than 50 percent" shall be  substituted  for the phrase "at least
          80 percent" each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1).  In addition,

          adopted this Plan, an organization  which is treated as a member of an

          such Employer belongs.

     (d)  "Alternate  Payee"  means a  spouse,  former  spouse,  child  or other

          benefits payable under the Plan with respect to a Participant.

     (e)  "Annual  Addition" means with respect to any  Participant,  the sum of
          the  following  amounts  allocable  for a Plan Year (which is also the
          limitation year) to a Participant under this Plan or under any defined
          contribution  plan or defined  benefit plan maintained by the Employer
          or an Affiliate:  (i) the Employer contributions  allocable for a Plan
          Year  to  the  accounts  of the  Participant,  including  any  amounts
          allocable from a suspense account maintained  pursuant to such plan on
          account  of  a  prior  Plan  Year;   amounts  deemed  to  be  Employer
          contributions  pursuant  to a cash or deferred  arrangement  qualified
          under section  401(k) of the Code  (including the Basic Pretax Savings
          Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings contributions  allocable to
          a  Participant  pursuant to this Plan);  and  amounts  allocable  to a
          medical account which must be treated as annual additions  pursuant to

          nondeductible Employee  contributions  allocable during a Plan Year to

          contributions or transfers from other qualified plans, restorations or
          forfeitures,   or  other  items   similarly   enumerated  in  Treasury
          Regulation   section   1.415-6(b)(3)   shall  not  be   considered  in
          calculating a  Participant's  Annual  Additions for any Plan Year. For
          purposes of calculating the "defined  contribution  plan fraction" for
          any Plan Year  pursuant  to  section  415 of the  Code,  nondeductible
          Employee contributions allocated to a Participant during any Plan Year
          commencing  on or before  December 31, 1986,  will be considered to be
          part of the Annual  Addition  for that Plan Year only to the extent of
          the lesser of (i) the amount of nondeductible  contributions in excess
          of 6% of the Participant's Compensation for that year or (ii) one-half
          of the  nondeductible  contributions  allocable during the year to the
          Participant's accounts.

     (f)  "Basic Pretax Savings Contributions" shall mean the amount, determined
          as a percentage of Compensation,  a Participant  requests the Employer
          to  contribute  on the  Participant's  behalf  to the Plan on a pretax
          basis in  accordance  with  section  4.1,  which  amount is subject to
          matching by the Employer as provided in Article 5.

     (g)  "Beneficiary"  shall  mean the  person  or  persons  (who may be named
          contingently or  successively)  designated by a Participant to receive
          the  Participant's  Account in the event of the  Participant's  death.
          Each designation shall be in the form prescribed by the Committee, and
          will be effective  only when filed in writing with the  Committee  and
          shall  revoke  all prior  designations  by the same  Participant.  The
          Committee  shall require that a married  Participant  who designates a
          Beneficiary  other than the  Participant's  spouse obtain the spouse's
          consent to the designation. In the case of a Participant with at least
          one Hour of Service on or after August 23, 1984,  such spousal consent
          shall be in  writing,  acknowledge  the  effect  of the  Participant's
          election,  be properly witnessed by a Plan official or a notary public
          under  procedures  approved  by the  Committee  and be provided to the
          Committee.  If no  Beneficiary  is  designated  at  the  time  of  the
          Participant's  death, or if no person so designated  shall survive the
          Participant,  the  Beneficiary  shall be the  Participant's  surviving
          spouse, or if the deceased  Participant has no surviving  spouse,  the
          Participant's estate, provided that this order of preference shall not
          supersede  the  former  rules of the Plan  with  respect  to any death
          occurring prior to the adoption of this Plan restatement.

     (h)  "Board of  Directors"  or "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of
          the  Company.  The Board of  Directors  of the  Company,  pursuant  to
          specific resolutions or a general grant of authority, may delegate any

          Plan or the Trust  Agreement to the Human  Resources  Committee or any
          other committee.

     (i)  "Code" shall mean the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as from time to
          time amended. Where reference is made to an incorrect or outdated Code
          section,  the  reference  shall be  reformed to indicate a proper Code
          section that is consistent with the context and the intended  meaning,

          shall also be reformed accordingly.

     (j)  "Committee" shall mean the Benefits Advisory  Committee of the Company

          from the context in which it is used.

     (l)  "Company  Contributions"  shall mean the  contributions  the  Employer

          basis as is provided in sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4.

     (m)  "Company  Securities" or "Sponsor Securities" - shall mean "qualifying
          employer  securities",  within the  meaning of  section  407(d)(5)  of
          ERISA, of the Company or an Affiliate.

     (n)  "Compensation" means a Participant's pay determined as follows:

          (l)  For all  purposes  of the Plan,  except as  otherwise  specified,
               Compensation  means  a  Participant's  total  cash  compensation,
               excluding,  however, bonuses, overtime,  compensation of any type
               earned or accrued prior to the date he/she becomes a Participant,
               any "subsistence  allowance"  payments  provided by the Employer,
               any  reimbursements  for moving  expenses  and any other  expense
               reimbursements.  Compensation, as so defined, shall be determined
               prior to any election to defer Basic Pretax Savings Contributions
               and  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Contributions  as  described  in
               sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this Plan.

          (2)  For purposes of applying the limits of section 415 of the Code as
               described  in  sections  5.8 and  5.11,  and  application  of the
               top-heavy   provisions   of  Article  13,   Compensation   means,
               generally,  an Employee's taxable W-2 earnings, and includes such
               modifications  as may be required to conform to the definition of
               "participant's  compensation"  in Code section  415(c)(3) and the
               regulations thereunder.

          (3)  For purposes of satisfying the limits on contributions  described
               in sections  4.7,  4.8 and 5.3 and for  purposes  of  determining
               whether  an   individual  is  a  Highly   Compensated   Employee,
               Compensation means a "participant's  compensation," as defined in
               section  415(c)(3)  of  the  Code  and  the  applicable  Treasury
               regulations  thereunder and as adjusted in the following  manner.
               Except as  prohibited  by Treasury  regulations,  the Company may
               include as  Compensation  for purposes of this  subparagraph  all
               Basic Pretax  Savings  Contributions,  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings
               Contributions,  and other Code section 401(k) elective  deferrals
               and all Code section 125 salary reduction amounts,  if any, under
               a plan  maintained  by the Company or an Affiliate  provided that
               such treatment and the  determination  of Compensation in general
               shall be applied on a consistent  basis in  accordance  with Code
               section 414(s) and the regulations  thereunder.  In lieu of using
               the  foregoing   definition  of  Compensation   for  purposes  of
               satisfying the limits on contributions described in sections 4.7,
               4.8 and  5.3,  any  definition  of  Compensation  that  satisfies
               section   414(s)  of  the  Code,  and  the   regulations   issued
               thereunder, may be used.

          The annual Compensation taken into account under the Plan for any Plan
          Year  beginning  on or after  January  1,  1989,  shall not exceed the
          maximum dollar amount ($200,000 for the year beginning in 1989 and any
          other  amount that  applies for a later year,  including  the limit of
          $150,000  that  applies  for  the  year  beginning  in  1994)  that is
          permitted  as  of  the  beginning  of  the  year  under  Code  section
          401(a)(17)  (determined  after giving effect to any statutory  changes
          affecting   Code  section   401(a)(17)   and  any  indexing  or  other
          adjustments  pursuant to Code section  401(a)(17)  that are applicable
          for the year of the  determination).  In the case of a short Plan Year
          or other  period of less than 12 months  requiring a reduction  of the
          Code section  401(a)(17) annual limit, the otherwise  applicable limit
          shall be prorated by  multiplying  it by a fraction,  the numerator of
          which is the number of months in the short period and the  denominator
          of which is 12.  Moreover,  in determining an Employee's  Compensation
          for purposes of the Code section  401(a)(17)  limit, the rules of Code
          section  414(q)(6)  (requiring the aggregation of Compensation paid to
          family members of certain  five-percent owners and the ten most highly
          compensated  Employees)  shall  apply,  except that in  applying  such
          rules, the term "family" shall include only the spouse of the Employee
          and any lineal  descendants  of the Employee who have not attained age
          19 before the close of the year. If, as a result of the application of
          such rules, the adjusted annual Code section  401(a)(17)  Compensation
          limit is  exceeded,  then  (except  for  determining  the  portion  of
          Compensation  up to the  integration  level if this Plan  provides for
          permitted disparity),  such limit shall be prorated among the affected
          individuals in proportion to each such  individual's  Compensation  as
          determined  prior to the  application  of the Code section  401(a)(17)
          limit.

          (o)  "Eligible  Employee" means any Employee  employed by an Employer,
               but  excluding  (i)  any  Leased  Employee,  (ii)  any  Temporary

               (iv) any Employee  covered by a collective  bargaining  agreement
               where  retirement   benefits  were  the  subject  of  good  faith
               bargaining between representatives of the Employer and the union,
               unless such agreement expressly provides for participation in the
               Plan.

          (p)  "Employee"   shall  mean  any  employee  of  the  Company  or  an
               Affiliate, including any Leased Employee.
                                                                   
          (q)  "Employer"  shall mean the Company and any Affiliate which adopts

          (s)  "ERISA" shall mean the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
               1974, as from time to time amended.
                                                                       
          (t)  "Highly Compensated Employee" means an Employee described in Code
               section  414(q) and generally  includes any Employee who,  during
               the current Plan Year or immediately preceding Plan Year:

               (1)  was at any time a 5-percent  owner (as defined in subsection
                    13.2 of the Plan);

               (2)  received  Compensation  in excess of $75,000  (or such other
                    amount as may be prescribed under the Code);

               (3)  received  Compensation  in excess of $50,000  (or such other
                    amount as may be  prescribed  under the Code) and was in the
                    group of Employees  consisting  of the top 20 percent of all

                    paid for the Plan Year; or

               (4)  was at any time an  officer  and  received  Compensation  in
                    excess of $45,000 (or such other amount as may be prescribed
                    under the Code) for the Plan  Year;  provided  that for this
                    purpose no more than 50 Employees or, if lesser, the greater
                    of 3  Employees  or 10  percent  of all  Employees  shall be
                    considered  officers  and,  if no officer  has  Compensation
                    exceeding $45,000, as adjusted, the officer with the highest
                    Compensation  shall  be  treated  as  a  Highly  Compensated
                    Employee under this subparagraph.
                                                                  
               For the Plan Year for which the  determination  is being made,  a
               person  who during the  preceding  Plan Year was not an  Employee
               described in  subparagraphs  (2), (3) or (4) shall not be treated
               as so described  during the current Plan Year,  unless  he/she is
               among  the  group  of  100   Employees   receiving   the  highest
               Compensation. In determining the group of Employees consisting of
               the top 20  percent of all active  Employees  under  subparagraph
               (3), the following Employees shall be disregarded:  Employees who
               have not attained age 21;  Employees  who normally work less than
               17-1/2  hours per week or 6 months  per year;  Employees  who are
               nonresident  aliens  receiving  no  U.S.-source  income  from the
               Company or an  Affiliate;  and,  except as prohibited by Treasury
               regulations, Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
               agreement  shall  be  disregarded.  A  former  Employee  shall be
               treated as a Highly  Compensated  Employee if he/she was a Highly
               Compensated  Employee  when  he/she  incurred  a  termination  of
               employment or at any time after attaining age 55.

               If an  Employee  is a family  member  of a  5-percent  owner or a
               Highly  Compensated  Employee  among  the  group of 10  Employees
               receiving the highest  Compensation  for the Plan Year, then such
               Employee  shall not be considered a separate  Employee under this
               subsection and any  Compensation  paid to him shall be treated as
               having  been paid to the Highly  Compensated  Employee.  For this
               purpose,  "family member" means the Employee's  spouse and lineal
               ascendants  or  descendants   and  the  spouses  of  such  lineal
               ascendants or descendants.
                                                                    
     (u)  "Hour of Service"  shall mean the hours  credited to an Employee under
          the following rules.  Each Employee shall receive credit for "Hours of
          Service" with the Company or an Affiliate as follows:

               (1)  One hour for each hour for which the Employee is directly or
                    indirectly  paid, or entitled to payment,  by the Company or
                    an  Affiliate  for the  performance  of  duties  during  the
                    applicable computation period for which the Employee's Hours
                    of Service are being determined under the Plan. (These hours
                    shall be credited to the Employee for the computation period
                    or  periods in which the duties  were  performed,  and shall
                    include hours for which back pay has been either  awarded or
                    agreed to by the  Company or an  Affiliate  as  provided  by
                    regulations  under ERISA,  with no duplication of credit for
                    hours.)

               (2)  One  hour  for  each  hour,  in  addition  to the  hours  in
                    paragraph  (l) above,  for which the Employee is directly or
                    indirectly  paid, or entitled to payment,  by the Company or
                    an Affiliate for reasons other than for the  performance  of
                    duties during the applicable  computation  periods,  such as
                    paid vacation,  holidays,  sickness,  disability and similar
                    paid  periods of  non-working  time.  (These  hours shall be
                    counted  in the  computation  period or periods in which the
                    hours occur for which payment is made.)

               (3)  One hour for each hour of the normally  scheduled work hours
                    during any period  the  Employee  is on any leave of absence
                    from work with the  Company  or an  Affiliate  for  military
                    service with the Armed Forces of the United States,  but not
                    to exceed the period  required  under the law  pertaining to
                    veterans'  reemployment  rights;  provided,  however, if the
                    Employee  fails to report  for work at the end of such leave
                    during the  period in which the  Employee  has  reemployment
                    rights,  the Employee  shall not receive credit for hours on
                    such leave.

               (4)  One hour  for  each of the  normally  scheduled  work  hours
                    during any period of  authorized  leave of absence or layoff
                    status  granted by the Company or an Affiliate for which the
                    Employee  is  not  compensated,   as  determined  under  the
                    Company's  policy  which  is  uniformly  applicable  to  all
                    Employees in similar circumstances.
                                                                           
               When no time records are  available,  the Employee shall be given
               credit for ten Hours of Service  for each day the  Employee is on
               the  Company's  or  Affiliate's   payroll.   There  shall  be  no
               duplication  of credit  for hours  under  (1),  (2),  (3) or (4),
               above,  and all such hours shall be determined in accordance with
               reasonable  standards  and policies  from time to time adopted by
               the Committee under Regulation sections 29 C.F.R.  2530.200b-2(b)

          discretionary  investment  powers with  respect to all or a portion of
          the Trust Fund.

          substantially a full-time basis for a period of at least one year, the
          services are of a type  historically  performed by Employees,  and the
          person is  required  to be treated  as an  Employee  pursuant  to Code

          me employee" shall also be considered to be an "On Call Employee".  An
          "ask me employee" is a resident of a community  who is  intermittently
          available to answer questions of prospective residents.

     (aa) "Participant" shall mean an Employee who has satisfied the eligibility
          requirements  of  -----------   Article  3.  In  addition,   the  term

          qualified plan on his/her behalf.

     (gg) "Seasonal  Employee"  shall  mean  any  Employee  whose  ordinary  and
          customary period of employment, measured in terms of 12 month periods,

          consecutive 12 month period and who is expected to or has been offered
          the opportunity to return to active  employment with the Company or an
          Affiliate at the  commencement  of his/her next  succeeding  customary
          period  of  employment.  Any  determination  as to  whether  or not an
          Employee  is a Seasonal  Employee  pursuant to the  definition  herein
          shall  be  made  by the  Company  or an  Affiliate  in a  uniform  and

          binding on all parties.

     (hh) "Temporary  Employee"  shall mean any  Employee  who is  employed in a

          initially  hired.  Any  determination  as to whether an  Employee is a
          Temporary  Employee  shall be made in a uniform and  nondiscriminatory
          manner by the Company or the Affiliate that employs the Employee.  Any
          determination so made shall be final and binding on all parties.

     (ii) "Trust or Trust  Agreement" shall mean the Trust or Trust Agreement of

     (ll) "Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Contributions"  shall  mean  the  amount,
          determined as a percentage of Compensation, a Participant requests the
          Employer to contribute on his/her behalf to the Plan on a pretax basis
          in accordance with section 4.2, which amount is not matched by Company
          Contributions.

     (mm) "Valuation  Date"  shall mean the date for  valuing  the assets of the
          Trust Fund,  which shall be the last business day of the Plan Year and
          any such other dates as the Committee may designate.

     (nn) "Year of Eligibility  Service" shall mean the computation period of 12
          consecutive  months  in which an  Employee  completes  1,000  Hours of
          Service.  The first such  computation  period shall  commence with the
          date on  which  the  Employee  first  receives  credit  for an Hour of
          Service.

          Each  subsequent  computation  period shall be a Plan Year,  beginning
          with the Plan Year that commences within the first computation period.

          In the case of an Employee who has not yet fulfilled  the  eligibility
          requirements  set  forth in  section  3.1 and who  incurs a "break  in
          service",  and then is reemployed  by the Company or an  Affiliate,  a
          "Year of Eligibility  Service" shall be determined by reference to the
          date upon which such Employee's reemployment begins. In the case of an
          Employee who terminates  employment and who is then  reemployed by the
          Company or an  Affiliate  without  incurring a "break in  service",  a
          "Year of Eligibility  Service" shall be determined by reference to the
          date  on  which  such  Employee's  original  employment  began.  If an
          Employee does not complete  1,000 or more Hours of Service  during the
          first 12 month period  during  which  he/she could  complete a Year of
          Eligibility  Service,  then "Year of Eligibility Service" shall mean a
          Plan Year during which such Employee  completes 1,000 or more Hours of
          Service.  For  purposes of this  section  2.1(nn),  the term "break in
          service" shall mean a twelve-month  computation period as set forth in
          this section  during which an Employee  performs 500 or fewer Hours of
          Service. Solely for purposes of determining whether a break in service
          has occurred in a computation period, an individual who is absent from
          work by reason of a Maternity/Paternity Leave shall receive credit for
          the Hours of Service which would  otherwise have been credited to such
          Employee but for such absence.  The Hours of Service  credited  herein
          shall be  credited  to the  computation  period in which  the  absence
          begins if the  crediting is necessary to prevent a break in service in
          that  period,  or in all other  cases,  in the  following  computation
          period.


     2.2  GENDER AND NUMBER. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, any
masculine or feminine  terminology  herein shall also include the other  gender,
and the  definition  of any term  herein in the  singular  or plural  shall also
include the other form.



                             Article 3. Participation
                             ------------------------

     3.1  PARTICIPATION.  Every Employee who was a Participant prior to December
31, 1994 shall remain a Participant in accordance with this Article. Every other
Employee  who is in or is hired into  employment  as an Eligible  Employee on or
after  December  31, 1994 shall  become a  Participant  in the Plan on the first
Entry Date coinciding with or next following the latest to occur of (a), (b), or
(c) below:

                  (a)    The date the Employee attains age 21;

                  (b)    The  date  the  Employee  completes  One-Half  Year  of
                         Eligibility  Service or,  effective  September 1, 1995,
                         six months of service; or

                  (c)    The date the Employee becomes an Eligible Employee.

For purposes of this section,  'One-Half  Year of  Eligibility  Service' means a
computation period of six consecutive months, measured from the date an Employee
first  performs an Hour of Service or from a date that is six months (or an even
multiple of six months) thereafter,  in which an Employee completes 500 Hours of
Service.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a person who became an Employee on or
before July 11, 1990 shall become a Participant  no later than the Entry Date on
which he/she would do so if (b) above were applied by substituting  'one Year of
Eligibility Service' in place of 'One-Half Year of Eligibility Service'."

As provided  above,  effective  September  1, 1995,  an Eligible  Employee  must
complete six months of service rather than One-Half Year of Eligibility  Service
as a condition of  participation in the Plan. In order to complete six months of
service,  an Eligible  Employee must simply remain in the Employer's  employ for
six months  following the day on which he first  performs an Hour of Service for
the Employer.  The Eligible  Employee  need not complete any specific  number of
Hours of Service during the six month period. If an Eligible Employee terminates
employment  before  completing  six  months  of  service  and later  returns  to
employment  with the  Employer,  he will be treated as a new Employee  unless he
completes or completed 1,000 or more Hours of Service during the 12 month period
beginning on the day on which he first  performed  an Hour of Service,  in which
case he shall become a Participant  as of the later of his date of  reemployment
or the first day of the month following the expiration of said 12 month period.

     3.2 Reemployment. A Participant who has a termination of employment and who
is  subsequently  reemployed as an Employee shall become a Participant as of the
date he/she returns to employment as an Eligible Employee. An Employee who has a
termination  of  employment  prior  to  the  time  he/she  becomes  eligible  to
participate in the Plan shall become a Participant in the Plan upon rehire as an
Eligible  Employee on the Entry Date  coinciding with or next following the date
he/she  fulfills  the age and  service  requirements  set forth in section  3.1.
Computation of such  Employee's  service shall be determined in accordance  with
the provisions of section 2.1(nn).

     3.3 Transferees.  If an Employee who is not currently an Eligible  Employee
transfers  to a  position  as  an  Eligible  Employee,  he/she  shall  become  a
Participant on the later of (i) the Entry Date coinciding with or next following
such transfer or (ii) the Entry Date upon which he/she would have  satisfied the
requirements of section 3.1.

Any  Participant who transfers to a status as an Employee who is not an Eligible
Employee  shall no longer be an Active  Participant  as of the effective date of
the change in his employment  classification.  The  Participant's  Accounts will
continue to be held  pursuant to the terms of this Plan and will be  distributed
upon his/her  subsequent  termination  of employment  or the  occurrence of some
other event permitting a distribution pursuant to the provisions of this Plan.



                      Article 4. Pretax Savings Contributions
                      ---------------------------------------
   
     4.1  DEFERRAL OF BASIC PRETAX SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS.  Each  Participant may
elect on a  prospective  basis to have the  Employer  contribute  a  portion  of
his/her  Compensation to the Plan on his/her behalf each Plan Year,  measured in
whole  percentage  points  of from  two  percent  up to the  applicable  maximum
percentage  described  below,  as  a  Basic  Pretax  Savings  Contribution,   in
accordance  with the rules set forth in section  4.3 and such other rules as the
Committee may prescribe.  The applicable maximum percentage shall be six percent
or such other  percent as may be  established  by the Board of Directors for the
particular  Plan  Year,  which  percentages  may vary for  different  groups  of
Participants.

     4.2  DEFERRAL OF UNMATCHED  PRETAX SAVINGS  CONTRIBUTIONS. In addition to a
Participant's Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions as provided under section 4.1,
in any Plan Year, a Participant who has elected the maximum percentage available
to him  under  section  4.1 may also  elect on a  prospective  basis to have the
Employer  contribute  a portion of his/her  Compensation  to the Plan on his/her
behalf,  measured  in whole  percentage  points  of from one  percent  up to the
applicable  maximum  percentage  described below, as an Unmatched Pretax Savings
Contribution,  in  accordance  with the rules set forth in section  4.3 and such
other rules as the Committee may prescribe.  The applicable  maximum  percentage
for any given  Participant  shall be the  difference  between 15 percent and the
maximum  percentage  that the  Participant is allowed to elect as a Basic Pretax
Savings  Contribution  under  section 4.1.  Thus,  for example,  the  applicable
maximum  percentage  is nine  percent if the  Participant  is allowed to elect a
maximum Basic Pretax Savings  Contribution of six percent, and it is ten percent
if  the  Participant  is  allowed  to  elect  a  maximum  Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contribution of five percent.

     4.3 DEFERRAL ELECTION PROCEDURES. Each Participant (or Employee expected to
become a  Participant  within  the  next 90 days)  shall  make the  election  or
elections  described  in sections  4.1 and 4.2 by  completing  an election  form
obtained from the Committee.  The Employee shall return the election form to the
Committee  at least 30 days (or such  shorter  period as may be specified by the
Committee)  preceding  the  Entry  Date on  which  he/she  expects  to  become a
Participant.

     4.4  DEFERRAL  ELECTION  CHANGES. Elections made in accordance with section
4.3 shall  remain in effect  until a new  election to  increase or decrease  the
deferral percentage becomes effective.  Such new election must be filed at least
30 days (or such shorter period as may be specified by the  Committee)  prior to
the beginning of any payroll period in which the Participant  desires the change
to become  effective.  Any new election so filed shall  become  effective on the
first day of such payroll  period and shall remain in effect until changed under
the rules of this section 4.4.

     4.5  DISCONTINUANCE OF BASIC AND UNMATCHED PRETAX SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS.  A
Participant  may  discontinue   his/her  Basic  and  Unmatched   Pretax  Savings
Contributions  to the  Plan at any  time by  filing a  written  notice  with the
Committee  at least 15 days (or such  other  period as may be  specified  by the
Committee)  prior to the beginning of the payroll period in which he/she desires
the discontinuance to become effective.

Such  Participant   shall  thereafter  be  eligible  to  resume  Pretax  Savings
Contributions to the Plan,  provided that at least six months have elapsed since
the  effective  date of his/her prior  election to  discontinue  Pretax  Savings
Contributions,  upon filing a new election  form with the  Committee at least 30
days (or such shorter period as may be specified by the Committee)  prior to the
beginning of the payroll  period in which  he/she  desires  his/her  election to
become effective.

     4.6  SALARY REDUCTION. Each Participant who makes an election  described in
section 4.3 to have the Employer contribute a percentage of his/her Compensation
to this Plan shall,  by the act of making such  election,  agree to have his/her
pay reduced by an equivalent  percentage for so long as the election  remains in
effect.

     4.7 LIMITATION ON BASIC PRETAX SAVINGS  CONTRIBUTIONS  AND UNMATCHED PRETAX
SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS.  This Plan is not intended to permit Basic Pretax Savings
Contributions plus Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions for any calendar year,
with  respect to any  Participant,  in excess of $7,000 (or such other amount as
may at the time be prescribed under Code section 402(g)(5)). The Committee shall
prescribe  procedures  designed to prevent this limit from being exceeded and to
cause such  contributions  that have been elected by a Participant to be stopped
at any time during the year when this limit has been reached under the Plan. The
Committee  shall also adopt  reasonable  procedures to assist a  Participant  in
fulfilling  his/her  responsibility  of ensuring  that the Basic Pretax  Savings
Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions made on his/her behalf
for the Participant's taxable year do not exceed $7,000 (or such other amount as
may at the time be  prescribed  under Code  section  402(g)(5)),  less any other
elective deferrals (within the meaning of Code section 402(g)(3)) made on behalf
of the Participant. The Participant will be treated as having a calendar taxable
year and as having  no  elective  deferrals  other  than  Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions unless the Participant
notifies the Committee differently,  in writing, before the beginning of his/her
taxable year.

If the  Participant  notifies  the  Committee  in  writing no later than March l
following  his/her taxable year of the amount of any excess Basic Pretax Savings
Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions under this section for
such taxable year, the Plan may, but need not,  distribute  such excess (and any
income and  investment  gain or loss  allocable  to such excess) to him no later
than April 15 following  such taxable year and, if so  distributed,  such excess
shall  not be  included  as an  Annual  Addition  for  the  Participant  for the
immediately  preceding Plan Year. The  Participant's  income for the year of the
excess  Basic  Pretax  Savings   Contributions   and  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  (or, the year of  distribution or other year or years that may be
specified  pursuant to Treasury rules and regulations) shall be increased by the
amount  distributed  under this  section.  The  distribution  described  in this
section may be made  notwithstanding  any other Plan  provision.  The  Committee
shall adopt reasonable procedures for coordinating distributions of excess Basic
Pretax Savings  Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions  under
this section and section 4.8, in accordance  with any applicable  Treasury rules
and regulations.

     4.8 RESTRICTIONS ON ELECTIONS. In conjunction with Participant elections of
Basic Pretax Savings Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions or
at such other or additional  times throughout the Plan Year as the Committee may
determine,  the Committee shall require testing of the elections of Basic Pretax
Savings Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions by Participants
(and any other Employer  contributions that the Company elects to include in the
testing  under  the  conditions  specified  below) to  assure  that the  average
deferral percentage for the Plan Year of Participants who are Highly Compensated
Employees will not exceed the greater of:

          (a)  1.25 times the average  deferral  percentage for the Plan Year of
               all other Participants who are non-Highly  Compensated Employees,
               or

          (b)  the lesser of (i) 2 percentage  points more than, or (ii) 2 times
               the average  deferral  percentage  for the Plan Year of all other
               Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees.

For purposes of this section,  the term "average  deferral  percentage" for each
group of  Participants  for any period shall be the average of the  percentages,
calculated  separately  for each  Participant  in such group,  of the  aggregate
amount of Compensation  that each Participant  elects to have contributed to the
Plan for the period as Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions  or Unmatched  Pretax
Savings  Contributions.  As provided  in Section  5.4, if the Company so elects,
Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions  shall be added  to Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  and Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Contributions  in computing  each
Participant's  deferral  percentage.  In  addition,  the Company  may elect,  in
accordance  with such  regulations  as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury,  to aggregate Code section 401(m)  matching  contributions  (including
matching and discretionary  Company Contributions under this Plan) that meet the
withdrawal and vesting  requirements of Code sections  401(k)(2)(B) and (C) with
the Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions,  Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions
and  Qualified   Nonelective   Contributions  for  purposes  of  computing  each
Participant's  deferral percentage.  Except as provided in Treasury Regulations,
excess  Basic  Pretax  Savings   Contributions   and  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  under  section  4.7 shall be treated as an amount  elected  under
section 4.3 and contributed to the Plan, whether or not such excess contribution
is distributed.

Advance testing done under this section may be based on a  Participant's  annual
rate of  Compensation  in effect at the time of the test, and  corrections to be
made to  reduce  the  amount  in  excess  of the  maximum  permissible  deferral
percentage may be made from  Compensation  to be earned for the remainder of the
Plan Year.  Final Plan Year  compliance  with the  restrictions  of this section
shall be based on the Participant's actual Compensation and Basic Pretax Savings
Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions for the Plan Year.

If,  at the end of the  Plan  Year,  the  percentage  of  Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  and  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Contributions  elected by Highly
Compensated  Employees (and any other Company Contributions that are included in
the testing at the  Company's  election)  would (if not  distributed)  cause the
average deferral  percentage of such Participants to exceed the maximum deferral
percentage permitted for the Plan Year under this section,  then, before the end
of the following Plan Year, the excess amount of such  contributions (and income
and investment  gain or loss  attributable  thereto) for the Highly  Compensated
Employees  shall  be  distributed  to such  Participants  in the  order of their
average deferral  percentages,  beginning with the Highly Compensated  Employees
with the highest  average  deferral  percentage  until the  limitations  of this
section are met. The income and investment  gain or loss  attributable to excess
contributions  is that portion of the income and investment  gain or loss on the
Participant's  Account for the Plan Year that bears the same ratio as the excess
Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions  and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions
bear to the total  Account  balance,  determined  as of the last day of the Plan
Year. To the extent required by Code section 401(k) and related regulations, any
amount distributed under this paragraph to a Highly  Compensated  Employee shall
be included  in that  Employee's  taxable  wages for the Plan Year for which the
contribution  was made. The  distribution  described in this section may be made
notwithstanding  any other Plan provision.  The Committee shall adopt reasonable
procedures for  coordinating  distributions of excess  contributions  under this
section and section 4.7.

Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing rules, the Committee shall take steps to
ensure that this section 4.8 is  interpreted  and  administered  so as to comply
with  applicable  legal  requirements  for the  determination  of  what  amounts
constitute  excess Code section 401(k) elective  deferrals and for the return of
such excess  amounts  and any income and  investment  gain or loss  attributable
thereto. If two or more plans which include Code section 401(k) cash or deferred
arrangements  are considered as one plan for purposes of Code section  401(a)(4)
or 410(b),  the cash or  deferred  arrangements  included in such plans shall be
treated as one  arrangement  for  purposes  of this  section  4.8. If any Highly
Compensated  Employee  is a  participant  under  two or more  cash  or  deferred
arrangements of an Employer or Affiliate, all such cash or deferred arrangements
shall be treated as one such  arrangement for purposes of determining the actual
deferral  percentage with respect to such Employee.  No benefits other than Code
section 401(m)  matching  contributions  shall be conditioned on a Participant's
election of Basic  Pretax  Savings  Contributions  or Unmatched  Pretax  Savings
Contributions under this Plan.

     4.9  TRANSFER OF PRETAX SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS. Any amount to be contributed
to the Plan because of a Participant's  election and resulting  salary reduction
under sections 4.3 or 4.6, respectively,  shall be transferred to the Trust Fund
at such times as the Company may determine;  provided, however, that the amounts
so contributed for any payroll period shall be transferred to the Trust Fund not
later  than 30 days  after the end of the month in which  occurs the last day of
such payroll period.

     4.10  CREDITING OF PRETAX SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS.  Any amount contributed to
the Trust under section 4.1 or 4.2 on behalf of a Participant shall be credited,
as of the appropriate Valuation Date, to the Basic Pretax Savings Account or the
Unmatched  Pretax Savings Account,  as applicable,  of each Participant on whose
behalf the contribution was made.

     4.11  ADJUSTMENT  OF  COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS  ACCOUNT.  In the event that a
distribution  of excess Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions  is made pursuant to
section 4.7 or section 4.8 of the Plan, the Company  Contributions  Account will
be adjusted by the amount of any matching Company Contributions  previously made
and allocated to the Company Contributions Account that are attributable to such
excess Basic Pretax Savings Contributions (the "excess matching  contributions")
plus the income allocable to any such excess matching contributions.  The income
allocable  to the  excess  matching  contributions  shall be  determined  by the
Committee in accordance  with any method  permitted  under  Treasury  Regulation
sections  1.401(m)-1(e)(3) or  1.401(k)-1(f)(4)  as applicable.  Any such excess
matching  contributions  (and earnings  allocable thereto) will be forfeited and
reallocated among the unaffected Participant's Accounts,  pursuant to such rules
as shall be adopted by the  Committee,  provided that such  treatment is applied
uniformly  to all  Participants  under  the  Plan for the  Plan  Year  involved.
Alternatively   if  the  Company   chooses,   the   adjustment  of  the  Company
Contributions   Account  will  be  made  by  an  additional   matching   Company
Contribution,  allocated to the Company  Contributions  Accounts of Participants
who are not Highly Compensated Employees.


                         Article 5. Company Contributions
                         --------------------------------

     5.1 MATCHING  COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS.  For each Plan Year,  so long as this
Plan is in existence,  and subject to the  limitations  set forth in section 5.8
below,  the Employer  shall make a matching  Company  Contribution  on behalf of
every  Participant for whom a Basic Pretax Savings  Contribution was made to the
Plan under section 4.1. Any  contribution  made in accordance  with this section
5.1 may be made in the form of cash or Company  Securities in the  discretion of
the Board of Directors.

The matching  amount to be contributed on behalf of each  Participant  hereunder
shall  be  equal  to  a  specified   percentage  of  the  Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  made on behalf of a Participant  under section 4.1, as determined
by the Company's Board of Directors with respect to particular groups of

Participants,  and subject to compliance with any regulations under Code section
401(a)(26)  that  prohibit  separate  benefit  schedules  covering  less than 50
Participants  under  certain  circumstances.  The matching  percentage  shall be
specified in advance and shall  remain in effect  until  changed by the Board or
its delegate on a prospective basis.

The  amount  of  matching   Company   Contribution   allocable  to  the  Company
Contributions  Account of any  Participant in any Plan Year shall not exceed the
limitations  of section 5.3 or the  limitations of sections 5.8 through 5.10, as
determined  after  taking  into  account  the  amount  of Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contributions  and  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Contributions  deferred  by such
Participant for the Plan Year.

     5.2  DISCRETIONARY  COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS.  The Board of  Directors in its
discretion may authorize and require the Employer to make a Company Contribution
to  the  Trust  Fund  for a Plan  Year  in  addition  to  the  matching  Company
Contribution made under section 5.1. Any discretionary Company Contribution made
in  accordance  with this section 5.2 may be made in the form of cash or Company
Securities in the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The  contribution  made
under this section shall be allocated in one or a  combination  of the following
methods, as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine:

          (a)  discretionary  Company  Contributions  may  be  allocated  to the
               Company Contributions  Accounts of only those Active Participants
               for whom a Basic  Pretax  Savings  Contribution  was made for the
               Plan  Year  in the  proportion  that  the  Basic  Pretax  Savings
               Contribution of each such Active Participant for the Plan Year up
               to the effective date of the discretionary  Company  Contribution
               bears to the  total  of such  contributions  for all such  Active
               Participants  for the Plan Year up to the  effective  date of the
               discretionary Company Contribution, and/or

          (b)  discretionary  Company  Contributions  may  be  allocated  to the
               Company   Contribution   Accounts  of  all  Active   Participants
               (regardless  of whether or not they have deferred an amount under
               section  4.1) in the  proportion  that the  Compensation  of each
               Active  Participant for the Plan Year up to the effective date of
               the  discretionary   Company  Contribution  bears  to  the  total
               Compensation of all Active  Participants  for the Plan Year up to
               the effective  date of the  discretionary  Company  Contribution,
               and/or

          (c)  discretionary  Company  Contributions  may  be  allocated  to the
               Company Contributions  Accounts of only those Active Participants
               who are not covered by any other Company  incentive  compensation
               plan  ("qualified  participants"),  regardless  of whether or not
               such qualified participants have deferred an amount under Section
               4.1, in the proportion  that the  Compensation  of each qualified
               participant  for the Plan  Year up to the  effective  date of the
               discretionary  Company  Contribution  bears to the total  covered
               Compensation  of all qualified  participants  up to the effective
               date of the discretionary Company Contribution for the Plan Year,
               and/or

          (d)  discretionary  Company  contributions  may  be  allocated  to the
               Company Contributions  Accounts of only those Active Participants
               who do not meet the eligibility requirements for participation in
               the Del Webb Corporation  Deferred  Compensation Plan ("qualified
               participants"),  regardless  of  whether  or not  such  qualified
               participants  have  deferred an amount under  Section 4.1, in the
               proportion that the  Compensation  of each qualified  participant
               for the Plan Year up to the effective  date of the  discretionary
               Company  Contribution bears to the total covered  Compensation of
               all qualified  participants for the Plan Year up to the effective
               date of the Company Contribution.

          The amount of  discretionary  Company  Contribution  allocable  to the
          Company  Contributions  Account of any Active  Participant in any Plan
          Year shall not exceed the  limitations of section 5.8 through 5.10, as
          determined  after  taking  into  account  the  amount of Basic  Pretax
          Savings  Contributions,  Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions,  and
          matching Company Contributions  allocable to such Active Participant's
          Company Contributions Account for the Plan Year.

     5.3  RESTRICTIONS  ON  MATCHING  COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS  AND  DISCRETIONARY
COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS.  At such times throughout the Plan Year as the Committee
may  determine,   the  Committee  shall  require  testing  to  assure  that  the
contribution  percentage  for the  Plan  Year  of  Participants  who are  Highly
Compensated Employees will not exceed the greater of:

          (a)  1.25 times the  contribution  percentage for the Plan Year of all
               other Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees, or

          (b)  the lesser of (i) 2 percentage  points more than, or (ii) 2 times
               the  contribution  percentage  for the  Plan  Year  of all  other
               Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees.

For purposes of this section, the term "contribution  percentage" for each group
of Participants  shall be the average of the ratios,  calculated  separately for
each  Participant  in such  group,  of the  aggregate  amount  of  matching  and
discretionary  Company  Contributions  that are  allocated  pursuant  to section
5.2(a),  made by or on  behalf  of the  Participant  for the  Plan  Year to that
Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year. As provided in section 5.4, if the
Company so elects,  Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions  shall be added to the
matching  Company  Contributions  and the  discretionary  Company  Contributions
allocated  pursuant  to  section  5.2(a)  for the  Plan  Year  for  purposes  of
calculating the contribution percentages. In addition, the Company may elect, in
accordance  with such  regulations  as may be  prescribed  by the  Secretary  of
Treasury,  to consider Code section 401(k) elective  deferrals  (including Basic
Pretax Savings  Contributions and Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions to this
Plan) for purposes of calculating contribution percentages.

Advance  testing  under this  section may be based on a  Participant's  level of
Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions  and Unmatched Pretax Savings  Contributions
and his/her annual rate of  Compensation  in effect at the time of the test, and
corrections to be made to reduce the amount in excess of the maximum permissible
contribution  percentage  may be from Company  Contributions  to be made for the
remainder of the Plan Year.  Final Plan Year compliance with the restrictions of
this  section  shall be  based on the  Participant's  actual  contributions  and
Compensation for the Plan Year.

If,  at the  end  of the  Plan  Year,  the  contribution  percentage  of  Highly
Compensated Employees exceeds the maximum contribution  percentage permitted for
the Plan Year under this  section,  then  simultaneously,  before the end of the
following Plan Year:

          (1)  the excess  nonforfeitable  Company Contributions (and the income
               and  investment  gain or loss  attributable  thereto)  for Highly
               Compensated  Employees shall be distributed to such Participants,
               and

          (2)  the excess Company Contributions that are forfeitable pursuant to
               section 4.11 (and income and investment gain or loss attributable
               thereto) for Highly Compensated Employees shall be forfeited,  in
               the order of the  contribution  percentages of such  Participants
               beginning with the Highly  Compensated  Employee with the highest
               contribution percentage until the limitations of this section are
               met.  The  income and  investment  gain or loss  attributable  to
               excess  contributions  is that  portion of income and  investment
               gain or loss on the Participant's  Company  Contributions Account
               for the  Plan  Year  that  bears  the same  ratio  as the  excess
               contributions  bears to the total Company  Contributions  Account
               balance,  determined  as of the last day of the Plan Year. To the
               extent  required by Code section 401(m) and related  regulations,
               any  amount   distributed   under  this  paragraph  to  a  Highly
               Compensated Employee shall be included in that Employee's taxable
               wages for the Plan Year for which the  contribution was made. The
               distribution    described   in   this   section   may   be   made
               notwithstanding any other Plan provision.



In the event that this Plan satisfies the  requirements of section 410(b) of the
Code only if  aggregated  with one or more other plans,  or if one or more other
plans satisfy the  requirements of section 410(b) of the Code only if aggregated
with this  Plan,  then this  section  5.3 shall be applied  by  determining  the
contribution  percentages of eligible  Participants  as if all such plans were a
single plan. If a Highly Compensated Employee  participates in two or more plans
of an Employer  or  Affiliate  to which such  contributions  are made,  all such
contributions shall be aggregated for purposes of this section.

Any  Employee  required  to be  taken  into  consideration  under  Code  section
401(m)(5) shall be treated as an eligible  Employee in accordance with such Code
section for  purposes of the  application  of this section  5.3.  Moreover,  the
determination of excess contributions under this section 5.3 shall be made after
first  determining  the excess  deferrals  (within the  meaning of Code  section
402(g))  pursuant  to section 4.7 of this Plan and then  determining  the excess
Code  section  401(k)  deferrals  pursuant  to  section  4.8 of this  Plan.  All
determinations  under this section 5.3 shall comply with Code section 401(m) and
the regulations  thereunder,  including any such regulations as may be necessary
to prevent the multiple use of the  alternative  percentage  limitations in Code
sections  401(k)(3)(A)(ii)(II)  and 401(m)(2)(A)(ii)  with respect to any Highly
Compensated  Employee  and also  including  regulations  permitting  appropriate
aggregation of plans and contributions.

The foregoing requirement to correct multiple use of the alternative  percentage
limitations (by first reducing excess Code section 401(k) deferrals  pursuant to
Plan section 4.8) applies to all Highly  Compensated  Employees who are eligible
for both Code section  401(k)  deferrals  under  Article 4 and matching  Company
Contributions under Article 5. This requirement  accordingly extends to all such
Employees  who are active  Participants  in the Plan at any time during the Plan
Year. In addition, if a matching Company Contribution for a Participant who is a
Highly  Compensated  Employee  is made on  account  of a  Basic  Pretax  Savings
Contribution that must be returned to such Participant as an amount in excess of
a limit specified in Article 4 (whether or not multiple use has occurred),  such
matching  Company  Contribution  shall be  forfeited  pursuant  to Code  section
411(a)(3)(G) and the forfeiture shall be used to reduce concurrent or subsequent
matching Company Contributions. If such matching Company Contribution is also in
excess of the  amount  permitted  by the  contribution  percentage  test in this
section 5.3, the first  corrective  step shall be the  correction  of the excess
Basic Pretax  Savings  Contribution  pursuant to Article 4 and the forfeiture of
any related matching Company Contribution. The second corrective step shall then
be the distribution of any remaining excess matching  Contribution  that exceeds
the contribution percentage limit of this section 5.3 and has not been forfeited
in the first step.

     5.4 CORRECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS. In accordance with such regulations as may be
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,  the Company may elect to treat any
or all of the discretionary  Company  Contributions made pursuant to section 5.2
as  Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions  for  purposes of  complying  with the
average  deferral  percentage  requirements  of section  4.8,  the  contribution
percentage requirements of section 5.3, or both.

In accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury,  the Company also may elect to make additional  Qualified  Nonelective
Contributions on behalf of Active  Participants  who are not Highly  Compensated
Employees  in an amount  sufficient  to  satisfy  either  the  average  deferral
percentage requirements of section 4.8, the contribution percentage requirements
of section 5.3, or both. Such  additional  Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions
shall  be  allocated  to the  Company  Contribution  Accounts  of  those  Active
Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees in the proportion that the
Compensation of each such Active  Participant bears to the total Compensation of
all such Active Participants for the relevant Plan Year.

If an Eligible  Employee is  inadvertently  excluded from  participation  in the
Plan, the Company shall make special  Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions  and
special  discretionary  Company  Contributions  to the  Plan  on  behalf  of the
Eligible Employee.  The special Qualified Nonelective  Contributions shall be in
an amount equal to the sum of (i) the average deferral  percentage for the group
of  non-Highly   Compensated  Employee  Participants  or  the  group  of  Highly
Compensated  Employee  Participants  (depending on whether the Eligible Employee
was a Highly Compensate  Employee) for the Plan Year or Plan Years that includes
the period or periods  during  which the  Eligible  Employee  was  inadvertently
excluded from participation  multiplied by the Eligible Employee's  Compensation
for the same period or periods; and (ii) the matching Company Contributions that
would  have  been  made  pursuant  to  section  5.1  if  the  Eligible  Employee
contributed  the amount  referred to in clause (i) on a pretax  basis during the
relevant  period or periods.  The  special  discretionary  Company  Contribution
called for by this  paragraph  shall be in an amount equal to the  discretionary
Company  Contribution  or  Contributions  that would have been  allocated to the
Eligible  Employee  had he not been  excluded.  The  Company  also  shall make a
special discretionary Company Contribution on behalf of the Eligible Employee in
an  amount  equal to the  annual  rate of  return  on Plan  investments  for the
relevant  Plan  Year  or Plan  Years  multiplied  by the  amounts  of  Qualified
Nonelective  Contributions or discretionary  Company Contributions made pursuant
to this paragraph, adjusted to reflect partial years.

The Qualified Nonelective Contributions made pursuant to the preceding paragraph
shall be  allocated to the Account or Accounts to which the  contributions  they
are  replacing  would have been  allocated.  For  example,  the  portion of such
Qualified Nonelective Contribution that would have been characterized as a Basic
Pretax Savings  Contribution if it had been made by the Eligible Employee during
the relevant  Plan Year will be allocated to the Basic Pretax  Savings  Account.
The special discretionary Company Contribution shall be allocated to the Company
Contribution  Account  to the  extent  that the  special  discretionary  Company
Contribution is replacing a discretionary  Company Contribution that should have
previously been made. The special  discretionary  Company  Contribution  that is
replacing Plan  investment  earnings shall be allocated to the Accounts to which
the  contributions  to  which  the  Plan  investment  earnings  relate  would be
allocated.

All  contributions  made pursuant to this section are subject to the limitations
of section 5.12. To the extent that the limitations of said section preclude the
making  of the full  special  Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions  or the full
special discretionary Company Contributions called for by the third paragraph of
this  section,  the balance of the special  contributions  will be made in later
years  subject to the  limitations  of section 5.12.  The special  discretionary
Company  Contribution that is intended to replace Plan investment earnings shall
be  adjusted  to  reflect  Plan  investment  earnings  on the  balance  of  said
contribution for the period of time during which contributions are limited.

In accordance with Treasury Regulations section  1.415-6(b)(2),  for purposes of
applying  the  limitations  of sections 5.8 through 5.11 of the Plan and section
415 of the Code, Qualified  Nonelective  Contributions and discretionary Company
Contributions  made in  accordance  with this section 5.4 will not be considered
Annual  Additions with respect to the  Participant  for the  limitation  year in
which said  contributions  are made,  but,  rather,  will be  considered  Annual
Additions  in  the  limitation   year  to  which  such   contributions   relate.
Furthermore, to the extent a discretionary Company Contribution made pursuant to
this section is intended to replace investment earnings,  it will not be treated
as an Annual Addition for any limitation year.

     5.5  TRANSFER  OF COMPANY  CONTRIBUTIONS.  Matching  Company  Contributions
described in section 5.1 shall  normally be transferred to the Trust Fund at the
same time Participant Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions are transferred to the
Trust Fund and in any event shall be  transferred to the Trust Fund prior to the
due date of the  Company's  federal  income  tax  return  (including  extensions
thereof)  for the taxable  year  coinciding  with such Plan Year.  Discretionary
Company Contributions described in section 5.2 shall be transferred to the Trust
Fund at such time as the  Committee  may determine but in no event shall they be
transferred  to the Trust Fund later than the due date of the Company's  federal
income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year coinciding
with such Plan Year.

     5.6 ALLOCATION OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS  ACCOUNTS.
Matching Company Contributions and discretionary Company Contributions described
in sections 5.1 and 5.2 shall be allocated to the Company Contributions Accounts
of  Participants,  as of the  appropriate  Valuation  Date to which it  relates,
provided  that in no event  shall such  contributions  be treated as having been
made or allocated as of a date later than the last day of the Plan Year to which
they relate.

     5.7  FORFEITURES.   The  nonvested  portion  of  a  Participant's   Company
Contributions  Account  shall be forfeited in  accordance  with section 6.3. The
Committee shall use forfeitures  occurring in any Plan Year to reduce subsequent
Company Contributions for such Plan Year and future Plan Years. If the amount of
forfeitures occurring in a Plan Year exceeds the amount of Company Contributions
for such year, then the excess shall be held in a separate account and allocated
to the extent that it reduces Company Contributions in succeeding Plan Years. No
Company Contributions shall be made while such a separate account exists, and if
the Plan  terminates  while such account is in  existence,  the balance shall be
allocated  under section  5.2(b) not to exceed the  limitations  of sections 5.8
through 5.10.

     5.8  LIMITATION  ON  ANNUAL  ADDITIONS.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the
contrary  contained in this Plan, the total Annual  Additions to be allocated to
the Accounts of a Participant for any Plan Year shall not exceed an amount equal
to the lesser of:

     (a)  $30,000 (or such greater amount as may be permitted under Code section
          415(c)(1)(A)) or

     (b)  25 percent of the Participant's Compensation for the limitation year.

     5.9 OTHER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. If the Company is contributing to any
other defined  contribution  plan, as defined in section 414(i) of the Code, for
its Employees,  some or all of whom are Participants of this Plan, then any such
Participant's  Annual Addition shall be aggregated with amounts  credited to the
Participant  under the other plan for purposes of applying the  limitations  and
reducing allocations under such other plan.

     5.10  DEFINED  BENEFIT  PLANS.  If a  Participant  in  this  Plan is also a
Participant in a defined benefit plan, as defined in section 414(j) of the Code,
to  which  contributions  are  made by the  Employer,  then in  addition  to the
limitations  contained in section 5.8 of this Plan, the projected benefit of the
Participant  under the  defined  benefit  plan  shall be  limited  to the extent
necessary to comply with the limitation set forth in section 415(e) of the Code.

     5.11 ADJUSTING  ANNUAL  ADDITIONS.  If at any time during the Plan Year the
Plan Administrator anticipates that the contributions to a Participant's Account
will exceed the limitations of section 5.8, the Plan Administrator may limit the
Participant's  ability to make Unmatched  Pretax Savings  Contributions  for the
remainder of the Plan Year. If after  application of the preceding  sentence the
Plan Administrator anticipates that the limitations of section 5.8 will still be
exceeded,  the Plan  Administrator may limit the  Participant's  ability to make
Basic Pretax  Savings  Contributions  for the remainder of the Plan Year. If the
limitation  of section 5.8 cannot be met by limiting  future  Unmatched or Basic
Pretax Savings  Contributions in this manner,  or, if the limitations of section
5.8 have been exceeded by  contributions  already made,  the Plan  Administrator
also shall take the following steps to limit Annual Additions:

     (a)  First, the Plan Administrator  shall distribute to the Participant all
          or a portion of the Unmatched Pretax Savings Contributions made by the
          Participant to the extent necessary to reduce the Participant's Annual
          Additions to the maximum  amount  permitted  by section 5.8.  Earnings
          attributable   to  any   such   "excess   Unmatched   Pretax   Savings
          Contributions"  also  shall be  distributed  to the  Participant.  The
          earnings   allocable   to  any   excess   Unmatched   Pretax   Savings
          Contributions  shall  be  determined  by  the  Plan  Administrator  in
          accordance with any method permitted under Treasury Regulation section
          1.401(k)-1(f)(4).

     (b)  Second, if after the application of paragraph (a) the Annual Additions
          continue  to  exceed  the   limitations   of  section  5.8,  the  Plan
          Administrator  shall distribute to the Participant all or a portion of
          the Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions made by the Participant to the
          extent necessary to reduce the  Participant's  Annual Additions to the
          maximum amount permitted by section 5.8. Earnings attributable to such
          "excess Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions" also shall be distributed
          to the  Participant.  The  earnings  attributable  to any excess Basic
          Pretax  Savings   Contributions   shall  be  determined  by  the  Plan
          Administrator  in accordance with any method  permitted under Treasury
          Regulation section 1.401(k)-1(f)(4).  No matching Company Contribution
          will be made  with  respect  to  Basic  Pretax  Savings  Contributions
          distributed to a Participant  pursuant to this paragraph.  If matching
          Company   Contributions   have   been  made  and   allocated   to  the
          Participant's   Account   before  the  excess  Basic  Pretax   Savings
          Contributions  have  been  identified,  the Plan  Administrator  shall
          reallocate the matching  Company  Contributions  attributable  to such
          excess Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions to a suspense account.  The
          amounts  allocated  to  the  suspense  account  shall  be  held  to be
          allocated  on a  first-in-first-out  basis in  reduction  of  matching
          Company Contributions due in future Plan Years prior to the allocation
          of additional matching Company  Contributions.  In deciding the amount
          of Basic Pretax  Savings  Contributions  that must be  distributed  in
          accordance with this paragraph, the Plan Administrator shall take into
          consideration that no matching Company  Contributions will be made (or
          if previously made, will be reallocated), with respect to excess Basic
          Pretax Savings  Contributions that will be distributed. 

     (c)  Third,  if further  limitation is required  after the  application  of
          paragraphs  (a) and (b), the Plan  Administrator  shall  allocate to a
          suspense  account  all  or a  portion  of  the  discretionary  Company
          Contributions  made  on  behalf  of  the  Participant  to  the  extent
          necessary to reduce the Participant's  Annual Additions to the maximum
          amount permitted by section 5.8.  Discretionary  Company Contributions
          allocated to the suspense  account  shall be held to be allocated on a
          first-in-first-out   basis  in  reduction  of  discretionary   Company
          Contributions  prior to the  allocation  of  additional  discretionary
          Company Contributions in future Plan Years.
                                                                               
     (d)  Further  reductions or adjustments to the methods  described above for
          adjusting  the Accounts of  Participants  may be made  pursuant to the
          directions  of the  Plan  Administrator  and may be made  pursuant  to
          priorities established under related defined contribution plans.
                                                  
     5.12 DEDUCTIBILITY LIMITATION.  The dollar amount of Company Contributions,
as provided  under  sections  5.1,  5.2 and 5.4,  shall be limited to the amount
deductible  under  section 404 of the Code for the  taxable  year for which such
contributions are paid.
                                                               
     5.13 ROLLOVER  CONTRIBUTIONS  AND PRIOR ACCOUNT  TRANSFERS.  As provided in
section  2.1(a)(5),  this Plan may include amounts  transferred  directly to the
Prior  Account  of a  Participant.  In  addition,  subject  to  the  Committee's
approval,  amounts  which an  Eligible  Employee  has  received  from any  other
employee  benefit plan may, in  accordance  with  uniform and  nondiscriminatory
procedures  adopted by the  Committee,  be  transferred by such Employee to this
Plan, and if transferred,  shall constitute such Employee's  "Rollover  Account"
hereunder: provided the following conditions are satisfied:

     (a)  The amounts tendered must have been received by the Employee from:

          (l)  A plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code; or

          (2)  An individual  retirement account or annuity ("IRA"),  containing
               amounts  described in section  408(d)(3)(A)(ii)  of the Code,  to
               which no deductible IRA  contributions  were made, or rolled over
               from a qualified plan.

     (b)  The amounts tendered must not include amounts attributable to:

          (1)  After-tax contributions to a qualified plan by the Employee;

          (2)  Deductible IRA contributions; or

          (3)  A partial  distribution  from a qualified  plan which is eligible
               for rollover to an IRA but not to another qualified plan.

     (c)  In no event  will a  transfer  to an  Employee's  Rollover  Account be
          permissible  if it would cause this Plan to become a  transferee  plan
          that is subject to the qualified plan survivor annuity requirements of
          the Code with respect to the Employee.

     (d)  The transfer to this Plan of amounts  described in paragraph  (a) will
          only be  accepted  if the  Employee  presents  to the  Committee  such
          information  as the Committee  may require to administer  the rules of
          this section 5.13 and to maintain  the  qualified  status of the Plan.
          Such information may include the Federal Form 1099, or equivalent, and
          the original distribution check, or a copy thereof.

     (e)  Amounts must be received by the Committee not later than 60 days after
          the distribution was received by the Employee.

The Committee shall establish such  procedures,  and may require such additional
information from the Employee, as it deems necessary or appropriate to determine
that a proposed  transfer  hereunder will satisfy the above  requirements.  Upon
approval by the Committee, rollover amounts shall be transmitted to the Trustee,
to be invested in such Investment Funds as the Employee may select in accordance
with such rules as are provided in Article 7.

No matching or discretionary Company Contributions shall be made with respect to
rollovers or amounts transferred to a Participant's Prior Account hereunder.

The  Committee  shall  not be  required  to  permit  any  rollover  amount to be
transferred to or held under this Plan if the Committee determines,  in its sole
discretion, that acceptance of any such rollover amount may adversely affect the
continued  qualification  of this  Plan or may  subject  the Plan to  burdensome
additional   requirements  for  continued   qualification,   including   without
limitation any requirement to provide a spousal  survivor annuity or other forms
of distribution that are not otherwise available under the Plan.

An Employee who transfers a rollover  amount into this Plan shall be eligible to
commence  Pretax Savings to this Plan only when he/she  satisfies the applicable
eligibility requirements in section 3.1.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  on and  after  January  1,  1993,  a  rollover
contribution  under this section shall,  to the extent  required by Code section
402 (c),  include  and be  limited to a  contribution  relating  to an  eligible
rollover distribution  described in Code section 402 (c) (4), including a direct
rollover or a sixty-day  rollover of such eligible  rollover  distribution.  The
Committee may establish other uniform rules and procedures,  consistent with the
requirements  of the Code and this section 5.13,  concerning  the  acceptance of
rollover  contributions,  including  rules that limit or prohibit wire transfers
and other payments that are made directly to this Plan from another plan in lieu
of having the  Participant  receive a check  payable to this Plan's  Trustee for
delivery  to a  Plan  representative  who  is  authorized  to  receive  rollover
contributions.


                          Article 6. Vesting and Benefits
                          -------------------------------


     6.1 VESTING.  The interest of a Participant in his/her Basic Pretax Savings
Account,  Unmatched Pretax Savings Account,  Prior Account, and Rollover Account
(if any) shall be fully vested at all times,  and his/her  rights and  interests
therein shall not be forfeitable  for any reason.  The interest of a Participant
in his/her Company Contributions Account shall be fully vested in him/her at all
times if the  Participant  has ever received credit for an Hour of Service on or
after April 1, 1988.  If a  Participant  terminated  employment  before April 1,
1988, his/her vested interest in his/her Company  Contributions Account shall be
determined  in  accordance  with the Plan  provisions  in  effect  when  his/her
employment terminated.

     6.2 BENEFITS UPON  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Every  Participant who has a
termination  of employment  for any reason other than death or disability  shall
have the value of his/her Basic Pretax Savings Account, Unmatched Pretax Savings
Account,  Prior Account,  Frozen Account,  and Rollover Account,  and the vested
portion  of his/her  Company  Contributions  Account,  distributed  pursuant  to
section 8.1, in either:

          (a)  one lump sum within the time set forth in section 6.7; or

          (b)  substantially  equal monthly,  quarterly,  or annual installments
               (as  selected  by the  Participant).  The first such  installment
               shall be  payable  within  60 days  after the end of the month in
               which  occurs  the  last  day  such  Participant  is  paid by the
               Company,  unless  such  Participant  elects to defer  receipt  of
               his/her  benefits as provided in section 6.7.  Such  Participant,
               may specify the number of  installments  to be paid each year and
               the  number  of  years,   not  to  exceed  10,   over  which  the
               installments will be paid;  provided,  however,  that the balance
               remaining  in  a  Participant's   Accounts  at  the  end  of  the
               designated  installment payout period shall be distributed on the
               last payment; and provided,  further, that the Account balance of
               such Participant shall be fully  distributed  within the lifetime
               of  such  Participant  or the  lifetimes  of the  Participant  or
               his/her Beneficiary,  or within a period not extending beyond the
               life  expectancy of the Participant or the life expectancy of the
               Participant and his/her Beneficiary.

               The Account  balance of a Participant  who has elected to receive
               an   installment   distribution   shall  be   invested   per  the
               Participant's instructions.  Should such a Participant die before
               all  of  his/her  installment  payments  have  been  distributed,
               his/her  Beneficiary  shall  receive the remainder of such unpaid
               installments  in one  lump sum as soon as  practicable  and in no
               event later than one year.

     6.3  FORFEITURE OF CONTINGENT  INTERESTS.  The provisions of the Plan as in
effect on December 31, 1986,  shall  govern  forfeitures  occurring on or before
that  date.  The  following  provisions  shall  govern  forfeitures  that  occur
thereafter  as  well  as any  reinstatements  that  may  be  required  for  such
forfeitures.  Any portion of a Participant's  Company Contributions Account that
is not vested under the  provisions of section 6.1 upon his/her  termination  of
employment shall be held in a separate Company  Contributions  Account and shall
be forfeited as of the earlier of (i) a distribution of the Participant's vested
Account  balance,  or (ii) the Valuation Date next following the passage of five
consecutive  years during which the  Participant  has not received credit for at
least one Hour of Service.  If the  Participant  is rehired as an  Employee  and
receives credit for an Hour of Service before the passage of the number of years
specified in clause (ii) of the foregoing  sentence,  then the  following  rules
shall  apply.  Any  unforfeited  amount  held in his/her  Company  Contributions
Account shall remain to his/her  credit and/or any previously  forfeited  amount
shall be restored to his/her Company Contributions Account by means of a special
Employer  contribution or a special allocation out of forfeitures  available for
reallocation,  as determined by the Committee.  Prior to the Participant's  full
vesting  thereafter,  the amount of any  subsequent  distribution  from  his/her
Company  Contributions  Account on any later  termination of employment shall be
determined by adding to his/her Company  Contributions Account the amount of the
previous distribution,  multiplying this total by his/her vested percentage, and
then  subtracting  from  the  resulting  product  the  amount  of  the  previous
distribution.

     6.4  DISABILITY.  A  Participant  who becomes  disabled  while still in the
service  of the  Company  or an  Affiliate  and who is  entitled  to  disability
payments under the Del Webb  Corporation  Long Term  Disability  Plan (LTD Plan)
shall  have  his/her  Account  balance,  valued  as  provided  in  section  8.1,
distributed to him in the form of a single lump sum as soon as  practicable  and
in no event later than three  months  after the end of the  calendar  quarter in
which the  Participant  is last paid by the  Company,  unless  such  Participant
elects to defer receipt of his/her Account balance as provided in section 6.7. A
Participant who becomes disabled but who is not entitled to disability  payments
from the LTD Plan,  however,  shall have the option of receiving his/her Account
balance  in the form of a single  lump sum or in  installments  as  provided  in
section 6.2.

For purposes of this Article,  "disability"  shall mean (l) a physical or mental
condition  which,  in the  judgment of the  Committee,  based on such  competent
medical evidence as the Committee may require,  renders an individual  unable to
engage in any substantial  gainful  activity for the Company for which he/she is
reasonably  fitted by education,  training or experience and which impairment is
likely to result in death or to be of long continued duration for a period of at
least 12 months, or (2) a judicial declaration of incompetence.

     6.5 DEATH BENEFITS.  Should a Participant die while still in the service of
the Company or an Affiliate,  said deceased  Participant's Account balance shall
be distributed  pursuant to section 8.1 to the Participant's  Beneficiary in the
form of a single lump sum as soon as practicable  and in no event later than the
latest date  specified  in section 6.7 for the  distribution  of benefits  whose
payments have not commenced as of the Participant's date of death.

     6.6  DESIGNATION OF  BENEFICIARY.  Subject to the  requirements  of section
2.1(g),  a Participant may designate,  in writing,  the Beneficiary  whom he/she
desires to receive  the  benefits  provided  by the Plan in the event of his/her
death.  Such designation  shall be filed on a form provided by the Committee for
that purpose. A Participant may change his/her designated  Beneficiary from time
to time without the consent of anyone other than his/her  spouse by filing a new
designation in writing with the Committee.

     6.7 LATEST TIME FOR PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  To comply with legal restrictions
on the deferral of benefit  commencement,  all benefit payments must comply with
the following limits,  notwithstanding  any other provisions of the Plan. If the
Participant dies before the  distribution of benefits,  distribution of benefits
to the  deceased  Participant's  spouse must be made by April 1 of the Plan Year
following the Plan Year in which the Participant  would have reached age 70-1/2,
and  distribution of benefits to any other  Beneficiary  must be made within one
year after the  Participant's  death (or such later date as may be prescribed by
regulations).  If a  Participant  is still  living,  then unless  he/she  elects
otherwise  in  accordance   with  an  option   permitted  under  the  Plan,  the
distribution  of  benefits  to him shall occur not later than the 60th day after
the close of the Plan Year in which  occurs the latest of (i) the  Participant's
termination of employment,  (ii) the tenth  anniversary of the year in which the
Participant commenced participation in the Plan, or (iii) the Participant's 65th
birthday.

Moreover,  (a) if the  Participant is a 5-percent  owner,  as defined in section
13.2, in any calendar year during which or after he/she  attains age 66-1/2,  or
(b) if the  Participant  attains  age  70-1/2  after  December  31,  1987,  then
distribution of the  Participant's  vested Account must occur not later than the
April l following the calendar year in which the Participant  attains age 70-1/2
even if the  Participant  has not incurred a  termination  of employment by such
date. For this purpose,  the  distribution of the  Participant's  vested account
means the payment of the entire vested balance in a lump sum in accordance  with
subsection  6.7(a),  except that an installment  distribution  under  subsection
6.7(b) shall  continue in the form in which it was elected if it started  before
the Code section 401(a)(9)  required beginning date and its continuation in this
manner will comply with the minimum  distribution  requirements  of Code section
401(a)(9).  Except for such  continuing  installments,  recent  additions to the
Participant's  Account that have not been included in a prior distribution shall
be  distributed  in a lump sum on or before each December 31 due date  following
the  April 1 on which  distributions  are  required  to begin  pursuant  to this
paragraph and Code section  401(a)(9).  All  distributions  under this paragraph
shall comply with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations
thereunder.

If for any reason the amount which is required to be paid cannot be  ascertained
on the date payment would be due hereunder, payment shall be made not later than
90 days  after the  earliest  date on which the  amount of such  payment  can be
ascertained.

     6.8   IN-SERVICE   DISTRIBUTION   OF   PRETAX   SAVINGS   AT  AGE   59-1/2.
Notwithstanding  any other  provisions  in the Plan to the  contrary,  an Active
Participant who has attained age 59-1/2 may elect, in accordance with such rules
as the Committee may prescribe, to have the vested value of his/her Basic Pretax
Savings  Account,   Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Account,  Company  Contributions
Account, Prior Account,  Frozen Account, and Rollover Account distributed to him
pursuant  to section  8.1 as of the end of any month on or after the date he/she
attains age 59-1/2 in the form of a single lump sum.

     6.9 HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS.

          (a)  Any Participant shall be permitted to make a cash withdrawal,  in
               any  whole  percentage  increment  or  dollar  amount,  up to 100
               percent  of the  amount  in the  Participant's  Unmatched  Pretax
               Savings  Account,  Basic Pretax  Savings  Account  (exclusive  of
               earnings  on such  amounts for  withdrawals  after  December  31,
               1988),  and the vested portion of his/her  Company  Contributions
               Account  (except that for  withdrawals  after  December 31, 1983,
               Company  Contributions,  which  have  been  used to  satisfy  the
               testing requirements of sections 4.8 or 5.3, and earnings thereon
               shall not be eligible for withdrawal),  provided that the minimum
               amount of a withdrawal under this section 6.9 shall be $1,000. No
               Participant  shall be  permitted  to  withdraw  any  amount  from
               his/her Prior Account,  Frozen Account,  or Rollover  Account.  A
               Participant  wishing to withdraw any amount hereunder shall do so
               by  making   application   therefor  which  demonstrates  to  the
               satisfaction  of the Committee that the Participant is confronted
               by a financial hardship.

          (b)  Subject to subparagraph (a) of this section 6.9, withdrawals must
               be made of all amounts in each  available  category below (listed
               in descending  order) before  amounts in a lower  category may be
               withdrawn:

               (1)      Unmatched Pretax Savings Account

               (2)      Basic Pretax Savings Account

               (3)      Company Contributions Account

          (c)  Application  for  withdrawals  shall be made on such forms as the
               Committee prescribes and may be made at any time. Distribution of
               withdrawals  shall be made in  accordance  with  section  8.1 and
               shall  be  paid  in a lump  sum as  soon  as is  administratively
               possible following such application.

          (d)  For purposes of this section 6.9, "financial  hardship",  means a
               hardship  occurring  in the  personal  affairs  of a  Participant
               because of:

               (1)  Illness  of the  Participant  or any of  his/her  dependents
                    resulting  in  significant   expenses  not  covered  by  the
                    Participant's medical benefit plan;

               (2)  Need for the  purchase  of/or  substantial  renovation  of a
                    Participant's primary residence;

               (3)  The education of the Participant,  the Participant's  spouse
                    or children; or

               (4)  Family emergencies.
                                                
               The  amount  of any  distribution  under  this  section  shall be
               limited to the amount  necessary to defray the  hardship  expense
               which is not  reasonably  available  from other  sources  and not
               covered by any other  employee  benefit  plan  maintained  by the
               Company or an  Affiliate.  For this  purpose,  the  Committee may
               accept the written  statement  of the  Participant  as to his/her
               financial resources unless it has reason to believe the statement
               is in error.  In addition,  effective  January l, 1989,  hardship
               withdrawals  shall be further limited to prevent the distribution
               of earnings on Basic Pretax Savings  Contributions  and Unmatched
               Pretax  Savings   Contributions  to  Participants  who  have  not
               attained  age  59-1/2,  and also to prevent the  distribution  of
               earnings  on Company  Contributions  to the extent  necessary  to
               satisfy the withdrawal  restrictions of Code section 401(k)(2)(B)
               in the event that such  Company  Contributions  have been used to
               satisfy the average  deferral  percentage  test of section 4.8 or
               the contribution percentage test of section 5.3.

               The foregoing notwithstanding,  the Committee shall not approve a
               hardship  withdrawal  for any of the  reasons  listed  under this
               paragraph (d) unless such hardship  withdrawal  complies with the
               applicable regulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury.

               The  amount  of any  distribution  under  this  section  shall be
               limited to the amount  necessary to defray the  hardship  expense
               which is not reasonably  available from other  reasonably  liquid
               assets from other sources outside the Plan. For this purpose, the
               Committee  may accept the written  statement  of the  Participant
               stating the nature of his/her immediate and heavy financial need,
               his/her  financial  resources,  and the fact  that the  amount of
               withdrawal  requested  is not  reasonably  available  from  other
               resources.



     6.10 DEBITING OF  INVESTMENT  FUNDS.  If a  Participant  making less than a
total  withdrawal of his/her  Accounts  under section 6.8 and/or 6.9 has his/her
Accounts  invested in more than one Investment  Fund, the amount  withdrawn from
such Accounts  shall be debited  against each of the  Investment  Funds in which
such Accounts are invested pro rata.

     6.11 LOANS TO  PARTICIPANTS.  The Committee  has  instituted a loan program
whereby, upon written application of a Participant, the Committee may permit the
Plan to make a loan to such  Participant,  provided  that all loans shall comply
with such rules and  regulations  as the Committee may establish for making Plan
loans and with the following terms and conditions:

          (a)  Loans  shall  be  made  available,  on  a  nondiscriminatory  and
               reasonably  equivalent  basis,  to  all  Participants,   who  are
               actively employed by the Company or are otherwise  required to be
               eligible  for  loans  under  the Code or ERISA  because  of their
               status as  disqualified  persons or parties in interest.  No loan
               shall be granted to a Participant who has a currently outstanding
               loan or a prior  loan  that  has not  been  repaid  in full for a
               period of at least  three full  months  prior to the month of the
               loan.

          (b)  A  Participant,  who  receives a loan from the Plan,  must sign a
               note  payable  to  the  Trust  in  the  proper  amount  on a form
               prescribed by the Committee and authorize payroll  deductions for
               payment of interest  and  principal  during any period of his/her
               employment as an Employee in accordance with  procedures  adopted
               by  the   Committee.   The  loan  shall  be   evidenced   by  the
               Participant's   promissory  note  and  shall  be  secured  by  an
               assignment  of  the  Participant's  vested  interest  in  his/her
               Accounts and such additional collateral as the Committee may deem
               necessary, provided that in no event shall the loan be secured by
               an assignment of more than 50% of the Participant's  vested (non-
               forfeitable) interest in his/her Accounts. In determining whether
               a pledge of additional  collateral  is  necessary,  the Committee
               shall consider the Participant's credit worthiness and the impact
               on the Plan in the event of  default  under the loan prior to the
               Participant's  benefit  commencement date. To secure repayment of
               the loan, the Participant shall,  within the 90-day period before
               the loan is made, consent to any distribution  resulting from the
               setoff  of the loan  against  the  Participant's  Accounts  under
               subsection  (g).  Any loan  processing  fee  (charged by a person
               other than the  Company)  shall be  deducted  from the  principal
               amount available to the Participant.

          (c)  The  amount of the loan  shall not be less than  $1,000  nor more
               than the least of:

               (1)  $50,000, reduced by the highest outstanding balance of loans
                    to the  Participant  from the Plan during the 1-year  period
                    ending on the day the loan is made;

               (2)  50   percent   of  the   vested   balance  in  all  of  such
                    Participant's Accounts at the time of the loan; or

               (3)  100 percent of the  Participant's  vested  balance in all of
                    such  Participant's  Accounts  (excluding  any  balances  in
                    his/her Prior Account,  Frozen Account, or Rollover Account)
                    at the time of the loan.

                    If such Participant is also covered under another  qualified
                    plan  maintained  by  the  Company  or  an  Affiliate,   the
                    limitations of clauses (1) and (2) above shall be applied as
                    though all such qualified plans are one plan.

          (d)  The  repayment  period  for any loan shall be  determined  by the
               Committee  and shall not  extend  beyond  five  years;  provided,
               however,  that if the Participant can show, by proof satisfactory
               to the  Committee,  that the  loan  will be used to  acquire  any
               dwelling unit which,  within a reasonable  time, is to be used as
               the principal  residence of the Participant (a "Home Loan"), then
               the  repayment  period  may  extend  to 15 years.  Moreover,  the
               Committee may,  under uniform rules,  limit the duration of loans
               to a shorter period than the maximum  periods  specified above so
               that,  for  example,  the Plan does not grant any Home  Loans and
               grants  regular  loans  for a  maximum  duration  of 54 months to
               part-time  Employees or 30 months to Seasonal  Employees so as to
               comply with the foregoing  maximum  limits while allowing for the
               possible effect of repayment  suspensions during unpaid leaves of
               absence.

          (e)  Each loan shall bear a reasonable  interest rate as determined by
               the Committee in accordance with the Code,  ERISA, and applicable
               rulings  and  regulations.  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  the
               Committee, the rate shall be equal to the average of the rates of
               Phoenix  banks  for   certificates  of  deposit  with  maturities
               equivalent  to  the  terms  of the  loan,  as  determined  at the
               beginning of the month in which the loan is granted. The interest
               rate so determined shall be fixed for the term of the loan.

          (f)  The Committee shall establish a Loan Account for the Participant,
               and shall  credit the Loan  Account  with an amount  equal to the
               principal amount of the loan granted. Loans shall be processed on
               a monthly basis.  When a loan is made, the principal amount shall
               be  withdrawn  pro rata  from each  Investment  Fund in which the
               Participant's  Accounts (other than the Prior Account, the Frozen
               Account or the  Rollover  Account)  are  invested  as of the most
               recent  Valuation  Date.  Each repayment of principal on the loan
               received by the Trustee  from the  Participant  shall  reduce the
               balance  credited  to the  Participant's  Loan  Account  and each
               payment of  principal  and interest  shall  increase pro rata the
               amount  invested in each  Investment  Fund in accordance with the
               Participant's investment elections at the time of such repayment.

          (g)  Except  in the  case of lump  sum  prepayments  described  below,
               repayment in substantially equal installments  occurring not less
               frequently  than  quarterly  of interest and  principal  shall be
               accomplished  through regular payroll  deductions (or by check or
               other means of payment  satisfactory to the Committee in the case
               of a former Employee who continues his/her outstanding loan). The
               Committee may restrict loan amounts if payroll  withholdings  for
               repayment would exceed 20 percent of Compensation. The obligation
               to make  repayments of principal and interest  shall be suspended
               during the period a Participant  is on seasonal  leave of absence
               (of  less  than  12  months)   without  pay.   Repayment  of  the
               substantially  equal  installments  occurring not less frequently
               than  quarterly  shall  resume  as of the  date  the  Participant
               returns to pay status,  and any remaining  unpaid  balance at the
               end of the maximum five-year term of the loan (or 15-year term in
               the  case of a Home  Loan)  shall  be paid  in a final  lump  sum
               installment  at such  time.  Except as may be  prohibited  by the
               rules of particular  Investment Funds from which loan amounts are
               taken or to which loan  repayments  are  directed,  a Participant
               shall be entitled  at any time to prepay,  without  penalty,  the
               total accrued  interest and outstanding  principal  amount of the
               loan by direct payment,  but shall not be allowed to make partial
               prepayments  of  amounts  that are not  currently  due  under the
               regular  repayment  schedule for the loan. If a Participant is in
               default by more than 90 days on any loan  payment that is due and
               payable,  the note in the  Participant's  Loan  Account  shall be
               canceled and the principal deemed distributed to him by the Trust
               Fund  as  soon  as  practicable  thereafter,  provided  that  the
               Participant  has had a hardship or a termination of employment or
               is  otherwise  eligible  for such  deemed  distribution  and loan
               cancellation under the Code and ERISA.

          (h)  The Plan's security interest in a Participant's  Account shall be
               superior to an Alternate  Payee's right to receive a distribution
               pursuant to a Qualified  Domestic  Relations  Order. In the event
               the Plan  Administrator  is presented  with a Qualified  Domestic
               Relations   Order  with  respect  to  a  Participant   having  an
               outstanding Participant loan, the Plan Administrator shall not be
               required  to make  any  distribution  to the  Alternate  Payee if
               immediately   following   said   distribution   the  sum  of  the
               Participant's  share of Plan benefits awarded under the Qualified
               Domestic  Relations Order and the Alternate Payee's share of Plan
               benefits awarded under the Qualified  Domestic Relations Order is
               less than two times the then outstanding balance of said loan(s).
               All  outstanding  Participant  loans  shall be  allocated  to the
               Participant's Account and treated as a separate investment of the
               Participant's  Account,  and Participant shall be responsible for
               the repayment of all loans from the Plan,  except that  Alternate
               Payee's  share  of Plan  benefits  shall  continue  to  serve  as
               security for outstanding loans.

          (i)  The foregoing  provisions  of this section 6.11  notwithstanding,
               the  Committee  reserves  the  right  to stop  granting  loans to
               Participants at any time.


     6.12  REQUIREMENT FOR CONSENT TO CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding any
other provision regarding the Plan  distributions,  the Plan may not immediately
distribute  the balance of a  Participant's  Account that exceeds $3,500 without
the written consent of the  Participant.  Where the Participant does not consent
to a  distribution  that is subject to the foregoing  requirement,  this section
shall  be  interpreted  and  administered  so as to  comply  with  Code  section
411(a)(11) by delaying any  distribution  that might otherwise be required under
the Plan to the extent necessary to comply with said Code section.

     6.13 ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS.  Eligible rollover distributions from
the Plan shall  comply  with the  requirements  of Code  section  401(a)(31)  as
follows. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.
Notwithstanding  any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would  otherwise
limit a distributee's  election under this section,  a distributee may elect, at
the time and in the manner  prescribed by the Committee,  to have any portion of
an eligible rollover  distribution paid directly to an eligible  retirement plan
specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. For purposes of this section,
the following definitions shall apply.

         An "eligible  rollover  distribution" is any distribution of all or any
         portion of the balance to the credit of the distributes, except that an
         "eligible  rollover  distribution"  does not include:  any distribution
         that is one of a series of substantially  equal periodic  payments (not
         less frequently  than annually) made for the life (or life  expectancy)
         of the distributes and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for
         a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent
         such  distribution  is required  under section 401 (a) (9) of the Code;
         and the portion of any  distribution  that is not  includible  in gross
         income  (determined  without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
         appreciation with respect to employer securities); and provided further
         that  the  determination  of what  constitutes  an  "eligible  rollover
         distribution" shall at all times be made in accordance with the current
         rules of Code  section  402 (c),  which shall be  controlling  for this
         purpose.

         An  "eligible  retirement  plan" is an  individual  retirement  account
         (described  in section  408(a) of the Code,  an  individual  retirement
         annuity  described  in section  408 (b) of the Code,  an  annuity  plan
         described in section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described
         in section 401(a) of the Code that accepts the  distributee's  eligible
         rollover  distribution.  However,  in the case of an eligible  rollover
         distribution to the surviving spouse, an "eligible  retirement plan" is
         an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.

         A "distributee"  includes an Employee or former Employee.  In addition,
         the Employee's or former Employee's surviving spouse and the Employee's
         or former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee
         under a  qualified  domestic  relations  order,  as  defined in section
         414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the
         spouse or former spouse.

          A  "direct  rollover"  is a  payment  by  the  Plan  to  the  eligible
          retirement  plan  specified by the  distributee.  In  prescribing  the
          manner  of  making   elections  with  respect  to  eligible   rollover
          distributions,  as described  above, the Committee may provide for the
          uniform,  nondiscriminatory  application of any restrictions permitted
          under   applicable   sections  of  the  Code  and  related  rules  and
          regulations,  including a requirement that a distributee may not elect
          a  partial  direct  rollover  in  an  amount  less  than  $500  and  a
          requirement that a distributee may not elect to make a direct rollover
          from a single eligible rollover distribution to more than one eligible
          retirement plan. Moreover,  if a distribution is one to which sections
          401(a)(11)  and 417 of the Code do not apply,  such  distribution  may
          commence  less than 30 days after the notice  required  under  section
          1.411(a)-11(c) of the Income Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

         (1)      The Plan  administrator  clearly informs the Participant  that
                  the  Participant  has a right to a period  of at least 30 days
                  after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether
                  or  not  to  elect  a  distribution  (and,  if  applicable,  a
                  particular distribution option), and

         (2)      The  Participant, after receiving  the  notice,  affirmatively
                  elects a distribution.


                          Article 7. Investment Elections
                          -------------------------------

     7.1 PARTICIPANT  DIRECTED INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT PLAN. This Plan is intended to
constitute a participant  directed  individual account plan under section 404(c)
of ERISA.  As such,  Participants  shall be provided the opportunity to exercise
control over the  investment of their  Accounts and to choose from a broad range
of investment alternatives.

     7.2  EMPLOYEE SELECTED INVESTMENT FUNDS.

     (a) The Committee,  pursuant to uniform and non-discriminatory rules, shall
establish  three or more  Investment  Funds in  accordance  with the  terms  and
provisions  of this  Article  7.  In  establishing  the  Investment  Funds,  the
Committee shall select  investment  alternatives  which provide each Participant
with a broad range of investment  alternatives  in accordance with Department of
Labor Regulation section  2550.404c-1(b)(3).  The available Investment Funds may
be changed or supplemented from time to time by action of the Committee.  One of
the investment alternatives will be a fund invested in Company Securities, which
shall be referred to as the "Company Stock Fund".

     (b) Each Participant shall designate,  on a form supplied by the Committee,
signed by the Participant and delivered to the Committee,  the Investment  Funds
established  pursuant to paragraph (a),  above, in which amounts held in his/her
Accounts are to be invested. The Committee,  in its discretion,  will invest the
portion of the  Participant's  Accounts for which the Participant has not issued
any investment  directions in accordance with this Plan and the Trust Agreement.
The written  investment  directive of a  Participant  shall be  effective  until
another directive is received by the Committee.


     7.3 EXERCISE OF CONTROL.

     (a) Each  Participant  may direct that all of the amounts  attributable  to
his/her  Accounts  be  invested  in a single  Investment  Fund or may  direct 5%
increments (falling within the range from 10% to 100%) of his/her Accounts to be
invested in such  Investment  Fund(s) as he/she shall desire in accordance  with
uniform procedures promulgated by the Committee. Each Participant, in accordance
with such rules, may change investment  directions to provide for the investment
of  existing  Account  balances  or  future   contributions  among  the  various
Investment  Funds  in  such  increments,  or  all to any  one  of  them,  as the
Participant  shall  elect on a form  provided  by the  Committee,  signed by the
Participant  and  delivered  to  the  Committee.  The  Committee  shall  provide
Participants  the  opportunity  to  receive  written  confirmation  of any  such
investment  direction.  The Trustee and  Committee  shall be obligated to comply
with such  instruction  except as provided in paragraph (d) below. The Committee
shall promulgate uniform and nondiscriminatory rules constituting the investment
direction  policy  under the Plan which shall be  communicated  to  Participants
regarding:

     (1) The  frequency of change of  investment  direction  of  current account
     balances among Investment Funds;

     (2) The frequency of change of investment direction of future contributions
     among Investment Funds;

     (3) The effective dates of instructions regarding investment directions and
     changes in investment directions;

     (4) The  fractional  (percentage)  limitations,  if any,  in which  current
     Account  balances may be invested  and/or  transferred  between  Investment
     Funds;

     (5) The  fractional  (percentage)  limitations,  if any,  in  which  future
     contributions are to be invested between Investment Funds; and

     (6)  The  periods  within  which  direction  must be  given  if it is to be
     effective for a particular period.

Procedures with regard to any one or more  Investment  Funds may vary to reflect
the  variable  or  contrasting   characteristics  of  a  particular   investment
alternative,  provided  that  Participants  are  given the  opportunity  to give
investment  instructions with respect to each investment  alternative  available
under the Plan with a  frequency  which is  appropriate  in light of the  market
volatility to which the investment  alternative may reasonably be expected to be
subject and that any  restrictions  on the frequency of investment  instructions
are   in   accordance    with   Department   of   Labor    Regulation    section
2550.404c-1(b)(2)(ii)(C).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the Plan or Trust Agreement to
the  contrary,  any  discretionary  Company  Contributions  made in the  form of
Company Securities in accordance with section 5.2 shall be initially invested in
the Company Stock Fund. Any  Participant  whose share of  discretionary  Company
Contributions  is  invested  in the Company  Stock Fund in  accordance  with the
preceding  sentence may elect to transfer such amounts among the other available
Investment  Funds,  in  accordance  with  such  uniform  and   nondiscriminatory
procedures as may be established by the Committee concerning matters such as the
timing and amount of transfers.

     (b) The Committee  shall provide each  Participant  with the opportunity to
obtain  sufficient  information  to  make  informed  decisions  with  regard  to
investment  alternatives  available  under the Plan,  and incidents of ownership
related to such  investment.  The Committee  shall  promulgate and distribute to
Participants  an  explanation  that the Plan is intended to comply with  section
404(c) of ERISA and any relief from fiduciary liability resulting  therefrom,  a
description of investment  alternatives available under the Plan, an explanation
of the circumstances  under which Participants may give investment  instructions
and any limitations  thereon,  along with all other information and explanations
required under Department of Labor Regulation  section  2550.404c-1(b)(2)(B)(1).
In addition,  the  Committee  shall provide  information  to  Participants  upon
request   as   required   by    Department   of   Labor    Regulation    section
2550.404c-1(b)(2)(B)(2). Neither the Employer, Committee, Trustee, nor any other
individual associated with the Plan or the Employer shall give investment advice
to Participants with respect to Plan  investments.  The providing of information
pursuant to this Article 7 shall not in any way be deemed to be the providing of
investment advice, and shall in no way obligate the Company, any other Employer,
the Committee,  the Trustee or any other individual  associated with the Plan to
provide any investment advice.

     (c) The Committee,  pursuant to uniform and  nondiscriminatory  rules,  may
charge each Participant's  Accounts for the reasonable  expenses of carrying out
investment  instructions  directly  related to such Account,  provided that each
Participant is periodically  (not less than  quarterly)  informed of such actual
expenses incurred with respect to his or her respective accounts.

     (d) The Committee shall decline to implement any  Participant  instructions
if: (i) the instruction is inconsistent with any provisions of the Plan or Trust
Agreement;  (ii) the instruction is inconsistent  with any investment  direction
policies  adopted by the Committee  from time to time;  (iii)  implementing  the
instruction would not afford a Plan fiduciary protection under section 404(c) of
ERISA;   (iv)   implementing  the  instruction  would  result  in  a  prohibited
transaction  under  section  406 of  ERISA  or  section  4975 of the  Code;  (v)
implementing  the  instruction  would result in taxable income to the Plan; (vi)
implementing the instruction  would jeopardize the Plan's tax qualified  status;
or (vii)  implementing  the  instruction  could  result in a loss in excess of a
Participant's   Account  balance.   The  Committee,   pursuant  to  uniform  and
nondiscriminatory  rules,  may promulgate  additional  limitations on investment
instruction consistent with section 404(c) of ERISA from time to time.

     (e) A  Participant  shall  be given  the  opportunity  to make  independent
investment  directions.  No Plan  fiduciary  shall  subject any  Participant  to
improper influence with respect to any investment  decisions,  and nor shall any
Plan  fiduciary  conceal any non-public  facts  regarding a  Participant's  Plan
investment unless disclosure is prohibited by law. Plan fiduciaries shall remain
completely  neutral  in all  regards  with  respect  to  Participant  investment
direction.  A Plan  fiduciary  may not  accept  investment  instructions  from a
Participant  known  to be  legally  incompetent,  and  any  transactions  with a
fiduciary,  otherwise  permitted  under  this  Article  7 and  the  uniform  and
nondiscriminatory  rules  regarding  investment  direction  promulgated  by  the
Committee,  shall be fair and reasonable to the  Participant in accordance  with
Department of Labor Regulation section 404c- 1(c)(3).

     7.4 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.  The Trustee, the Committee
and the  Employer  shall  not be  liable  for  acting  in  accordance  with  the
directions of a Participant  pursuant to this Article 7 or for failing to act in
the absence of any such direction.  The Trustee,  the Committee and the Employer
shall not be  responsible  for any loss  resulting  from any direction made by a
Participant  and  shall  have  no  duty  to  review  any  direction  made  by  a
Participant.   The  Trustee  shall  have  no  obligation  to  consult  with  any
Participant regarding the propriety or advisability of any selection made by the
Participant.

     7.5  FORMER PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES. For purposes of this Article 7,
the term  "Participant"  shall be deemed to include former  Participants and the
Beneficiaries of any deceased Participants.

     7.6  TRANSFER OF ASSETS.  If the Company is serving as an  intermediary  in
conveying the investment  elections of Participants,  the Committee shall direct
the  Trustee  to  transfer  moneys  or other  property  to or from  the  various
Investment  Funds  as may be  necessary  to  carry  out the  aggregate  transfer
transactions  after the Committee has caused the necessary entries to be made in
the Participants' Accounts in the Investment Funds and has reconciled offsetting
transfer  elections,  in accordance with uniform rules therefore  established by
the Committee. The foregoing sentence shall be inapplicable if Participants are,
in accordance with current  procedures for investment  elections,  communicating
their elections directly to the appropriate Investment Fund agent.

     7.7  VOTING, TENDER OFFERS, OR SIMILAR RIGHTS. Unless passed through to the
Participants, the Trustee, in its discretion, shall vote all proxies relating to
the exercise of voting,  tender or similar  rights which are  incidental  to the
ownership  of any asset  which is held in any  Investment  Fund,  other than the
Company  Stock Fund.  Subsequent  to a  Participant's  investment in the Company
Stock Fund, the Participant  shall be entitled to vote such shares in accordance
with  section  4(e) of the Trust  Agreement,  and  approve  or reject any tender
offers  in  accordance  with  section  4(e) of the  Trust  Agreement.  Except as
otherwise  specified  by the  Board,  the  Committee  shall  have the duties and
responsibilities  assigned to the Named  Fiduciary  in section 4(e) of the Trust
Agreement,  and the Company shall have the duties and responsibilities  assigned
to the Sponsor in that section 4(e).

     7.8  INVESTMENT  RESTRICTIONS  DUE TO SECURITIES  LAWS. No  Participant  or
Beneficiary who is a Company officer,  director, or ten percent beneficial owner
subject to reporting  and  potential  liability  for  short-swing  profits under
section 16 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934  (hereinafter,  a "Section 16
Insider")  shall be  permitted  to acquire or retain an Account  balance that is
invested the Company Stock Fund. This investment  restriction  takes  precedence
over other,  more general  investment  rules stated  elsewhere in the Plan.  The
Committee shall provide for adequate  coordination with the Plan's  recordkeeper
and take other appropriate steps to ensure that this investment restriction will
be  administered,   consistent  with  applicable   qualification  and  fiduciary
requirements  under the Code and ERISA, in a manner that furthers the purpose of
eliminating  the need for  Section  16  Insiders  to  report  Plan  transactions
pursuant  section 16 of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934.  In  addition to
prohibiting new Company Stock Fund investments by Participants and Beneficiaries
who are Section 16 Insiders,  the Committee  shall establish  appropriate  rules
under which a  Participant  or  Beneficiary  who has an existing  balance in the
Company Stock Fund and is, or at some future time becomes,  a Section 16 Insider
will be required to dispose of such balance as soon as practicable. This section
7.8 does not limit the  Company  Stock  Fund  investments  of  Participants  and
Beneficiaries  who are not now,  and are not  expected  to  become,  Section  16
Insiders.  Thus,  it does  not  prevent  the  Trust  from  acquiring  a level of
ownership in the  Company's  common stock that could cause the Trust to become a
Section 16 Insider.

     7.9  CONFIDENTIALITY  REQUIREMENTS.  Because  Participants are permitted to
invest in Company  Securities,  the Company must establish written procedures in
order to safeguard the confidentiality of information  relating to the purchase,
holding and sale of Company  Securities  and the exercise of voting,  tender and
similar  rights.   While  the  Committee  may  adopt  expanded   confidentiality
procedures, this section 7.9 shall constitute the confidentiality procedures for
the  Plan  until  such  time  as  expanded  procedures,  if  any,  are  adopted.
Information relating to the purchase, holding and sale of Company Securities and
the exercise of voting,  tender and similar  rights shall be held in  confidence
and not divulged to the Company,  or any other officer or Employee  thereof,  or
any other person except to the extent  necessary to ensure that a  Participant's
directions to purchase,  hold or sell Company  Securities  or the  Participant's
exercise of voting,  tender or similar  rights are given effect.  Any person who
willfully or  negligently  violates the  confidentiality  rules  espoused in the
preceding  sentence will be subject to disciplinary  action,  and, to the extent
the Committee deems it necessary, will be relieved of any duties which allow the
person to gain access to such  confidential  information.  The  Committee  shall
appoint a person (the  "confidentiality  fiduciary") to monitor  compliance with
the  foregoing  procedures,  and/or  any  expanded  procedures  adopted  by  the
Committee. The confidentiality  fiduciary shall appoint an independent fiduciary
to carry out  activities  relating to any  situations  that the  confidentiality
fiduciary  determines  involve a potential for undue influence upon Participants
and Beneficiaries  with regard to the direct or indirect exercise of shareholder
rights.  For purposes of this  section,  a fiduciary is not  independent  if the
fiduciary is affiliated with the Company or its Affiliates.


            Article 8. Participant Accounts and Records of the Plan
            -------------------------------------------------------

     8.1 ACCOUNTS  AND  RECORDS.  The  Committee  shall  maintain or cause to be
maintained,  accounts and records which shall accurately  disclose the status of
the  Accounts  of each  Participant  or his/her  Beneficiary  in the Plan.  Each
Participant's  Basic Pretax Savings  Account,  Unmatched Pretax Savings Account,
Prior Account,  Frozen  Account,  Company  Contributions  Account,  and Rollover
Account shall be assigned an appropriate  share of each Investment Fund in which
the Participant's  Accounts are invested,  based on the times and the amounts of
the  Participant's  investments in, and  withdrawals  from, each such Investment
Fund with respect to each such Account.  The records relative to a Participant's
Accounts  shall permit a  determination  as of any Valuation Date of the current
value of his/her Accounts in the Trust Fund. Each  Participant  shall be advised
from time to time,  at least  once each Plan  Year,  as to the status of his/her
Accounts and the portions  thereof  attributable to his/her Basic Pretax Savings
Account,  Unmatched  Pretax  Savings  Account,  Prior Account,  Frozen  Account,
Company Contributions Account, and Rollover Account.  Nothing in this Plan shall
prevent the  aggregation of the separate  Accounts of any group of  Participants
for  recordkeeping  purposes,  provided  that it is possible as of any Valuation
Date to determine the separate  interest of each  Participant in such aggregated
Account,  as well as the vested and nonvested portions thereof,  and the portion
that is attributable to each separate Investment Fund.

In general,  disbursements  on account of loans,  withdrawals,  or distributions
following  a  termination  of  employment  shall be made  monthly  and  shall be
accounted for as occurring as of the most current Valuation Date coinciding with
or immediately preceding the disbursement.  Consequently, no adjustment shall be
made for earnings or investment  gains or losses  occurring since such Valuation
Date. However, at any time that Valuation Dates are occurring no more frequently
than monthly,  the  Committee may suspend the practice of making and  accounting
for  disbursements as of a prior Valuation Date whenever  special  circumstances
indicate  that this step is necessary in order to protect the assets of the Plan
and  the  share  of all  Participants  and  Beneficiaries  in  such  assets.  An
indication  of the  existence  of such special  circumstances  will occur if the
disbursements to be processed  indicate that a reduction of more than 10 percent
will  occur in the  number of  Participant  Accounts  invested  in a  particular
Investment Fund or if the market value of the principal  investment  assets of a
particular  Investment  Fund has declined by more than 20 percent since the last
Valuation  Date.  Moreover,  at any such time,  the  Participant  or Beneficiary
receiving the disbursement  may, at his/her  election,  avoid the use of a prior
Valuation  Date by  delaying  his/her  disbursement  until the next  monthly (or
other,  less frequent)  Valuation  Date. If a disbursement  is delayed until the
next monthly (or other,  less  frequent)  Valuation  Date,  the recipient  shall
receive an adjustment to his/her  Account for earnings and  investment  gains or
losses up to such next Valuation Date.

     8.2  VALUATION OF INVESTMENT  FUNDS. As of each Valuation Date, the Trustee
shall  determine  the fair market value of the assets of each  Investment  Fund,
including  uninvested cash (if any),  accrued interest and dividends,  and shall
notify the  Company  of the value so  determined.  Assets  for which  there is a
readily ascertainable market shall be valued by the Trustee at their fair market
value,  determined by the last known sale on the Valuation  Date as of which the
market value is determined, provided that the use of average daily book value or
other similar  method may be used to value any  guaranteed  investment  contract
fund in accordance with established  procedures that are generally  followed for
purposes of arm's length transactions involving such a Fund. In the absence of a
sale on the  Valuation  Date,  the fair market value of such assets,  as well as
other  assets for which there is no readily  ascertainable  fair  market  value,
shall be determined by the Trustee in such manner as the Trustee shall  consider
appropriate.

     8.3 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. As of each Valuation Date, the prior balances in
the  Accounts of a  Participant  or  Beneficiary  shall be updated as follows if
transactions  are not  being  processed  on a daily  basis.  First,  such  prior
balances  shall  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  any  payouts  due  to  loans,
withdrawals, or distributions occurring during the valuation period and shall be
increased  by the amount of any  contributions  or loan  repayments  during such
period to the extent that such  contributions or repayments are considered to be
available as of the first day of the  valuation  period under rules  approved by
the Committee.

The adjusted prior Account balances,  as described above,  shall then be further
adjusted,  upward or downward,  in proportion to the adjusted Account balance of
each  Participant or Beneficiary  in each  Investment  Fund so as to reflect the
results of earnings and investment gains or losses during the valuation  period.
Finally,   the  Account   balances  so  obtained   shall  be  increased  by  any
contributions  or loan repayments  during the valuation period (other than those
previously added as an Account adjustment) which are considered  available as of
the new Valuation  Date. The resulting net credit balances in the Accounts shall
reflect their current  status as of the new Valuation Date and shall also become
the starting point for the adjustment of prior Account  balances as adjusted for
transfers for purposes of the next following Valuation Date.

The sum of the net credit  balances  attributable  to an  Investment  Fund shall
equal the net value of such Fund as of the current Valuation Date. The Committee
shall determine the net value of an Investment Fund by subtracting from the fair
market value of assets (as reported by the Trustee) held in such Investment Fund
any  expenses,  withdrawals,  distributions  and  transfers  chargeable  to that
investment  Fund which have been incurred but not yet paid.  All  determinations
made by the Trustee with respect to fair market values and determinations of the
Committee  concerning  net  value  shall be made in  accordance  with  generally
accepted principles of trust accounting, and such determinations when so made by
the Trustee and the Committee  shall be conclusive  and binding upon all persons
having an interest under the Plan.


                               Article 9. Financing
                               --------------------

     9.1  FINANCING.  The  Company  shall  maintain a Trust Fund to finance  the
benefits  under the Plan,  by  entering  into one or more  Trust  Agreements  or
insurance  contracts approved by the Company,  or by causing insurance contracts
to be  held  under a Trust  Agreement.  Any  Trust  Agreement  or any  insurance
contract that is not held in trust is designated as and shall  constitute a part
of this  Plan,  and all rights  which may  accrue to any person  under this Plan
shall be subject to all the terms and  provisions  of such  Trust  Agreement  or
insurance  contract.  A Trustee shall be appointed by the Board of Directors and
shall have such powers as provided in the Trust Agreement.

The Committee shall have  responsibility for selecting the Investment  Managers,
if any, who shall direct the Trustee in the  investment  of the assets of any or
all of the available Investment Funds, and for selecting the insurance contracts
or securities issued by regulated  investment  companies or trusts that shall be
used by the Trustee in making investments under each Fund to the extent that the
Fund's assets are not to be invested by the Trustee acting in its own discretion
or pursuant to the  direction of an  Investment  Manager.  The  Committee  shall
instruct the Trustee as to the specific  Investment  Managers  and/or  regulated
investment  company  or trust  securities  or  insurance  contracts  that it has
selected  for each  Fund.  In the  event  that the  Committee  has not given the
Trustee or an  Investment  Manager  responsibility  for managing the assets of a
particular  Fund and has not  directed  the Trustee to invest the assets of such
Fund in a particular insurance contract or in particular  securities issued by a
regulated  investment  company or trust,  the Trustee shall invest the assets of
such Fund according to its best judgment.

     9.2 Company Contributions. The Company shall make such contributions to the
Trust Fund as are required by this Plan,  subject to the right of the Company to
discontinue the Plan.

     9.3 Non-Reversion.  Anything in this Plan to the contrary  notwithstanding,
it shall be impossible at any time for the  contributions  of the Company or any
part of the Trust Fund to revert to the  Company or an  Affiliate  or to be used
for or diverted to any purpose other than the exclusive  benefit of Participants
or their Beneficiaries, except that:

         (a)      If a contribution or portion thereof is made by the Company by
                  a mistake of fact, upon written request to the Committee, such
                  contribution  or such portion and any increment  thereon shall
                  be returned  to the Company  within one year after the date of
                  payment; and

         (b)      In the event that a deduction  for any  contributions  made by
                  the Company is disallowed by the Internal  Revenue  Service in
                  any Plan Year,  then that portion of the Company  Contribution
                  that is not deductible shall be returned to the Company within
                  one year from the date of  receipt  of notice by the  Internal
                  Revenue Service of the disallowance of the deduction.


                           Article 10. Administration
                           --------------------------

     10.1  THE COMMITTEE. The Plan Administrator  shall be the Company,  but the
Company  delegates its duties as such to the Benefits  Advisory  Committee  (the
"Committee")  appointed  by the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Committee  shall be
composed of as many members as the Board of  Directors  may appoint from time to
time, but not fewer than 3 members, and shall hold office at the pleasure of the
Board of Directors. Such members may, but need not, be Employees of the Company.
Any member of the Committee may resign by delivering his/her written resignation
to the Board of Directors with 30 days' advance notice.

Vacancies in the Committee arising by resignation,  death, removal or otherwise,
shall be  filled  by the  Board of  Directors.  The  Company  shall be the Named
Fiduciary  under  the Plan and under the Trust  Agreement,  in  accordance  with
ERISA.

     10.2  COMPENSATION  AND EXPENSES.  The members of the Committee shall serve
without  compensation for services as such a member. Any member of the Committee
may  receive  reimbursement  by the Company of expenses  properly  and  actually
incurred.  All  expenses of the  Committee  shall be paid out of the Plan assets
unless paid directly by the Company.  Such  expenses  shall include any expenses
incident to the  functioning  of the Committee,  including,  but not limited to,
fees of the Plan's accountants,  outside counsel and other specialists and other
costs of administering the Plan.

     10.3  MANNER OF ACTION. A majority of the members of the  Committee  at the
time in office shall  constitute a quorum for the  transaction of business.  All
resolutions  adopted,  and other  actions  taken by the Committee at any meeting
shall be by the vote of a majority of those  present at any such  meeting.  Upon
concurrence  in  writing  of a  majority  of the  members at the time in office,
action of the Committee may be taken otherwise than at a meeting.

A member of the  Committee  shall not vote or act upon any matter which  relates
solely to such person as a Participant.  If a matter arises affecting one of the
members of the Committee as a Participant and the other members of the Committee
are unable to agree as to the disposition of such matter, the Board of Directors
shall appoint a substitute member in the place and stead of the affected member,
for the sole and only  purpose  of  passing  upon and  deciding  the  particular
matter.

     10.4  CHAIRMAN, SECRETARY AND EMPLOYMENT OF SPECIALISTS. The members of the
Committee  shall  elect  one of their  number  as  Chairman  and  shall  elect a
Secretary  who  may,  but  need  not,  be a member  of the  Committee.  They may
authorize  one or more of their  number or any agent to execute  or deliver  any
instrument or  instruments on their behalf,  and may employ such counsel,  which
may be in-house counsel of the Company, auditors, and other specialists and such
clerical,  medical, actuarial and other services as they may require in carrying
out the provisions of the Plan.

     10.5 SUBCOMMITTEES. The Committee may appoint one or more subcommittees and
delegate  such of its  power  and  duties  as it  deems  desirable  to any  such
subcommittee,  in which case every reference  herein made to the Committee shall
be deemed to mean or  include  the  subcommittees  as to  matters  within  their
jurisdiction.  The  members  of any  such  subcommittee  shall  consist  of such
officers  or other  employees  of the  Company  and such  other  persons  as the
Committee may appoint.

     10.6  OTHER  AGENTS. The  Committee may also appoint one or more persons or
agents to aid it in carrying out its duties in  administration  of the Plan, and
delegate such of its powers and duties as it deems  desirable to such persons or
agents.

     10.7  RECORDS. All resolutions, proceedings, acts and determinations of the
Committee  shall  be  recorded  by  the  Secretary   thereof  or  under  his/her
supervision,  and all such records, together with such documents and instruments
as may be necessary for the  administration  of the Plan,  shall be preserved in
the custody of the Secretary.

     10.8 RULES. Subject to the limitations contained in the Plan, the Committee
shall be  empowered  from time to time in its  discretion  to adopt  by-laws and
establish  rules for the conduct of its  affairs and the  exercise of the duties
imposed upon it under the Plan.

     10.9 COMMITTEE'S POWERS AND DUTIES. The Committee shall have responsibility
for the general  administration of the Plan and for carrying out its provisions.
The  Committee  shall  have the  power and  discretion  as may be  necessary  to
discharge  its  functions  hereunder.  Without  limiting the  generality  of the
foregoing, the Committee shall have the discretionary authority:

     (a)  To  construe  and  interpret  the Plan,  to decide  all  questions  of
          eligibility  and determine  the amount,  manner and time of payment of
          any benefits hereunder;

     (b)  To make a determination as to the right of any person to a benefit;

     (c)  To obtain from the  participating  Affiliates  and from Employees such
          information as shall be necessary for the proper administration of the
          Plan and, when  appropriate,  to furnish such information  promptly to
          the Trustees or other persons entitled thereto;

     (d)  To prepare and distribute, in such manner as the Company determines to
          be appropriate, information explaining the Plan;

     (e)  To furnish the participating  Affiliates,  upon request,  such reports
          with respect to the  administration  of the Plan as are reasonable and
          appropriate;

     (f)  To  establish   and  maintain   such  accounts  in  the  name  of  the
          participating Affiliates and of each Participant as are necessary;

     (g)  To  instruct  the  Trustee  with  respect to the  payment of  benefits
          hereunder;

     (h)  To provide for any required  bonding of fiduciaries  and other persons
          who may from time to time handle Plan assets;

     (i)  To prepare and file any reports required by the ERISA;

     (j)  To  engage  an   independent   public   accountant   to  conduct  such
          examinations  and to render  such  opinions  as may be required by the
          ERISA;

     (k)  To  allocate  contributions  and  Trust  Fund  gains or  losses to the
          Accounts of Participants;

     (l)  To  establish  a  funding  policy  and  method   consistent  with  the
          objectives of the Plan and the requirements of ERISA;

     (m)  To correct any errors and remedy any defects in the  administration of
          this Plan, including,  if necessary, by requiring any Employer to make
          a Qualified  Nonelective  Contribution  that  prevents  discrimination
          under Code section 401(k) or 401(m) without materially  increasing the
          cost of the Plan;

     (n)  To establish reasonable claims procedures in accordance with the terms
          of this Plan and ERISA; and

     (o)  To establish  procedures for  identifying and complying with Qualified
          Domestic Relations Orders.

     10.10 COMMITTEE'S  DECISIONS  CONCLUSIVE.  The Committee shall exercise its
powers hereunder in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. Any and all disputes
with  respect  to the Plan  which may  arise  involving  Participants,  or their
Beneficiaries  shall be  referred to the  Committee  and its  decision  shall be
final,  conclusive and binding.  Furthermore,  if any question  arises as to the
meaning,  interpretation or application of any provision hereof, the decision of
the Committee with respect thereto shall be final.

     10.11 INDEMNITY. To the extent permitted by law, Del Webb Corporation shall
and does hereby  jointly and severally  indemnify and agree to hold harmless its
employees, officers and directors who serve in fiduciary capacities with respect
to the Plan and Trust  Agreement  and each member of the Committee  (which,  for
purposes  of this  section,  includes  any  Employee to whom the  Committee  has
delegated fiduciary or other duties) from all loss, damage, or liability,  joint
or several, including payment of expenses in connection with defense against any
such claim, for their acts,  omissions and conduct,  and for the acts, omissions
and conduct of their duly  appointed  agents,  which  acts,  omission or conduct
constitute or are alleged to constitute a breach of such individual's  fiduciary
or other  responsibilities  under ERISA or any other law, except for those acts,
omissions or conduct resulting from his own willful misconduct,  willful failure
to act, or gross negligence.  The right of indemnity  described in the preceding
sentence shall be conditioned  upon (i) the timely receipt of notice by Del Webb
Corporation of any claim asserted against the member, which notice, in the event
of a lawsuit  shall be given  within 10 days after  receipt by the member of the
complaint,  and (ii) the  receipt by Del Webb  Corporation  of an offer from the
Employee of an  opportunity  to participate in the settlement or defense of such
claim.

     10.12  FIDUCIARIES.  The fiduciaries  named in this Article shall have only
those powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations as are specifically given
them under this Plan or the Trust.  The  Company  and  participating  Affiliates
shall have the sole  responsibility  for making the  contributions  specified in
Article  5.  The  Board of  Directors  or the  Company,  acting  through  a duly
authorized representative (including the chairman of the Committee to the extent
provided  in  section  11.1 with  respect  to  amendments)  shall  have the sole
authority to appoint and remove the Trustee and to amend or terminate,  in whole
or in part,  this Plan or the Trust.  The Committee shall be the Named Fiduciary
under the Plan and shall have the sole  responsibility for the administration of
this Plan, which  responsibility is specifically  described in this Plan and the
Trust  Agreement.  The  officers  and  Employees  of the Company  shall have the
responsibility  of implementing  the Plan and carrying out its provisions as the
Committee shall direct.  The Trustee,  and any Investment Manager shall have the
sole  responsibility  for the  administration of the Trust and the management of
the assets held under the Trust, to the extent provided in the Trust  Agreement.
A  fiduciary  may rely upon any  direction,  information  or  action of  another
fiduciary  as being  proper  under this Plan or the Trust,  and is not  required
under  this  Plan or the  Trust  to  inquire  into  the  propriety  of any  such
direction,  information or action.  It is intended under this Plan and the Trust
that each fiduciary  shall be responsible  for the proper exercise of his/her or
its own powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan and the
Trust and shall not be  responsible  for any act or  failure  to act of  another
fiduciary.  No  fiduciary  guarantees  the  Trust  Fund  in any  manner  against
investment loss or depreciation in asset value. Any party may serve in more than
one fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan or Trust.

     10.13  NOTICE OF ADDRESS.  Each person  entitled to benefits  from the Plan
must file with the  Committee  or its agent,  in  writing,  his/her  post office
address and each change of post office address. Any communication,  statement or
notice addressed to such a person at his/her latest reported post office address
will be binding upon him for all purposes of the Plan, and neither the Committee
nor the  Company or any  Trustee  shall be  obliged  to search for or  ascertain
his/her whereabouts.

     10.14  DATA. All persons entitled to benefits from the Plan must furnish to
the Company such  documents,  evidence or information  as the Company  considers
necessary or desirable for the purpose of  administering  the Plan; and it shall
be a condition of the Plan that each such person must  furnish such  information
and sign such  documents as the Company may require  before any benefits  become
payable from the Plan.

     10.15 APPEALS FROM DENIAL OF CLAIMS.  Benefits  shall be provided from this
Plan through procedures initiated by the Committee, and the Participant need not
file a claim.  However,  if a  Participant  or  Beneficiary  believes  he/she is
entitled to a benefit, or a benefit different from the one he/she receives, then
the  Participant  or  Beneficiary  may file a claim for the benefit by writing a
letter to the  Committee.  If any claim for benefits under the Plan is wholly or
partially  denied,  the claimant shall be given notice in writing of such denial
within 90 days  after  receipt of the claim or within an  additional  90 days if
special  circumstances  require an extension of time,  and written notice of the
extension  shall be  furnished to the  claimant.  Notice of the denial shall set
forth the following information:

     (a)  The specific reason or reasons for the denial;

     (b)  Specific  reference to pertinent  Plan  provisions  on which denial is
          based;

     (c)  A description of any additional material or information  necessary for
          the  claimant  to  perfect  the claim and an  explanation  of why such
          material or information is necessary;

     (d)  An  explanation  that a full and fair review by the  Committee  of the
          decision denying the claim may be requested by the claimant or his/her
          authorized  representative by filing with the Company,  within 60 days
          after  such  notice  has been  received,  a written  request  for such
          review; and

     (e)  If such  request  is so filed,  the  claimant  or  his/her  authorized
          representative  may review  pertinent  documents and submit issues and
          comments  in  writing  within  the same  60-day  period  specified  in
          paragraph (d) above.

The  decision  of the  Committee  upon review  shall be made by the  Committee's
delegate,  and  shall be made  promptly,  and not later  than 60 days  after the
Committee's  receipt of the  request for review,  unless  special  circumstances
require an extension of time for processing, in which case the claimant shall be
so notified and a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible,  but not later
than 120 days after  receipt of the request for review.  if the claim is denied,
wholly or in part, the claimant shall be given a copy of the decision  promptly.
The  decision  shall be in writing and shall  include  specific  reasons for the
denial, specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial
is based and shall be written in a manner  calculated  to be  understood  by the
claimant.


                       Article 11. Amendment And Termination
                       -------------------------------------

     11.1  AMENDMENT  AND  TERMINATION.  The  Company  expects  the  Plan  to be
permanent and continue  indefinitely,  but since future conditions affecting the
Company cannot be anticipated or foreseen, the Company must necessarily and does
hereby  reserve the right to amend,  modify or terminate the Plan at any time by
action of the Board of Directors or its Human Resources Committee.  In addition,
the chair of the  Benefits  Advisory  Committee  may make any  modifications  or
amendments  to  the  Plan  that  are  necessary  or   appropriate  to  meet  the
requirements  of the Code or any  other  applicable  law,  as now in  effect  or
hereafter  amended,  or any  amendment  which  does not  significantly  increase
benefit  levels or costs.  No  amendment of the Plan shall cause any part of the
Trust Fund to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive
benefit  of the  Participants  or  their  Beneficiaries  covered  by  the  Plan.
Retroactive  Plan  amendments  may not  decrease  the  accrued  benefits  of any
Participant  determined  as of the beginning of the first Plan Year to which the
amendment applies, or, if later, as of the time the amendment was adopted.

     11.2 DISTRIBUTION ON TERMINATION.  Upon termination of the Plan in whole or
in part (after an initial  determination  has been  obtained  from the  Internal
Revenue Service that the Plan constitutes a qualified defined  contribution plan
with  respect to the  Employer),  or upon  complete  discontinuance  of Employer
contributions to the Plan (after such initial  determination has been obtained),
the value of the  proportionate  interest in the Trust Fund of each  Participant
affected  by such  termination  having an  interest  in the Trust  Fund shall be
determined   by  the   Committee  as  of  the  date  of  such   termination   or
discontinuance.

The Accounts of such Participants shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable,  and
thereafter  distribution  shall  be  made  to  such  Participants  as soon as is
practicable  consistent  with the  requirement  of  section  6.7 to  obtain  the
Participant's  consent to certain distributions and the restrictions of sections
6.8 and 6.9  limiting  the  ability  of  Participants  who  remain in service as
Employees to make withdrawals from the Plan.

     11.3  CORPORATE  REORGANIZATION.  In the event the Company is  dissolved or
liquidated or shall by appropriate legal proceedings be adjudged a bankrupt,  or
in  the  event  judicial  proceedings  of any  kind  result  in the  involuntary
dissolution  of  the  Company,  the  Plan  shall  be  terminated.   The  merger,
consolidation or reorganization of the Company, or the sale of the Company or of
all or substantially all of its assets or stock, shall not terminate the Plan if
there is delivery to the Company, by its successor or by the purchaser of all or
substantially all of its stock or assets, a written  instrument  requesting that
it be  substituted  for the Company and  agreeing to perform all the  provisions
hereof  which the  Company is  required  to  perform.  Upon the  receipt of said
instrument,  with the approval of the Company,  the  successor or the  purchaser
shall be substituted for the Company herein,  and each  participating  Affiliate
and the Company shall be relieved and released from all obligations of any kind,
character or description herein or in any trust agreement.

     11.4 PLAN  MERGER OR  TRANSFER.  This Plan  shall not merge or  consolidate
with, or transfer  assets and  liabilities  to, or accept a transfer  from,  any
other  employee  benefit plan unless each  Participant in this Plan will (if the
plan had then  terminated)  receive a  benefit  immediately  after  the  merger,
consolidation  or transfer  which is not less than the  benefit the  Participant
would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation
or transfer of assets (if this Plan had then terminated).


                       Article 12. Adoption by Affiliate
                       ---------------------------------

     12.1  AFFILIATE PARTICIPATION.  An Affiliate may become a party to the Plan
and Trust  Agreement by adopting the Plan for the benefit of any specified group
of its Employees, with such modifications of the basic Plan provisions as may be
approved by the Company,  effective as of the date  specified in such  adoption.
Such adoption shall be accomplished by the Affiliate:

     (a)  By filing  with the Company a certified  copy of a  resolution  of its
          Board of Directors to that effect,  and such other  instruments as the
          Company may require; and

     (b)  By  the  Company's  filing  with  the  then  Trustee  a copy  of  such
          resolution,  and other instruments,  together with a certified copy of
          resolutions  of  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approving  such
          adoption.

     12.2 Company Action  Binding on  Participating  Affiliates.  As long as the
Company is a party to the Plan and the Trust  Agreement it shall be empowered to
act thereunder  for any  participating  Affiliate in all matters  respecting the
Committee and the Trustee and the designation of Affiliates and any action taken
by the Company with respect thereto shall  automatically  include and be binding
upon any Affiliate which is a party to the Plan.

     12.3 TERMINATION OF  PARTICIPATION  OF AFFILIATE.  The Company reserves the
right, in its sole discretion and at any time, to terminate the participation in
this  Plan  of  any or all  Affiliates.  Such  termination  shall  be  effective
immediately  upon notice of such termination from the Company to the Trustee and
the Affiliate being terminated.  In event of such  termination,  this Plan shall
not terminate,  but the portion of the Plan  attributable to the Affiliate shall
become a separate  Plan, and the Company shall inform the Trustee of the portion
of the  Trust  Fund  that  is then  attributable  to the  participation  of such
terminated   Affiliate.   Such   portion   shall  as  soon   thereafter   as  is
administratively  feasible be set apart by the Trustee as a separate Trust which
shall be part of the separate Plan of such terminated Affiliate.  Thereafter the
administration,  control,  and  operation  of the  Plan  with  respect  to  such
terminated  Affiliate  shall be on a separate basis in accordance with the terms
hereof, or as such terms may be amended by appropriate action of such terminated
Affiliate in accordance with the provisions of Article 12.


                        Article 13. Top-Heavy Provisions
                        --------------------------------

     13.1 APPLICATION. If in any Plan Year after 1983 (a) the sum of the Account
balances of  Participants  who are "Key Employees" for such Plan Year exceeds 60
percent  of the sum of the  Account  balances  of all  Participants  (excluding,
however,  balances that are disregarded under the rules of this Article), or (b)
the Plan is part of a top-heavy group, then the following  provisions under this
Article 13 shall apply for such Plan Year.

The date for determining the  applicability  of this Article 13  ("determination
date") is:

     (a)  For the first Plan Year, the last day of the Plan Year, and

     (b)  For any other Plan Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year.

     13.2 KEY  EMPLOYEES.  For  purposes  of this  Article  13,  the terms  "Key
Employee" and an Employee who is not a Key Employee  ("non-Key  Employee")  have
the meaning  specified in Code  section  416(i),  where the term "Key  Employee"
generally  means any Employee (and the  Beneficiary  of such an Employee) who at
any time during a Plan Year or any of the four preceding Plan Years is:

     (a)  An officer of the Company or an Affiliate  whose  Compensation  during
          the relevant Plan Year  exceeded 150 percent of the dollar  limitation
          under Code section 415(c)(1)(A);  provided,  however, no more than the
          lesser  of 50  Employees,  or the  greater  of three  Employees  or 10
          percent of all Employees are to be treated as officers,

     (b)  One of the 10 Employees having Compensation for the relevant Plan Year
          in excess  of the  dollar  limitation  in effect  under  Code  section
          415(c)(1)(A) and owning (or considered as owning within the meaning of
          Code  section  318)  the  largest  interests  in  the  Company  or  an
          Affiliate,  then the Employee with the greater  Compensation  shall be
          treated as having the larger interest,

     (c)  A 5 percent owner of the Company or an Affiliate, or

     (d)  A 1  percent  owner  of the  Company  or an  Affiliate  having  annual
          Compensation of more than $150,000.

An Employee is  considered  to be a "5 percent  owner" if the Employee owns more
than 5 percent of the outstanding  stock of the Company or an Affiliate or stock
possessing  more than 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all of the
Company or Affiliates'  stock. An Employee is also treated as owning stock owned
by certain members of the Employee's family as provided in Code section 318. The
same rules apply to determine whether an Employee is a 1 percent owner.

If a current  Employee  ceases to be a Key  Employee,  such  Employee's  Account
balance shall be disregarded  under the top-heavy plan  computation for any Plan
Year  following  the last  Plan  Year for  which  he/she  was  treated  as a Key
Employee.  For Plan Years beginning after 1984, the account balances and accrued
benefits of a Participant  who has not performed any services for the Company or
any Affiliate at any time during the 5-year  period ending on the  determination
date will be disregarded.  In addition, a Participant's Rollover Account balance
shall be disregarded to the extent that it consists of amounts attributable to a
rollover  initiated by the Participant from a plan that is not maintained by the
Company or an Affiliate.

     13.3 TOP-HEAVY GROUP. For purposes of determining  whether the Plan is part
of a top-heavy  group as described in section 13.1,  the  following  rules shall
apply:

     (a)  Aggregation Group. All plans maintained by the Company or an Affiliate
          are  aggregated  to  determine  whether  the  plans,  as a group,  are
          top-heavy. The aggregation group shall include any plan which covers a
          Key  Employee and any other plan which  enables a plan  covering a Key
          Employee to meet the  requirements of section  401(a)(4) or 410 of the
          Code.

     (b)  An aggregation  group is a top-heavy group if, as of the determination
          date, (1) the sum of the account  balances of Key Employees  under all
          defined contribution plans included in the group exceeds 60 percent of
          the account balances of all  participants  under all such plans in the
          group,  or (2) the present value of the accumulated  accrued  benefits
          for Key Employees under all defined benefit plans in the group exceeds
          60 percent of the present value of the  accumulated  accrued  benefits
          for all participants under all such plans in the group.

In any Plan Year, in testing for top-heaviness under section 13.3(a) or (b), the
Company may in its discretion take into account accumulated accrued benefits and
account balances in any other plan maintained by it or an Affiliate,  so long as
such expanded  aggregation  group continues to meet the requirements of sections
401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.


     13.4 ADDITIONAL  RULES. In determining the present value of the accumulated
accrued  benefits  under a  defined  benefit  plan  and  the sum of the  account
balances under a defined contribution plan, Company  contributions and voluntary
employee  contributions  shall be taken into  account.  The present value of the
accrued  benefit in a defined  benefit plan or the account  balance in a defined
contribution  plan will include any amount  distributed to a Participant  within
the five year period ending on the determination date.

     13.5  CODE  SECTION  415(H)  ADJUSTMENT.  If the Plan is  determined  to be
top-heavy in any Plan Year,  then the combined limits of Code section 415(e) and
section  5.11 of the Plan  shall be  applied  in  accordance  with Code  section
416(h)(1)  by  substituting  "1.0" for "1.25" in computing  the defined  benefit
fraction  and the defined  contribution  fraction  under Plan  section  5.10 and
paragraphs 2(B) and 3(B) of Code section 415(e).

     13.6 MINIMUM  CONTRIBUTION  REQUIREMENT.  If this Plan is  determined to be
top-heavy  in any Plan  Year  under the  provisions  of this  Article,  then the
Employer shall contribute and allocate the amount described below to the Account
of any person who was an Employee and a Participant  at any time during the Plan
Year and is not  treated  as a Key  Employee  (such  person  or,  if  he/she  is
deceased,  his/her  Beneficiary,  being referred to as a "non-Key Employee") for
such Plan Year such amount shall be equal to the difference, if any, between (i)
3  percent  of the  Participant's  Compensation  for that Plan Year and (ii) the
amount of Employer  contributions,  expressed  as a percentage  of  Compensation
allocated to the account of each non-Key  Employee who was a  participant  under
this Plan or any other plan in the same  aggregation  group.  For this  purpose,
salary reduction  contributions  made at the election of the Participant to this
Plan or any other similar plan in the aggregation group for Plan Years beginning
before January 1, 1985,  shall be disregarded,  but such  contributions  for all
subsequent Plan Years shall be taken into account.  The contributions under this
section 13.6 shall be accounted for and vested as Company Contributions.


                      Article 14. Miscellaneous Provisions
                      ------------------------------------

     14.1 EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.  Nothing contained in this Plan or any modification
of the same or act done in  pursuance  hereof  shall be  construed as giving any
person any legal or  equitable  right  against the  Company,  the Trustee or the
Trust Fund, unless specifically provided herein, or as giving any person a right
to be retained  in the employ of the  Company.  All  Participants  shall  remain
subject to assignment,  reassignment,  promotion,  transfer,  layoff, reduction,
suspension  and  discharge  to the same  extent as if this  Plan had never  been
established.

     14.2 NO EXAMINATION  OR ACCOUNTING.  Neither this Plan nor any action taken
thereunder shall be construed as giving any person the right to an accounting or
to examine the books or affairs of the Company.

     14.3 INVESTMENT RISK. The Participants and their Beneficiaries shall assume
all risks in  connection  with any  decrease in the value of any assets or funds
which may be invested or reinvested in the Trust Fund which supports this Plan.

     14.4 NON-ALIENATION.  Except as permitted under the Plan in accordance with
Code section 401(a)(13) and ERISA section 206(d) with respect to matters such as
loans to  Participants  and  assignments  to Alternate  Payees  under  Qualified
Domestic  Relations  Orders, no benefit payable at any time under the Plan shall
be subject to the debts or  liabilities  of a Participant  or his/her  spouse or
Beneficiary,  and any attempt to alienate,  sell,  transfer,  assign,  pledge or
otherwise  encumber any such benefit,  whether presently or thereafter  payable,
shall be void.  Subject to the  foregoing  exception,  no benefit under the Plan
shall be  subject  in any  manner to  alienation,  sale,  transfer,  assignment,
pledge,  attachment,  garnishment or encumbrance of any kind. In accordance with
procedures  consistent  with Code  section  414(p) that are  established  by the
Committee  (including  procedures  requiring prompt notification of the affected
Participant  and  each  Alternate  Payee of the  Plan's  receipt  of a  domestic
relations order and its procedures for determining the qualified  status of such
order),  judicial orders for purposes of enforcing family support obligations or
pertaining to domestic  relations (which orders do not alter the amount,  timing
or form of  benefit  other  than to have it  commence  at the  earliest  legally
permissible date) shall be honored by the Plan if the Committee  determines that
they constitute Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.  Except as may otherwise be
required by regulations of the Secretary of Labor, such orders may not require a
retroactive  transfer  of all or part of a  Participant's  Account to or for the
benefit of an Alternate Payee without  permitting an appropriate  adjustment for
earnings and investment  gains or losses that have occurred in the interim,  nor
shall such orders  require the Plan to provide loans,  self-directed  investment
elections,  or other  rights  to  Alternate  Payees  that are not  available  to
Beneficiaries generally. To the full extent permitted by Code section 414(p)(10)
and by the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, amounts assigned to an
Alternate  Payee may be paid as soon as possible in a lump sum,  notwithstanding
the age, financial  hardship,  employment status, or other factors affecting the
ability  of the  Participant  to  make  a  withdrawal  or  otherwise  receive  a
distribution  of balances to his/her  credit under the Plan. In cases where such
full and prompt  payment of amounts  assigned to an Alternate  Payee will not be
made, the assigned  amounts will be transferred  within a reasonable time to the
Income Fund and, pending payment, shall be maintained in a separate Account, for
the benefit of the Alternate Payee.

     14.5  INCOMPETENCY.  Every person receiving or claiming  benefits under the
Plan shall be  conclusively  presumed to be mentally  competent and of age until
the date on which the Committee  receives a written notice, in a form and manner
acceptable to the Committee,  that such person is  incompetent  or a minor,  for
whom a guardian or other person  legally  vested with the care of his/her person
or estate has been  appointed;  provided,  however,  that if the Committee shall
find that any person to whom a benefit  is  payable  under the Plan is unable to
care for his/her affairs because of incompetency, or is a minor, any payment due
(unless a prior claim therefor  shall have been made by a duly  appointed  legal
representative)  may be paid to the  spouse,  a child,  a parent or a brother or
sister, or to any person or institution deemed by the Committee to have incurred
expense for such person otherwise  entitled to payment.  To the extent permitted
by law,  any such  payment so made shall be a complete  discharge  of  liability
therefor under the Plan.

In the event a  guardian  of the  estate of any  person  receiving  or  claiming
benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction,
benefit  payments  may be made to such  guardian  provided  that proper proof of
appointment  and  continuing  qualification  is  furnished  in a form and manner
acceptable to the Committee. To the extent permitted by law, any such payment so
made shall be a complete discharge of any liability therefor under the Plan.

     14.6  SEVERABILITY.  In the event any  provision of this Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any  reason,  such  illegality  or  invalidity  shall not
affect the remaining  parts of this Plan, and it shall be construed and enforced
as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

     14.7  MISSING  PERSONS AND OTHER BARS TO PAYMENT. If the Committee shall be
unable to make payment to any Participant or Beneficiary because the whereabouts
of such person cannot be ascertained or because there is an unresolved  question
about who is  entitled  to the  payment or how the  payment  is to be made,  the
Committee shall delay the payment until it can properly be made and, in the case
of a missing  person or  another  situation  where  the  Committee  is unable to
provide an investment election to a person who is clearly entitled to direct the
investment of the Account balance,  shall direct that the balance in the Account
from which the payment is due shall be invested in the Money Market Fund.  After
an amount has been due and  payable to a missing  person for five years  without
his/her  coming  forth or  providing  a current  address to the  Committee,  the
Committee may mail a notice by registered mail to the last known address of such
person  stating that unless such person  makes  written  reply to the  Committee
within 60 days from the mailing of such notice,  the Committee  will direct that
such  amount and all  further  benefits  with  respect to such  person  shall be
discontinued  and  all  liability  for  the  payment  thereof  shall  terminate;
provided,  however,  that in the  event of the  subsequent  reappearance  of the
Participant or Beneficiary  prior to termination of the Plan, the benefits which
were due and payable and which such person missed shall be paid in a single sum,
and any future benefits due such person shall be reinstated in full.

The  amount  of any  discontinued  interest  shall  be  used to  reduce  Company
Contributions at the end of the two-year period.  The reinstatement of a benefit
shall be  accomplished  by the making of a special  Company  Contribution  in an
amount sufficient to provide the Participant's benefit.

     14.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Plan may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which  shall be deemed to be an  original.  All the  counterparts  shall
constitute but one and the same instrument and may be sufficiently  evidenced by
any one counterpart.

     14.9  SERVICE  OF LEGAL  PROCESS.  The  members  of the  Committee  and the
Secretary of the Company are hereby designated agent of the Plan for the purpose
of receiving service of summons, subpoena or other legal process.

     14.10  HEADINGS OF ARTICLES  AND  SECTIONS.  The  headings of Articles  and
Sections are included solely for  convenience of reference,  and if there is any
conflict between such headings and the text of the Plan, the text shall control.

     14.11  APPLICABLE LAW. The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be governed,
construed and  administered  in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona
with the exception that any Trust  Agreement  which may constitute a part of the
Plan shall be construed  and  enforced in all respects  under and by the laws of
the State in which the Trustee thereunder is located.

                              * * * * * * * * * *

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Del Webb Corporation has caused this instrument to be
executed by its duly authorized representative in a number of counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original even though the others are not produced and
all of which collectively shall be deemed to constitute one instrument.

                              DEL WEBB CORPORATION
                    1995 EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN


                ARTICLE 1. ESTABLISHMENT, PURPOSE, AND DURATION

         1.1  Establishment  of the  Plan.  Del  Webb  Corporation,  a  Delaware
corporation  (hereinafter  referred to as the "Company"),  hereby establishes an
incentive  compensation  plan to be  known  as the "Del  Webb  Corporation  1995
Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan" (hereinafter  referred to as the "Plan"), as
set forth in this  document.  The Plan permits the grant of  Nonqualified  Stock
Options,  Incentive Stock Options,  Restricted  Stock,  Performance  Units,  and
Performance-Based Awards.

         Upon  approval by the Board of  Directors of the Company and subject to
shareholder ratification, the Plan shall become effective as of November 8, 1995
(the  "Effective  Date"),  and shall remain in effect as provided in Section 1.3
herein.

         1.2  Purpose of the Plan.  The  purpose  of the Plan is to promote  the
success, and enhance the value, of the Company by linking the personal interests
of participants to those of Company shareholders,  and by providing Participants
with an incentive for outstanding performance.

         The Plan is further  intended to provide  flexibility to the Company in
its ability to motivate,  attract,  and retain the services of Participants upon
whose  judgment,  interest,  and special  effort the  successful  conduct of its
operation largely is dependent.

         1.3 Duration of the Plan. Subject to approval by the Board of Directors
of the Company and  ratification by the  shareholders  of the Company,  the Plan
shall  commence on the Effective  Date, as described in Section 1.1 herein,  and
shall  remain in  effect,  subject  to the right of the  Board of  Directors  to
terminate the Plan at any time  pursuant to Article 14 herein,  until all Shares
subject to it shall have been  purchased  or  acquired  according  to the Plan's
provisions.  However,  in no event may an Award be granted  under the Plan on or
after November 7, 2005.

                    ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

         2.1  Definitions.  Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall
have the meanings set forth below and, when the meaning is intended, the initial
letter of the word is capitalized:

                  (a) "Award" means, individually or collectively, a grant under
         this Plan of  Nonqualified  Stock  Options,  Incentive  Stock  Options,
         Restricted Stock, Performance Units, or Performance-Based Awards.

                  (b) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning ascribed to such
         term in Rule  13d-3 of the  General  Rules  and  Regulations  under the
         Exchange Act.

                  (c)  "Board"  or  "Board  of  Directors"  means  the  Board of
         Directors of Del Webb Corporation.

                  (d) "Cause"  means:  (i) willful and gross  misconduct  on the
         part of a Participant that is materially and  demonstrably  detrimental
         to the Company;  or (ii) the commission by a Participant of one or more

         3.1  The  Committee.  The  Plan  shall  be  administered  by the  Human
Resources  Committee of the Board,  or by any other  Committee  appointed by the
Board  consisting of not less than two (2) Directors who are not Employees.  The
members  of the  Committee  shall be  appointed  from time to time by, and shall
serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors.

         Except as permitted under Section 16b-3(c)(2)(i)(A),  (B), (C), and (D)
of the Exchange Act, no member of the  Committee  shall have received a grant of
an  Award  under  the  Plan or any  similar  Plan of the  Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries  while serving on the  Committee,  or shall have so received such a
grant  at any  time  within  one (l) year  prior  to his or her  service  on the
Committee,  or, if different,  for the time period just necessary to fulfill the
then current Rule 16b-3 requirements under the Exchange Act. However, if for any
reason the Committee does not qualify to administer the Plan, as contemplated by
Rule  16b-3 of the  Exchange  Act,  the  Board of  Directors  may  appoint a new
Committee so as to comply with Rule 16b-3.

         3.2 Authority of the  Committee.  The  Committee  shall have full power
except as limited by law or by the  Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of the
Company,  and subject to the provisions  herein, to determine the size and types
of Awards;  to  determine  the terms and  conditions  of such Awards in a manner
consistent with the Plan; to cancel and reissue any Awards granted  hereunder in
the event the Award lapses for any reason (provided that the Committee shall not
have the authority to reprice previously issued and currently outstanding Awards
without  shareholder  approval);  to  construe  and  interpret  the Plan and any
agreement or instrument  entered into under the Plan; to  establish,  amend,  or
waive rules and regulations for the Plan's  administration;  and (subject to the
provisions  of  Article  14  herein)  to amend the terms and  conditions  of any
outstanding  Award to the  extent  such  terms and  conditions  are  within  the
discretion  of the  Committee as provided in the Plan.  Further,  the  Committee
shall make all other  determinations which may be necessary or advisable for the
administration  of the Plan. As permitted by law, the Committee may delegate its
authorities as identified hereunder.

         3.3 Decisions  Binding.  All  determinations  and decisions made by the
Committee  pursuant  to the  provisions  of the Plan and all  related  orders or
resolutions of the Board of Directors shall be final, conclusive, and binding on

Hundred  Thousand  (1,200,000)  Shares may be either  authorized but unissued or
reacquired Shares.

         4.2 Lapsed  Awards.  If any Award  granted under this Plan is canceled,
terminates,  expires, or lapses for any reason, any Shares subject to such Award
again shall be available for the grant of an Award under the Plan.

         4.3  Adjustments  in  Authorized  Shares.  In the event of any  merger,
reorganization, consolidation,  recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock
dividend,  split-up,  Share  combination,  or  other  change  in  the  corporate
structure of the Company affecting the Shares,  such adjustment shall be made in
the number and class of Shares which may be delivered under the Plan, and in the
number and class of and/or price of Shares  subject to  outstanding  Options and
Restricted  Stock granted under the Plan, as may be determined to be appropriate
and equitable by the Committee,  in its sole discretion,  to prevent dilution or
enlargement  of rights;  and provided  that the number of Shares  subject to any
Award shall always be a whole number.

         4.4  Limitation on Number of Shares  Subject to Award.  Notwithstanding
any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the maximum number of shares of Stock
that may be subject to one or more Awards  granted to any one  Participant  over
the term of the Plan shall be 400,000.

Award.  No Employee shall have any right to be granted an Award under this Plan.

confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company.

                            ARTICLE 6. STOCK OPTIONS

         6.1 Grant of Options.  Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan,
Options may be granted to  Employees  at any time and from time to time as shall
be  determined  by  the  Committee.  The  Committee  shall  have  discretion  in
determining the number of Shares subject to Options granted to each Participant.
The Committee may grant ISOs, NQSOs, or a combination  thereof.  Nothing in this
Article 6 shall be deemed to prevent the grant of NQSOs in excess of the maximum
established by Section 422(d) of the Code.

         6.2 Option Agreement. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Option
Agreement that shall specify the Option Price,  the duration of the Option,  the
number of Shares to which the Option pertains,  and such other provisions as the
Committee shall  determine.  The Option Agreement also shall specify whether the
Option is  intended  to be an ISO within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
or a NQSO whose grant is intended  not to fall under the  provisions  of Section
422 of the Code.

         6.3 Option  Price.  The Option  Price for each grant of an Option shall
not be less than one hundred  percent  (100%) of the Fair  Market  Value of such
Share on the date the Option is granted.

         6.4  Duration of Options.  Each Option shall expire at such time as the
Committee  shall  determine  at the time of grant;  provided,  however,  that no
Option shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th)  anniversary date of its
grant.

         6.5  Exercise  of  Options.  Options  granted  under the Plan  shall be
exercisable at such times and be subject to such  restrictions and conditions as
the  Committee  shall in each instance  approve,  which need not be the same for
each grant or for each Participant.  However, in no event may any Option granted
under this Plan become exercisable prior to six (6) months following the date of
its grant.

         6.6  Payment.  Options  shall be exercised by the delivery of a written
notice of exercise to the Secretary of the Company,  setting forth the number of
Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised,  accompanied by full
payment for the Shares.

         The Option  Price upon  exercise of any Option  shall be payable to the
Company  in full  either:  (a) in cash or its  equivalent,  or (b) by  tendering
previously  acquired  Shares  having a Fair Market Value at the time of exercise
equal to the total  Option  Price  (provided  that the Shares which are tendered
must have  been held by the  Participant  for at least six (6)  months  prior to
their tender to satisfy the Option  Price),  or (c) by a combination  of (a) and
(b).

         The  Committee  also may allow  cashless  exercise as  permitted  under
Federal  Reserve  Board's  Regulation  T, subject to applicable  securities  law
restrictions,  or by any  other  means  which  the  Committee  determines  to be
consistent  with the Plan's purpose and applicable law. The proceeds from such a
payment shall be added to the general funds of the Company and shall be used for
general corporate purposes.

         As soon as  practicable  after  receipt  of a written  notification  of
exercise and full payment, the Company shall deliver to the Participant,  in the
Participant's  name, Share  certificates in an appropriate amount based upon the
number of Shares purchased under the Option(s).

         6.7 Restrictions on Share  Transferability.  The Committee shall impose
such  restrictions on any Shares acquired  pursuant to the exercise of an Option
under  the  Plan,  as it may  deem  advisable,  including,  without  limitation,
restrictions under applicable Federal securities laws, under the requirements of
any stock  exchange  or market  upon which such  Shares are then  listed  and/or
traded,  and  under any blue sky or state  securities  laws  applicable  to such
Shares.

         6.8 Termination of Employment Due to Death, Disability, or Retirement.

                  (a)  Termination  by Death.  In the event the  employment of a
         Participant is terminated by reason of death,  any outstanding  Options
         granted  to that  Participant  which are vested as of the date of death
         shall remain exercisable at any time prior to their expiration date, or
         for one (1)  year  after  the  date  that  employment  was  terminated,
         whichever  period is  shorter,  by such person or persons as shall have
         been named as the  Participant's  beneficiary,  or by such persons that
         have acquired the  Participant's  rights under the Option by will or by
         the laws of descent and distribution.

         The portion of any outstanding Option which is deemed vested under this
         Plan as of the  date of  employment  termination  shall  be  determined
         according to the following guidelines:

                           (i) The portion of the Option which is exercisable as
         of the date of employment termination shall remain exercisable;

                           (ii) The  percentage  vesting  of the  portion of the
         Option  which  otherwise  would have vested at the end of the  calendar
         year in which employment termination occurs, will equal a fraction, the
         numerator of which is the number of full weeks of employment during the
         calendar  year  in  which  employment   termination   occurs,  and  the
         denominator of which is fifty-two (52); and

                           (iii) The portion of the Option which is scheduled to
         vest in a year which begins after the end of the calendar year in which
         employment  termination occurs, and the portion of the Option that does
         not vest in the year in which employment  termination occurs,  shall be
         forfeited  by the  Participant  and  returned to the Company (and shall
         once again be available for grant under the Plan).

         Any  Options  which  are  not  vested  as of  the  date  of  employment
termination shall expire  immediately,  and may not be exercised  following such
time.

                  (b) Termination by Disability.  In the event the employment of
         a Participant  is terminated by reason of Disability,  any  outstanding
         Options granted to that Participant which are vested as of the date the
         Committee   determines  the  definition  of  Disability  to  have  been
         satisfied,  shall  remain  exercisable  at  any  time  prior  to  their
         expiration  date, or for one (l) year after the date that the Committee
         determines  the  definition  of  Disability  to  have  been  satisfied,
         whichever period is shorter.

         The portion of any outstanding  Option which is deemed vested as of the
date the  definition of  Disability is determined to have been  satisfied by the
Committee  shall  be  determined   pursuant  to  the  guidelines  set  forth  in
Subparagraphs (a)(i) through (a)(iii) of this Section 6.8.

         Any  Options  that are not  vested  as of the date  that the  Committee
determines  the  definition of Disability to have been  satisfied,  shall expire
immediately, and may not be exercised following such date.

                  (c) Termination by Retirement.  In the event the employment of
         a Participant  is terminated by reason of Retirement,  any  outstanding
         Options  granted  to  that  Participant  which  are  vested  as of  the
         effective  date of  Retirement,  shall remain  exercisable  at any time
         prior to their  expiration  date,  or for  three  (3)  years  after the
         effective date of Retirement, whichever period is shorter.

         The portion of any outstanding  Option which is deemed vested as of the
effective date of Retirement shall be determined  pursuant to the guidelines set
forth in Subparagraphs a(i) through a(iii) of this Section 6.8.

         Any Options which are not vested as of the effective date of Retirement
shall expire immediately, and may not be exercised following such date.

                  (d) Exercise Limitations on ISOs. In the case of ISOs, the tax
         treatment prescribed under Section 422 of the Code may not be available
         if the Options are not exercised within the Section 422 prescribed time
         periods after each of the various types of employment termination.

         Notwithstanding  the exercise periods  described in Subparagraphs  (a),
(b),  and (c)  above,  the  Committee  shall  have  the  authority,  in its sole
discretion, to accelerate the vesting of Options which are outstanding as of the
date of employment  termination for one of the reasons described in this Section
6.8.

         6.9 Termination of Employment for Other Reasons. If the employment of a
Participant  shall terminate for any reason (other than the reasons set forth in
Section 6.8 or for Cause),  all Options  held by the  Participant  which are not
vested as of the effective date of employment  termination  immediately shall be
forfeited to the Company (and shall once again become  available for grant under
the Plan). However, the Committee, in its sole discretion,  shall have the right
to immediately vest all or any portion of such Options, subject to such terms as
the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

         Options  which  are  vested  as of the  effective  date  of  employment
termination may be exercised by the Participant  within the period  beginning on
the effective date of employment termination,  and ending three (3) months after
such date.

         If the  employment of a  Participant  shall  terminate  for Cause,  all
outstanding  Options held by the Participant  immediately  shall be forfeited to
the Company and no additional  exercise  period shall be allowed,  regardless of
the vested status of the Options.

         6.10 Nontransferability of Options. Each Incentive Stock Option granted
under the Plan may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or otherwise
alienated  or  hypothecated,  other than by will or by the laws of  descent  and
distribution;  each  other  Option  granted  under the Plan may be  transferable
subject to the terms and  conditions as may be  established  by the Committee in
accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act, or any other
applicable  law or  regulation.  Further,  all Options  granted to a Participant
under the Plan  shall be  exercisable  during his or her  lifetime  only by such
Participant.

                          ARTICLE 7. RESTRICTED STOCK

         7.1 Grant of Restricted  Stock.  Subject to the terms and provisions of
the Plan, the Committee,  at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of
Restricted  Stock to eligible  Employees in such amounts as the Committee  shall
determine;  provided that the total number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted
under  this Plan  shall not  exceed One  Hundred  Thousand  (100,000)  Shares of
Restricted Stock.

         7.2 Restricted  Stock  Agreement.  Each Restricted Stock grant shall be
evidenced  by a  Restricted  Stock  Agreement  that shall  specify the Period of
Restriction, or Periods, the number of Restricted Stock Shares granted, and such
other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

         7.3  Transferability.  Except as provided in this Article 7, the Shares
of  Restricted  Stock  granted  herein  may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged,
assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable
Period  of  Restriction  established  by  the  Committee  and  specified  in the
Restricted  Stock  Agreement,   or  upon  earlier   satisfaction  of  any  other
conditions,  as specified by the Committee in its sole  discretion and set forth
in the Restricted Stock Agreement. However, in no event may any Restricted Stock
granted under the Plan become  vested in a  Participant  prior to six (6) months
following the date of its grant. All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock
granted to a  Participant  under the Plan shall be  available  during his or her
lifetime only to such Participant.

         7.4  Other   Restrictions.   The  Committee  shall  impose  such  other
restrictions on any Shares of Restricted  Stock granted  pursuant to the Plan as
it may deem advisable including, without limitation, restrictions based upon the
achievement of specific  performance  goals  (Company-wide,  divisional,  and/or
individual),  and/or  restrictions  under applicable Federal or state securities
laws;  and may legend the  certificates  representing  Restricted  Stock to give
appropriate notice of such restrictions.

         7.5  Certificate   Legend.   In  addition  to  any  legends  placed  on
certificates  pursuant  to Section  7.4 herein,  each  certificate  representing
Shares of Restricted  Stock granted  pursuant to the Plan may bear the following
legend:

                  "The sale or other transfer of the Shares of Stock represented
         by this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of
         law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the
         Del Webb Corporation 1995 Executive  Long-Term Incentive Plan, and in a
         Restricted  Stock  Agreement.  A copy of the Plan  and such  Restricted
         Stock  Agreement  may be  obtained  from  the  Secretary  of  Del  Webb
         Corporation."

         7.6  Removal of  Restrictions.  Except as  otherwise  provided  in this
Article 7, Shares of  Restricted  Stock covered by each  Restricted  Stock grant
made under the Plan shall become freely  transferable by the  Participant  after
the last day of the Period of Restriction. Once the Shares are released from the
restrictions,  the Participant  shall be entitled to have the legend required by
Section 7.5 removed from his or her Share certificate.

         7.7  Voting  Rights.  During the  Period of  Restriction,  Participants
holding  Shares of Restricted  Stock granted  hereunder may exercise full voting
rights with respect to those Shares.

         7.8   Dividends   and  Other   Distributions.   During  the  Period  of
Restriction,  Participants  holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder
shall be entitled to receive all  dividends  and other  distributions  paid with
respect  to  those  Shares  while  they are so held.  If any such  dividends  or
distributions  are paid in  Shares,  the  Shares  shall be  subject  to the same
restrictions on  transferability  and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted
Stock with respect to which they were paid.

         7.9 Termination of Employment. If the employment of a Participant shall
terminate  for any reason,  except as determined by the Committee at the time of
such  termination for any reason other than for Cause,  all nonvested  Shares of
Restricted  Stock held by the Participant  upon the effective date of employment
termination  immediately  shall be  forfeited  and  returned to the Company (and
shall once  again  become  available  for grant  under the Plan).  The number of
Shares of Restricted  Stock which are deemed vested as of the effective  date of
employment  termination shall be determined pursuant to the guidelines set forth
with  respect to the vesting of Options,  as  specified  in Sections 6.8 and 6.9
herein.

                          ARTICLE 8. PERFORMANCE UNITS

         8.1  Grant of  Performance  Units.  Subject  to the  terms of the Plan,
Performance Units may be granted to eligible Employees at any time and from time
to time,  as shall be  determined by the  Committee.  The  Committee  shall have
complete  discretion in determining  the number of Performance  Units granted to
each Participant.

         8.2 Value of Performance  Units.  Each  Performance  Unit shall have an
initial value that is  established  by the  Committee at the time of grant.  The
Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which,  depending on the
extent  to  which  they are met,  will  determine  the  number  and/or  value of
Performance  Units that will be paid out to the  Participants.  The time  period
during which the performance  goals must be met shall, in all cases,  exceed six
(6) months in length.

         8.3 Earning of  Performance  Units.  After the  applicable  time period
during  which the goals must be met,  the holder of  Performance  Units shall be
entitled  to receive  payout on the number of  Performance  Units  earned by the
Participant  over such period,  to be  determined as a function of the extent to
which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

         8.4 Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units.  Payment of earned
Performance  Units shall be made in a single lump sum,  within  forty-five  (45)
calendar days following the close of the applicable time period during which the
goals  must be met.  The  Committee,  in its  sole  discretion,  may pay  earned
Performance Units in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof)
which  have an  aggregate  Fair  Market  Value  equal to the value of the earned
Performance Units at the close of such period.

         Prior to the  beginning of each time period during which the goals must
be met,  Participants  may elect to defer the receipt of Performance Unit payout
upon such terms as the Committee deems appropriate.

         8.5 Termination of Employment Due to Death, Disability,  Retirement, or
Involuntary  Termination  (without  Cause).  In the  event the  employment  of a
Participant  is  terminated  by  reason  of death,  Disability,  Retirement,  or
involuntary   termination   without  Cause  during  a  Performance  Period,  the
Participant  shall  receive a  prorated  payout of the  Performance  Units.  The
prorated  payout shall be determined by the Committee,  in its sole  discretion,
based upon the guidelines  set forth with respect to the vesting of Options,  as
specified  in Sections  6.8 and 6.9 herein,  and further  adjusted  based on the
achievement of the preestablished performance goals.

         Payment  of  earned  Performance  Units  shall be made at the same time
payments are made to Participants  who did not terminate  employment  during the
applicable time period during which the goals must be met.

         8.6  Termination of Employment  for Other Reasons.  In the event that a
Participant  terminates  employment  with the Company for any reason  other than
those reasons set forth in Section 8.5, all Performance Units shall be forfeited
by the  Participant to the Company,  and shall once again be available for grant
under the Plan.

         8.7 Nontransferability. Performance Units may not be sold, transferred,
pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or
by the laws of descent and  distribution.  Further a Participant's  rights under
the Plan shall be  exercisable  during the  Participant's  lifetime  only by the
Participant or the Participant's legal representative.

                      ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS

         9.1 Purpose.  The purpose of this Article 9 is to provide the Committee
the ability to qualify  the  Restricted  Stock  Awards  under  Article 7 and the
Performance  Unit Awards  under  Article 8 as  "performance-based  compensation"
under Section 162(m) of the Code. If the Committee,  in its discretion,  decides
to grant a Performance-Based Award to a Covered Employee, the provisions of this
Article 9 shall control over any contrary  provision  contained in Articles 7 or
8.

         9.2  Applicability.  This  Article 9 shall apply only to those  Covered
Employees  selected by the Committee to receive  Performance-Based  Awards.  The
Committee may, in its discretion,  grant  Restricted Stock Awards or Performance
Unit Awards to Covered  Employees that do not satisfy the  requirements  of this
Article  9.  The  designation  of a  Covered  Employee  as a  Participant  for a
Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive an
Award  for  the  period.  Moreover,  designation  of  a  Covered  Employee  as a
Participant for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of
such Covered Employee as a Participant in any subsequent  Performance Period and
designation  of  one  Covered  Employee  as  a  Participant  shall  not  require
designation of any other Covered Employees as a Participant in such period or in
any other period.

         9.3 Discretion of Committee with Respect to  Performance  Awards.  With
regard  to a  particular  Performance  Period,  the  Committee  shall  have full
discretion  to  select  the  length  of such  Performance  Period,  the  type of
Performance-Based  Awards to be issued, the kind and/or level of the Performance
Goal, and whether the Performance Goal is to apply to the Company,  a Subsidiary
or any division or business unit thereof.

         9.4 Payment of Performance  Awards.  Unless  otherwise  provided in the
relevant  Award  Agreement,  a Participant  must be employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary  on the last  day of the  Performance  Period  to be  eligible  for a
Performance Award for such Performance Period.  Furthermore, a Participant shall
be  eligible  to  receive  payment  under  a  Performance-  Based  Award  for  a
Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.

         In  determining  the  actual  size of an  individual  Performance-Based
Award, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance-Based
Award earned for the Performance Period, if in its sole and absolute discretion,
such reduction or elimination is appropriate.

         9.5 Maximum Award Payable.  Notwithstanding  any provision contained in
the Plan to the contrary, the maximum Performance-Based Award payable to any one
Participant  under the Plan for a Performance  Period is  Seventy-five  Thousand
(75,000) Shares,  or in the event the  Performance-Based  Award is paid in cash,
such  maximum   Performance-Based  Award  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying
Seventy-five  Thousand  (75,000) by the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the
date of grant of the Performance-Based Award.

                      ARTICLE 10. BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

         Each  Participant  under  the Plan  may,  from  time to time,  name any
beneficiary or beneficiaries  (who may be named contingently or successively) to
whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before
he or she  receives  any or all of such  benefit.  Each such  designation  shall
revoke  all  prior  designations  by the  same  Participant,  shall be in a form
prescribed  by the  Company,  and  will be  effective  only  when  filed  by the
Participant in writing with the Human Resource  Department of the Company during
the Participant's  lifetime.  In the absence of any such  designation,  benefits
remaining unpaid at the  Participant's  death shall be paid to the Participant's
estate.

                             ARTICLE 11. DEFERRALS

         The  Committee  may permit a  Participant  to defer such  Participant's
receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be
due to such  Participant  by virtue of the  exercise of an Option,  the lapse or
waiver of restrictions  with respect to Restricted Stock, or the satisfaction of
any  requirements  or goals  with  respect  to  Performance  Units.  If any such
deferral  election is required or permitted,  the Committee  shall,  in its sole
discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals.

                        ARTICLE 12. RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES

         12.1  Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in
any way the right of the Company to terminate  any  Participant's  employment at
any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of
the Company.

         For  purposes of the Plan,  transfer  of  employment  of a  Participant
between the Company and any one of its  Subsidiaries  (or between  Subsidiaries)
shall not be deemed a termination of employment.

         12.2 Participation.  No Employee shall have the right to be selected to
receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to
receive a future Award.

                         ARTICLE 13. CHANGE IN CONTROL

         Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Change  in  Control,   unless   otherwise
specifically prohibited by the terms of Article 17 herein:

                  (a)  Any  and  all  Options  granted  hereunder  shall  become
         immediately exercisable;

                  (b)  Any  restriction  periods  and  restrictions  imposed  on
         Restricted  Shares shall lapse, and within ten (10) business days after
         the  occurrence  of  a  Change  in  Control,   the  stock  certificates
         representing  Shares of Restricted  Stock,  without any restrictions or
         legend thereon, shall be delivered to the applicable Participants;

                  (c) The target value  attainable  under all Performance  Units
         shall be deemed to have been fully  earned  for the entire  Performance
         Period as of the effective  date of the Change in Control,  except that
         all Performance  Units which shall have been  outstanding less than six
         (6) months on the effective  date of the Change in Control shall not be
         deemed to have earned the target value; and

                  (d) Subject to Article 14 herein, the Committee shall have the
         authority to make any  modifications to the Awards as determined by the
         Committee to be appropriate  before the effective date of the Change in
         Control.

              ARTICLE 14. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION

         14.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. With the approval of the
Board, at any time and from time to time, the Committee may terminate, amend, or
modify the Plan.  However,  without  the  approval  of the  stockholders  of the
Company (as may be required by the Code, by the insider trading rules of Section
16 of the Exchange Act, by any national  securities  exchange or system on which
the  Shares  are  then  listed  or  reported,  or by a  regulatory  body  having
jurisdiction   with  respect  hereto)  no  such   termination,   amendment,   or
modification may:

                  (a)  Increase  the total  amount of Shares which may be issued
         under this Plan, except as provided in Section 4.3 herein; or

                  (b) Change the class of Employees  eligible to  participate in
         the Plan; or

                  (c)  Materially  increase  the cost of the Plan or  materially
         increase the benefits to Participants; or

                  (d) Extend the maximum  period  after the date of grant during
         which Options may be exercised.

         14.2  Awards  Previously   Granted.  No  termination,   amendment,   or
modification  of the  Plan  shall  in any  manner  adversely  affect  any  Award
previously   granted  under  the  Plan,  without  the  written  consent  of  the
Participant holding such Award.

                            ARTICLE 15. WITHHOLDING

         15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to
deduct or withhold,  or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient  to  satisfy   Federal,   state,   and  local  taxes  (including  the
Participant's  FICA  obligation)  required by law to be withheld with respect to
any grant, exercise, or payment made under or as a result of this Plan.

         15.2 Share Withholding.  With respect to withholding  required upon the
exercise of Options, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock, or upon
any other taxable event, Participants shall satisfy all federal, state and local
tax  withholding  requirements  by having the  Company  withhold  Shares (to the
extent that Shares are issued  pursuant to the Award) having a Fair Market Value
on the date the tax is to be determined  equal to the maximum marginal total tax
which would be imposed on the transaction.

                             ARTICLE 16. SUCCESSORS

         All  obligations of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Awards
granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the
existence  of such  successor  is the result of a direct or  indirect  purchase,
merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.

                        ARTICLE 17. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW

         17.1  Requirements  of Law.  The granting of Awards and the issuance of
Shares  under the Plan shall be  subject  to all  applicable  laws,  rules,  and
regulations,  and to such  approvals  by any  governmental  agencies or national
securities exchanges as may be required.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in the Plan, if required
by the then current Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, any "derivative  security or
equity security"  offered pursuant to the Plan to any Insider may not be sold or
transferred  for at least six (6) months  after the date of grant of such Award,
except in the case of the death, disability, or termination of employment of the
Participant.  The terms "equity  security" and "derivative  security" shall have
the  meanings  ascribed to them in the then  current  Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange
Act.

         17.2 Governing Law. The Plan,  and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

                                 EXHIBIT 10.26

                              DEL WEBB CORPORATION
                            1995 DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN


                ARTICLE 1. ESTABLISHMENT, PURPOSE, AND DURATION

         1.1  Establishment  of the  Plan.  Del  Webb  Corporation,  a  Delaware
corporation  (the  "Company"),  hereby  establishes a stock plan for Nonemployee
Directors,  to be known as the "Del Webb  Corporation  1995 Director Stock Plan"
(the "Plan"),  as set forth in this  document.  The Plan permits the deferral of
Directors'  Annual  Retainers  into  grants of  Nonqualified  Stock  Options and
Restricted  Stock, and sets forth the terms of annual grants of Stock Options to
Nonemployee Directors, subject to the terms and provisions set forth herein.

         Upon approval by the Board of Directors of the Company, and conditioned
upon subsequent  approval of the Plan by the  shareholders  of the Company,  the
Plan shall become effective as of November 8, 1995 (the "Effective  Date"),  and
shall remain in effect as provided in Section 1.3 herein.  Without  limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, the Plan and the grant of Awards thereunder will
be void ab initio,  and of no force and effect,  if the Plan is not  approved by
the Company's shareholders on or before November 8, 1995.

         1.2  Purpose of the Plan.  The  purpose  of the Plan is to promote  the
achievement  of  long-term  objectives  of the Company by linking  the  personal
interests  of  Nonemployee  Directors to those of Company  shareholders,  and to
attract and retain Nonemployee Directors of outstanding competence.

         1.3  Duration of the Plan.  The Plan shall  commence  on the  Effective
Date, as described in Section 1.1 herein, and shall remain in effect, subject to
the right of the Board of Directors to terminate  the Plan at any time  pursuant
to Article 9 or Section 10.3 herein,  until all Shares  subject to it shall have
been purchased or acquired  according to the Plan's provisions.  However,  in no
event may an Award be granted under the Plan on or after November 7, 2005.

                    ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

         2.1  Definitions.  Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall
have the meanings set forth below and, when the meaning is intended, the initial
letter of the word is capitalized:

                  (a)  "Annual  Retainer"  means the annual  fee  payable by the
         Company to a  Director,  including  amounts  payable  for  service as a
         chairperson of a committee of the Board, but excluding meeting fees.

                  (b) "Award" means,  individually or  collectively,  a grant of
         Nonqualified Stock Options or Restricted Stock under this Plan.

                  (c) "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning ascribed to such
         term in Rule  13d-3 of the  General  Rules  and  Regulations  under the
         Exchange Act.

                  (d)  "Board"  or  "Board  of  Directors"  means  the  Board of
         Directors of Del Webb  Corporation,  and includes any  committee of the
         Board of Directors designated by the Board to administer part or all of
         this Plan.

                  (e) "Change in Control" of the Company shall be deemed to have
         occurred if (i) any  "person"  (as such term is used in Sections  13(d)
         and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than a trustee or other fiduciary
         holding  securities  under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a
         corporation  owned  directly or indirectly by the  stockholders  of the
         Company in  substantially  the same  proportions as their  ownership of
         stock of the Company,  is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
         in Rule 13d-3  under the  Exchange  Act),  directly or  indirectly,  of
         securities of the Company  representing 20% or more of the total voting
         power  represented by the Company's then outstanding  Voting Securities
         (defined as any  securities of the Company which vote  generally in the
         election of  directors),  or (ii) during any period of two  consecutive
         years,  individuals who at the beginning of such period  constitute the
         Board of Directors of the Company and any new director  whose  election
         by the Board of Directors or  nomination  for election by the Company's
         stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
         directors  then  still in  office  who  either  were  directors  at the
         beginning of the period or whose  election or  nomination  for election
         was  previously  so  approved,  cease for any  reason to  constitute  a
         majority  thereof,  or (iii) the  stockholders of the Company approve a
         merger or  consolidation  of the  Company  with any other  corporation,
         other than a merger or  consolidation  which would result in the Voting

         3.2  Administration  by the  Committee.  The Committee  shall have full
power,  discretion,  and  authority to interpret and  administer  this Plan in a
manner which is  consistent  with the Plan's  provisions.  However,  in no event
shall the Committee  have the power to (i)  determine  Plan  eligibility,  or to
determine the number,  the price, the vesting period, or the timing of Awards to
be made  under the Plan to any  Participant,  or (ii) take an action  that would

         3.3 Decisions  Binding.  All  determinations  and decisions made by the

authorized  and  unissued  Shares  or  Shares  reacquired  by  the  Company,  as
determined by the Committee.

         4.2 Lapsed Awards.  If any Option or Share of Restricted  Stock granted

subject to purchase  pursuant  to such Option and any such Shares of  Restricted

         4.3  Adjustments  in  Authorized  Shares.  In the event of any  merger,
reorganization, consolidation,  recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock

such event.  Any adjustment  pursuant to this Section 4.3 will be conclusive and
binding for all purposes of this Plan.

                    ARTICLE 5. ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

         5.1  Eligibility.  Persons  eligible  to  participate  in this Plan are
limited to Nonemployee Directors.

         5.2 Actual  Participation.  All eligible  Nonemployee  Directors  shall
receive grants of Options  pursuant to Article 7 herein,  and shall be given the
opportunity  to defer all or a portion of their  Annual  Retainers  into Options
and/or  Restricted  Stock,  pursuant  to the terms and  provisions  set forth in
Article 6 herein.

                    ARTICLE 6. DEFERRAL OF ANNUAL RETAINERS

         6.1 Deferral Election. On or before December 31 of each year during the
term of this Plan, each Nonemployee  Director shall have the ability to elect to
defer any portion or all of his or her Annual Retainer, pursuant to the terms of
this Article 6. Deferrals may, at the discretion of the Director, be made in the
form of discounted Options or Restricted Stock, or combination thereof.

         The deferral election shall be irrevocable,  and shall be made by means
of a written  notice  delivered  to the  Secretary  of the  Company on or before
December  31 of the  calendar  year  which ends  prior to the  beginning  of the
applicable  fiscal year. The deferral election shall state the percentage and/or
dollar amount of the Director's  Annual Retainer,  which is to be deferred,  and
shall  specify  whether the  deferral is to be in the form of  discounted  Stock
Options or Restricted Stock, or combination thereof.

         Each  deferral  election by a Director  shall  correspond to the Annual
Retainer  which is to be earned by the  Director for the  Company's  fiscal year
which begins in the first calendar year following the calendar year in which the
deferral  election is made. For example,  a deferral election made by a Director
on December 31, 1995 will  correspond to a deferral of an Annual  Retainer which
is to be earned by the Director  during the fiscal year  beginning July 1, 1996,
and ending June 30, 1997.

         The  effective  date of the Award  grant  relating  to Annual  Retainer
deferrals  shall be the  Grant  Date  which  falls in the  first  calendar  year
following the calendar year in which the applicable  deferral  election is made.
Accordingly,  the Option price of Stock Options granted pursuant to Article 6 of
this Plan shall equal  seventy-five  percent  (75%) of the Fair Market  Value of
Shares on the Grant Date. Awards of Restricted Stock pursuant to Annual Retainer
deferrals under this Plan also shall be made on the Grant Date.

         6.2      Terms of Stock Option Deferrals.

                  (a) Number of Shares under Option.  The number of shares which
         may be purchased under Options  pursuant to Annual  Retainer  deferrals
         shall be derived according to the following formula:

Number of Shares      =                   Amount of Deferral
                         -------------------------------------------------------
                            0.25 x Fair Market Value of Shares at Grant Date

                  The Option price for each Share granted  pursuant to an Annual
         Retainer  deferral shall equal  seventy-five  percent (75%) of the Fair
         Market  Value of a Share on the Grant Date.  Options  are issued  using
         this formula to give the  Director  who is deferring  his or her Annual
         Retainer an equivalent economic value.

                  (b) Vesting of Options.  Options  granted under this Article 6
         shall vest one  hundred  percent  (100%) at the end of the sixth  month
         following the date of grant of the Options.

                  (c)  Individual  Award  Agreement.  Each Option grant shall be
         evidenced by an Individual  Award  Agreement  that will not include any
         terms or conditions that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions
         of this Plan.

                  (d) Duration of Options. Unless earlier terminated, forfeited,
         or surrendered  pursuant to a provision of this Plan, each Option shall
         expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary date of its grant.

                  (e) Payment.  Options  shall be exercised by the delivery of a
         written  notice of exercise to the  Secretary of the  Company,  setting
         forth the  number of Shares  with  respect to which the Option is to be
         exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares.

                  The Option price upon  exercise of any Option shall be payable
         to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent, or (b) by
         tendering  previously acquired Shares having a Fair Market Value at the
         time of exercise  equal to the total  Option Price  (provided  that the
         Shares  tendered upon Option exercise have been held by the Participant
         for at least six (6) months prior to their tender to satisfy the Option
         Price),  or (c) by a combination of (a) and (b). The proceeds from such
         a payment  shall be added to the general funds of the Company and shall
         be used for general corporate purposes.

                  (f)  Restrictions  on  Share  Transferability.  To the  extent
         necessary  to  ensure  that  Awards  granted   hereunder   comply  with
         applicable law, the Committee  shall impose  restrictions on any Shares
         acquired  pursuant  to the  exercise  of an  Option  under  this  Plan,
         including,  without  limitation,  restrictions under applicable Federal
         securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market
         upon which such Shares are then  listed  and/or  traded,  and under any
         blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

                  (g) Termination of Service on Board of Directors Due to Death,
         Disability, or Retirement. In the event the service of a Participant on
         the Board is terminated by reason of death,  Disability,  or retirement
         from  the  Board  after  attaining  age  72,  and if a  portion  of the
         Participant's  Award is not fully vested as of the date of  termination
         of service on the Board,  then the portion of the  Participant's  Award
         which is  exercisable  as of the date of  termination of service on the
         Board shall be  determined  by  prorating  the Award  according  to the
         following guidelines:

                           (i) The portion of the Award which is  exercisable as
                  of the date of  termination  of  service  on the  Board  shall
                  remain exercisable;

                           (ii) The  percentage  vesting  of the  portion of the
                  Award  which  otherwise  would  have  vested at the end of the
                  Company's  fiscal year in which  termination of service on the
                  Board occurs, will equal a fraction, the numerator of which is
                  the number of full  weeks of  service on the Board  during the
                  Company's  fiscal year in which  termination  occurs,  and the
                  denominator of which is fifty-two (52); and

                           (iii) The portion of the Award which is  scheduled to
                  vest in a year  which  begins  after the end of the  Company's
                  fiscal  year in which  termination  of  service  on the  Board
                  occurs, and the portion of the Award that does not vest in the
                  Company's  fiscal year in which  termination of service on the
                  Board  occurs,  shall be  forfeited  by the  Participant,  and
                  returned to the Company (and shall once again be available for
                  grant under the Plan).

                  To the extent an Option is exercisable as of the date of death
         (or as of the date of termination by reason of Disability or retirement
         from the Board after attaining age 72, as applicable),  it shall remain
         exercisable  at any time prior to its  expiration  date, or for one (1)
         year after the date of death (or the date of  termination  by reason of
         Disability  or  retirement  from the Board after  attaining  age 72, as
         applicable),  whichever  period is shorter,  by the Participant or such
         person or persons as shall have been named as the  Participant's  legal
         representative  or  beneficiary,  or by such persons that have acquired
         the  Participant's  rights  under the  Option by will or by the laws of
         descent and distribution.

                  (h)  Termination  of Service on Board of  Directors  for Other
         Reasons. If the service of the Participant on the Board shall terminate
         for any reason other than death,  Disability,  or  retirement  from the
         Board  after  attaining  age 72, any  outstanding  Options  held by the
         Participant  that are not  exercisable  as of the  date of  termination
         immediately  shall be  forfeited  to the Company  (and shall once again
         become available for grant under the Plan).

                  To the  extent  an  Option  is  exercisable  as of the date of
         termination  of the  Participant's  service  on the  Board  under  this
         Section  6.2(h),  it shall remain  exercisable at any time prior to its
         expiration  date, or for one (1) year after the date the  Participant's
         service on the Board terminates, whichever period is shorter.

                  (i)  Nontransferability  of Options.  No Option  granted under
         this Plan may be sold,  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or otherwise
         alienated or  hypothecated,  other than by will, by the laws of descent
         and  distribution,  or pursuant to Section  10.1 herein.  Further,  all
         Options  granted to a Participant  under this Plan shall be exercisable
         during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.

         6.3      Terms of Restricted Stock Deferrals.

                  (a)  Grants  of  Restricted  Stock.  The  number  of shares of
         Restricted  Stock which shall be granted pursuant to an Annual Retainer
         deferral shall be derived according to the following formula:

Number of Shares      =                   Amount of Deferral
                         -------------------------------------------------------
                               Fair Market Value of Shares at Grant Date


                  Awards of  Restricted  Stock  under this Plan shall be made on
         the Grant  Date  which  falls  within  the first  (1st)  calendar  year
         following the calendar year in which the applicable  deferral  election
         was made.

                  (b) Restricted  Stock  Agreement.  Each Restricted Stock grant
         shall be evidenced by a Restricted  Stock  Agreement that shall specify
         the Period of Restriction,  or Periods,  the number of Restricted Stock
         Shares  granted,  and such  other  provisions  as the  Committee  shall
         determine.

                  (c)  Transferability.  Except  as  provided  in  this  Section
         6.3(c),  the Shares of Restricted Stock granted herein may not be sold,
         transferred,  pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated
         (other  than  pursuant  to Section  10.1  herein)  until the end of the
         applicable Period of Restriction,  as specified in the Restricted Stock
         Agreement.

                  The  Period of  Restriction  for  Shares of  Restricted  Stock
         awarded  pursuant to this Article 6 shall end six (6) months  following
         the Grant Date on which  such  Shares  were  issued.  All  rights  with
         respect to the  Restricted  Stock granted to a Director  under the Plan
         shall be available during his or her lifetime only to such Director.

                  (d) Certificate Legend.  Each certificate  representing Shares
         of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may bear the following
         legend:

                  "The sale or other transfer of the Shares of Stock represented
         by this certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of
         law, is subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the
         Del Webb  Corporation  1995  Director  Stock Plan,  and in a Restricted
         Stock Agreement. A copy of the Plan and such Restricted Stock Agreement
         may be obtained from the Secretary of Del Webb Corporation."

                  (e) Removal of Restrictions.  Except as otherwise  provided in
         this Plan,  Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock
         grant made  under the Plan  shall  become  freely  transferable  by the
         Participant  after the last day of the Period of Restriction.  Once the
         Shares  are  released  from the  restrictions,  the  Director  shall be
         entitled to have the legend required by Section 6.3(d) removed from his
         or her Share certificate.

                  (f) Voting Rights. During the Period of Restriction, Directors
         holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted  hereunder may exercise full
         voting rights with respect to those Shares.

                  (g)  Dividends and Other  Distributions.  During the Period of
         Restriction,  Directors  holding  Shares of  Restricted  Stock  granted
         hereunder  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  all  dividends  and  other
         distributions paid with respect to those Shares while they are so held.
         If any such dividends or distributions  are paid in Shares,  the Shares
         shall  be  subject  to the same  restrictions  on  transferability  and
         forfeitability  as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which
         they were paid.

                  (h) Termination of Service on Board of Directors Due to Death,
         Disability,  or Retirement.  In the event that a Director's  service on
         the Board  terminates  prior to the end of the Period of Restriction by
         reason  of  death,  Disability,  or  retirement  from the  Board  after
         attaining  age  72,  then  the  percentage  vesting  of the  Shares  of
         Restricted  Stock shall be  determined  according  to a  fraction;  the
         numerator  of which is the number of full weeks of service on the Board
         between the applicable  Grant Date and the date the Director's  service
         on the Board  terminates,  and the  denominator  of which is twenty-six
         (26).

                  Within  thirty (30) days after  termination  of service on the
         Board, the Director (or his or her legal  representative)  shall return
         to  the  Company  all  of  the  certificates   representing  Shares  of
         Restricted Stock. As soon as practicable thereafter,  the Company shall
         issue a new  certificate  representing  the number of vested  Shares to
         which the Director is entitled.

                  (i)  Termination  of Service on Board of  Directors  for Other
         Reasons.  If the service of a Director on the Board terminates prior to
         the end of the Period of  Restriction  for  reasons  other than  death,
         Disability,  or retirement  from the Board after attaining age 72, then
         all Shares of  Restricted  Stock that are not vested as of the date the
         Director's  service on the Board  terminates  shall be forfeited to the
         Company  (and shall once again  become  available  for grant  under the
         Plan).  Within thirty (30) days after the termination of service on the
         Board, the Director shall return to the Company all of the certificates
         representing his or her Shares of Restricted Stock.

Shares which may be awarded under this Plan, each Nonemployee  Director shall be
granted an Option to purchase two thousand  (2,000) Shares upon each November 20

the Director under the Del Webb Corporation Director Stock Plan during each such

         7.2 Limitation on Grant of Options. Other than the grant of Options set
forth in Article 6 and in Section 7.1, no  additional  Options  shall be granted

following  vesting  schedule:  one-third  of  the  Options  shall  vest  on  the
anniversary  date of date of grant of the Options,  and one-third of the Options

Board shall impose  restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise
of an Option under this Article 7, including,  without limitation,  restrictions
under  applicable  Federal  securities laws, under the requirements of any stock
exchange or market upon which such Shares are then  listed  and/or  traded,  and
under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

         7.9 Termination of Employment Due to Death, Disability,  or Retirement.
In the event the service of a  Participant  on the Board is terminated by reason
of death,  Disability,  or retirement from the Board after attaining age 72, and
if a portion of the  Participant's  Award is not fully  vested as of the date of
termination of service on the Board, then the portion of the Participant's Award
which is exercisable as of the date of termination of service on the Board shall
be determined according to the guidelines set forth in Section 6.2(g) herein.

         7.10  Termination  of  Service  on the  Board of  Directors  for  Other
Reasons.  If the service of a Participant  on the Board shall  terminate for any
reason  other than for death,  Disability  or  retirement  from the Board  after
attaining age 72, any outstanding  Options held by the Participant  that are not
exercisable  as of the date of  termination  shall be governed by the guidelines
set forth in Section 6.2(h) herein.

         7.11  Nontransferability  of  Options.  No Option  granted  under  this
Article 7 may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or
hypothecated,  other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or
pursuant to Section 10.1 herein.  Further,  all Options granted to a Participant
under this Article 7 shall be  exercisable  during his or her  lifetime  only by
such Participant.

                          ARTICLE 8. CHANGE IN CONTROL

         In the event of a Change in Control of the Company,  all Awards granted
under this Plan that are still  outstanding  and not yet  vested,  shall  become
immediately  one hundred  percent (100%) vested in each  Participant,  as of the
first date that the  definition  of Change in Control  has been  fulfilled,  and
shall  remain  as such for the  remaining  life of the  Award,  as such  life is
provided  herein,  and within the  provisions  of the related  individual  award
agreements entered into with each Participant.  All Options that are exercisable
as of the  effective  date of the Change in Control shall remain as such for the
remaining life of the Options.

              ARTICLE 9. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION

         9.1 Amendment,  Modification, and Termination. Subject to the terms set
forth in this Section 9.1, the Committee may  terminate,  amend,  or modify this
Plan at any time and from  time to time;  provided,  however,  that  shareholder
approval is required for any Plan amendment that would  materially  increase the
benefits  accruing to  Participants  under this Plan,  materially  increase  the
number of securities  which may be issued under this Plan, or materially  modify
the requirements with respect to eligibility for participation in this Plan; and
provided,  further,  that Plan  provisions  relating to the amount,  price,  and
timing of  securities to be awarded under this Plan may not be amended more than
once every six (6) months, other than to comport with changes in the Code or the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

         9.2 Awards Previously Granted.  Unless required by law, no termination,
amendment, or modification of this Plan shall in any manner adversely affect any
Award  previously  granted under this Plan,  without the written  consent of the

from  time to time,  name any  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  (who may be named
contingently or  successively) to whom any benefit under this Plan is to be paid
in the  event of his or her  death.  Each  designation  will  revoke  all  prior
designations  by the  same  Participant,  shall be in a form  prescribed  by the
Committee,  and will be effective only when filed by the  Participant in writing
with the  Committee  during  his or her  lifetime.  In the  absence  of any such
designation,  benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid
to the Participant's estate.

         10.2  Successors.  All obligations of the Company under this Plan, with
respect to Awards  granted  hereunder,  shall be binding on any successor to the
Company,  whether the  existence of such  successor is the result of a direct or
indirect purchase, merger, consolidation,  or otherwise, of all or substantially
all of the business and/or assets of the Company.

         10.3  Requirements  of Law. The granting of Awards under the Plan shall

by  any  governmental  agencies  or  national  securities  exchanges  as  may be
required.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  set forth in this  Plan,  the
Committee may, at its sole discretion,  terminate, amend, or modify this Plan in
any way  necessary  to comply  with the  applicable  requirements  of Rule 16b-3
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission as interpreted pursuant to
no-action letters and interpretive releases.

         10.4 Governing Law. This Plan, and all agreements  hereunder,  shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

                                 EXHIBIT 10.27

              ARTICLE 1. ESTABLISHMENT, AND PURPOSE, AND DURATION

         1.1  Establishment  of the  Plan.  Del  Webb  Corporation,  a  Delaware
corporation (the "Company"),  hereby  establishes an annual incentive plan to be
known as the "Del Webb  Corporation  1995 Executive  Management  Incentive Plan"
(the "Plan").

         1.2  Purpose of the Plan.  The Plan is designed  to (i)  recognize  and
reward on an annual basis select Company  executives for their  contributions to
the overall success of the Company, and (ii) qualify compensation paid under the
Plan as  "performance-based  compensation"  as that term is  defined  in Section
162(m) of the Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986 (the  "Code") and the  regulations
thereunder.

         1.3  Duration  of the  Plan.  Subject  to  approval  by  the  Company's
stockholders,  the Plan will  commence  as of July 1,  1995.  If the Plan is not
approved by the Company's  stockholders,  the Plan will not be effective and any
grants made under the Plan prior to that date will be void. No award may be made
under the Plan after the date the Plan terminates, but awards made prior to that
date may extend beyond that date.

                    ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

         2.1  Definitions.  Whenever used in the Plan, the following terms shall
have the meanings set forth below and, when the meaning is intended, the initial
letter of the word is capitalized:

                  (a)  "Award"  means  the  agreement  of  the  Company  to  pay
         compensation  to  a  Participant   upon  the  attainment  of  specified
         Performance Goals.

                  (b) "Award Agreement" means the written  agreement  evidencing
         the terms and conditions of an Award.

                  (c)  "Board"  or  "Board  of  Directors"  means  the  Board of
         Directors of Del Webb Corporation.

                  (d) "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
         from time to time.

                  (e)  "Committee"  means the Human  Resources  Committee of the
         Board or the committee  appointed by the Board pursuant to Article 3 to
         administer the Plan.

                  (f)  "Company"   means  Del  Webb   Corporation,   a  Delaware
         corporation, or any successor thereto.

                  (g)  "Covered  Employee"  means an Employee  who is a "covered
         employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                  (h)  "Director"  means any  individual  who is a member of the
         Board of Directors of the Company.

                  (i) "Employee" means any full-time,  nonunion  employee of the
         Company.  Directors who are not otherwise employed by the Company shall
         not be considered Employees under this Plan.

                  (j)  "Participant"  means a Covered Employee who is designated
         by the Committee to  participate  in the Plan for a Performance  Period
         pursuant to Article 4.

                  (k)  "Performance   Criteria"  means  the  criteria  that  the
         Committee  selects for purposes of establishing the Performance Goal or
         Performance  Goals for a  Participant  for a  Performance  Period.  The
         Performance  Criteria that will be used to establish  Performance Goals
         are limited to the following:  pre- or after-tax net earnings,  revenue
         growth,  operating  income,  operating cash flow, return on net assets,
         return on shareholders'  equity,  return on assets,  return on capital,
         Share price growth,  shareholder  returns,  gross or net profit margin,
         earnings per Share, price per Share, and market share, any of which may
         be measured either in absolute terms, or as compared to any incremental
         increase,  or as  compared to results of a peer  group.  The  Committee
         shall, within the time prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code, define
         in an  objective  fashion  the manner of  calculating  the  Performance
         Criteria  it  selects  to use for  such  Performance  Period  for  such

         Performance  Criteria  used to  establish  such  Goal,  the Goal may be
         expressed in terms of overall Company performance or the performance of
         an operating unit or community. The Committee, in its discretion,  may,
         within the time  prescribed  by Section  162(m) of the Code,  adjust or
         modify the calculation of Performance Goals for such Performance Period
         in order to  prevent  the  dilution  or  enlargement  of the  rights of
         Participants,  (i) in the event of, or in anticipation  of, any unusual
         or extraordinary  corporate item,  transaction,  event, or development;
         and (ii) in recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or
         nonrecurring events affecting the Company, or the financial  statements
         of the Company,  or in response to, or in  anticipation  of, changes in
         applicable  laws,  regulations,   accounting  principles,  or  business
         conditions.

                  (m)  "Performance  Period"  means the one or more  periods  of
         time,  which  may  be of  varying  and  overlapping  durations,  as the
         Committee  may  select,  over  which  the  attainment  of one  or  more
         Performance  Goals will be measured  for the purpose of  determining  a
         Participant's  right to, and the  payment  of,  compensation  under the
         Plan.

                  (n)  "Shares"  means the  shares  of common  stock of Del Webb
         Corporation.

         2.2 Severability.  In the event that a court of competent  jurisdiction
determines that any portion of this Plan is in violation of any statute,  common
law, or public  policy,  then only the  portions of this Plan that  violate such
statute,  common law, or public  policy shall be stricken.  All portions of this
Plan that do not  violate any statute or public  policy  shall  continue in full
force and effect.  Further,  any court order  striking  any portion of this Plan
shall modify the  stricken  terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect
as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Plan.

                           ARTICLE 3. ADMINISTRATION

         3.1  The  Committee.  The  Plan  shall  be  administered  by the  Human
Resources  Committee of the Board,  or by any other  Committee  appointed by the
Board  consisting of not less than two (2) Directors who are not Employees.  The
members  of the  Committee  shall be  appointed  from time to time by, and shall
serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors.

         3.2  Authority  of the  Committee.  The  Committee  shall  have all the
authority   that  is  necessary  or  helpful  to  enable  it  to  discharge  its
responsibilities  under  the  Plan.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the
preceding  sentence,  the Committee  shall have the exclusive right to interpret
the Plan, to determine  eligibility for participation in the Plan, to decide all
questions concerning  eligibility for and the amount of Awards payable under the
Plan, to establish and administer the Performance Goals and certify whether, and
to what extent, they are attained,  to construe any ambiguous  provisions of the
Plan,  to  correct  any  default,  to supply  any  omission,  to  reconcile  any
inconsistency,   to  issue   administrative   guidelines   as  an  aide  to  the
administration  of the Plan, to make  regulations for carrying out the Plan, and
to decide any and all questions arising in the  administration,  interpretation,
and application of the Plan.

         3.3 Decisions  Binding.  All  determinations  and decisions made by the
Committee  pursuant  to the  provisions  of the Plan and all  related  orders or
resolutions of the Board of Directors shall be final, conclusive, and binding on
all persons, including the Company, its stockholders,  Employees,  Participants,
and their estates and beneficiaries.

         3.4  Section  162(m)  Compliance.  This Plan shall be  administered  to
comply with Section  162(m) of the Code and, if any provisions of the Plan cause
any Award to not qualify as performance-based  compensation under Section 162(m)
of the Code,  that  provision  shall be stricken  from this Plan,  but the other
provisions of this Plan shall remain in effect.  Any action striking any portion
of this Plan shall modify the stricken  terms as narrowly as possible to give as
much  effect as  possible  to the  intentions  of the  parties  under this Plan.
Furthermore,  if any portion of the Plan or any Award  Agreement  conflicts with
Section 162(m) or the regulations issued  thereunder,  the provisions of Section
162(m) and such regulations shall control.

                    ARTICLE 4. ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

         4.1  Eligibility.  Participation  is  limited  in any  fiscal  year  to
Employees who the Committee concludes will be Covered Employees for such year.

         4.2 Actual Participation.  From among the Covered Employees eligible to
participate  each year,  the Committee may select those to receive Awards in any
one or more Performance Periods under the Plan.

                           ARTICLE 5. FORM OF AWARDS.

         Awards  shall  be  paid  in  cash.  The  Committee  may,  in  its  sole
discretion,  subject  any  Award to such  terms,  conditions,  restrictions,  or
limitations  (including  but not  limited to  restrictions  on  transferability,
vesting, termination of employment for cause or otherwise, or change of control)
that the  Committee  deems to be  appropriate,  provided that such terms are not
inconsistent  with the terms of the Plan or  Section  162(m)  of the  Code.  All
Awards will be evidenced by an Award Agreement.

               ARTICLE 6. DETERMINATION AND LIMITATION OF AWARDS.

         6.1  Determination  of Awards.  Within the time  prescribed  by Section
162(m) of the Code for each Performance Period, the Committee shall, in its sole
discretion, determine and establish:

                  (a) the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Period
for each Participant;

                  (b) the total dollar amount payable to each Participant  under
the Award based upon attaining the Performance Goals; and

                  (c) such  other  terms  and  conditions  of such  Award as the
Committee determines to be appropriate under the circumstances.

Such determinations shall be reflected in the minutes of a Committee meeting, or
in a written action adopted  without the necessity of a meeting,  and also shall
be documented in the Award Agreement.

         6.2 Limitations of Awards.  If only one Performance Goal is established
for a Performance  Period, the Performance Goal for such Performance Period must
be achieved in order for a Participant to receive  payment for an Award for such
Performance  Period.  If more than one  Performance  Goal is  established  for a
Performance  Period,  one or more of the Performance  Goals for such Performance
Period  must be achieved in order for a  Participant  to receive  payment for an
Award for such Performance Period, all as set forth in accordance with the terms
of the Award  Agreement.  Furthermore,  the  Committee is authorized at any time
during  or  after a  Performance  Period  to  reduce  or  eliminate  (but not to
increase)  the  amount  of an  Award  payable  to  any  Covered  Employee  for a
Performance Period for any reason.

         6.3 Maximum  Awards.  Notwithstanding  any provision in the Plan to the
contrary, the maximum Award payable to any Covered Employee under the Plan for a
Performance Period shall be $2,000,000.00.

         6.4  Employment  Continuation.   Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the
Committee,  provided in the Award  Agreement,  or required by applicable law, no
payment  pursuant  to  this  Plan  shall  be made to a  Participant  unless  the
Participant  is  employed  by the  Company  on the last  day of the  Performance
Period.

         6.5  Deferrals of  Payments.  In the  exercise of its  discretion,  the
Committee  may allow a  Participant  to elect to defer the receipt of all or any
portion  of an Award.  Such  deferral  shall be made  pursuant  to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Del Webb Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan.

                         ARTICLE 7. RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES

         7.1  Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall  interfere with or limit in
any way the right of the Company to terminate  any  Participant's  employment at
any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of
the Company.

         7.2  Participation.  No Employee shall have the right to be selected to
receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to
receive a future Award.

              ARTICLE 8. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION

         The  Committee  may suspend or  terminate  the Plan at any time with or
without prior notice. In addition,  the Committee may from time to time and with
or without  prior  notice,  amend or modify the Plan in any manner,  but may not
without shareholder  approval adopt any amendment that would require the vote of
shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

                             ARTICLE 9. WITHHOLDING

         The Company  shall have the power and the right to deduct or  withhold,
or  require a  Participant  to remit to the  Company,  an amount  sufficient  to
satisfy  Federal,  state,  and local taxes  (including  the  Participant's  FICA
obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any grant,  exercise,
or payment made under or as a result of this Plan.

                             ARTICLE 10. SUCCESSORS

         All  obligations of the Company under the Plan,  with respect to Awards
granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the
existence  of such  successor  is the result of a direct or  indirect  purchase,
merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.

                        ARTICLE 11. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW

         11.1  Requirements  of Law. The granting of Awards under the Plan shall
be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals
by any governmental agencies as may be required.

governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
