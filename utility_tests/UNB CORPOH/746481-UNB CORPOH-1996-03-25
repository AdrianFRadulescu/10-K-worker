Item 1 - Business
- -----------------

a.  General Development of Business
    -------------------------------

    UNB Corp. (Registrant) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio
    during 1983.  Its principal business is to act as a bank holding company
    for the United National Bank & Trust Company (Bank).  Effective October 1,
    1984, in a transaction accounted for as an internal reorganization, the
    Registrant acquired all of the outstanding stock of the United National
    Bank & Trust Company.  The Corporation exchanged two shares of common stock
    for each previously outstanding share of the United National Bank & Trust
    Company.  The Registrant did not have any operations prior to the business
    combination.  UNB Corp. is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as amended.  A substantial portion of UNB Corp.'s revenue is derived
    from cash dividends paid by the Bank.

b.  Financial Information About Industry Segments
    ---------------------------------------------

    The Registrant and its subsidiary bank are engaged in commercial and retail
    banking.  Reference is hereby made to Item 1(e), "Statistical Disclosure",
    and Item 8 of this Form 10-K for financial information pertaining to the
    Registrant's banking business.

c.  Description of UNB Corp.'s Business
    -----------------------------------

    The Bank is a full-service bank offering a wide range of commercial and
    personal banking services primarily to customers in northern Stark and
    southern Summit Counties of Ohio.  These services include a broad range of
    loan, deposit and trust products and various miscellaneous services.  Loan
    products include commercial and commercial real estate loans, a variety of
    mortgage and construction loan products, installment loans, home equity
    lines of credit, MasterCard lines of credit, accounts receivable and lease
    financing.  Deposit products include interest and non-interest bearing
    checking accounts, various savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and
    IRAs.  The Trust Department provides services in the areas of employee
    benefits and personal trusts.  Miscellaneous services include safe deposit
    boxes, night depository, United States savings bonds, traveler's checks,
    money orders and cashier checks, bank-by-mail service, money transfers,
    wire services, utility bill payments and collections, notary public
    services, discount brokerage services and alternative investments.  In
    addition, the Bank has correspondent relationships with major banks in New
    York, Pittsburgh and Detroit pursuant to which the Bank receives various
    financial services.  The Bank accounts for substantially all (98%) of UNB
    Corp.'s consolidated assets at December 31, 1995.

    The Bank's primary lending area consists of Stark County, Ohio, and its
    contiguous counties.  Loans outside the primary lending area are considered
    for creditworthy applicants.  Lending decisions are made in accordance with
    written loan policies designed to maintain loan quality.

    Retail lending products are comprised of credit card loans, overdraft
    lines, personal lines of credit and installment loans.  Credit cards are
    unsecured credit accounts, on which the credit limits are determined by
    analysis of two criteria, the borrowers debt service and gross income.
    Overdraft lines of credit are lines attached to checking accounts to cover
    overdrafts and/or allow customers to write themselves a loan.  Credit
    limits are based on a percentage of gross income and average deposits.
    Personal lines of credit





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
    include lines secured by junior mortgages (home equity) and Private Banking
    lines which are generally secured by junior mortgages but may be unsecured
    or secured by other collateral.  The lines have a five year draw period and
    may then be renewed or amortized over ten years.  Credit limits are
    determined by comparing three criteria, appraised value, debt service and
    gross income.  Criteria for determining credit limits on private banking
    products also consider the applicant's annual income, net worth and average
    deposits.  Installment loans include both direct and indirect loans.  The
    term can range from three to 180 months, depending upon the collateral
    which includes new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles as
    well as junior mortgages and unsecured personal loans.  Retail lending
    underwriting guidelines include evaluating the entire credit using the Five
    C's of Credit, character, capacity, capital, condition and collateral.
    Credit scoring, analysis of credit bureau ratings and debt to income ratios
    are the major tools used by the lender in the underwriting process.

    The Bank offers a variety of mortgage loan programs, including a variety of
    fixed and adjustable rate mortgages ranging from 120 to 360 months.  The
    Bank also offers some specialty products such as jumbo mortgages, Mortgage
    Assistance Programs for low income individuals, construction and bridge
    loans.  The underwriting guidelines include those for consumer loans and
    those necessary to meet secondary market guidelines.  The Bank may sell
    loans to the secondary market when it deems it profitable and desirable to
    do so.  Residential real estate decisions focus on loan to value limits,
    debt to income ratio, housing to income ratio, credit history, and in some
    cases, whether private mortgage insurance is obtained.

    Business credit products include commercial loans and commercial real
    estate loans, Business Manager and leases.  Commercial loans include lines
    and letters of credit, fixed, and adjustable rate term loans, demand and
    time notes.  Commercial real estate loans include fixed, and adjustable
    mortgages.  Loans are generally to owner occupied businesses.  The
    portfolio also includes loans to churches, residential rental property,
    shopping plazas and residential development loans.  Loans to businesses
    often entail greater risk because the primary source of repayment is
    typically dependent upon adequate cash flow.  Cash flow of a business can
    be subject to adverse conditions in the economy or a specific industry.
    Should cash flow fail, the lender looks to the assets of the business
    and/or the ability of the comakers to support the debt.  Commercial lenders
    consider the Five C's of Credit, character, capacity, capital, condition
    and collateral in making commercial credit decisions.  Business Manager is
    a system which the Bank uses to assist creditworthy businesses with
    accounts receivable management.  It is a hybrid program combining funding
    and billing with cash management, monitoring and reporting functions.  The
    Bank purchases creditworthy receivables at full recourse with a flexible
    reserve.  The Bank may earn a discount, interest and/or fees.  The Bank has
    provided both direct and indirect leasing on a limited basis.  The direct
    leases are for specific equipment and may be open-end or closed-end.
    Indirect leases are established by granting a lease line to a dealer, while
    the Bank holds title and files a UCC lien for an assignment of the lease.
    Each vehicle has its own amortization.

    In addition to the underwriting guidelines followed for specific loan
    types, the Bank has underwriting guidelines common to all loan types.  With
    regard to collateral, the Bank follows supervisory limits set forth in
    Regulation H for transactions secured by real estate.  Loans in excess of
    these guidelines are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
    Loans not secured by real estate are analyzed on a loan by loan basis,
    based on collateral type guidelines set forth in the loan policy.
    Appraisal policies follow and comply with provisions outlined under Title
    XI of FIRREA.  All appraisals are done by





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
    outside independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors.  The
    Bank, as a general rule, gets an appraisal on all real estate transactions
    even when not required by Title XI.  The Bank may occasionally rely on a
    tax appraisal.  Senior Loan Committee has the option of requiring equipment
    appraisals.  Approval procedures include loan authorities approved by the
    Board of Directors for individual lenders and loan committees.  Retail and
    residential loans are centrally underwritten by their respective
    departments.  Business credits can be approved by the individual commercial
    lender or taken to Loan Committee if it exceeds individual approval limits.
    Senior Loan Committee approves aggregate loan commitments in excess of the
    lender's authority up to $1 million.  Executive Loan Committee approves
    aggregate loan commitments in excess of $1 million up to the Bank's legal
    lending limit.  Loans to Directors and Executive Officers are approved by
    the Board of Directors.  Business loans within a lender's authority are
    reported in the Senior Loan Committee minutes.  Retail and residential real
    estate loan transactions are also reported to Senior Loan Committee at
    certain dollar limits.  Exceptions and/or overrides are tracked and
    reported to Senior Loan Committee.

    The Loan Quality Review Committee meets on a monthly basis.  The Committee
    reviews Bank lending trends, the Past Due Report, the Watch List and
    various other reports in order to monitor and maintain credit quality.  The
    Committee also reviews on a relationship basis, customers on the Bank's
    Watch List and credits with aggregate commitments in excess of $1 million.

    Revenues from loans accounted for 75%, 73%, and 71% of consolidated
    revenues in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  Revenues from interest and
    dividends on investment and mortgage-backed securities accounted for 14%,
    13%, and 14%, of consolidated revenues in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
    respectively.

    The Registrant formed the United Credit Life Insurance Company (United
    Credit Life) to engage in the underwriting of credit life and credit
    accident and health insurance directly related to the extension of credit
    by the Bank to its customers.  United Credit Life commenced business in
    May, 1986.  The insurance is currently written by Union Fidelity Life
    Insurance Company; however, United Credit Life has entered into reinsurance
    treaties with Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company whereby United Credit
    Life assumes up to $25,000 of liability on each life policy.

    In September, 1994, the Bank purchased four branch offices of the former
    TransOhio Federal Savings Bank headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, from the
    Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).  Included in this purchase were $70.4
    million in deposits and other liabilities assumed and $0.6 million in cash,
    premises and equipment, and other assets. The intangible assets acquired in
    the transaction amounted to $6.6 million.

    The business of the Registrant is not seasonal to any material degree, nor
    is it dependent upon a single or small group of customers whose loss would
    result in a material adverse effect on the Registrant or its subsidiaries.

    Regulation and Supervision
    --------------------------

    UNB Corp. is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as amended, which restricts the activities of the Corporation and the
    acquisition by the Corporation of voting stock or assets of any bank,
    savings association or other company.  The Corporation is also subject to
    the reporting requirements of, and examination and regulation by, the Board
    of Governors of the Federal Reserve system (Federal Reserve Board).
    Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain
    restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on transactions with
    affiliates, including any loans





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
    or extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its
    subsidiaries, investments in the stock or other securities thereof and the
    taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower;
    the issuance of guarantees, acceptances or letters of credit on behalf of
    the bank holding company and its subsidiaries; purchases or sales of
    securities or other assets; and the payment of money or furnishing of
    services to the bank holding company and other subsidiaries.  Banks and
    bank holding companies are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in
    arrangements in connection with extensions of credit or provision of
    property or services.

    Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect
    control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock or substantially all
    of the assets of any bank holding company without the prior approval of the
    Federal Reserve.  In addition, acquisitions across state lines are limited
    to acquiring banks in those states specifically authorizing such interstate
    acquisitions.  However, in September 1995, federal law permitted interstate
    acquisitions of banks, if the acquired bank retains its separate charter.

    As a national bank, United National Bank & Trust Co. is supervised and
    regulated by the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller).  The deposits
    of the Bank are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the deposits
    assumed from savings and loans in 1994 and 1991 are insured by the Savings
    Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC).  The Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  Various requirements and restrictions
    under the laws of the United States and the State of Ohio affect the
    operations of the Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against
    deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans which may be made
    and the interest which may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to
    investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to
    correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and
    surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, and limitations on branching.
    Under current laws, the Bank may establish branch offices throughout the
    State of Ohio.  Pursuant to recent federal legislation, the Bank may branch
    across state lines, if permitted by the law of the other state.  In
    addition, effective June 1997, such interstate branching by the Bank will
    be authorized, unless the law of the other state specifically prohibits the
    interstate branching authority granted by federal law.

    The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for
    bank holding companies.  The risk-based capital guidelines include both a
    definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-based assets by
    assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories.  The
    required minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including
    certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) was
    10.00% at December 31, 1995 as disclosed in Note 14 of UNB Corp.'s 1995
    Annual Report (See Exhibit 13).  At least half of the total regulatory
    capital is to be comprised of common stockholders' equity, including
    retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited
    amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in
    equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill (Tier 1
    capital).  The remainder (Tier 2 capital) may consist of, among other
    things, mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of
    subordinated debt, other preferred stock and a limited amount of allowance
    for loan and lease losses.  The Federal Reserve Board has also imposed a
    minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of 4% for bank
    holding companies that meet certain specified conditions, including no
    operational, financial or supervisory deficiencies, and including those
    having the highest regulatory (CAMEL) rating.  The minimum leverage ratio
    is 1.0-2.0% higher for other holding companies based on their





                                       6

    particular circumstances and risk profiles and those experiencing or
    anticipating significant growth.  National banks are subject to similar
    capital requirements adopted by the Comptroller.

    UNB Corp. and its subsidiaries currently satisfy all regulatory capital
    requirements.  Failure to meet the capital guidelines could subject a
    banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to
    federal regulatory authorities, including dividend restrictions and the
    termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.

    Under an outstanding proposal of the Comptroller and the FDIC, the Bank may
    be required to have additional capital if its interest rate risk exposure
    exceeds acceptable levels provided for in the regulation.  In addition,
    those regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective
    action to resolve capital deficient banks.  Under these regulations, banks
    which become undercapitalized become subject to mandatory regulatory
    scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital continues to decrease.
    Such banks are also required to file capital plans with their primary
    federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital
    shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient bank at the time
    it becomes undercapitalized.

    The ability of UNB Corp. to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and
    for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends
    which may be declared by the Bank.  However, the Federal Reserve expects
    UNB Corp. to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries, which may
    require it to retain capital for further investment in the subsidiaries,
    rather than for dividends for shareholders of the Corporation.  Generally,
    United National Bank & Trust Co. must have the approval of its regulatory
    authority if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for
    that year to exceed the sum of current year's net profits and retained net
    profits for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus.  A
    national bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net
    profits then on hand after deducting its losses and bad debts or, if less
    than 1/10 of net profits for the preceding six months, for a quarterly or
    semiannual dividend, or the preceding year for an annual dividend, was
    transferred to surplus.  The Bank may not pay dividends to the Corporation
    if, after such payment, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels
    under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio
    requirements.  Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any
    time at the discretion of the regulatory authorities, if they deem such
    dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice or if
    necessary to maintain adequate capital for the bank.  These provisions
    could have the effect of limiting the Corporation's ability to pay
    dividends on its outstanding common shares.

    Management is not aware of any recommendations by regulatory authorities
    which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on the
    Registrant.

    Government Monetary Policies
    ----------------------------

    The earnings and growth of UNB Corp. are affected not only by general
    economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the
    federal government and its agencies and regulatory authorities,
    particularly the Federal Reserve Board.  Its policies influence the growth
    and mix of bank loans, investments and deposits and the interest rates
    earned and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on earnings of the
    Corporation.





                                       7
<PAGE>   8
    Due to the changing conditions in the economy and the activities of
    monetary and fiscal authorities, no predictions can be made regarding
    future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit
    levels.

    Competition
    -----------

    The Bank competes with nine state and national banks located in Stark and
    Summit Counties as well as an additional four in Summit County alone.  The
    Bank also competes with a large number of other financial institutions,
    such as savings and loan associations, savings banks, insurance companies,
    consumer finance companies, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, and
    commercial finance and leasing companies, for deposits, loans and financial
    services business.  Money market mutual funds, brokerage houses, and
    similar organizations provide many of the financial services offered by the
    Bank.  Many competitors have substantially greater resources than the Bank.
    In the opinion of management, the principal methods of competition are the
    rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid for
    deposits and borrowing, the fees charged for services, the availability and
    quality of services provided and the convenience of its branch locations.

    Effects of Compliance with Environmental Regulations
    ----------------------------------------------------

    Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the
    discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon the
    capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Registrant or
    its subsidiaries.  The Registrant anticipates, based on the nature of its
    business, that it will have no material capital expenditures for the
    purpose of protecting the environment in the foreseeable future.  From time
    to time the Bank may be required to make capital expenditures for
    environmental control facilities related to properties acquired through
    foreclosure proceedings.  Currently the Bank owns such a parcel of OREO
    property in the northwest quadrant of Stark County.  The Bank continues to
    negotiate with a large national petroleum company, owner of the facility at
    the date it was taken out of service and also the party responsible for the
    cleanup according to the State of Ohio's Bureau of Underground Storage
    Tanks (BUSTER) regulations.  Environmental assessments by the Bank and the
    petroleum company have been filed with the State agency, which has
    requested further validation of the Bank's assessment.  Upon completion of
    the second assessment report, the Bank will ask for another ruling by the
    State.  The outcome will determine whether the Bank can proceed with the
    marketing of the property for sale and/or any legal action against the
    national oil company to remediate the contamination of the property.  The
    estimated costs, should they become the responsibility of the Bank, are not
    material to the business or financial condition of the Registrant and have
    been set up as an allowance against the property's value on the
    Registrant's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

    Employees
    ---------

    As of December 31, 1995, UNB Corp. and its subsidiaries had 263 full-time
    employees and 65 part-time employees.  UNB Corp. and its subsidiaries are
    not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management considers
    its relationship with its employees to be good.

I.  DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY; INTEREST
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    RATES AND INTEREST DIFFERENTIAL
    -------------------------------

A. & B.  The average balance sheet information and the related analysis of net
         interest earnings for the years ending December 31, 1995, 1994, and
         1993 are included in Table 4 - "Average Balance Sheet and Related
         Yields", within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
         Condition and Results of Operations found on page 31 of the
         Registrant's 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated
         into this Item I by reference.

    All interest is reported on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a
    marginal tax rate of 35%.  Nonaccruing loans, for the purpose of the
    computations, are included in the daily average loan amounts outstanding.
    Loan fees in the amount of $2,901,438 are included in interest on loans.

C.  Tables setting forth the effect of volume and rate changes on interest
    income and expense for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 are
    included in Table 2 - "Changes in Net Interest Differential - Rate/Volume
    Analysis", within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations found on Page 29 of the Registrant's
    1995 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated into this Item I by
    reference.  For purposes of these tables, changes in interest due to volume
    and rate were determined as follows:

         Volume Variance - change in volume multiplied by the previous year's
         rate.

         Rate Variance - change in rate multiplied by the previous year's
         volume.

         Rate/Volume Variance - change in volume multiplied by the change in
         rate.

    The rate/volume variance was allocated to volume variance and rate variance
    in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the
    change in each.

B.  The carrying value and weighted average interest yield for each investment
    category listed in Part A at December 31, 1995 which are due (1) in one
    year or less, (2) after one year through five years, (3) after five years
    through ten years, and (4) after ten years are presented in Note 3 -
    Securities, found on page 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Registrant's 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders and is
    incorporated herein by reference.  The weighted average yields have been
    computed by dividing the total interest income adjusted for amortization of
    premiums or accretion of discount over the life of the security by the par
    value of the securities outstanding.  The weighted average yields of tax
    exempt obligations are presented on an after tax basis.

C.   Excluding those holdings of the investment portfolio in U.S. Treasury
     Securities and other agencies and corporations of the U.S.  Government,
     there were no investments in securities of any one issuer which exceeded
     10% of the consolidated shareholder's equity of the Registrant at December
     31, 1995.

          For the year ended December 31, 1995, $17,799 of interest income would
          have been earned under the original terms of those loans classified as
          nonaccrual.  The policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is to
          cease accruing interest on loans when management believes that the
          collection of interest is doubtful, or when loans are past due
          as to principal or interest ninety days or more.  The loans must be
          brought current and kept current for six consecutive months before
          being removed from nonaccrual status.  When loans are charged-off, any
          accrued interest recorded in the current fiscal year is charged
          against interest income.  The remaining balance is treated as a loan
          charge-off.

          The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 114 and SFAS No. 118 effective
          January 1, 1995.  At December 31, 1995, loans totaling $566 thousand
          were classified as impaired.  All loans classified as impaired at
          December 31, 1995 were also classified as nonaccrual loans, and
          therefore the adoption of SFAS No. 114 and SFAS NO. 118 had no effect
          on the comparability of non-performing assets at December 31, 1995 to
          prior periods.

    2.    Potential Problem Loans - As shown in the table above, at December
          31, 1995, there are approximately $1.1 million of loans not otherwise
          identified which are included on management's watch list.
          Management's watch list includes both loans which management has some
          doubt as to the borrowers' ability to comply with the present
          repayment terms and loans which management is actively monitoring due
          to changes in the borrowers financial condition.  These loans and
          their potential loss exposure have been considered in management's
          analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

    3.    Foreign Outstandings - There were no foreign outstandings at December
          31, 1995, 1994, or 1993.

    4.    Loan Concentrations - As of December 31, 1995, indirect installment
          loans comprise 33.4% of loans.  The dealer network from which the
          indirect loans are generated included 162 active relationships at
          December 31, 1995, the largest of which was responsible for 7% of
          total indirect volume for 1995.  There are no additional
          concentrations of loans greater than 10% of total loans which are not
          otherwise disclosed as a category of loans pursuant to Item III. A.
          above.  Also refer to the Note 1, Concentrations of Credit Risk,
          found on Page 16 of the 1995 Annual Report incorporated herein by
          reference.

    5.    No material amount of loans that have been classified by regulatory
          examiners as loss, substandard, doubtful, or special mention have
          been excluded from the amounts disclosed as nonaccrual, past due 90
          days or more, restructured, or potential problem loans.

    D.    Other Interest Bearing Assets - As of December 31, 1995, there are no
          other interest bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed
          under Item III C.1 or 2 if such assets were loans.  The Registrant
          had Other Real Estate Owned at December 31, 1995, in the amount of
          $325,000.

     The allowance for loan losses balance and the provision charged to expense
     are judgmentally determined by management based upon the periodic review
     of the loan portfolio, an analysis of impaired loans, past loan loss
     experience, economic conditions, anticipated loan portfolio growth, and
     various other circumstances which are subject to change over time.  In
     making this judgment, management reviews selected large loans as well as
     delinquent loans, nonaccrual loans, problem loans, and loans to industries
     experiencing economic difficulties.  The collectability of these loans is
     evaluated after considering the current financial position of the
     borrower, the estimated market value of the collateral, guarantees, and
     the Company's collateral position versus other creditors.  Judgments,
     which are necessarily subjective, as to the probability of loss and the
     amount of such loss, are formed on these loans, as well as other loans in
     the aggregate.

</TABLE>


     A comparison of allocations of the allowance for loan losses between
     December 31, 1995 and prior year ends shows a significant shift in the
     dollars allocated to each of the four loan categories.  During the third
     quarter of 1995, a change in the methodology used to determine the
     allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan
     categories was approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of
     Directors and instituted by management.  Management will continue to use
     the same three methodologies it has historically used to determine the
     allocation of the allowance, however, it will select the single
     methodology that results in the highest aggregate calculation for
     allocation of the allowance among the various loan categories, and not the
     highest specific allocation for each loan category from among the three
     methodologies.  Management believes this change reflects a more reliable
     analysis of the Bank's risk of loan loss.

     At December 31, 1995, $188 thousand was specifically allocated to
     commercial loans in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 114.  Because
     management's analysis of problem loans would have provided a similar
     allocation prior to





                                       14
<PAGE>   15
     adopting SFAS No. 114, the adoption of SFAS No. 114 had no impact on the
     comparability of the December 31, 1995 allowance for loan loss allocation
     to prior periods.

     While management's periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for
     loan loss may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loan
     situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-offs
     that occur.

     six branches are leased with various expiration dates running through 2002
     with renewal options.  Property has been purchased to consolidate the two
     branch offices in Hartville, Ohio, into a new facility with construction
     to begin the first quarter of 1996.

PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE

To Our Shareholders:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mergers and acquisitions seemed to be one of the activities that was prominent
in our industry in 1995. Around the United States and even in our own backyard,
banks purchased other banks in attempts to grow and increase profitability -
often at the expense of their customers, employees and communities. However,
United Bank's focus during the year was continued enhancement of products,
customer service and increasing shareholder value while remaining a locally
owned and independent community bank. It is my pleasure to present the
financial and other highlights that illustrate the success we achieved in 1995.

 Net income for the year reached a record high of $7.38 million, up 11.3
percent over 1994. Total assets for UNB Corp. at year-end were nearly $700
million, an increase of 16.4 percent over year-end 1994. Cash dividends were
$1.05 per share in 1995, representing a 9.4 percent increase over a year ago.
At year-end, the market value of UNB Corp. stock had increased to $44.00 per
share, a 14.3 percent increase over the previous year-end. This marked the 21st
consecutive year-end at which the value of UNB Corp. stock was greater than the
previous year-end. The total return to shareholders in 1995 including dividends
and appreciation was 17.3 percent. The cumulative three year return was an
impressive 78.6 percent.

 Interest rates increased in early 1995 and then began to moderate in the
fourth quarter. Due to favorable interest rates and excellent performance by
all lending areas, the total loan portfolio of United Bank grew to $519
million, an increase of $106 million or 25.7 percent over 1994. The consumer
loan portfolio accounted for $221 million of total loans in 1995, an increase
of 21.1 percent over 1994. Much of this growth can be attributed to our success
in indirect lending through automobile, boat and recreational vehicle dealers.
United Bank continued to expand the geographic area where indirect loans were
made as well as increasing the number of dealer relationships.

 The Bank's existing home equity loan product was revised and improved in 1995.
The new product, named Equity100(TM), enables homeowners to borrow up to 100
percent of the equity they have in their home. In addition, Equity100 features
very attractive tiered interest rates indexed to the Prime Rate, and a lower
minimum monthly payment amount. With interest rates expected to fall, the Bank
anticipates increased activity in the use of Equity100 in 1996.

 United Bank was Stark County's leading mortgage lender in 1995 as reported by
the Realty Industry's PACE report. The mortgage department made 841 loans in
1995 to lead all other financial institutions and mortgage companies that
originated loans within Stark County. Mortgage loan originations totaled $80.0
million in 1995. United Bank's Mortgage Assistance Program (MAP), which
provides mortgage assistance for low-to-moderate income families in the
communities we serve, reached a new record of $1.9 million. I am pleased to
report that United Bank's MAP loan program assisted 51 families who might not
have been able to afford housing, move into their own homes last year.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Business Manager lending product was launched in 1995. Designed to provide
immediate cash flow for businesses by purchasing their accounts receivables,
Business Manager loan volume has met expectations to date. Aggressive growth
goals for 1996 will be supported by enhanced marketing efforts.

 To help support United Bank's initiative to be the primary bank for new and
growing businesses in Stark County, a new low-documentation loan program was
created in 1995. Designed for locally owned businesses that need faster
turnaround on applications for term loans and lines of credit, this new product
features the "Rapid Application," a smaller, easy-to-complete document that can
be faxed to a commercial lender or business development officer for quick
review and approval. This new product will be marketed actively in 1996 through
direct mail and direct sales efforts.

 United Bank's nonperforming loans and delinquencies continue to compare very
favorably with financial institutions in its peer group.  Nonperforming loans
for 1995 were $1.3 million compared to $1.1 million at year-end 1994. Total
loan delinquency was 1.24 percent compared to 1.93 percent for our peer group.
The Bank's excellent record on nonperforming loans can be attributed to
adherence to strict lending guidelines and enhanced management reporting
capabilities and monitoring.

 United Bank will continue to enhance revenues by increasing non-interest
income in 1996. This includes aggressively pursuing income from the sales of
mutual funds, annuities, and life insurance products. In 1995, United Bank
joined with a third-party provider to sell these products in our bank lobbies.
Customers will know the new company as "Investors MarketPlace" and will be
served by Account Executives and United Bank employees.

 Perhaps no where else have the consolidations by regional banks had a greater
impact on customers than in the area of Personal Trust services.  Our
competitors continue to move their Trust officers and operations out of the
county. United Bank's Trust Department now remains the only locally owned and
managed Trust company in Stark County. The challenge for us will be to
familiarize local Trust clients with the many benefits and advantages derived
from our local operation. For example, our Trust Department manages individual
portfolios for each client based on investment goals established through
personal consultation with the client. No common pooled funds or bank-operated
mutual funds are used. This gives clients more control over their accounts. Our
Trust Department provides this customized service at a fraction of the cost
other Trust companies charge to deliver standard mutual fund investments with
average returns. It is our goal to continue to provide good local management of
investment accounts, living trusts, estate planning and estate administration,
charitable trusts, and employee benefit planning and administration.

 Predictions for the banking industry have stated that of the thousands of
banks, savings and loans, and credit unions in business today, only a few
hundred will survive the merger and acquisition activity and be in business in
the next 10 years.  To help chart a successful course to the turn of the
century, United Bank's Management team and Board of Directors spent several
weeks in 1995 creating a Vision Statement called "Vision 2000" and a long range
Strategic Plan to guide us through these critical years.

                                 VISION 2000
                                      
OUR VISION IS THAT UNITED NATIONAL BANK & TRUST COMPANY SHALL BE:

         * A LOCALLY OWNED AND OPERATED
           COMMUNITY BANK PROVIDING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE
           COMMUNITIES IT SERVES; 

         * A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY WITH AN ROE OF
           NO LESS THAN 17.5%, AN ROA OF 1.3% OR GREATER, AND A CAPITAL RATIO OF
           AT LEAST 7.5%; 

         * AN EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE ORGANIZATION WITH AN EFFICIENCY RATIO
           BELOW 50%; 

         * A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION WITH A DIVERSIFIED, HIGHLY
           SKILLED WORK FORCE; AND 

         * AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS LED BY VISIONARY DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS
           WORKING IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER TO ACHIEVE COMMON STRATEGIC GOALS.

 The long range Strategic Plan sets specific Return On Equity (ROE), Return On
Assets (ROA), and efficiency ratio goals that will be necessary to meet in
order to remain a profitable and independent bank in 2000 and sets forth
general plans to help the Bank successfully
<PAGE>   6

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

reach these goals. The long range Strategic Plan will be reviewed annually and
supported by yearly strategic plans to help the Bank reach its annual goals on
the way to the year 2000. As part of Vision 2000 and the 1996 Strategic Plan,
the Bank is committed to remaining an independent community bank. It is
Management's belief that the best return on our shareholders' investment will
be gained by maintaining United Bank as a locally owned, independent bank.

 In the 1994 Annual Report, we described a new bank-wide, performance-based
incentive plan for all employees. The United Bank "Stakeholder Incentive Plan"
was implemented to create a "team-oriented environment which promotes and
rewards employee initiative, development and contribution." This program is
based on meeting certain key performance levels which can be identified with
specific profit goals. In 1995, the Bank met and exceeded the performance
standards established in the Stakeholder program, and all employees received a
cash incentive based on performance. It is our belief that rewarding employees
in this manner will lead to increased motivation, higher efficiency and
increased shareholder value.

 To remain competitive in the rapidly changing banking environment, United Bank
is constantly evaluating the condition, location and service of its retail
delivery network, including Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). Currently United
Bank covers Stark and southern Summit Counties with 20 offices and 19 ATMs.
After an extensive evaluation, Management concluded that the two offices in
Hartville should be consolidated into a new facility on State Route 619 which
will enable us to better serve our customers. Construction of the new financial
center will begin in the spring of 1996. This financial center will feature
private offices for financial counseling, drive-up teller lanes, safe deposit
boxes, a night depository and a drive-up ATM. Building a new United Bank
facility emphasizes Lake Township's importance as a growing financial market
and reaffirms our commitment to serve the Hartville community and our customers
there.

 One of the Bank's busiest branches is located at Belden Village on Whipple
Avenue, N.W. After extensive analysis of the market and this office, Management
has determined that renovation of the office was necessary. The renovation will
take place in the spring of 1996 and will include a number of customer service
refinements. In addition, renovations and enhancements are planned for the
Wales Square office in Massillon and the Beach City office.

 As the Bank continues to grow, our processing and support requirements
increase as well. The United Bank Center, which is the home of the Operations
Center of the Bank, is currently undergoing renovation. The renovations will
add new office space, provide updated technology for computers and telephones,
and include the construction of a special area for a new centralized telephone
service. This new service will be dedicated to providing enhanced customer
service over the telephone, including the opening of accounts by telephone.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Through the strategic placement of
                     banking facilities, United Bank will
                           maintain its competitive
                          edge in customer service.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As Stark County experiences tremendous growth in Lake Township, North Canton,
Green and other locations, United Bank will continue to evaluate current
locations and potential new branch sites. In addition, with the growing
popularity of free-standing drive-up ATM units, the Bank will explore new
locations for these as well. The goal of this analysis, construction and
consolidation is to make certain that United Bank is providing convenient
access to financial services for people in the communities we serve. Through
the strategic placement of banking facilities, United Bank will maintain its
competitive edge in customer service.

 Equally important as the analysis and maintenance of the Bank's facilities is
the evaluation of new financial products and services for our customers. To
maintain our competitiveness in the market, United Bank must meet and exceed
the expectations of our customers. To this end, Management is constantly
reviewing new products for possible implementation. As mentioned earlier, the
Bank is currently setting up a new telephone center to handle the growing
demand for service by telephone. While telephone service will be accessible
from anywhere in the United States via a toll-free telephone number, the
service will continue to be provided locally at the Bank's Operations Center.
It is our goal to enable customers to perform more of their routine banking
tasks over the telephone and eventually the computer, without leaving their
home or office. Telephone services may include paying bills, making loan
payments, trans-

ferring funds between accounts, checking balances, opening new accounts and
taking loan applications.

 The Bank launched a new product in 1995 called the United Bank MasterMoney
card. This enhanced ATMcard features a MasterCard(R) logo and is linked to a
personal checking account. The MasterMoney card has all the features of an
ATMcard, plus it allows customers to make card purchases at any MasterCard
merchant. The purchases are deducted automatically from the customer's checking
account and listed in detail on the monthly checking account statement,
eliminating the need to write checks or carry cash to make purchases. The
positive response from customers who received the new card in December
indicates the MasterMoney card will be a popular customer service.

 Another product enhancement that was introduced in 1995 was a Certificate of
Deposit (CD) Renewal Letter Program. This expanded renewal notice is mailed to
customers whose CD is about to mature. The enhanced notice gives customers more
information about their CD and includes a form which enables them to make
changes to the CD or open a new one through the mail. This may save the customer
a trip to the bank and enables the Bank to offer greater service.

 More and more people are setting up home computers and inquiring about
computer banking. We are taking the first steps toward providing a computer
link for these early-adopters by exploring the establishment of a Home Page on
the World Wide Web. Many banks have already initiated these "electronic
billboards" for their companies with some offering to open new accounts via the
Internet. While this method of banking is in relatively low demand right now,
the banking industry foresees strong growth and increasing demand for
electronic links from homes and businesses directly to the bank. We feel
confident that in the near future, United Bank will be listing its World Wide
Web address for you to gain electronic access to the Bank.

 The demand for the option to gain access to accounts electronically is already
growing among United Bank's business customers. To satisfy their needs, we are
in the process of setting up new methods by which our commercial customers can
handle their financial transactions. Two new Automated Clearing House (ACH)
services will allow customers to initiate wire transfers and other transactions
by either telephone or personal computer. These confidential electronic methods
of access will help our commercial customers keep pace with the growing demands
to manage assets quickly and efficiently.

 None of these new products and services can be established and provided to
customers without employees who have the skills and resources to develop, sell
and maintain them. United Bank is proud to have excellent employees, and it is
our goal to make certain we maintain a highly skilled, team-oriented and
efficient work force. To assist in providing a motivational atmosphere,
Management has conducted an ongoing Corporate Culture Survey in each of the
past two years to receive input from all employees on how to motivate and
reward employee initiative, development and contribution. The results of the
1995 survey indicated that the steps Management took to enhance employee
satisfaction and morale over the past year were successful. We will continue to
monitor our corporate culture through this annual survey and make the necessary
changes to maintain an efficient and motivated work force.

 I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, officers,
directors, community advisory board members, and shareholders for their
continued dedication and support in 1995. In particular, I would like to give
my thanks and best wishes to Joanna Pietrocola who retired January 1, 1996
after a 48-year career, the last six years of which were spent with United
Bank. Joanna served as a Vice President and Trust Officer at the Mount Union
office and was an excellent ambassador for United Bank in the Alliance
community. We all wish her a long and happy retirement.

 With revolutionary changes taking place in the banking industry, it will be
necessary for United Bank to stay true to the course that Management and the
Board of Directors have set forth in our Vision 2000. I am confident that by
recommitting ourselves to the principles that have guided the Bank successfully
over the years, United Bank will maintain its local, independent ownership,
continue to increase shareholder value, and provide outstanding customer
service.


Sincerely,

/s/ Robert L. Mang

  The Management of UNB Corp. is responsible for the preparation, accuracy and
fair presentation of the financial statements and related information presented

written policies and procedures which establish and maintain effective internal
controls through proper delegation of authority and division of responsibility,

that the system provides reasonable assurances that financial transactions are
recorded properly, and that the Corporation is in compliance with federal and
state laws and regulations as well as safety and soundness laws and

Report of Independent Auditors                     CROWE CHIZEK

Board of Directors and Shareholders
UNB Corp.
Canton, Ohio

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UNB Corp. as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of UNB Corp. as of December 31, 1995
and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

  As discussed in Note 1, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for
impaired loans in 1995 and for income taxes and certain investment securities
in 1993 to comply with new accounting guidance.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial statements include
accounts of UNB Corp.  (Corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
the United National Bank & Trust Company (Bank),  620 Market Community Urban
Development Corp. and United Credit Life Insurance  Company.  All significant
intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION: UNB Corp. is a bank holding company engaged in
the business of commercial and retail banking and trust and investment
services, with operations conducted through its main office and branches
located throughout Stark and southern Summit Counties of Ohio. Stark and
southern Summit Counties provide the source for substantially all of the
Corporation's deposit, loan and trust activities. The majority of the
Corporation's income is derived from commercial and retail business lending
activities and investments.
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash and noninterest
bearing deposits with banks. UNB Corp. reports net cash flows for interest
bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, customer loan transactions,
deposit transactions and short-term borrowings.
    For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Corporation paid
interest of $20,787,722, $13,362,450 and $12,848,580,  respectively, and income
taxes of $4,290,000, $3,560,250 and $4,485,000, respectively.
    INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES: Effective December 31, 1993, the
Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." SFAS No. 115 requires the Corporation to classify debt and
equity securities as held to maturity, trading or available for sale. The
cumulative effect on retained earnings at December 31, 1993 of adopting SFAS
No. 115, is included as a separate component of shareholders' equity in the
consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity and represents the
after-tax effect of adjusting securities available for sale to fair value.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 115, the Corporation recorded investment and
mortgage-backed securities at amortized cost.
    Securities classified as held to maturity are those that management has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities classified as
available for sale are those that management intends to sell or that could be
sold for liquidity, investment management, or similar reasons, even if there is
not a present intention for such a sale. Trading securities are purchased
principally for sale in the near term and are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. During 1995 and 1994, the
Corporation held no trading securities.
    Securities held to maturity are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts. Securities available for sale are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. Gains or losses on dispositions
are based on net proceeds and the adjusted carrying amount of securities sold,
using the specific identification method.
    LOANS HELD FOR SALE: Residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank and
intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or
estimated market value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized
in a valuation allowance by charges to income. To mitigate interest rate risk,
the Bank generally obtains fixed price commitments on loans held for sale. The
Bank retains the servicing rights on loans sold and incurs no recourse
obligation in connection with the loan sales or servicing activities.
    ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: Because some loans may not be repaid in full, an
allowance for loan losses is recorded. This allowance is increased by
provisions charged to earnings and is reduced by loan charge-offs, net of
recoveries.  Estimating the risk of loss on any loan is necessarily subjective.
Accordingly, the allowance is maintained by Management at a level considered
adequate to cover possible losses that are currently anticipated based on
Management's evaluation of several key factors including information about
specific borrower situations, their financial position and collateral values,
current economic conditions, changes in the mix and levels of the various types
of loans, past charge-off experience and other pertinent information. The
allowance for loan losses is based on estimates using currently available
information, and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates due to changes
in circumstances. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments
become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they
become known. While Management may periodically allocate portions of the
allowance for specific problem situations, the entire allowance is available
for any charge-offs that occur. Charge-offs are made against the allowance for
loan losses when Management concludes that loan amounts are likely to be
uncollectible. After a loan is charged-off, collection efforts continue and
future recoveries may occur.
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 and No. 118 were
adopted January 1, 1995 and require recognition of loan impairment. Loans are
considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated.
Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or at the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A portion of the allowance for
loan losses is allocated to impaired loans. The effect of adopting these
standards is included in the 1995 provision for loan losses, and was not
material.
    Management analyzes loans on an individual basis and classifies a loan as
impaired when an analysis of the borrower's operating results and financial
condition indicates that underlying cash flows are not adequate to meet its
debt service requirements. Often this is associated with a delay or shortfall
in payments of 30 days or more. Smaller-balance homogeneous loans are evaluated
for impairment in total. Such loans include residential first mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four family residences, residential construction loans and
consumer automobile, boat, home equity and credit card loans with balances less
than $300,000. In addition, loans held for sale and leases are excluded from
consideration as impaired. Loans are generally moved to nonaccrual status when
90 days or more past due. These loans are often also considered impaired.
Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.
The nature of disclosures for impaired loans is considered generally comparable
to prior nonaccrual loans and non-performing and past due asset disclosures.

                                                                              16

    PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT: Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
calculated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, limited in the case
of leasehold improvements to the lease terms, or useful lives, whichever is
less, using primarily the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expenses as incurred and major improvements are capitalized.
    OTHER REAL ESTATE: Other real estate owned is included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or fair value, less
estimated costs to sell. Any reduction in fair value is reflected in a
valuation allowance account established by a charge to income. Costs incurred
to carry the real estate are charged to expense. Other real estate, net of the
valuation reserve totaled $325,000 and $334,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
    INTEREST AND FEES ON LOANS: Interest income on loans is accrued primarily
over the term of the loans based on the principal balances of loans
outstanding.  Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are
deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the related loan using the
level yield method. The net amount of fees and costs deferred is reported in
the consolidated balance sheets as a part of loans.
    The accrual of interest on loans is suspended when, in Management's
opinion, the collection of all or a portion of the loan principal has become
doubtful.  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid
interest at risk is charged against income. Payments received on non-accrual
loans are applied against principal until recovery of the remaining balance is
reasonably assured.  The carrying value of loans classified as impaired is
periodically adjusted to reflect cash payments, revised estimates of future
cash flows and increases in the present value of expected cash flows due to the
passage of time. Cash payments representing interest income are reported as
such and other cash payments are reported as reductions in carrying value.
Increases or decreases in carrying value due to changes in estimates of future
payments or the passage of time are reported as reductions or increases in the
provision for loan losses.
    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which requires that the Corporation follow the liability method in
accounting for income taxes. The liability method provides that deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial
reporting purposes, referred to as "temporary differences."
    The effect on years prior to 1993 of changing to this method was $353,830,
which is reflected in the consolidated statements of income as the cumulative
effect of change in accounting method. This change had no significant effect on
the provision for income taxes for 1993.
    CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK: The Corporation, through its subsidiary
Bank, grants residential, consumer, and commercial financing to customers
located primarily in Stark County. Commercial loans, commercial real estate
loans, mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases comprise 12.5%, 11.7%,
33.2% and 42.6% of total loans, respectively at December 31, 1995. Indirect
loans accounted for 78.5% of consumer loans at December 31, 1995.
    EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS PER SHARE: Primary and fully diluted earnings per
share are computed based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the
period. Primary earnings per common share has been computed assuming the
exercise of stock options less the treasury shares assumed to be purchased from
the proceeds using the average market price of UNBCorp.'s stock for the years
presented. Fully diluted earnings per common share represents the additional
dilution related to the stock options due to the use of the market price as of
the year-end.
    The primary weighted average shares were 2,928,722, 2,856,171 and 2,674,270
for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Fully diluted weighted average shares
were 2,936,269, 2,988,848, and 2,795,699 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    The Corporation declared a 100% stock dividend in 1993 which was recorded
by a transfer from retained earnings to common stock at par. All per share data
has been adjusted for the stock dividend.
    STOCK OPTIONS: The potential effect of exercising outstanding stock options
has been included in the calculation of earnings per share. The excess of the
option price over the par value of the shares issued is added to paid-in
capital when exercised. Any tax benefit realized by the Corporation from the
exercise of non-qualified stock options is added to paid-in capital.
    DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN: The dividend reinvestment plan, effective March
30, 1989, authorized the sale of 289,406 shares of the Corporation's authorized
but previously unissued Common Shares to shareholders who choose to invest all
or a portion of their cash dividends. During 1995, stock was purchased in the
open market at the current market price. In 1994 and 1993, shares totalling
22,595 and 23,830, respectively, were issued by the Corporation pursuant to the
plan. The shares issued were purchased from the Corporation with reinvested
dividends at the current market price, which was the average of the closing bid
and asked prices for the last business day immediately preceding the purchase
date. The number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the 1993 stock
dividend.
    TRUST DEPARTMENT ASSETS AND INCOME: Property held by the Corporation in a
fiduciary or other capacity for its trust customers is not included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since such items are not assets
of the Corporation. Income from the Trust Department is reported on the accrual
basis of accounting.
    USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Management must
make estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial
statements that affect the amounts reported and the disclosures provided. These
estimates and assumptions may change in the future and future results could
differ.
    Areas involving the use of Management's estimates and assumptions include
the allowance for loan losses, the realization of deferred tax assets, fair
value of certain securities, the determination and carrying value of impaired
loans, the post retirement benefit obligation, the determination of
other-than-temporary reductions in the fair value of securities, depreciation
of premises and equipment, the carrying value and amortization of intangibles,
the fair value of financial instruments, the actuarial present value of pension
benefit obligations and the net periodic pension expense and prepaid pension
costs recognized in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.
Estimates that are more susceptible to change in the near term include the
allowance for loan losses and the fair value of certain securities.

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

    Effective September 16, 1994, the Bank acquired from the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) certain assets and assumed certain deposits and other
liabilities of the former Transohio Federal Savings Bank, (Transohio),
headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, in accordance with a purchase and assumption
agreement of the same date.
    The Transohio acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have
been recorded based on their estimated fair market values at the date of
acquisition. A summary of assets acquired and liabilities assumed follows:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                <C>
Cash and cash equivalents received                 $    375,000 
Premises and equipment                                  224,000
Accrued interest receivable and other assets              2,000 
Funds receivable from Resolution Trust Corporation   63,142,000 
Intangible assets/purchase premium paid               6,630,000
- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
           Total Assets                            $ 70,373,000 
=============================================================== 
Deposit liabilities                                $ 69,244,000 
Accrued interest payable and other liabilities        1,129,000 
- --------------------------------------------------------------- 
           Total Liabilities                       $ 70,373,000 
===============================================================
</TABLE>

    The effect of the Transohio acquisition is included in the results of
operations prospectively from the date of acquisition. The pro forma effect of
this acquisition on prior periods is not shown herein due to a lack of
continuity of operations and the fact that the assistance received by Transohio
from the RTC reduces the relevance of past information.
    The intangible assets arising from acquisitions, and included in intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are summarized as
follows at December 31, net of accumulated amortization:

<TABLE>

  Total intangible assets           $7,376,421       $8,470,758
===============================================================
</TABLE>

    The core deposit intangibles are being amortized on accelerated methods
over periods ranging from 8 to 10 years, while the good-will is being amortized
over the estimated remaining lives of the assets acquired, or 120 months.
Amortization expense for these intangible assets totaled $1,094,337 in 1995,
$641,665 in 1994, and $536,863 in 1993.

    The balance of impaired loans was $566,269 at December 31, 1995. Of this
amount, $378,693 in impaired loans required no allowance for loan loss
allocation. The remaining impaired loans of $187,576 had $187,576 of the
allowance for loan losses allocated to them, although the entire allowance
remains available for charge-offs of any loan.
    The average  balance of impaired  loans for 1995 was $603,068.  Interest
income  recognized on impaired loans during 1995 was $53,130,  which included
$52,300 of interest income recognized on a cash basis.
    Loans on non-accrual status at December 31, 1994 approximated $1,039,000. A
loan is considered to be non-accrual once it is ninety days past due and is
kept on non-accrual status until it has been current six consecutive months or
is charged off. If interest had been accrued on non-accrual loans, interest
income would have increased by $18,516 in 1994 and $11,854 in 1993.
Additionally, loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing income
totaled approximately $19,000 at December 31, 1994.

    Other changes include adjustments for loans applicable to one reporting
period that are excludable from the other reporting period.
    In 1996, the Corporation is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No.
122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights." This statement requires
lenders who sell originated loans and retain the servicing rights to recognize
as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others. It also
requires that capitalized mortgage servicing rights be assessed for impairment
based on the fair value of those rights. Management does not anticipate that
this pronouncement will have a material impact on the Corporation's financial
condition or results of operations upon adoption.

NOTE 10 - RETIREMENT PLANS

    PENSION PLAN - The Corporation has a noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan covering substantially all of its employees. In general, benefits
are based on years of service and the employee's compensation. The
Corporation's policy is to fund the plan sufficiently to meet the minimum
funding requirement set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, plus such additional amounts as the Corporation may determine to be
appropriate up to the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal tax
purposes. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service date but also for those expected to be earned in the
future. For financial reporting purposes, pension expense is calculated using
the projected unit cost method. The following table sets forth the plan's
funded status and amounts recognized in the Corporation's consolidated
financial statements at December 31, respectively:

    PROFIT SHARING PLAN - The UNB Tax-Deferred Savings Plan covers all
qualified employees. The annual plan expense is based upon discretionary
matching of employees' voluntary pre-tax contributions. The Corporation's
contributions are invested in UNB Corp. common stock, and become vested after
three years of service. Employee voluntary contributions are fully vested at
all times.  Employee contributions are invested in a money market fund, a
balanced stock and bond fund, or in UNB Corp. common stock based on employee
investment elections.  The expense related to this plan totaled $219,000,
$231,000 and $273,960 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS - The Corporation sponsors a
defined benefit postretirement medical plan. Employees who retire on or after
completion of 10 years of service and attainment of age 55 are eligible to
receive postretirement medical benefits. The retiree may also receive coverage
for dependents. Prior to the attainment of age 65, coverage is provided under
the Corporation's group major medical insurance plan. At age 65, coverage is
provided under a Medicare supplement plan.
    The Corporation's plan is contributory. Retirees under age 65 pay a lower
premium than retirees who have attained age 65.
    The following table sets forth the plan's funded status reconciled with the
amounts shown in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at December 31:

===============================================================
</TABLE>

    Benefit payments of $48,317, $42,759 and $37,840 were made for
postretirement medical benefits in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    For measurement purposes, a 13% annual rate of increase in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1995, 1994 and 1993. The
rate was assumed to gradually decrease to 7% after four years in 1995, 7% after
six years in 1994 and 7% after 25 years in 1993. The health care cost trend
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. An increase in the
assumed health care cost trends rates by 1% in each year would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $205,000 and
$194,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit
cost for the year then ended by approximately $25,000, $23,000 and $57,000 for
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    The weighted average  discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligation was 7%, 7% and 6% at December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE 11 - STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN

    In 1987, the shareholders approved a Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan
reserving 191,010 shares of common stock for the granting of options to
executive officers and other senior Management personnel. Options are not
exercisable for at least three years from the date of grant and are not fully
exercisable until five years from the date of grant. The duration of the
exercise period is ten years. As such options are exercised, shareholders'
equity will be credited with the proceeds.
    As of December 31, 1995, there were 4,868 shares exercisable at $14.04,
15,292 shares exercisable at $14.47, 15,216 shares exercisable at $15.55, 7,455
shares exercisable at $16.78 and 4,184 shares exercisable at $19.05. In January
1996, options to purchase 13,841 shares were granted at a price of $44.00.

    In 1996, the Corporation is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." This statement establishes
financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee
compensation plans. Upon adoption of this statement, the Corporation will
disclose the pro forma effect on earnings per share of recognizing the
compensation cost for stock options based on the fair value method. Management
does not anticipate that this pronouncement will have a material impact on the
Corporation's result of operations or earnings per share upon adoption.

    Taxes attributable to securities gains approximated $2,104 in 1995, $69,633

NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    RESERVE REQUIREMENTS: The Corporation's subsidiary bank is required to
maintain approximately $11.6 million of cash on hand or on deposit with the
Federal Reserve to meet regulatory reserve requirements at December 31, 1995.
These balances do not earn interest.
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK: The Corporation is a
party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the
financial needs of its customers. The contract or notional amounts of these
instruments are not included in the consolidated financial statements. The
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the financial instruments for commitments to make loans is represented by the
contractual amounts of these instruments. The Corporation does not anticipate
any material losses from these transactions. The contract or notional amounts
of these instruments on December 31, are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                        1995          1994
<S>                                  <C>            <C>
Commitments to
 extend credit                       $124,829,000   $88,011,000
Standby letters of credit
 and financial guarantees               6,362,000     2,273,000
Interest rate swaps                     6,625,000     7,875,000
</TABLE>

    The amounts above represent contracts entered into by the Corporation. The
Corporation has not participated any portions to other financial institutions.
At December 31, 1995, $18,259,000 of the commitments to extend credit were
fixed rate and $106,570,000 were adjustable rate. In addition, all of the
standby letters of credit were adjustable rate.
    The Corporation uses the same credit policies in extending commitments and
letters of credit and financial guarantees as it does for on-balance-sheet
financial instruments. The Corporation controls its exposure to loss from these
agreements through credit approval processes and monitoring procedures. Letters
of credit and commitments to extend credit are generally issued for one year or
less. The total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
disbursements, as many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon. The
Corporation may require collateral in extending commitments, which may include
cash, accounts receivable, securities, and real or personal property.
    INTEREST RATE SWAP: The Corporation has entered into an agreement to assume
variable interest payments in exchange for fixed interest payments (interest
rate swaps). At December 31, 1995 and 1994 the notional amount of the interest
rate swap agreement was $6,625,000 and $7,875,000, respectively. The notional
amounts of the interest rate swaps do not represent amounts exchanged by the
parties and are not a measure of the Corporation's exposure through its use of
derivatives. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional
amounts and the other terms of the interest rate swap. The agreement calls for
quarterly reductions in the notional amount with a final expiration of November
26, 2000. Variable interest payments received are based on the 3 month LIBOR
rate which is adjusted on a quarterly basis. The net income (cost) of this
agreement for 1995 and 1994 was approximately $219,000 and ($152,000),
respectively, which was included in income.
    CONTINGENCIES: The nature of the Corporation's business results in a
certain amount of litigation. Management, after reviewing with counsel all
actions and proceedings pending against or involving UNB Corp. and its
subsidiaries, considers that the aggregate liability or loss, if any, resulting
from them will not be material to the Corporation's financial position.
    DIVIDEND AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS: Dividends paid by the Bank
are the primary source of funds available to the Corporation for payment of
dividends to shareholders and for other working capital needs. The payment of
dividends by the subsidiary bank to the Corporation is subject to restrictions
by regulatory authorities. These restrictions generally limit dividends to the
current and prior two year's retained earnings. At December 31, 1995,
approximately $12,270,000 of the Bank's retained earnings were available for
dividends to the Corporation under these guidelines. In addition to these
restrictions, as a practical matter, dividend payments cannot reduce regulatory
capital levels below the Corporation's regulatory capital requirements and
minimum regulatory guidelines. These restrictions do not presently limit the
Corporation from paying normal dividends.
    The Corporation's regulatory capital requirements and ratios at December
31, 1995 follow:

    The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value:
    CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS - For those short-term instruments, the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    INVESTMENT SECURITIES - For investment securities and mortgage backed
securities, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes.
    LOANS - The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. The fair
value of unrecorded commitments was not material at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

    DEPOSIT LIABILITIES - The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts,
and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the
reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is
estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates currently offered
for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
    INTEREST RATE SWAPS - The fair value of the interest rate swap reflects the
amount that the Corporation would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the
reporting date based on a dealer quote.
    Below are the estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial
instruments at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively:

Management's Discussion and Analysis
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
    The following is Management's discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of the operations of UNB Corp. (the Corporation). It is
intended to amplify certain financial information regarding UNB Corp. and
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements,
related Notes, and the Five Year Summary of Selected Data included in this
report.
    UNB Corp. is a locally owned and operated one-bank holding company whose
principal subsidiary is the United National Bank and Trust Company (the Bank).
The Bank is a full service commercial bank offering a complete range of
personal, trust, and business financial products and services through its
twenty branch network located in Stark and southern Summit Counties.
    On September 16, 1994, UNB Corp., acting through the Bank, successfully
acquired four branches of the former Transohio Federal Savings Bank (Transohio)
from the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Transohio was a federal savings
and loan association headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio which was placed in
receivership by the Office of Thrift Supervision and operated by the RTC as
conservator. The Bank acquired certain assets of cash and options to acquire
certain fixed assets and received cash from the RTC equal to the difference
between the liabilities assumed by the Bank and the value of the assets
purchased. The Bank assumed approximately $70.4 million in deposit liabilities
and received certain assets and cash from the RTC less a premium paid to the
RTC. Performance in 1995 reflected a full year of the impact of this
acquisition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    UNB Corp.'s net income for 1995 was $7,379,466 which represents an 11.3%
increase over 1994 net income of $6,628,089, which in turn represented a 4.6%
increase over 1993 net income of $6,337,856. Primary earnings per share for
1995 was $2.52, an increase of $.20 per share from 1994, whereas 1994 primary
earnings per share of $2.32 represented a $.05 decrease from 1993. On a fully
diluted basis, earnings per share for 1995 were $2.51, compared to $2.22 for
1994 and $2.27 for 1993, respectively.
    Return on average assets was 1.14%, 1.24%, and 1.29% for 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively. The Corporation's return on average equity, which is to a
great extent effected by its strong capital base, was 11.98%, 11.45% and 12.63%
for the same periods. The reduction in primary and fully diluted earnings per
share and return on average equity from 1993 to 1994 reflects the impact of the
adoption of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," in addition to the impact of the inclusion of the 1993 stock offering
in average equity for a full year in 1994 and 1995. This additional equity was
raised to position the Corporation to take advantage of future acquisition and
expansion opportunities, such as the Transohio branches acquired in 1994.

NET INTEREST INCOME
    Net interest income, the primary source of earnings for the Corporation, is
the difference between interest and loan fee income generated on earning assets
and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds (Table 1). For
1995, net interest income increased to $27,953,146 from $24,191,419 in 1994, an
increase of 15.5%. For 1994, net interest income increased to $24,191,419 from
$22,721,100 in 1993, an increase of 6.5%. These annual increases are primarily
attributable to the growth in interest earning assets exceeding the growth in
interest bearing liabilities. Cost of funds rates continued to increase more
rapidly in 1995 than earning asset yields. While this difference between the
funding cost and earnings yield has decreased, strong earning asset growth has
prevented an adverse impact on net interest income.
    Total interest income in 1995 increased by $12,059,082, or 32.0%, over
1994.  This compares to a $2,319,156, or 6.6% increase from 1993 to 1994. In
1995, the most significant factor to impact the level of interest income was
the growth in average earning assets to $600,130,000 from $495,711,000 in 1994.
In 1995, the Bank was positioned to take advantage of strong loan demand
attributable to a low interest rate environment. Strong deposit growth combined
with the proceeds from the assumption of Transohio deposits in 1994 which were
placed in the Securities Portfolio and whose cash flows and maturities
supported the 1995 loan growth contributed to the strong performance. Comparing
1993 to 1994, growth was attributed to increased earning assets funded by
deposits assumed from the Transohio branch acquisition and strong loan growth
concentrated in the Consumer Loan Portfolio. The yield on earning assets
increased by

67 basis points in 1995, a result of higher yields in  mortgage-backed  and
other securities and loans.  From 1993 to 1994, the yield on earning assets
decreased by 26 basis points as a result of lower yields earned on tax-exempt
and other securities and loans.
    Total interest expense increased in 1995 by $8,297,355, or 61.4%, over
1994.  This compares to a $848,837, or 6.7% increase from 1993 to 1994. Average
interest bearing liabilities grew to $511,255,000, an increase of $96,458,000
or 23.3% over 1994. This compares to a $30,477,000, or 7.9% increase from 1993
to 1994. In 1995, interest expense was impacted for the entire year by more
expensive Transohio deposits which contained a higher percentage of deposits in
more expensive Certificates of Deposit. The Bank's core deposit to total
deposit percentage declined in 1995 as the Bank became more reliant on more
expensive Certificates of Deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances to fund
the strong loan growth. Passbook and Statement Savings deposits continued to
decline as depositors sought higher yields in Certificates of Deposit and
alternative investments outside the banking industry. During the second half of
the year, the Bank's emphasis on funding asset growth was directed toward
attracting and retaining Certificates of Deposit. During this period, the Bank
offered very competitive rates in all maturity ranges. The increase from 1993
to 1994 was significantly impacted by the Transohio acquisition, since rates on
Transohio deposits, on average, were higher than those paid on the Bank's own
deposits.
    Net interest margin is the measure of the net yield on average earning
assets on a fully taxable basis. The net interest margin is calculated by
dividing net interest income on a fully taxable basis by average earning
assets.  The net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning
assets and supporting deposits and borrowings and the interest rate spread
between them.  The Bank's net interest margin decreased to 4.68% in 1995. From
1993 to 1994, the net interest margin decreased from 5.09% to 4.92% (Table 1).
The decline for these two periods was the net result of a smaller increase in
the yields received on interest earning assets than the increase in rates paid
on interest bearing liabilities.

OTHER INCOME
    Other income for 1995 totaled $5,616,985, a decrease of $26,817, or less
than 1.0%, from 1994. This compares to a decrease of $365,088, or 6.1% from
1993 to 1994 (Table 3). Service charges on deposits decreased $53,457, or 2.2%,
in 1995. The Bank's deposit accounts were restructured in 1994. This
restructuring afforded depositors the opportunity to avoid service charges by
carrying minimum balances in their accounts. While this restructuring reduced
service charges, deposit balances and average account balances increased. From
1993 to 1994, service charges increased $160,842, or 7.1%. This growth is the
result of the increase in the deposit base, primarily from the Transohio
deposit acquisition.
    Trust Department earnings showed continued growth in 1995 with income up
$345,639, or 16.0%, from 1994. A new fee structure instituted in the second
half of 1994 had a significant impact on 1995 income. Managed assets increased
to $489.0 million compared to $391.4 million and $392.6 million in 1994 and
1993, respectively. This increase in managed assets in 1995 was the primary
contributor to the increase in Trust income. The reduction in managed assets
from 1993 to 1994 was partially the result of the decline in market values
prompted by the effect of rising interest rates on fixed income assets.
    Other operating income for 1995 was $667,627, a decrease of $149,440, or
18.3% compared to 1994. The primary factor contributing to the decline in 1995
was the reduction in fee income from the sales of annuities and mutual funds
investments. In 1995, the Bank switched third party providers which left the
program without sales support for a portion of the year. The Bank has since
joined with Essex Corporation and anticipates increased income in 1996. From
1993 to 1994, operating income declined $389,000 or 32.3%. In 1993, income
benefited significantly from a $325,000 one-time positive valuation adjustment
on other real estate owned.
    In 1994, a one-time gain was taken to recognize a portion of the market
appreciation in the Corporation's equity portfolio. Gains on mortgage loans
originated for resale in 1995 contributed $67,087 compared to $38,031 in 1994.
In 1994, gains declined $324,920 compared to 1993. This was due to the
unfavorable impact of the rising interest rate environment in 1994. Should
interest rates rise in 1996, there will be little opportunity to improve on
1995's performance.

OTHER EXPENSE 

    Total other expense of $20,655,175 in 1995 increased over 1994 by   
$1,844,931, or 9.8%. From 1993 to 1994, expenses increased by $1,169,948, or
6.6% (Table 3). Total employee compensation, including salaries, wages and
benefits, grew 10.5% from 1994. From 1993 to 1994, the increase was 6.6%. 

    For 1995, total employee compensation accounted for 49.1% of Other Expense
compared to 48.8% in both 1994 and 1993. A major contributor to this increase
was a full year's cost of staff additions which resulted from the Transohio
branch acquisition. In addition, the Bank's incentive payout from the
performance based Stakeholder Program increased in 1995. While salary and
benefits per employee increased in 1995, total employee com-

<PAGE>   32
29

pensation equaled only 1.7% of average earning assets compared to 1.9% in 1994
and 1.9% in 1993. Management monitors employee compensation closely through a
well defined salary administration program and merit increases tied to the
Bank's "pay for performance" program.
    The one-time expenses in 1994 associated with the Transohio branch
acquisition were substantially matched in 1995 by a full year's amortization of
the Transohio goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded as part of
the transaction.
    In 1995, new risk based deposit insurance premiums went into effect as
part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA)
passed by Congress in 1991. The annual assessment for each institution is now
determined on the basis of capital adequacy and other regulatory risk
assessments. Due to the Bank's capital levels and supervisory ratings and the
overcapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), the premium on BIF insured
deposits decreased from $0.23 per $100 of deposits to $0.04 effective in June
of 1995. For at least the first six months of 1996, the premium on BIFinsured
deposits has been reduced to $0. Deposits of the Bank that were acquired
through the purchase of savings and loan branches from the RTC, and are insured
by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), continue to be assessed
premiums at the rate of $0.23 per $100 of deposits. The FDIC premium expense
reduction to the Bank amounted to $210,560 in 1995. In 1996, Management
anticipates, based on legislation currently pending in Congress, that the Bank
will be required to pay a one-time assessment of approximately $700,000 on
deposits acquired through the RTC and insured by the SAIF fund. This assessment
will be used to recapitalize the SAIF fund which insures these deposits. After
paying the assessment, the premium on those deposits is expected to decline. In
1997, if the FDIC continues to assess deposits at the lower premium rates,
Management expects expense savings approximating the amount of the one-time
assessment.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
    The allowance for loan losses is maintained by Management at a level
considered adequate to cover possible future losses. The amount of the
provision for loan losses charged to operating expenses is the amount
necessary, in the opinion of Management, to maintain the allowance for loan
losses at an adequate level. Management determines the adequacy of the
allowance based on past experience, changes in portfolio size and mix, relative
quality of the Loan Portfolio and the rate of loan growth, assessments of
current and future economic conditions, information about specific borrower
situations, including their financial position and collateral values, and other
factors and estimates, which are subject to change over time. While
Management's periodic analysis of the allowance for loan losses may dictate
portions of the allowance be allocated to specific problem loans, the entire
amount is available for any loan charge-offs that may occur.
    The allowance for loan losses on December 31, 1995, was $7,242,003, or
1.40% of outstanding loans, compared to $6,348,219, or 1.54%, at year-end
1994, and $6,055,843, or 1.73%, at year-end 1993.
    The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense was $1,750,000
in 1995 compared to $1,020,000 in 1994 and $2,195,000 in 1993. The increase in
1995 was a direct result of strong loan growth. The provision declined in 1994
compared to 1993 due to Management's decision in 1993 to fund the allowance so
that as a percentage of total loans outstanding, the allowance was comparable
to the Bank's peers. Management continued to maintain the allowance at a level
comparable to the Bank's peers in 1994 and 1995.

</TABLE>
    Net charge-offs for 1995 were $856,000, compared to $728,000 for 1994 and
$494,000 for 1993. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding
for 1995 was 0.18% compared to 0.19% in 1994 and 0.15% for 1993.
    Impaired loans totaled $566,269 at December 31, 1995. Non-performing loans
at year-end 1995 were $1,320,000 compared to $1,061,000 at year-end 1994 and
$645,000 at year-end 1993. Non-performing loans consist of loans past due 90
days or more and loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status. As of
December 31, 1995, 21.4% of non-performing loans were Commercial and Commercial
Real Estate Loans, 55.2% were Residential Mortgage Loans, and 23.4% were
Consumer Loans. This compares to 10.3%, 47.5%, and 42.2%, respectively, for the
same categories at year-end 1994. The ratio of non-performing loans to total
loans was 0.25% for 1995 and 0.39% for 1994. This ratio compares very favorably
to that of the Bank's peer group at 0.78%. Due to anticipated loan growth built
into the 1996 Profit Plan, Management anticipates increasing the provision to
maintain a similar reserve-to-loan ratio to that of the past year.
    On January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (SFAS) No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."
SFASNo. 114 and 118 address the accounting by creditors for impairment of all
loans identified for evaluation, uncollateralized as well as collateralized,
except for large groups of small balance, homogenous loans that collectively
are evaluated for impairment.
    Under SFAS 114, when Management determines that a loss is possible, a full
or partial charge-off is recorded for the amount the book value of the impaired
loan exceeds the present value of the cash flows or the fair value of the
collateral, for collateral dependent loans. Under SFAS 118, Management has
classified all impaired loans as nonaccrual status. Loans which were classified
as nonaccrual and have been brought current must remain current for six months
before removal from nonaccrual status and are not considered impaired for
purposes of these Statements.

INCOME TAXES
    The provision for income taxes for 1995 was  $3,785,490,  up from
$3,376,888 and $2,910,668 in 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  This increase is the
result of higher taxable income and lower tax-exempt income for 1995. Management
anticipates that in the future it will continue to encounter limited
opportunities for obtaining tax-free investments with attractive tax-equivalent
yields and desired maturities due to changing tax regulations and competitive
market conditions. In addition, the stated federal tax rate increased from 34%
to 35% for pretax earnings in excess of $10 million.  As the Bank continues to
grow, incremental earnings will be taxed at the higher rate. In 1995, the
effective federal income tax rate for the Corporation equaled 33.9% compared to
33.8% in 1994 and 32.7% in 1993.
    Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS
No. 109, deferred tax expense is computed following the liability method.
Adopting SFAS No. 109 resulted in a positive effect on earnings for 1993 of
$353,830.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
    Total assets were $699,643,837 at year-end 1995, compared to $601,083,685
at December 31, 1994, an increase of $98,560,152, or 16.4%, over 1994. Earning
assets at December 31, 1995 were $651,760,563, an increase of $98,817,790, or
17.9%, over 1994 year-end. Earning assets equaled 93.2% and 92.0% of total
assets at year-end 1995 and 1994, respectively. The composition of earning
assets also changed in 1995, as the mix of Consumer, Mortgage and Commercial
Loans changed. Liquidity in the Securities Portfolio was used to fund loan
growth.
    At December 31, 1995, Federal Funds Sold were $4,300,000, an increase of
$3,700,000 from December 31, 1994. Total Investments and Mortgage-Backed
Securities decreased $11,292,711, or 8.1%, from 1994. Total Loans increased
$106,207,561, or 25.7%, over 1994 with growth concentrated in the areas of
indirect Consumer Loans,Mortgage Loans, and Commercial Real Estate Loans.
United Bank continues to serve the business and professional communities and to
satisfy the credit needs of its customers.
    Total deposits on December 31, 1995 were $547,187,160, compared to
$486,770,515 at year-end 1994. This 12.4% increase is primarily attributable to
a $62,842,345 increase in Certificates of Deposit. Short-term Borrowings at
year-end 1995 increased $14,762,217 over year-end 1994.




<PAGE>   34

    FHLB advances increased  $14,700,000 over 1994,  attributable to borrowings
in the first half of 1995 used to fund strong loan growth.  The Bank's
loan-to-deposit ratio at December 31, 1995 increased to 93.5% versus 83.4% at
year-end 1994.

LOANS
    Total net loans were $511,487,786 at year-end 1995 compared to $406,174,009
at year-end 1994. This represents an increase of $105,313,777, or 25.9%, over
1994. Loans comprised 77.4% of the Corporation's average earning assets during
1995, compared to 77.8% in 1994 and 75.5% in 1993. The product mix in the loan
portfolio shows Consumer Loans, Mortgage Loans, Commercial Loans and Commercial
Real Estate comprising 42.6%, 33.2%, 12.5% and 11.7%, respectively, at December
31, 1995, compared with 44.2%, 28.0%, 14.9%, and 12.9%, respectively, at
December 31, 1994. This change in the loan portfolio mix reflects the Bank's
continuing strategy of increasing the retail loan portfolio through increased
Consumer and Mortgage lending. Business loan demand continued to be fairly weak
in 1995 and competition for quality loans became more intense. In 1994,
preceded by a substantial interest rate decline in 1993, the demand for new
fixed rate mortgages and refinancing of existing variable and fixed rate loans
increased dramatically. By offering competitive rates, the Bank was able to
increase its mortgage loan portfolio.  This growth was the main reason for the
change in loan mix. The loan portfolio is diverse, covering a wide range of
borrowers. There are no loans outstanding which in total could be considered a
concentration of lending in any particular industry or group of industries.
    Loans contributed 83.4% of total interest income in 1995 compared to 84.3%
in 1994 and 83.1% in 1993. Loan yield was 8.96% in 1995, 69 basis points higher
than 1994 and 65 basis points higher than the average rate for earning assets.
Management recognizes that while the loan portfolio holds some of the Bank's
highest yielding assets, it is inherently the most risky portfolio.
Accordingly, Management attempts to balance credit risk versus return with
conservative credit standards. Management has developed and maintains
comprehensive underwriting guidelines and a loan review function which monitors
credits during and after the approval

process. To minimize risks associated with changes in the borrowers' future
repayment capacity, the Bank generally requires scheduled periodic principal
payments on all types of loans and normally requires collateral. To reduce the
risk of volatility in collateral values, Management usually requires down
payments on its Mortgage and Consumer Loans and seeks a reasonable and
continuing level of equity in commercial customers' businesses.
    Consumer Loans increased to $220,738,840 on December 31, 1995 from
$182,262,910 on December 31, 1994. Management continued to expand its dealer
network both geographically as well as the number of dealers. Dealer paper was
purchased using strict underwriting guidelines with an emphasis on quality, not
quantity. Indirect loans comprise 78.5% of the Consumer Loan Portfolio in 1995
compared to 78.1% in 1994. In 1995, the Consumer Loan Department implemented a
credit scoring system which helped to maintain the high credit standards
already in place. In addition, credit scoring helped by improving customer
service through quicker response times, improving management reporting and
assisting the Bank in meeting its regulatory responsibilities.
    Home Equity Line of Credit outstandings were $17,896,153 at December 31,
1995, or an increase of 25.4% over 1994. This product was redesigned in 1995 to
enable homeowners to borrow up to 100% of the equity they have in their home.
It also features a very attractive tiered interest rate based on the Prime Rate
and a lower monthly payment amount than previously offered. Management views
the current product as one which will make the Bank very competitive in this
market segment.
    Residential Mortgage Loans increased to $172,282,619 at December 31, 1995,
up from $115,353,701 in 1994. The Bank increased its realtor base
significantly, with strong growth coming from eastern Stark County. A small
correspondent program initiated toward the end of 1994 helped to increase
mortgage loan penetration in southern Summit County. The Bank sold $5.1 million
of fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market while retaining the servicing
rights to the loans as a source of fee income. The offering of very competitive
rates, combined with a favorable rate environment, helped the Bank's Mortgage
Loan Department attain the distinction of being Stark County's number one
mortgage lender in 1995. In 1995, the Bank's Mortgage Assistance Program
provided approximately $1.9 million in loans to low-to-moderate income
individuals to purchase homes. This program now has approximately $8.7 million
in loans outstanding.  If interest rates remain low or decline further,
Management anticipates an increase in mortgage loan refinancings. By offering
competitive rates and innovative products, the Bank should be able to attract
new loans while retaining existing loans.

    Commercial Loans at December 31, 1995 were $64,810,976, compared to
$61,094,079 for year-end 1994. This increase was particularly gratifying
because of the intense competition in the Bank's market and the fact that
Commercial Loan balances remained relatively constant from year-end 1993 to
year-end 1994.  The Bank's strategic plan targeted Commercial Real Estate loans
as a product which had strong growth potential. As of December 31, 1995,
Commercial Real Estate outstandings increased $7,226,355, or 13.6%, compared to
year-end 1994.  Since 1993, outstandings have increased by 29.4%. During 1995,
the Bank introduced the new Business Manager lending product. This product
provides business customers with immediate cash flow by selling their accounts
receivable to the Bank. Management feels that there is a strong demand for this
product in its market and anticipates continued growth in 1996.

INVESTMENTS
    The Bank's Investment Portfolio provides a degree of liquidity for the
Bank, while it also generates interest income. The Investment Portfolio
consists primarily of U.S. Treasury and Agency Securities, various types of
Asset-backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, and various
types of short term money market instruments. At the holding company level, a
small portfolio of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, common stocks, money
market instruments and tax-exempt securities is maintained. At December 31,
1995, the Corporation's consoli-dated Investment Portfolio was $128,216,265
versus $139,508,976 at year-end 1994.
    The Bank continues to purchase securities which are eligible to be pledged
against the deposited funds of public entities and for use as collateral in
Repurchase Agreements. At year-end, there were $84,609,074 of securities
pledged for these purposes compared $60,087,996 at year-end 1994.
    Management utilizes the Investment Portfolio as a source of income and
liquidity. During the first three quarters of the year, maturities and
principal repayments were used to fund loan growth. As the Bank experienced a
seasonal slowing of loan demand late in the year, funds were invested primarily
in shorter term securities that will provide a source of funds for additional
loan growth in 1996.
    Under the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No.  115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
the securities in the Corporation's portfolio are classified as either
Available for Sale or Held to Maturity. Securities in the Available for Sale
account are marked to market at the end of each quarter, with the gain or loss
shown as an adjustment to shareholders' equity. At year end 1995, the adjust-

ment to shareholders' equity for unrealized gain on the portfolio was $844,921,
compared to an unrealized loss of $1,440,629 in the previous year. This
represents an increase to shareholders' equity at December 31, 1995 of 1.30%.
The increase was due in part to a significant decrease in market rates during
1995, as well as a change in the composition of the portfolio as securities
purchased during a period of lower interest rates matured and were replaced at
current levels. In general, increases in interest rates will cause a decline in
the market values of fixed rate securities. The market values of equity
securities are subject to other factors that are not necessarily related to
interest rates, and will not change in a predictable manner.

DEPOSITS
    Deposits are the Bank's primary source for funding its earning assets. The
Bank offers a wide variety of products designed to attract and retain its
customers, with a primary focus on core deposits. Total deposits at December
31, 1995 were $547,187,160, an increase of $60,416,645 from 1994. In 1995,
Management actively pursued retaining the Bank's maturing Certificates of
Deposits as well as attracting new deposits. A portion of the funds from the
deposits assumed in the 1994 Transohio branch acquisition were invested short
term in the Investment Portfolio, which provided some liquidity in 1995 to
support loan growth. The Bank introduced two new products in 1995. The
MasterMoney product allows customers to make purchases at any MasterCard
merchant with the amount of the purchase automatically deducted from the
customer's checking account. The Money Market Access account, introduced in the
fourth quarter of 1995, has a tiered interest rate indexed to the 13- week
Treasury Bill rate. This product offers customers liquidity as well as a
competitive rate of return.
    The Bank's noninterest bearing Checking Account balances increased to
$73,707,817 at December 31, 1995 from $71,014,730 at December 31, 1994, an
increase of 3.8%. Interest bearing NOW Accounts grew to $74,201,892 at December
31, 1995, a 1.6% increase. At December 31, 1995, Savings Accounts totaled
$151,069,955, a decline of 4.0% from year-end 1994 while Certificates of
Deposit were $248,207,496, an increase of 33.9% over year-end 1994. The
decrease in Savings balances and corresponding increase in Certificates of
Deposit reflects depositors searching for higher yields available in both
Certificates of Deposit and in alternative investments found outside the
banking industry, specifically mutual funds.
    Core deposit growth remains a primary objective of the Bank's deposit
strategy for 1996. As in the past, the level and direction of interest rates
will play a key role in the growth and mix of deposits in 1996. Market rates
began to decline late in 1995. If rates continue their downward trend in 1996,
the mix of deposits could shift to more liquid deposit products.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
    Capital represents shareholder ownership in the Corporation. It serves as a
cushion against potential losses and provides a base for asset growth. The
capital adequacy of the Bank and the Corporation is monitored closely by
Management, regulators and investors. The adequacy of capital is an important
indicator of financial stability and performance. The assessment of capital
adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality, liquidity, earnings
performance, competition and economic conditions.
    FDICIA, which was enacted in December, 1991, set the guidelines for a
financial institution to be "well capitalized." These guidelines require a
minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%
and leverage ratio of 5%. All of the Corporation's assets, which include
various risk-weighted percentages of assets on the balance sheet, as well as
off-balance sheet exposures, are expressed as a percentage of risk-adjusted
assets and compared to its capital. Tier 1 capital consists of shareholders'
equity and such items as mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt, and the
allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 1995, UNBCorp. had a total
risk-based capital ratio of 12.67%, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.42%. Both
of these risk-based capital ratios are well above minimum regulatory
requirements.
    In addition to risk-based capital, a leverage ratio test must also be met.
This ratio evaluates capital adequacy on the basis of Tier 1 capital-to-total
assets (unadjusted for risk). On December 31, 1995, UNBCorp.'s leverage ratio
was 8.26%, which substantially exceeds the Corporation's minimum regulatory
requirement.

    Total shareholders' equity equaled $65,326,883 on December 31, 1995,
compared to $58,640,442 on December 31, 1994. These amounts include market
value adjustments under SFAS No. 115 of $844,921 and $(1,440,629) at year-end
1995 and 1994, respectively. The book value per share of stock was $22.73 at
year-end 1995 compared to $20.43 at year-end 1994, an 11.3% increase.
    Cash dividends paid to shareholders of UNBCorp. during the year ended
December 31, 1995 totaled $3,016,675 or $1.05 per share. This compared to
$2,742,404, or $0.96 per share for the year ended December 31, 1994. In
addition to the regular dividend of $1.00 per share, a special cash dividend of
$0.05 per share was declared by the Board of Directors and paid in December,
1995. The dividends per share represent an increase of 9.4% over 1994.
Dividends paid in 1995 represented a payout ratio of 40.9% of net income
compared to 41.4% in 1994. This is within the guidelines established by
UNBCorp.'s Board of Directors for a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 45% of net
income. As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Corporation's primary source of funds for the payment of dividends is its Bank
subsidiary. The Bank is limited by regulation as to the amount of dividend
which can be paid. Currently, this restriction will not preclude the Bank from
paying sufficient dividends to fund the usual quarterly dividends paid to the
Corporation's shareholders.
    Including dividends and appreciation, the stock returned 17.3% to its
shareholders during 1995. At year-end 1995, the market value of the stock was
193.6% of the year-end book value compared to 188.4% at year-end 1994.
    Participation in UNBCorp.'s Dividend Reinvestment Plan continued to grow in
1995. This plan allows shareholders to reinvest all or a portion of their
dividends automatically in the purchase of additional shares. Currently, there
are 922 shareholders participating with 33.4% of the dividend paid being
reinvested in the plan. Management will continue to promote this plan because
it provides the opportunity to generate new Tier 1 capital for the Corporation
and allows shareholders to increase their holdings of stock without paying
brokers' fees and commissions.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
    A volatile banking environment, shrinking interest margins, increasing
expenses and regulatory mandates make Asset and Liability Management imperative
for the Management of UNB Corp. Management has established and maintains loan,
investment, deposit and borrowed funds policies and strategies based on sound
Asset and Liability Management principles in order to achieve its goal of
consistent growth in earnings, independent of volatile interest rates, amid
deregulation of the financial industry and the uncertainties of the national
and local economies.
    The objective of the Corporation's Asset and Liability Management Policy is
to help Management establish a profit plan for the Corporation through the
coordination of asset mix and volume controls, liquidity, capital and dividend
policies, interest margin management, sound investment and loan portfolio
management, loan pricing policies, purchased funds policies and cash management
techniques. This profit plan seeks to maximizing profitability while minimizing
the adverse effects on net interest margin resulting from fluctuations in
interest rates.
    All assets and liabilities are designated as being either rate sensitive or
non-rate sensitive during some assigned time period such as one month or one
year. Interest rate sensitivity relates to that time period when assets and
liabilities can be repriced. Management attempts to match rate sensitive assets
and rate sensitive liabilities in an effort to maintain an acceptable net
interest margin regardless of the level or direction of interest rates for both
assets and liabilities. The GAP measures the variance in this matching process
and is defined as the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate
sensitive liabilities within an assigned time frame. The GAP can be either
positive or negative, and is viewed as the dollar measure of the Bank's
exposure to changes in interest rates over a certain time frame. A negative GAP
benefits net interest income when rates are decreasing, while a positive GAP
benefits net interest income when rates are increasing. The reverse is also
true for each of these.
    The Bank monitors its GAP using certain adjustments to deposits that have
no specified maturity date. Some of these deposits are scheduled to reprice in
one month and others are assumed to be less rate sensitive and are repriced in
a later period, based on the Bank's actual experience. The Bank's three month,
six month and twelve month modified adjusted cumulative GAP's were -5.20%,
- -7.15%, and -5.52% at year-end 1995 (Table 8), which represents a decline in
liability sensitivity from year-end 1994. Part of the decrease can be
attributed to the gradual assimilation of deposits acquired late in 1994 from
the former Transohio into the

    Bank's various deposit products. In addition, as interest rates showed
signs of declining during the year, there was a shift in Certificate of Deposit
maturities to terms longer than twelve months. The Bank's Asset and
Liability Management Policy specifies a plus 10% to minus 10% range for the
twelve month modified adjusted cumulative GAP, and the uncertainty of the
interest rate environment in 1996 mandates that the Bank continue to manage the
GAP within these tolerances.
    Management uses static GAP analysis as one technique to measure and
minimize interest rate risk. In addition to GAP management, the Bank also uses
the more dynamic techniques of simulation and duration. Simulation is the
process of measuring the amount that net interest income and the market value
of the Bank's equity will change over a twelve month time horizon given a
specified movement in interest rates. Duration is a method used to estimate the
market value sensitivity of the various financial assets and liabilities
contained on the balance sheet by quantifying relative interest rate risk among
assets with different coupons, maturities, cash flows and repricing
characteristics. The comparison of the duration of the Bank's assets and
liabilities, both individually and in total, provides another measure of the
potential impact of changes in rates on the Bank's financial position.
    The Bank has access to a variety of funding and hedging instruments to
insulate earnings from changes in interest rates. These include Federal Home
Loan Bank advances as well as various off-balance-sheet products such as
interest rate swaps, caps and floors. At year-end 1995, the Bank was paying a
fixed rate of 2.88% and receiving a variable rate of 5.875% on an interest rate
swap with a notional principal balance of $6,625,000. The variable rate resets
quarterly at three-month LIBOR and the notional principal balance amortizes
quarterly according to a predetermined schedule that corresponds to the
expected prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
    Liquidity is a measure of the Corporation's ability to fund loan
commitments and meet deposit maturities and withdrawals in a timely and
cost-effective manner. The Bank's Asset and Liability Committee actively
analyzes and manages the Corporation's liquidity. Principal sources of
liquidity for the Corporation and the Bank are cash and cash equivalents,
federal funds sold, short-term money market investments, the cash flows
provided by maturities and amortizations in the Loan and Investment Portfolios
and the strong core deposit base.
    On December 31, 1995, cash and cash equivalents equaled $31,735,149 or 4.5%
of total assets. The change in cash and cash equivalents is shown in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and arises from operating, investing and
financing activities. These activities are summarized for the three years ended
December 31, 1995 in Table 9.
    The adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operating
activities primarily consisted of $1,750,000 in provision for loan losses,
$1,094,337 from amortization of intangible assets, $789,359 from depreciation
and amortization of fixed assets and $461,821 in net accretion of discounts in
the Investment Portfolio. These items represent income and expense included in
net income which did not represent an expenditure or receipt of cash.
    Cash flows from investing activities related primarily to changes in loans
and investments. During 1995, $107,271,403 of net loan purchases and additions
and an increase in the balance of Federal Funds Sold of $3,700,000 were the
primary uses of cash through investing activities. The primary source of cash
through investing activities was a net reduction in the Investment Portfolio of
$15,223,676.
    Net cash from financing activities totaled $86,900,287. The major cash
sources from financing activities in 1995 were net increases in deposits,
borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and short-term borrowings of
$60,416,645, $14,700,000 and $14,762,217, respectively. The payment of
$3,016,677 in cash dividends was the only use of cash from financing
activities.  The net result of these cash flows was an increase of cash and
cash equivalents from year-end 1994 to 1995 of $1,524,465. Management is not
aware of any trend or event that is reasonably likely to occur or will result
in the Corporation being unable to meet all current and projected cash needs.

IMPACT OF FDICIA
    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) applies
to banks with total assets in excess of $500 million. During the second half of
1994 and throughout 1995, Management spent considerable time ensuring
compliance with requirements for documenting internal control reporting. This
year's Annual Report contains a statement from Management attesting to the
internal control structure of the Corporation, including policies, procedures
and compliance with laws and regulations within the Banking industry. In
addition, the Bank's independent external auditor has attested to the accuracy
of Management's assertions regarding internal control systems over financial
reporting.

IMPACT OF INFLATION
    Consolidated financial data included herein has been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Presently, GAAP requires
UNB Corp. to measure financial position and operating results in terms of
historical dollars, except for securities available for sale which are carried
at fair value.  Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or
recession are generally not considered.
    In Management's opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial
condition of UNB Corp. to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation
rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation
rate, they do not move concurrently. Rather, interest rate volatility is based
on changes in the expected rate of inflation, as well as changes in monetary
and fiscal policy. A financial institution's ability to be relatively
unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability
to perform in today's volatile economic environment. In an effort to insulate
itself from the effects of interest rate volatility, UNB Corp. works toward the
goal of having rate sensitive assets and liabilities respond to interest rate
changes in a similar time frame and to a similar degree.

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

   Under the Code of Regulations of UNB Corp., the Board of Directors is
divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II, and Class III,
with each class consisting of approximately one-third of the total number of
directors as fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Currently,
that number has been fixed at seven.  The directors serve staggered three-year
terms, so that directors of only one class are elected at each Annual Meeting.
At the forthcoming Annual Meeting, the Shareholders will be asked to elect two
directors of Class II.  Those nominees receiving the greatest number of votes
will be elected as directors.  There is no minimum number of votes required to
elect a director.
   The nominees for election at the forthcoming Annual Meeting are Messrs. E.
Lang D'Atri and Robert L. Mang.  The nominees are presently directors of the
Corporation.
   The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote the proxy in
accordance with the choices specified.  If no choices are specified, it is the
intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy to vote for the
two nominees named above.  Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of
persons than the number of nominees named.

              PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

   The Board of Directors of the Corporation believes that it would be in the
best interest of the Corporation and its Shareholders that the Articles of
Incorporation be amended to increase the number of no par value Common Shares
from the 5,000,000 shares presently authorized to 15,000,000 shares. The number
of no par value shares outstanding as of January 31, 1996, including 73,387
shares acquirable within sixty days through the exercise of stock options, was
2,947,363. One Hundred Ninety-One Thousand and Ten (191,010) Common Shares have
been authorized or reserved for issuance pursuant to the 1987 Stock Option and
Performance Unit Plan. An additional Two Hundred Eighty-Nine Thousand Four
Hundred and Six (289,406) Common Shares have been authorized or reserved for
issuance pursuant to the 1989 Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
   The purposes for increasing the number of authorized Common Shares are to
have additional shares available for issuance in the future for stock splits,
stock dividends, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes. These additional
shares may be issued on authorization of the Board of Directors without further
approval of Shareholders, except as may be required by law. The Board of
Directors has no present agreements, commitments, or understandings for the
issuance of any such shares, with the exception of shares which may be issued
pursuant to the 1987 Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan or the 1989
Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
   The adoption of the proposed amendment will require the affirmative vote of
the holders of 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation. If so
adopted, a Certificate of Amendment to the Corporation's Articles of
Incorporation will be filed with the Secretary of the State of Ohio.

   THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVES AND RECOMMENDS TO THE
SHAREHOLDERS THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION.

                   COMPENSATION AND PENSION COMMITTEE REPORT
                                  JANUARY 1996

         The Compensation and Pension Committee's Report to the Shareholders
which follows was approved and adopted by the Committee and by the Board of
Directors on January 18, 1996. The members of the Compensation and Pension
Committee are all independent directors.
   UNB Corp. did not incur any salary expense in 1995 nor did it provide
pensions, profit sharing, tax-deferred savings plans, an incentive compensation
plan, or any other benefits to any of its officers or directors. All such
expenses are paid for, and any type of compensation or benefit plan is provided
by, UNB Corp.'s wholly owned subsidiary, the United National Bank & Trust Co.
All executive officers of the Corporation are also executive officers of the
Bank.
   The Compensation Plan for the executive officers listed in the table below
consisted of these components: a base salary; the United Bank Stakeholder
Incentive Plan; and the 1987 Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan. Also, the
executive officers listed below are eligible for the UNB Tax Deferred Savings
Plan (401-K) and the UNB Corp. and Affiliates Deferred Compensation Plan.
   On November 18, 1993, the Board of Directors of the United National Bank &
Trust Co. adopted the United Bank Stakeholder Incentive Plan.  This Plan, which
is based on the achievement of multiple financial and other goals by the Bank
and individual Bank departments, will allow all United Bank employees an
opportunity to earn an incentive over and above their base salaries. In 1995,
the performance of the executive officers listed in the table below was
evaluated under the United Bank Stakeholder Incentive Plan.
   The base salary and the cash incentive paid under the United Bank
Stakeholder Incentive Plan to the Chief Executive Officer are based on the
achievement of specific performance objectives established by the Compensation
and Pension Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.  The Chief
Executive Officer's performance objective is related directly to corporate
performance as measured by the Corporation's Return on Equity and the actual
net income of the Corporation compared to a targeted net income figure as
approved by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Compensation and
Pension Committee.
   Base salaries and cash incentives paid under the United Bank Stakeholder
Incentive Plan to the other executive officers also are determined, in part, by
the overall performance of the Corporation as measured by the Corporation's
Return on Equity and the achievement of net income and other objectives. In
addition, executive officers' salaries are based on the achievement of other
specific functional, managerial, and individual objectives which are
established each year by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the
Compensation and Pension Committee.
   The United Bank Stakeholder Incentive Plan provides for a percentage of the
Bank's income to be available for distribution to all eligible employees of the
Bank based on achieving a certain level of net income and on other key
performance indicators. The underlying principle of this Plan is to reward for
specific performance. Eligibility and allocation of incentive awards are
determined by the Compensation and Pension Committee and approved by the Board
of Directors; incentive awards are paid in February of the year following the
year in which the performance objectives were achieved.

   The 1987 Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan was designed to benefit the
Corporation and its Shareholders by enabling the Corporation and the Bank to
attract and retain a strong management group. It is a long-term incentive
compensation plan designed to provide a competitive incentive and reward
program for the participants who remain with the company on a long-term basis;
the Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan's grants do not fully vest until
five years after being awarded. The grants are based on the achievement of
financial and other corporate goals which are established by the Compensation
and Pension Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.
   Effective October 1, 1984, the Bank established the UNB Tax-Deferred Savings
Plan (401-K) to which it may make contributions. Qualification of the Plan was
received on May 22, 1987. All full-time employees are eligible to participate
in the Plan, subject to certain eligibility requirements established by the
Plan. The Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers are
participants in the Plan on the same basis as all other eligible employees.
Participants are permitted to make voluntary contributions to their accounts in
the Plan. Participants' contributions are invested, by their choice, in one of
four funds. All employees of UNB Corp., or its subsidiaries, as of December 31,
1989, are 100% vested in the Bank's future contributions. All employees hired
after December 31, 1989, must accumulate three years of service to achieve 100%
vesting of the Bank's contributions.
   The UNB Corp. and Affiliates Deferred Compensation Plan provides an
opportunity for the participants to accumulate supplemental funds for
retirement on a tax-deferred basis. The purpose of this Plan is to aid the Bank
in attracting and retaining senior officers and directors of exceptional
ability by providing such individuals with the benefits of deferring
compensation under such a Plan. There is no financial contribution to this Plan
by either UNB Corp. or the Bank. Mr. Mang is currently participating in this
Plan.

                  1987 STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN

   Pursuant to its 1987 Stock Option and Performance Unit Plan (the Stock
Option Plan) which was approved by the Shareholders at the 1987 Annual Meeting,
there are outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 151,445 shares of
Common Stock of UNB Corp. at a price equal to 100% of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the respective dates on which the options were granted.
The outstanding options expire ten years from the date of grant.
   The Compensation and Pension Committee of the Bank's Board of Directors has
exclusive power to determine which employees participate in the Stock Option
Plan and the type and amount of awards to be made under the Stock Option Plan.
Options granted under the Stock Option Plan qualify as "incentive stock
options" as determined under the Internal Revenue Code.  No awards may be made
under the Stock Option Plan after February 11, 1997.
   Once awarded, each option cannot be exercised sooner than three years from
the date of grant nor later than ten years from the date of grant.  An option
may be exercised only while an optionee is an employee of the Corporation (or a
subsidiary) or within ninety days after termination of employment for any
reason other than death or total disability, but only to the extent that it was
exercisable at the date of termination.  If the optionee is terminated by
reason of total disability, his options may be exercised in full or in part, to
the extent not previously exercised, within one year following termination of
employment (but not later than the expiration date of such option).  If the
optionee shall cease to be employed by the Corporation by reason of normal
retirement (as defined in the Corporation's Pension Plan), the option shall
terminate and may no longer be exercised,
<PAGE>   10
except that within the period of ninety days following such retirement, but not
later than the expiration date of the option, the option may be exercised in
full or in part to the extent not previously exercised.  If an optionee's
employment is terminated by death or if he dies within ninety days after
cessation of employment, a person entitled by will or by the laws of descent
and distribution to exercise the options may exercise the options in full or in
part at any time prior to the expiration date of the options to the extent not
previously exercised.
   Once an option is awarded, the optionee, after the third consecutive year of
employment following the grant, may exercise the option and purchase up to 25%
of the total number of shares allowed by the option.  After the fourth
consecutive year of employment following the grant, the optionee may exercise
the option and purchase up to 50% of the total number of shares allowed by the
option.  The option shall be fully exercisable and the optionee may exercise
the option and purchase 100% of the total number of shares allowed by the
option after the fifth consecutive year of employment following the grant.
   Payment for shares upon exercise of an option under the Stock Option Plan
may be made in cash or by delivery of previously issued shares of Common Stock
of the Corporation having a fair market value equal to the exercise price, or a
combination of cash and shares.  There is reserved for issuance upon exercise
of stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan a total of 191,010 Common
Shares of the Corporation.

   UNB Corp. does not have an Employee Pension Plan.  However, executive
officers of UNB Corp. and the United National Bank & Trust Co. are participants
in the United National Bank & Trust Co.'s Pension Plan (the Plan) which is a
Defined Benefit Plan for all eligible full-time employees as defined by the
Plan.
   The following table sets forth retirement benefits at various levels of
compensation and years of service based upon retirement at age 65.  For this
table, benefits are based on 1995 Plan provisions using a male born in 1935.

    *NOTE:  BENEFITS LISTED DO NOT INCLUDE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.
     THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL SALARY ALLOWABLE FOR 1995 IS $150,000 FOR A DEFINED
     BENEFIT PLAN.

   A participant's remuneration covered by the Plan is his or her annual
compensation as defined by the Plan averaged over the three highest consecutive
compensation periods as defined in the Plan.  For the named executives as of
the end of the last calendar year, the covered compensation is:  Mang,
$150,000; Doyle, $123,041; Pennetti, $118,423; Sweeney, $108,028.  The
estimated years of service for each named executive is as follows:  Mang,
nineteen years; Doyle, nineteen years; Pennetti, twenty-three years; Sweeney,
twenty-six years.  Benefits are computed as a straight-life annuity beginning
at age 65.

                          CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS

   On November 16, 1995, the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and the
Bank approved the recommendation of the Compensation and Pension Committee and
adopted and entered into Change of Control Agreements (the Agreements) with the
four executive officers of the Bank, namely Robert L. Mang, Leo E. Doyle, James
J. Pennetti, and Robert M. Sweeney. The Agreements become effective only upon a
change of control of the Corporation as defined in the Agreements. If, prior to
a change of control, the executive's employment with the Corporation or the
Bank is terminated by death, retirement, disability, resignation, or dismissal
for any reason, the Agreements will terminate.
   The Boards of Directors approved and adopted these Agreements in order to
help to assure the objectivity of these executive officers in evaluating a
potential change of control and in advising the Board of Directors of the
Corporation whether or not a potential change of control would be in the best
interests of the Corporation and its Shareholders. Further, these Agreements
will help to assure the present and future continuity of executive management
and will be an inducement for these four key officers to remain in the
employment of the Corporation and the Bank should a change of control occur.
   The Change of Control Agreements provide that upon termination of
employment, as defined in the Agreements, within two years following a change
of control, unless the executive is terminated for good cause as defined in the
Agreements, the executive will be entitled to severance compensation. The
Agreements also provide that if the executive voluntarily terminates employment
not earlier than six months and not later than nine months following a change
of control, the executive will be entitled to severance compensation.
   In the event of the termination of the executive's employment as described
above, the executive shall be entitled to receive either a lump sum cash
payment equal to two years of compensation (base salary plus incentive) or upon
the executive's election, two years of compensation (base salary plus
incentive) payable in equal monthly payments, in cash, without interest.
   Following the termination of the executive's employment, the Corporation
shall continue the executive's coverage in the Bank's health, disability, and
life insurance plans, at the same levels that had been provided the executive
immediately prior to his termination of employment, for a period of two years.
   Payments made to an executive under the terms of the Agreements shall be
included within the definition of compensation for all qualified and
non-qualified retirement plans of the Corporation or the Bank. The benefit
period as defined in the Agreements shall be included within the computation of
any and all years of service and/or age requirements for the determination of
the amount of or vesting of benefits under the Corporation's or the Bank's

                TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND RELATED PARTIES

   Some of the directors and officers of UNB Corp., and the companies with
which they are associated, were customers of the Bank, and had banking
transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business during 1995, and
expect to have such banking transactions in the future.  All loans and
commitments for loans included in such transactions were made in the ordinary
course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates
and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with other persons, and in the opinion of the management of the Bank, did not
involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable
features.  The aggregate amount of such loans and commitments outstanding at
December 31, 1995, was $5,978,133, or 9.2%, of the Corporation's equity at
year-end 1995.
   Director E. Lang D'Atri is a partner in the law firm Day, Ketterer, Raley,
Wright & Rybolt.  In the ordinary course of business, UNB Corp.  and the United
National Bank & Trust Co. have retained the legal services of this firm in the
past and may retain its services in the future.  In 1995, the Corporation and
the Bank paid a total of $18,965 to Day, Ketterer, Raley, Wright & Rybolt for
legal services rendered by the firm.

               COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

   During the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, no
director, officer, or other person required to file such reports failed to file
reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or failed to file such
reports in a timely manner.

                               LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   There are no pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business of UNB Corp. and the United National Bank
& Trust Co., to which the Corporation or the Bank is a party.  There are no
pending legal proceedings to which any director, officer, affiliate of the
Corporation, any owner of record, or beneficiary of more than five percent (5%)
of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any associate of any such director,
officer, affiliate of the Corporation, or security holder is a party adverse to
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or has an interest adverse to that
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   Crowe, Chizek and Company, Certified Public Accountants, served as
independent public accountants for the purposes of auditing the Corporation's
Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and for the preparation of
consolidated tax returns for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.  The
appointment of independent public accountants is approved annually by the Board
of Directors.  The decision of the Board of Directors is based on the
recommendation of the Audit Committee.  In making its recommendation, the Audit
Committee reviewed both the audit scope and estimated fees for professional
services for the coming year.  On February 15, 1996, the Board of Directors
authorized the engagement of Crowe, Chizek and Company as independent public
accountants for the year 1996.
   One or more representatives of Crowe, Chizek and Company will attend the
Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so
desire.  They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.
