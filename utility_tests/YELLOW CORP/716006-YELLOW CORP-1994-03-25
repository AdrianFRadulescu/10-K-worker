Item 1.  Business.

(a)      Yellow Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively
         referred to as "the company".  The company changed its name in 1993
         from Yellow Freight System, Inc. of Delaware to Yellow Corporation.
         This was done to more clearly distinguish the company as a holding
         company of transportation services and to eliminate confusion with the
         name of the company's principal operating subsidiary (Yellow Freight
         System, Inc.).  In February 1993 the company completed its acquisition
         of the stock of Preston Corporation (Preston).  Preston is the holding
         company for three regional less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers serving
         the Northeast, Upper Midwest and Southeast United States.  The 1993
         financial statements include the results of Preston effective March 1,
         1993.  The acquisition provided $497 million of operating revenue for
         the company in 1993.  This accounted for 21.9% of the 26.2% increase
         in operating revenue over 1992.

(b)      The operation of the company is conducted through one predominant
         industry segment, which is the interstate transportation of general
         commodity freight by motor vehicle.

(c)      Yellow Corporation is a holding company providing freight
         transportation services through its subsidiaries, Yellow Freight
         System, Inc. (Yellow Freight), Preston Trucking Company, Inc. (Preston
         Trucking), Saia Motor Freight Line, Inc. (Saia), Smalley
         Transportation Company (Smalley Transportation), CSI/Reeves, Inc.
         (CSI/Reeves), Yellow Logistics Services, Inc.  (Yellow Logistics) and
         Yellow Technology Services, Inc. (Yellow Technology).  The company
         employed an average of 35,000 persons in 1993.

         Yellow Freight is the company's principal subsidiary, and up until the
         company's completion of the Preston Corporation acquisition in
         February 1993 contributed substantially all of the company's
         consolidated revenue.  Yellow Freight had operating revenue of $2.358
         billion in 1993 (83% of the company's total revenue) and is based in
         Overland Park, Kansas.  It is the nation's largest provider of LTL
         transportation services with direct service to over 35,000 points in
         all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico.  Yellow Freight
         services Europe via an alliance with The Royal Frans Maas Group based
         in the Netherlands.

         Preston Trucking is primarily a regional LTL carrier serving the
         Northeast and Upper Midwest markets of the United States.  Preston
         Trucking had operating revenue of $338 million for the ten months
         ended December 31, 1993 (12% of the company's total revenue) and is
         headquartered in Preston, Maryland.

         Saia is a regional LTL carrier that provides overnight and second-day
         service in nine southeastern states.  It had operating revenue of $102
         million for the ten months ended December 31, 1993 and is based in
         Houma, Louisiana.

         Smalley Transportation is a regional carrier providing service to
         customers in Georgia and throughout Florida.  It had operating revenue
         of $32 million for the ten months ended December 31, 1993 and is based
         in Tampa, Florida.

         CSI/Reeves is in the business of transporting, warehousing and
         distributing carpet and related products.  It had operating revenue of
         $25 million for the ten months ended December 31, 1993 and is based in
         Calhoun, Georgia.

Item 1.  Business. (cont.)

Yellow Logistics offers a full range of integrated logistics management
services including transportation management, warehousing, information systems,
distribution, and package design and testing.  Yellow Logistics specializes in
serving the chemical, retail, computer hardware, electronic and pharmaceutical
industries.  Its headquarters are in Overland Park, Kansas.

Yellow Technology supports the company's subsidiaries - primarily Yellow
Freight - with information technology.  It ensures that information systems
anticipate and meet customers' needs and that the systems are an integral part
of the transportation process.  Its headquarters are in Overland Park, Kansas.

The operations of the freight transportation companies are regulated by the
Interstate Commerce Commission and state regulatory bodies.  Competition
includes contract motor carriers, private fleets, railroads and other motor
carriers.  No single carrier has a dominant share of the motor freight market.

The company operates in a highly price-sensitive and competitive industry,
making pricing and customer service major competitive factors.  Pricing
discipline and cost control are critical to improving profit levels in 1994.
Traditionally, rate increases have been implemented to offset increases in
labor and other operating costs.  These increases have been difficult to retain
because of the competitive pressures on pricing.  The full impact of these
increases is not realized immediately as a result of pricing that is on a
contract basis and can only be increased when the contract is renewed or
renegotiated.  Pricing pressures were extremely competitive in the first half
of 1993.  They moderated in the second half of the year, aided by a two percent
discount rollback implemented in August 1993 at Yellow Freight.  The company's
subsidiaries are continuing to work toward improved account profitability and
maintaining pricing stability.  The Yellow operating companies have implemented
rate increases of between four and five percent during the first quarter of
1994 to cover increases in operating costs.

The company attempts to control operating costs by maintaining efficient
operations, optimum capacity utilization and strict budgetary controls.  During
1993, Yellow Freight began an extensive multi-year network development process
by consolidating and realigning terminals to improve customer service and
reduce costs.  A charge of $18.0 million before taxes was accrued for the costs
to close certain facilities and dispose of excess property.  This network
development will result in better use of assets, reduced overhead, improved
transit times and lower freight handling costs without reducing customer
service.

Salaries, wages and employees' benefits decreased as a percent of revenue in
1993 despite wage and benefit increases of approximately 3% effective April 1
for employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
(Teamsters).  This is due to a wage reduction of 9% effective April 1 for
employees of Preston Trucking, a small decrease in the total number of
employees and a reduction in workers' compensation expense.  The current labor
agreement with the Teamsters expires March 31, 1994.  In the second quarter of
1993, Yellow Freight reaffiliated with Trucking Management, Inc. (TMI), a
multi-employer bargaining group representing the trucking industry in labor
contract negotiations.  Preston Trucking is also a member of TMI.  TMI is
currently negotiating the renewal of this contract.  An agreement that allows
greater operational flexibility and the opportunity to reduce costs is
necessary to allow Yellow Freight and Preston Trucking to better compete in the
marketplace.

Item 1.  Business. (cont.)

In addition, Preston Trucking's wage reduction expires March 31, 1994.  Preston
Trucking feels it is essential to continue this wage reduction in the near
future to maintain its progress toward restoring profitability.  Extension of
the wage reduction requires a contract provision allowing the reduction and
approval of Preston's Teamster employees.

The company's differentiation strategy focuses on introducing new customer
services, improving existing services and providing service to new markets.
Yellow Freight's revenue growth was moderate in 1993 as compared to 1992.
Growth was due to increased tonnage, which grew faster than the Industrial
Production Index, and contributions from new services started in 1992.  Yellow
Freight expects moderate revenue growth in 1994.  A service which reduces
transit times by a full day on traditional three, four and five-day lanes
experienced good revenue growth in 1993.  A guaranteed expedited service that
provides shippers an economical alternative to air freight in selected markets
experienced a healthy revenue growth rate in 1993 and operated at a very high
on-time service ratio.  The Canadian and Mexican markets continued to provide
good growth for Yellow Freight in 1993.  This growth is expected to continue in
1994, partly as a result of NAFTA's simplified trade provisions between those
countries and the United States.  Service to and from Western Europe, through
an alliance with The Royal Frans Maas Group of The Netherlands is expected to
grow in 1994 as a result of expanded consolidation and deconsolidation points
in North America and improvements in streamlining documentation processing.

Preston Trucking continued to experience declines in both revenue and tonnage
after the acquisition by the company, but benefited in June 1993 from the
bankruptcy of a major competitor in the Northeast.  Preston Trucking opened
four new terminals and increased their revenue and tonnage during the last half
of the year.  They expect continued revenue growth in 1994 and are planning to
broaden service with a new distribution center in Ohio.

The company expects to benefit from Saia's expansion into Texas and Tennessee
as well as their introduction of intrastate service in Texas.  Combined with
Saia's strong market position and profitable operations, revenue growth in 1994
is expected to be much improved.

The operations of the company are generally funded by cash flows generated from
operating activities except in periods of accelerated capital spending.  The
company requires working capital to fund capital expenditures and pay
shareholder dividends.  The rapid turnover of accounts receivable, effective
cash management and ready access to credit provided by commercial paper,
medium-term notes and flexible banking agreements allows the company to
effectively manage its working capital.  It is anticipated that 1994 capital
expenditures and shareholder dividends will be primarily financed through
internally-generated funds.  The company made commercial paper borrowings in
early 1993 to fund a portion of the Preston stock acquisition ($8 million) and
to repay certain Preston indebtedness ($82 million).  Revisions to the
medium-term note program in 1993 provided for increased amounts outstanding and
longer maturity periods.  During the last six months of 1993, $37 million was
borrowed under the medium-term note program, primarily to replace commercial
paper borrowings.  Modest capital expenditures and good cash flow from
operations in 1993 enabled the company to further reduce commercial paper
borrowings to $25 million at December 31, 1993.

Item 2.  Properties.

At December 31, 1993, the company operated 696 freight terminals located in 50
states, Puerto Rico, parts of Canada and Mexico.  Of this total, 331 were owned
terminals and 365 were leased, generally for terms of three years or less.  The
number of vehicle back-in doors totaled 19,243, of which 14,802 were at owned
terminals and 4,441 were at leased terminals.  The freight terminals vary in
size ranging from one to three doors at small local terminals, up to 304 doors
at Yellow Freight's largest consolidation and distribution terminal.
Substantially all of the larger terminals, containing the greatest number of
doors, are owned.  In addition, the company and most of its subsidiaries own
and occupy general office buildings in their headquarters city.

The company also maintains a significant investment in revenue equipment.  At
December 31, 1993, the company's subsidiaries operated the following number of
linehaul units:  tractors - 4,918, 45' and 48' trailers - 7,738, and 27' and
28' trailers - 31,698.  The number of city units operated were:  trucks and
tractors - 8,165 and trailers - 5,535.

The above facilities and equipment are used in the company's predominant
industry, the interstate transportation of general commodity freight.  The
company expects moderate growth in 1994 and has projected no significant
changes to its operational capacity.  A small number of facilities will be
closed at Yellow Freight as part of the network development process started in
1993.  Projected facility expenditures of $30 million will target expansion of
existing locations and the construction or purchase of new locations to improve
efficiency and enter new markets in selected areas.  Equipment expenditures of
$90 million are expected to consist primarily of replacement units with some
expansion units at certain of the subsidiaries.  Revenue equipment replacement
units are expected to be approximately 70% higher than in the last three years.
Other operating property expenditures of $55 million are primarily for
improving efficiency through technological enhancements and advanced
information systems.

         The remaining exhibits required by Item 7 of Regulation S-K are

(b)      Reports on Form 8-K

         No reports on Form 8-K were filed for the three months ended December
         31, 1993.  However, on March 21, 1994, a Form 8-K was filed under Item
         5, Other Events, which reported that due primarily to the impact of
         severe winter weather in January and February, the company expects to
         report a net loss in the first quarter of 1994 greater than the net
         loss of $.06 per share recorded in the first quarter of 1993.  Severe
         winter weather caused significant business disruptions and higher
         operating expenses for both the company's largest motor carrier
         subsidiary, Yellow Freight System, Inc. and for Preston Trucking
         Company, Inc.  Preston Trucking, whose operations are concentrated in
         the Northeast and Upper Midwest, was especially hard hit by the
         weather.

                          Report of Independent Public
                  Accountants on Financial Statement Schedules





To Yellow Corporation:

         We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated financial statements included in Yellow Corporation
and Subsidiaries' annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in
this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January 31, 1994.  Our
report on the consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory
paragraph with respect to the change in the method of revenue recognition in
1992, as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Our
audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken
as a whole.  The schedules listed in Item 14(a)(2) are the responsibility of
the company's management and are presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and are not part of the basic
consolidated financial statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial
statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
