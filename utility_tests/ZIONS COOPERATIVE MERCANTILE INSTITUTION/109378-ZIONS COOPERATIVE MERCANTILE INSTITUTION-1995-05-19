ITEM  1.      BUSINESS.
        
       (a) Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (Registrant) was organized
             as a Utah Corporation in 1868 and was the first full-line 
             department store in the United States. Notwithstanding the 
             Registrant's name, the Registrant does not operate as a 
             cooperative on a non-profit basis.  The Registrant is in the 
             retail line of business:  operating both full-line, conventional
             department stores, men's and women's ready to wear, specialty and
             outlet stores.  The full-line stores are located in downtown Salt
             Lake City and Ogden, Utah and in regional shopping centers in the
             suburban Salt Lake City, Orem, Logan, Sandy, Layton, and St. 
             George, Utah areas and in Pocatello and Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The
             specialty and outlet stores are located in Provo, Utah; Mesa, 
             Arizona; and St. George, Utah.  During the year ended January 31,
             1993, ZCMI closed stores located in Scottsdale, Arizona and Las 
             Vegas, Nevada.  During the year ended January 29, 1994, ZCMI closed
             its store located in Phoenix, Arizona.  During the year ended 
             January 28, 1995, ZCMI closed its Superstition Springs store 
             located in Mesa, Arizona.  The Registrant is one of the major 
             tenants with full-line stores in six suburban regional shopping 
             centers in Utah.
          
       (b) Not applicable as Registrant operates one line of business as
             previously described.

       (c) (1)   (i)     No department or class accounted for 10% or more of
                   revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.
       
              (ii)  through (iv)   Not applicable
             
              (v)   The business of the Registrant follows the seasonal
                   pattern of full-line department stores.
       
              (vi)  The Registrant offers to sell on the basis of cash, bank
                   credit card, option charge account, third party credit
                   cards, or layaway.  The option charge account is a typical
                   revolving charge account with finance charges assessed on
                   the unpaid balance at 1-1/2% per month.
               
                 Registrant's sales made on credit vary by store but range
                   from approximately one-third to one-half of sales at each
                   department store location. 
               
              (vii) through (ix)  Not applicable
       
              (x)   Substantial competition is found in all store locations
                   from other full-line, conventional department stores, chain
                   department stores, discount stores, and specialty stores.
       
              (xi)  and (xii)  Not applicable
       
              (xiii)     At year end the Registrant had 2,602 employees
                   (full-time equivalent), an increase of two from the prior
                   year.
       
       (d) The Registrant has no operations in any foreign country, nor does
             the Registrant have any sales nor obtain revenue from any foreign
             country.  The Registrant's operations are limited to the States of
             Utah, Arizona, and Idaho.

ITEM  7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
          RESULTS OF OPERATION.
  
  OVERVIEW OF 1994
  
  ZCMI achieved a second consecutive year of impressive sales gains and
  profitability during 1994.  As shown below, overall sales increased 4.1 %  for
  the year ended January 28, 1995, compared to a 6.3% increase for fiscal 1993
  and a 1.9% increase for fiscal 1992.  Comparable store locations which were
  open for the full fiscal year in the three comparable years had overall sales
  increases of 4.3% for the year ended January 28, 1995 compared to 6.4% for the
  year ended January 29, 1994 and 2.9% for the year ended January 31, 1993.   
  These increases came as a result of continuing economic stimulus in Utah 
  markets, and despite increasing competition in the company's market areas, 
  and without a strong market nationally in ready to wear clothing areas.

</TABLE>
  
  Other income has increased by 3.5% for the year ended January 29, 1995 as 
  compared to 0.3% increase in the year ended January 29, 1994.   Other income 
  is primarily interest income from customer accounts and deferred gross profit
  from the sales of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.  Interest income has 
  been growing smaller as result of continuing pressures for lower interest 
  rates on credit and as customers pay accounts quicker to avoid interest 
  charges.  Other income from this source increased slightly because of the 
  size of the increase in credit balances from credit sales.  An analysis of the
  average percent of total credit balances paid and annual turnover of credit 
  balances is shown below.   Deferred gross profit increased other income as a 
  result of accounting changes which changed the recognition of this income from
  a credit to operating expenses during part of the fiscal year ended January
  29, 1994 to recognizing all deferred gross profit in other income during the
  fiscal year ended January 28, 1995.  Net Income increased as a result  of 
  items covered in the analysis of operation below.
  
  Analysis of Credit Balances
  
                                        1994      1993      1992
  Average Monthly Collection Percent    21.51%    21.89%    21.39%
  Annual Turnover                        2.5812    2.6268    2.5668
  
  The collection rate has increased from 21.39% in fiscal 1992 to 21.51% in 
  fiscal 1994 and the annual turnover has increased from 2.57 in fiscal 1992 
  to 2.58 in fiscal 1994.  This increase has come in spite of the fact that 
  ZCMI extended the terms on Club Plan purchases from 12 months to 24 months 
  during 1993 and also offered several deferred payment promotions on certain 
  purchases for the first time in 1993.  Both of these promotions raised 
  balances while either lowering or deferring the payments from normal payment
  patterns.
  
  During the year ended January 28, 1995, ZCMI closed the Superstition Springs 
  store in Mesa, Arizona.  This store had been converted to an outlet store 
  format during fiscal 1992, as were the stores in the now-closed Village Fair
  Mall in Phoenix, Arizona, the Tri-City Mall in Mesa, Arizona and the East Bay
  Mall in Provo, Utah. As mentioned, during the year ended January 29, 1994, 
  ZCMI closed the Village Fair Mall store in Phoenix, Arizona.  ZCMI did not 
  open or close any stores during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1993.   No 
  new stores are planned during the current fiscal year.
  
  Retailing in general continues a sluggish growth pattern in the Northeast and
  West Coast as economies in those areas experience slowdowns in employment and
  manufacturing.   Retailers in the South, Midwest and Rockies are experiencing
  better economic conditions, higher population growth rates, and resulting 
  sales increases.  These conditions are leading to increased competition, 
  particularly in hard goods lines such as home furnishings, furniture, and 
  electronics in Utah market areas.  Sales are continuing to be flat nationally 
  in Men's and Women's ready to wear and accessories departments both as a 
  result of casual office wear and retrenchment in style and pricing by vendors.
  Also, decreases in the interest rate on debt financing for consumers provided
  a higher than normal amount of spendable income to be used in home furnishings
  purchases.  This trend will slow as interest rates regain pre-1994 levels.  An
  increasing number of vendors struggle financially to cope with squeezing 
  margin rates on domestic goods as newer, better made imports make their 
  presence felt in the market.  The market areas for ZCMI continue an outlook 
  for good economic conditions, particularly in the Utah markets, which are 
  traditionally the prime markets of the Company.  Our emphasis will be to 
  continue building market share in the moderate and better price points while
  positioning quality opening price points with name-brand lines.  This 
  emphasis, together with superior customer service, will position ZCMI as the
  dominant retailer in our markets.
  
  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS
  
  COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD
  
  Cost of merchandise sold includes the cost of merchandise and the related 
  buying cost.  Cost of merchandise sold was increased slightly to 68.1% of 
  sales during the year ended January 28, 1995 as depicted in the chart below.
  This percentage compares with 67.9% during the year ended January 29, 1994
  and 67.7% during the year ended January 31, 1993.
  
     Year ended:              January 28,    January 29,     January 31,
                                 1995           1994            1993
  Cost of Merchandise Sold    $161,672,320   $154,871,242   $145,186,900 
  Costs as a percent of sales      68.1%          67.9%          67.7%
  
  The increase in cost of merchandise sold is a result of increases in purchases
  costs and markdowns, and a decrease in purchase discounts  These negative
  increases are offset by decreased costs for shrinkage, workroom costs, and
  other buying costs. .  The changes in factors are noted in the table below:

  Total costs of merchandise sold68.1%           67.9%          67.7%
</TABLE>
  
  Comparisons between the fiscal periods noted above are affected by several
  trends. Increasing costs of purchases continues to rise from manufacturer 
  costs of business passed on to retailers.  Markdowns has risen as an effect of
  the slowdown in ready to wear, as noted above.  This is offset by a 
  reduction of shrinkage from increased efforts in security and shrinkage 
  programs implemented in the past three years, including the purchase of 
  state-of-the-art video equipment and POS terminals.   Discounts continue to 
  decrease as manufacturers seek quicker cash flow through other means, such as 
  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and electronic transfer of funds.  Lastly, 
  buying costs coninue to decline as a result of the closing of the ZCMI II 
  buying division and more efficient merchandising programs for the buying 
  office use.
  
  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
  
  As shown in the chart below, selling, general and administrative expenses
  increased to 30.5% as a percent to sales and other income during the year 
  ended January 28, 1995.  This compares to 29.7% in the year ended January 29,
  1994 and 30.6% in the year ended January 31, 1993.  Expenses have increased as
  a result of depreciation, leases, and rental of furniture, fixture and 
  equipment due to remodeling and expansion.  These fixed asset additions are
  discussed below in cash flow discussions.  Also, pension and health insurance
  expense have continued dramatic increases as the cost of providing fringe 
  benefits to associates have increased.  Expenses decreased in the year ended 
  January 29, 1994 as a result of expense reduction efforts to control costs 
  related to increasing sales.

  Percent increase (decrease)            7.1          2.8        (2.1)
</TABLE>
  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses in the years ended January 29, 
  1994 and January 31, 1993 have declined as a result of a decisive move to 
  close stores in the Village Fair Mall and Superstition Springs, as previously
  mentioned.  As part of the continuing effort to close these unprofitable 
  stores, $948,800 was reserved from profits in fiscal 1991 for closing costs,
  while $4,600,000 was reserved from current year profits during fiscal 1992 
  and $1,900,000 reserved from current year profits in fiscal 1993.  No 
  additional amounts were reserved during the year ended January 28, 1995. 
  These amounts are considered sufficient to close all  unprofitable stores 
  without any further costs.   In the lease termination agreements, ZCMI has 
  guaranteed lease payments for the Pavilions and Village Fair locations.  In 
  addition, ZCMI is obligated for continuing substantially reduced lease 
  payments in the Charleston Commons location.  There are no continuing
  payments or guarantees from lease amendments in the Superstition Springs store
  closure.  These guarantees and obligations are reflected in disclosure data on
  the financial statements.  Operating expenses decreased during the year ended 
  January 31, 1993 as a result of lower payroll costs, lower rent expense in 
  the Cottonwood store, and lower supply costs.  Bad debt expense continued to
  decline in both fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1992 due to a favorable economy and 
  improved technology in equipment and software.  
  
  
  FINANCIAL CONDITION
  
  Financial Objective
  
  The objectives of ZCMI's financial policy are to provide the Company and its
  shareholders with an improved return on investment, a solid capital structure 
  and a degree of financial flexibility.  The Company expects that funds 
  required to finance expansion and refurbishment of existing stores and future 
  expansions will be provided by internally generated funds, the leasing of 
  buildings and fixtures, and by short-term and long-term debt financing.
  
  Management has reviewed the company's position in long-term debt as thereare
  indications which exist that advantages are possible in placing longer term 
  loans now and setting interest rates at current levels.  In reviewing this 
  decision, it is still the position of ZCMI that, in view of existing favorable
  short-term loan rates to the company, and the needed and prudent dollar level
  of debt financing, short-term borrowing for working capital needs remains the 
  most effective method of meeting the debt financing requirements of the 
  company's financial objectives.
  
  Cash Flow
  
  Company funds generated by operations, investing and financing activities as
  reported in the Statement of Cash Flows are summarized below.  See also Notes 
  to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Statement of 
  Cash Flows.
  
  Net cash from operating activities in the year ended January 28, 1995 from
  operating activities after amortization, depreciation, and other non-cash
  adjustments resulted in more cash used than provided.  The increase in the
  liability Accounts Payable provided the major cash inflow while increases in
  Accounts Receivable and Merchandise Inventories were the main areas of cash
  outflow.   The majority of the increase in Accounts Receivable came in the
  company's Extras Plan from continued customer purchases of big ticket items 
  and special no-interest promotions offering extended repayment terms.  Also, 
  purchases  made on the company's Club Plan increased as a result of the 
  extension of repayment terms as discussed earlier.  The major increase in 
  Merchandise Inventories came in the company's hard goods divisions.  
  Increased sales of home furnishings and decorative home items resulted in 
  increased inventories and buying plans for future sales.
  
  
  Net cash from investing activities in the year ended January 28, 1995 were 
  used in purchases of property, plant and equipment, which were subsequently 
  sold and leased back to provide positive cash flows.  Proceeds from the sale 
  of the Ogden store, as noted below, provided an inflow of cash. The categories
  of capital expenditures are summarized below:

</TABLE>
  
  Capital expenditures during the year ended January 28, 1995 consisted of the
  completion of major remodeling in the Cottonwood Mall location second floor, 
  which was completed in the second half of the year.  Also, remodeling was 
  completed in the Layton Hills Mall second floor , which was completed in 
  October, 1994.  Lastly, the Ogden store building was sold in October, 1994 
  at a purchase price of $3,900,000.  This transaction generated a profit in the
  fiscal year ended January 28, 1995 of $1,373,658.   The Ogden location then
  moved across Washington Boulevard in Ogden to the Ogden City Mall.  Extensive
  improvements to the existing location were made to accomodate the anticipated 
  store size and some new fixturing and equipment was required.  The new Ogden 
  City Mall location was completed and opened in November, 1994.
  
  Capital expenditures during the year ended January 29, 1994 consisted of major
  remodeling projects in the Cottonwood and Valley Fair locations, replacement 
  of POS Terminals in all locations, and software and hardware purchases for 
  conversion of mainframe resources.  POS Terminals consisting of 8 year old 
  to 12 year old terminals were replaced with state of the art IBM 4683 
  terminals to upgrade customer service, UPC scanning and to allow future price
  look up capabilities.   Remodeling of the first floor in Cottonwood was 
  completed in October 1993 and remodeling of certain areas of the Valley Fair 
  store were completed in November, 1993.
  
  Capital expenditures during the year ended January 31, 1993 were the result of
  furniture, fixtures and equipment purchases.  Major purchases included: 
  telephone system replacement to allow more efficient control and use of 
  telephone equipment; security equipment consisting of video systems and other
  systems to control shrinkage; and software purchases in anticipation of 
  mainframe conversion and POS system conversion.
  
  Future estimated capital expenditures include normal equipment replacement
  estimated at $500,000 and the completion of the conversion from an IBM 4381
  mainframe to an IBM AS/400 computer system is estimated to cost approximately
  $500,000 in total.
  
  It is anticipated that these capital expenditures will be financed by 
  continuing operations and financing activities as described in financial 
  objectives.  Lines of credit, as shown in detail in the chart below, are 
  considered adequate to fund the amounts necessary for capital expenditures,
  dividends and other cash needs.

  Net cash from financing activities in the year ended January 28, 1995 
  increased as cash was provided by long-term borrowings which was offset by 
  payments on short-term borrowings, the pay-off of the Ogden store mortgage,
  dividends, and for use by both investing and operating activities as described
  
  As a result of the above, there was an decrease in cash and cash equivalents
  during the year ended January 28, 1995.

</TABLE>
  
  As indicated in the ratio comparisons, the quick ratio of 1.61 times for the 
  year ended January 28, 1995 has increased from 1.44 times in the year ended 
  January 29, 1994, mostly on the strength of increased accounts receivable 
  balances and the decrease of short term borrowing.  Accounts Receivable 
  balances have increased as a result of special promotions of hard goods 
  which offered exceptional terms.  Short term borrowing decreased as a shift
  to long term borrowing.  The current ratio of 2.97 times for the year ended 
  January 28, 1995 has increased from 2.49 times for the year ended January 29,
  1994.  Current assets have increased both from the accounts receivable 
  increase and an increase in inventories.   Accounts receivable increased as 
  previously noted, while inventories have increased as noted above in the 
  discussion on cash flow changes.  The return of equity of 6.8% for the year 
  ended January 28, 1995 increased from 6.2% for the year ended January 29, 
  1994 for reasons previously discussed. 
  
  Inflation and Pension Effect
  
  Inflation has been in an acceptable range for the past three years and has 
  not had a significant effect on ZCMI's sales growth.  The Bureau of Labor 
  Statistics Index decrease for the year ended January 28, 1995 was (0.5)%, 
  compared to an increase of 1.3% in the year ended January 29, 1994 and an 
  increase of 0.6% in the year ended January 31, 1993.  However, since ZCMI 
  uses the LIFO method for valuing inventories, the increase does have an 
  effect on the cost of merchandise sold.  The LIFO credit to cost of 
  merchandise sold for the year ended January 28, 1995 was $804,951, compared
  to a charge to cost of merchandise sold of $451,855 in the year ended 
  January 29, 1994 and a credit to cost of merchandise sold of $216,900
  during the year ended January 31, 1993. 
  
  As noted in the financial statements, actuarial estimates utilizing the 
  discount rate of 9% were used in computing the pension expense for the year
  ended January 29, 1994.  If the actuarial estimate had used a discount rate
  of 8%, pension expense would increase by approximately $230,000.   Actuaries
  expect that the discount rate for ZCMI would be higher than most because a) 
  the ZCMI plan is a career-average plan rather than a final-pay plan; and b)
  over half of the ZCMI liabilities comes from retired participants.  This 
  results in ZCMI liabilities in the plan being much shorter in duration than
  the average plan, justifying the higher discount rate.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) was issued in Dec.,
  1990.  SFAS No. 106 requires that postretirement benefits other than pensions
  (i.e., health care benefits) be accrued for in anticipation of an employee's
  retirement.  The cost of these benefits is currently expensed on a 
  pay-as-you-go basis.  ZCMI's benefit program does not currently provide 
  postretirement benefits other than pensions except as required by the 
  Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  SFAS 106 is
  required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.  
  As noted in the notes to the financial statements, ZCMI adopted SFAS 106 in
  the fiscal period ended January 31, 1994.  The effects of the Statement on 
  ZCMI were immaterial.
  
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income 
  Taxes" (SFAS 109) was issued in February, 1992.  SFAS 109 requires an asset
  and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income 
  taxes which differs from the method previously required for by generally 
  accepted accounting principles.  SFAS 109 is required to be applied for 
  fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992, although earlier adoption is 
  allowed.  In the year adopted, the Statement permits either the restatement
  of prior period financial statements or the presentation of the effects of 
  the Statement in a manner similar to the  cumulative effect of a change of 
  accounting principle.  As noted in the notes to the financial statements, 
  ZCMI adopted SFAS 109 in the fiscal period ended January 31, 1993.  The 
  effects of the Statement on ZCMI were immaterial.

               Financial Statements as of January 28, 1995 and

               in the Period Ended January 28, 1995 and
               Independent Auditors' Report









INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
  Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution:

We   have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  of   Zions
Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) as of January  28,  1995
and  January  29,  1994,  and the related  statements  of  income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the  three  years
in  the period ended January 28, 1995.  These financial statements
are  the  responsibility of ZCMI's management.  Our responsibility
is  to  express an opinion on these financial statements based  on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits in accordance with  generally  accepted
auditing  standards.  Those standards require  that  we  plan  and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An  audit
includes  examining,  on  a test basis,  evidence  supporting  the
amounts  and  disclosures in the financial statements.   An  audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used   and
significant  estimates made by management, as well  as  evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in  all
material  respects, the financial position of ZCMI at January  28,
1995  and January 29, 1994, and the results of its operations  and
its  cash  flows for each of the three years in the  period  ended
January  28, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES

   Inventories - Substantially all inventories are valued  at  the
   lower  of  cost  or  market, using the retail  method,  on  the
   last-in,  first-out (LIFO) basis.  If the inventories had  been
   valued  on  the  first-in,  first-out  basis,  total  inventory
   values  would have been approximately $5,900,000 and $6,700,000
   higher at January 28, 1995 and January 29, 1994, respectively.
   
   Property,   Plant,  and  Equipment  -  Property,   plant,   and
   equipment   are  stated  at  cost.   For  financial   statement
   purposes, the straight-line method of depreciation is used  for
   buildings,  and  the sum-of-the-years digits and  straight-line
   methods  are  used  for leasehold improvements  and  furniture,
   fixtures,  and  equipment, over estimated useful lives  ranging
   from  3  to  50  years.  See Note 2 for information  concerning
   leased property under capital leases.
   
   Net  Sales and Other Income - Net sales includes proceeds,  net
   of   returns,   from   merchandise,  services,   and   licensed
   departments.   The  sales of licensed departments  amounted  to
   approximately  $20,423,000, $18,648,000,  and  $18,138,000  for
   the  years  ended  January  28, 1995,  January  29,  1994,  and
   January  31,  1993, respectively.  Included in  net  sales  are
   finance  charges on retail credit accounts receivable  totaling
   approximately  $5,830,000, $5,893,000, and $5,837,000  for  the
   years  ended  January 28, 1995, January 29, 1994,  and  January
   31,  1993,  respectively.   Net sales  and  other  income  also
   include   the  amortization  of  deferred  gain  on  sale   and
   leaseback  totaling approximately $1,186,000,  $1,100,000,  and
   $668,000  for  the  years ended January 28, 1995,  January  29,
   1994, and January 31, 1993, respectively (see Note 2).
   
   Net  Income  Per  Share  - Net income per  share  is  based  on
   weighted  average shares outstanding of 2,148,202 for the  year
   ended  January  28, 1995, 2,153,325 for the year ended  January
   29,  1994,  and 2,156,774 for the year ended January 31,  1993.
   Stock  options have been excluded from the computation  of  per
   share  amounts  because they are antidilutive  or  because  the
   dilutive effect is not material.
   
   Income  Taxes  -  In  February 1992, the  Financial  Accounting
   Standards   Board  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
   Standards  (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income  Taxes"  (the
   "Statement")  (see Note 3).  Effective February  1,  1992,  the
   Company  adopted the provisions of the Statement.  The adoption
   of  the Statement on the Company's financial statements for the
   year ended January 31, 1993 was immaterial.
   
   Statements  of  Cash Flows - For purposes of the statements  of
   cash  flows,  ZCMI considers short-term investments,  all  with
   original  maturities  of  three months  or  less,  to  be  cash
   equivalents.
   
   Fiscal  Year  -  Effective January 29,  1994,  ZCMI  adopted  a
   fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest the end of January.
   
2. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

   ZCMI   has   noncancelable  leases  covering  store   premises,
   fixtures, and equipment which expire on various dates to  2017.
   Leases   covering   store  premises  contain   provisions   for
   additional  annual  lease payments based  on  a  percentage  of
   sales  and have renewal options for various additional  periods
   ranging up to 68 years.
   
   Minimum rentals of capital leases have been capitalized at  the
   present value of the rentals at the inception of the lease  and
   the  obligation  for such amount is recorded  as  a  liability.
   Amortization of capital lease property, which is included  with
   depreciation  expense, is computed on the  straight-line  basis
   over  the  lease terms and interest expense is accrued  on  the
   basis of the outstanding lease obligation.
   
   Leased  property under capital leases by major classes  was  as
   follows (see Note 7):

</TABLE>
   Contingent  rentals on capital leases, which were  included  in
   expense,   totaled   approximately  $251,000,   $253,000,   and
   $244,000  for  the  years ended January 28, 1995,  January  29,
   1994, and January 31, 1993, respectively.
   
   During the years ended January 28, 1995, January 29, 1994,  and
   January  31,  1993, ZCMI sold certain furniture, fixtures,  and
   equipment  with  a  net  book value of  approximately  $35,000,
   $4,880,000,   and  $1,867,000  for  approximately   $1,700,000,
   $6,057,000,  and  $3,508,000,  respectively.   ZCMI  agreed  to
   lease  back  such  furniture,  fixtures,  and  equipment  under
   operating  lease agreements.  The resulting gains on  sale  for
   the  years  ended  January  28, 1995,  January  29,  1994,  and
   January  31, 1993 of approximately $1,665,000, $1,177,000,  and
   $1,641,000,  respectively, are being amortized over  the  lease
   terms  ranging from 5 to 10 years.  Amortization  of  gains  on
   all  sale  leasebacks  for the years ended  January  28,  1995,
   January  29,  1994, and January 31, 1993 totaled  approximately
   $1,186,000, $1,100,000, and $668,000, respectively.
   
   During  the years ended January 29, 1994 and January 31,  1993,
   management  decided  to  close  several  of  ZCMI's   specialty
   stores.   Estimated closing expenses relating to  these  stores
   during  the years ended January 29, 1994 and January  31,  1993
   totaled  approximately $1,900,000 and $4,600,000, respectively,
   of  which  approximately $768,000 and $3,484,000 were  included
   in  accrued  liabilities at January 28, 1995  and  January  29,
   1994, respectively.  In connection with the store closings  and
   related termination and assignment of lease agreements  to  new
   lessees,  ZCMI  was required to guarantee the  payment  of  the
   minimum   lease   payments   by   the   new   lessee   totaling
   approximately   $2,251,000  through   July   2001.    Also   in
   connection with the store closings, ZCMI entered into  a  lease
   termination  agreement  with  a  lessor  in  May  1993.    This
   agreement  required a lump sum payment of $500,000 and  monthly
   payments  totaling  $476,000 through February  1,  2001,  which
   costs were accrued when the lease was terminated.
