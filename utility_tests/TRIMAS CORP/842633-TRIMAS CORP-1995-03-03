                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
     TriMas Corporation is a diversified proprietary products company with
leadership positions in commercial, industrial and consumer niche markets.
TriMas Corporation's operations are conducted through sixteen operating
businesses principally manufacturing industrial container closures, pressurized
gas cylinders, specialty industrial gaskets, towing systems products, specialty
fasteners, specialty products for fiberglass insulation, specialty tapes and
precision cutting tools. TriMas Corporation's businesses are managed as
decentralized autonomous profit centers which emphasize entrepreneurial
management, high value-added products and services and strong cash flows.
 
     TriMas Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1986 as Campbell Industries, Inc., and, in October, 1988, adopted the name
TriMas Corporation in connection with the transactions described below.
Immediately prior to such transactions, the Company was principally a
manufacturer of industrial fasteners as a result of an acquisition in December,
1986. Except as the context otherwise indicates, the terms "TriMas Corporation"
and the "Company" refer to TriMas Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
     Effective October 1, 1988, the Company acquired various businesses and cash
from MascoTech, Inc. ("MascoTech") in exchange for securities of the Company. In
a related transaction, Masco Corporation ("Masco"), which prior to the above
described acquisition had an equity ownership interest in the Company, acquired
additional shares of Company Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), in exchange for cash. The Company became a public
corporation in February, 1989 when approximately 28 percent of the then
outstanding Company Common Stock was distributed by Masco to its stockholders as
a special dividend. MascoTech currently holds approximately 41 percent of
Company Common Stock and Masco currently holds approximately 5 percent of
Company Common Stock.
 
     In January, 1990, the Company acquired three businesses from Masco which
are engaged in the manufacture of trailer hitches, tow bars and accessories,
winches, jacks and couplers as well as flame-retardant facings and jacketings
and pressure-sensitive tapes used in conjunction with insulation products. In
June, 1990, the Company acquired the operating assets and business of Draw-Tite,
Inc. Draw-Tite is engaged in the manufacture and sale of trailer hitches and
other related towing systems products. In October, 1991, the Company acquired
all of the capital stock of Monogram Aerospace Fasteners, Inc., a manufacturer
of highly engineered specialty fasteners for the domestic and international
aerospace industry. In November, 1993, the Company acquired from MascoTech all
of the capital stock of Lamons Metal Gasket Co., a manufacturer and distributor
of specialty industrial gaskets.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     While each of the Company's businesses operates as an autonomous entity,
they are grouped into four distinct categories for financial reporting purposes:
Specialty Fasteners, Towing Systems, Specialty Container

SPECIALTY FASTENERS
 
     Lake Erie Screw Corporation, Eskay Screw Corporation, Monogram Aerospace
Fasteners, Inc. and Commonwealth Industries form the Company's Specialty
Fasteners segment. Lake Erie and Eskay are manufacturers of both standard and
custom-designed ferrous, nonferrous and special alloy fasteners sold to
commercial and industrial markets. Monogram Fasteners manufactures permanent
blind bolt and temporary fasteners used in aircraft construction and assembly.
Commonwealth provides specialized metallurgical services for fastener products
used in a variety of markets.
 
     Lake Erie specializes in manufacturing both standard and custom-designed
large diameter fasteners, generally in sizes  1/4" to 1 1/4". Lake Erie's design
and engineering capabilities enable the company to formulate fastener product
programs to meet demanding metallurgical and performance specifications for a
wide variety of customers. With this emphasis on design and engineering, coupled
with its ability to offer just-in-time delivery, the Company believes that Lake
Erie has established a premier reputation in the industry for product quality
and service. Lake Erie products are sold to distributors and manufacturers in
the agricultural, transportation, construction, fabricated metal products, and
commercial and industrial maintenance markets. Lake Erie is a leading
manufacturer of private brand products for the equipment maintenance
aftermarket, supplying national and regional private brand distributor
organizations. During 1994 TriMas Fasteners, Inc., a capacity expansion of Lake
Erie, commenced operations in the first phase of a planned 275,000 square foot
large diameter industrial fastener manufacturing and distribution facility in
Indiana.
 
     Eskay manufactures both ferrous and nonferrous standard and
specialty-designed small diameter fasteners, generally in sizes  3/8" and
smaller. Eskay's strategy is to focus on niche markets which require high
value-added products for critical applications. Eskay's ES-Form(R) and
ES-Form(R)II, Plask(R)I and Plask(R)II, Plask H/L(R), and Tri-Plask(R)
self-threading specialty fasteners, for example, are designed for use in
applications where the absence of drilling chip contamination is critical. A
typical application would be electronic or electrical assemblies installed
within metallic or plastic housings and requiring no chip contamination to
qualify for UL or other certification. Eskay products are marketed directly to
distributors and manufacturers in the electrical and electronic equipment,
appliance, fabricated metal products, furniture, transportation and agricultural
markets.
 
     Monogram Fasteners manufactures highly engineered specialty fasteners for
the domestic and international aerospace industry. Monogram Fasteners is the
leader in the development of blind bolt fastener technology for the aerospace
industry. Its Visu-Lok(R), Visu-Lok(R)II and Radial-Lok(TM) blind bolts, which
allow sections of aircraft to be joined together when access is provided to only
one side of the airframe, are lighter in weight and provide certain cost
efficiencies over conventional two-sided fastening devices. Monogram Fasteners'
Composi-Lok(R) and Composi-Lok(R)II blind bolts are designed to solve unique
fastening problems associated with the assembly of composite aircraft
structures, and are therefore particularly well suited to take advantage of the
increasing use of composite materials in aircraft construction.
 
     Commonwealth Industries provides commercial heat treating and specialized
metallurgical and finishing services for fastener products used in the
automotive, industrial, agricultural and construction markets.
 
     The Company's fasteners are sold through factory personnel and independent
sales representatives. Although the overall market for fasteners and
metallurgical services is highly competitive, these businesses primarily provide
products and services for specialized market niches, and principally compete as
quality and service oriented suppliers in their respective market segments.
 
TOWING SYSTEMS
 
     The Towing Systems segment comprises Draw-Tite, Inc., Reese Products, Inc.
and Fulton Performance Products, Inc. These three companies are leading
producers of vehicle hitches, jacks, winches, couplers and related accessories.
Draw-Tite, Reese and Fulton give TriMas the leading position in the design and
manufacture of towing systems products for domestic and imported passenger cars,
light trucks and recreational vehicles. The Company believes that product lines
offered by its Towing Systems companies are
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   6
 
the most extensive in the industry, permitting TriMas to provide custom-designed
products for virtually every towing vehicle and need.
 
     Each company conducts extensive testing of its products to assure reliable
and safe performance. Engineering, product design and fatigue testing are
performed utilizing computer aided design and finite element analysis. In
addition, on-road performance research is conducted on hitches with
instrumentation equipped trailers and towing vehicles. Extensive product testing
programs have improved product safety and reliability and reduced manufacturing
costs.
 
     The Company believes that Draw-Tite is the largest North American
manufacturer and distributor of premium towing systems products, including
hitches and towing accessories, such as hitch balls, sway controls, wiring
harnesses and brake controls. Draw-Tite has two manufacturing facilities and
seven regional distribution centers in the United States, as well as a sales and
distribution center in Canada. Draw-Tite sales are principally to independent
installers through its own sales organization. Rapid delivery and customer
service are emphasized, with most Draw-Tite orders shipped within twenty-four
hours of receipt.
 
     Reese manufactures premium towing systems products, including
weight-distributing hitches and towing accessories, which are sold to
independent installers, distributors, recreational vehicle manufacturers and
automotive aftermarket retailers. Sales in the United States are made by both
Reese sales personnel and independent sales representatives and are distributed
from five regional distribution centers. Reese also manufactures and distributes
hitches and towing accessories in Canada and Australia, and the Company believes
that Reese is the largest manufacturer of such products in Australia.
 
     Fulton is a major manufacturer of winches, jacks, couplers and accessories
for marine, recreational vehicle, agricultural and industrial markets. These
products are sold by Fulton marketing personnel to distributors, manufacturers
and aftermarket retailers.
 
     Due to seasonal factors, sales by companies which form the Towing Systems
segment are stronger during the Company's second and third quarters.
 
SPECIALTY CONTAINER PRODUCTS
 
     The Company's Specialty Container Products segment consists of Rieke
Corporation, Norris Cylinder Company and Lamons Metal Gasket Co., leading
suppliers of products for the containment and dispensing of fluids and gases for
the chemical, agricultural, refining, food, petroleum, health care and other
industries.
 
     The Company believes that Rieke is the largest manufacturer in North
America of steel and plastic industrial container closures and dispensing
products. Rieke's manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, as well as distribution capabilities in Europe and
the Far East, allow Rieke to service most major world markets for its products.
Industrial container closures are manufactured using metal forming and plastic
injection molding technologies, supplemented by automated material handling
systems.
 
     Rieke believes its investment in new product development and manufacturing
programs has enabled it to develop and produce precise quality, high performance
products while maintaining cost-efficient production capabilities. For more than
seventy years, Rieke's new product development programs have provided innovative
and attractive proprietary product opportunities, which have been an integral
part of its success. Among these products are the ViseGrip(R) steel flange and
plug closure, the Poly-ViseGrip(R) plastic closure, the all plastic,
environmentally safe, self-venting FlexSpout(R) flexible pouring spout and the
ViseGrip drum closure.
 
     Rieke sells its products through factory personnel primarily to industrial
container manufacturers who also utilize Rieke's specialty tooling to install
the closures. A significant portion of Rieke's products are specified by
end-users of industrial containers. Rieke believes it has been successful in
having end-users specify its products because of Rieke's history of new product
development, its product quality and performance characteristics and its
customer service standards.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
     During 1994 TriMas achieved record net sales and operating earnings for the
seventh consecutive year as it continued its focus on operating and financial
strategies to improve operating performance and shareholder returns. These
strategies include internal and external programs to strengthen the Company's
competitive positions in key markets, including increased levels of
manufacturing efficiency and customer service, new product development and
market share initiatives, and the acquisition of selected companies which can
enhance future growth and profitability.
 
     The discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the
financial statements and related footnotes to assist in understanding the
Company's results of operations, its financial position, cash flows, capital
structure and other relevant financial information.
 
ANALYSIS OF 1994 OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 1993 OPERATIONS
 
     Record net sales of $535.5 million in 1994 increased 20.8 percent over 1993
net sales of $443.2 million. TriMas' strategic diversification of products and
markets has balanced its operating risk over a broad range of industries,
moderating the cyclical impact of individual markets. As in 1993, the results of
the Company's strategic diversification, including emphasis on niche markets,
manufacturing efficiencies and market share initiatives, played an important
role in 1994's sales performance.
 
     The Company's gross margin percentage increased to 32.5 percent in 1994, up
from 32.1 percent in 1993. The improvement in 1994's gross margin reflects the
incremental profit impact of increased sales volumes as well as the effects of
ongoing cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency initiatives. Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 14.5 percent in 1994, compared to
1993, but as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.4 percent, compared to
16.3 percent in 1993.
 
     Consolidated operating profit, after general corporate expense, equaled
$91.4 million during 1994, compared to $70.0 million in 1993, an increase of
30.5 percent, with operating profit margins of 17.1 percent and 15.8 percent in
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     A record year was experienced by the Specialty Fasteners segment in both
sales and operating profit as operating profit increased 26.1 percent to $24.3
million, compared to $19.3 million in 1993, while sales of $138.7 million were
13.0 percent higher than 1993 sales of $122.7 million. Higher levels of economic
activity contributed to segment sales increases during 1994, reflected by
increased sales to the heavy-duty truck, distribution and other original
equipment markets. As a result of higher sales levels and improved operating
efficiencies, the segment operating profit margin increased to 17.5 percent in
1994, compared to 15.7 percent in 1993. In 1994 inventory turnover was 5.5 times
as compared to 5.1 times in 1993. Capital expenditures during the year,
primarily for Lake Erie Screw Corporation and TriMas Fasteners, Inc., were $9.1
million, compared to 1993's $9.2 million.
 
     Record operating profit of the Towing Systems segment increased 15.8
percent to $25.7 million, compared to $22.2 million in 1993. Record segment
sales increased 16.7 percent to $163.1 million, compared to $139.8 million in
1993. Operating performance of the segment was favorably impacted by higher
domestic vehicle sales, market share initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies
resulting from both 1993 and 1994 capital expenditure programs. The segment's
1994 operating profit margin equaled 15.7 percent, compared to 15.8 percent in
1993. Inventory turnover during the year was 3.1 times as compared to 3.0 times
in 1993. Capital expenditures decreased to $6.7 million, compared to $7.9
million in 1993.
 
     In 1994 operating profit of the Specialty Container Products segment
increased 35.5 percent to a record $39.1 million, compared to $28.8 million in
1993. Segment sales of $163.9 million, also a record level, were 37.7 percent
higher than 1993's $119.0 million. Lamons Metal Gasket Co., acquired in November
1993, has been included in the Specialty Container Products segment for
financial reporting purposes and is included in 1994 segment results. The
segment's operating profit margin in 1994 of 23.8 percent was affected by full
year acquisition related expenses at Lamons. Although Lamons' historical
operating profit margin has been lower relative to the combined historical
margin of the other two segment companies, its margins have consistently met or
exceeded the high standards of the Company's acquisition criteria. In 1993 the
segment's operating
 
                                       11
<PAGE>   13
 
margin equaled 24.2 percent. The segment's inventory turnover was 6.3 times in
1994, compared to 6.6 times during 1993. Capital expenditures for the segment,
primarily to further improve manufacturing efficiencies and service
capabilities, were $5.4 million, compared to $7.8 million in 1993.
 
     The Corporate Companies segment achieved record operating results during
1994 as operating profit increased 38.5 percent to $9.9 million, compared to
$7.1 million in 1993. Record segment sales of $69.8 million increased 13.0
percent, compared to $61.7 million in 1993. The Precision Cutting Tools group
and Compac Corporation both benefited from the generally stronger economy.
Compac Corporation's continued expansion in specialty industrial tape niche
markets and the cost savings associated with the successful consolidation of two
industrial tape manufacturing facilities during the latter part of the year also
contributed to 1994's sales and earnings increases. All of these factors
contributed to the segment's 1994 operating profit margin of 14.1 percent
exceeding that achieved in 1993 of 11.5 percent. In 1994 inventory turnover was
5.6 times as compared to 5.3 times in 1993. Capital expenditures during the year
increased to $3.0 million, compared to $1.3 million in 1993.
 
     Primary earnings per common share increased 28.6 percent to $1.35 in 1994
based on 37.0 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding,
compared to $1.05 and 31.1 million shares and equivalents outstanding in 1993.
The increase in primary shares outstanding was principally the result of the
conversion of the Company's $100 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock in
December 1993. Fully diluted earnings per common share in 1994 were $1.28, based
on 42.1 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding, compared to
$1.01 and 39.1 million shares and equivalents outstanding in 1993. The increase
in fully diluted shares in 1994 was principally the result of the issuance of
the 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003 in August 1993, which are

ANALYSIS OF 1993 OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 1992 OPERATIONS
 
     TriMas achieved net sales in 1993 of $443.2 million, an increase of 14.2
percent over 1992 net sales of $388.2 million. As in 1992, the results of the
Company's strategic diversification, including emphasis on niche markets,
manufacturing efficiencies and market share initiatives, played an important
role in 1993's sales performance.
 
     The Company's gross margin percentage increased to 32.1 percent in 1993, up
from 31.5 percent in 1992. The improvement in 1993's gross margin reflects the
incremental profit impact of increased sales volumes as well as the effects of
ongoing cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency initiatives. Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased
modestly during 1993 to 16.3 percent, compared to 16.4 percent for 1992.
 
     Consolidated operating profit, after general corporate expense, equaled
$70.0 million during 1993, compared to $58.6 million in 1992, with operating
profit margins of 15.8 percent and 15.1 percent in 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     The Specialty Fasteners segment operating profit increased 11.0 percent to
$19.3 million, compared to $17.3 million in 1992, while sales of $122.7 million
were 8.6 percent higher than 1992 sales of $113.0 million. Higher levels of
economic activity contributed to segment sales increases during 1993, reflected
by increased sales to the heavy-duty truck, distribution and other original
equipment markets. As a result of higher sales levels and improved operating
efficiencies, the segment operating profit margin increased to 15.7 percent in
1993, compared to 15.3 percent in 1992. Segment profit performance in both years
was impacted by higher costs relating to quality and customer service
initiatives, as well as higher costs associated with the establishment of TriMas
Fasteners, Inc. In 1993 inventory turnover was 5.1 times as compared to 4.5
times in 1992. Capital expenditures during the year, primarily for Lake Erie
Screw Corporation and TriMas Fasteners, Inc., were $9.2 million, an increase of
139.4 percent over 1992's $3.8 million.
 
     Operating profit of the Towing Systems segment increased 25.4 percent to
$22.2 million, compared to $17.7 million in 1992. Segment sales increased 13.7
percent to $139.8 million, compared to $123.0 million in 1992. Operating
performance of the segment was favorably impacted by higher domestic vehicle
sales, market share initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from
both 1992 and 1993 capital expenditure
 
                                       12

programs. As a result of increased sales levels and operating efficiencies, the
segment's 1993 operating profit margin increased to 15.8 percent, compared to
14.4 percent in 1992. Inventory turnover during the year was 3.0 times as
compared to 3.1 times in 1992. Capital expenditures decreased to $7.9 million,
compared to $10.2 million in 1992.
 
     In 1993 operating profit of the Specialty Container Products segment
increased 26.2 percent to $28.8 million, compared to $22.8 million in 1992.
Segment sales of $119.0 million were 26.4 percent higher than 1992's $94.1
million. Lamons Metal Gasket Co., acquired in November 1993, has been included
in the Specialty Container Products segment for financial reporting purposes and
is included in 1993 segment results. Operating margin in 1993 of the previously
owned segment companies improved over 1992's level, while the acquisition of
Lamons and the related depreciation and amortization affected the segment
operating margin as a whole. The segment's inventory turnover was 6.6 times in
1993, compared to 7.0 times during 1992. Capital expenditures for the segment,
primarily to further improve manufacturing efficiencies and service
capabilities, and consolidate manufacturing facilities at Norris Cylinder
Company, were $7.8 million, compared to $3.5 million in 1992.
 
     The Corporate Companies segment operating profit increased 6.6 percent to
$7.1 million, compared to $6.7 million in 1992. Segment sales of $61.7 million
increased 6.1 percent, compared to $58.2 million in 1992. The Precision Cutting
Tools group and Compac Corporation both benefited from the modestly
strengthening economy during 1993 as well as individual market share gains.
Compac Corporation's continued expansion in specialty industrial tape niche
markets contributed to 1993's sales increase. The 1993 segment operating profit
margin of 11.5 percent equaled that achieved in 1992. In 1993 inventory turnover
was 5.3 times as compared to 4.9 times in 1992. Capital expenditures during the
year decreased to $1.3 million, compared to $2.9 million in 1992.
 
     In August 1993 the Company issued $115.0 million of 5% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures Due 2003. The net proceeds of $112.0 million, together
with available cash resources, were used to reduce existing bank borrowings by
$115.0 million.
 
     On December 15, 1993, all outstanding shares of the Company's $100
Convertible Participating Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 7.8
million shares of common stock. Because of this conversion, the provision for
preferred stock dividends in 1993 totaled $5.3 million as compared to $7.0
million in 1992.
 
     Primary earnings per common share increased 20.7 percent to $1.05 in 1993
based on 31.1 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding,
compared to $.87 (before an extraordinary charge) and 26.0 million shares and
equivalents outstanding in 1992. The increase in primary shares outstanding was
the result of the conversion of the Convertible Participating Preferred Stock,
as well as the 1993 full year effect of 1992's public offering of 9.2 million
common shares. Fully diluted earnings per common share in 1993 were $1.01, based
on 39.1 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding, compared to
$.87 (before an extraordinary charge) and 33.9 million shares and equivalents
outstanding in 1992. Convertible securities did not have a dilutive effect in
1992. The increase in fully diluted shares in 1993 was the result of the
issuance of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which are convertible into
5.1 million common shares.
 
LIQUIDITY, WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH FLOWS
 
     One of the Company's financial strategies is to maintain a relatively high
level of liquidity and cash flow, which continued in 1994. Historically, TriMas
Corporation has generated significant cash flows from operating activities to
fund capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other operating
requirements. Cash flow generation has been enhanced by the Company's continuing
efforts to improve operating efficiencies, cost reductions and the management of
working capital requirements to support increased sales volumes.
 
     One of the Company's strengths is its ability to generate cash from
operations in excess of requirements for capital investments and dividends.
 
     "Free Cash Flow": Free Cash Flow is cash from operations remaining after
the Company has satisfied its capital investment initiatives to enhance
manufacturing efficiencies, expand productive capacity and avail
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   15
 
itself of other competitive opportunities. As one of its financial strategies,
the Company focuses on maximizing Free Cash Flow to achieve management's primary
objective -- maximizing long-term shareholder value. The consolidated statements
of cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):

     In 1994 the Company again experienced strong operating cash flows as
operating activities provided $67.7 million. Increased cash flow from income and
noncash charges for depreciation and amortization during 1994 were partially
offset by working capital needs to support 1994's internal sales growth as new
product successes and marketing initiatives and the improved economy contributed
to record sales levels in all four segments. Capital expenditures to reduce
product costs, improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiencies and expand
productive capacity equaled $24.3 million in 1994, and $26.3 million and $20.5
million in 1993 and 1992. During the three year period approximately $25.0
million of capital expenditures were for capacity expansion and productivity
enhancements in the Towing Systems segment, and $12.5 million were for capacity
expansion in the Specialty Fasteners segment at the Company's new TriMas
Fasteners, Inc. facility in Indiana. The Company continues its active corporate
development efforts to complement internal growth through significant
investments for the acquisition of additional companies which meet TriMas'
selective criteria. In 1993 the Company acquired Lamons Metal Gasket Co. for
$60.3 million cash.
 
     The Company's net financing activities during this period consisted of the
funding of the cost of the 1993 acquisition, the refinancing of its prior
Subordinated Debentures from cash and the issuance of equity securities, and the
payment of common and preferred dividends. The Company borrowed $60.0 million in
November 1993 under its bank revolving credit agreement to finance the
acquisition of Lamons. In August 1993 the Company issued $115.0 million of 5%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003. The net proceeds of the offering
of $112.0 million, together with $3.0 million of available cash resources, were
used to redeem $115.0 million of borrowings under the Company's bank revolving
credit agreement which were originally incurred to finance prior acquisitions.
 
     In April 1992 the Company issued 9.2 million new shares of common stock
through a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering of $85.2 million
together with a portion of available cash resources, a total of $97.0 million,
were used to redeem $88.0 million of subordinated debt and pay a related
redemption premium.
 
     The Company initiated a quarterly common stock dividend during 1992, and
common stock dividends paid in 1994, 1993 and 1992 equaled $5.1 million, $3.2
million and $.7 million, respectively. In 1993 the Company paid $12.3 million in
preferred stock dividends representing dividends accrued through the first three
quarters of 1993 and the full year 1992. In 1992 the Company paid $7.0 million
of preferred stock dividends accrued during the prior year.
 
     The Company believes its cash flows from operations, along with its
borrowing capacity and access to financial markets, are adequate to fund its
strategies for future growth, including working capital, expenditures for
manufacturing expansion and efficiencies, market share initiatives, and
corporate development activities.

     At December 31, 1994, the Company's current ratio was 4.7 to 1 and working
capital totaled $207.6 million, including $107.7 million of cash and cash
equivalents. At December 31, 1993, the current ratio was 4.2 to 1 and working
capital totaled $163.8 million, including $69.8 million of cash and cash
equivalents.
 
     The Company's working capital turnover was 2.9 times in 1994, compared to
3.0 times in 1993. Excluding cash, the working capital turnover was 5.5 times in
1994 as compared to 5.4 times in 1993. The Company's inventory turned over 4.6
times in 1994, compared to 4.8 times in 1993, while the accounts receivable
days-sales year-end balance declined to 51 days in 1994, compared to 52 days in
1993.
 
     The Company has a $350.0 million revolving credit facility, maturing in
1998, with a group of domestic and international banks. The facility permits the
Company to borrow under several different interest rate options. At December 31,
1994, the Company had available credit of $228.0 million under the credit
agreement.
 
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company maintains an active acquisition program, which has made
important contributions to the Company's growth. During 1993 the Company
acquired Lamons Metal Gasket Co. from MascoTech, Inc. for $60.3 million cash and
the assumption of certain liabilities, plus contingent payments based upon
Lamons achieving specified levels of future earnings.
 
     The Company utilizes well-disciplined criteria in selecting acquisitions,
including the long-term enhancement of its financial strength and shareholder
value.
 
     The initial earnings benefit of acquisitions to the Company is less than
the corresponding increase in sales since earnings are reduced by acquisition
related costs such as interest and added depreciation and amortization.
Generally, the anticipated earnings improvement for the Company comes from
subsequent growth of acquired companies, since future incremental sales are not
burdened with these fixed acquisition costs.

                               TRIMAS CORPORATION
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TriMas
Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in prior period
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.
 
AFFILIATES
 
     As of December 31, 1994, MascoTech, Inc.'s common stock ownership in the
Company approximated 41.5 percent, and Masco Corporation's common stock
ownership approximated 5.3 percent. The Company has a corporate services
agreement with Masco Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
pays a fee to Masco Corporation for various corporate support staff,
administrative services, and research and development services. Such fee equals
.8 percent of the Company's net sales, subject to certain adjustments.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
     The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 1994,
the Company had $90.5 million invested in prime commercial paper of several
United States issuers having the highest rating given by one of the two
principal rating agencies.
 
INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with
cost determined principally by use of the first-in, first-out method.
 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Property and equipment additions, including significant betterments, are
recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or
loss is included in income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense
as incurred.
 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
     Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 1/2 to 5 percent, and machinery and
equipment, 6 2/3 to 33 1/3 percent. The excess of cost over net assets of
acquired companies is being amortized using the straight-line method over the
periods estimated to be benefited, not exceeding 40 years. At December 31, 1994
and 1993, accumulated amortization of the excess of cost over net assets of
acquired companies and other intangible assets was $26.8 million and $21.5
million, respectively. Amortization expense was $5.3 million, $4.5 million and
$4.2 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     As of each balance sheet date management assesses whether there has been an
impairment in the value of excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies
by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from the related
operating activities with the carrying value. The factors considered by
management in performing this assessment include current operating results,
trends and prospects, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition and other economic factors. Based on this assessment there was no
impairment at December 31, 1994.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INCOME TAXES
 
     The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and the basis as reported in the consolidated financial
statements. The Company has not provided for taxes on $12.3 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 1994, because
such earnings are generally considered permanently reinvested.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
     Net assets of the Company's operations outside of the United States are
translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates with the effects of
translation adjustments deferred and included as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates
of exchange during the period.
 
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
 
     Primary earnings per common share in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were calculated on
the basis of 37.0 million, 31.1 million and 26.0 million weighted average common
and common equivalent shares outstanding. Fully diluted earnings per common
share in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were calculated on the basis of 42.1 million, 39.1
million and 33.9 million weighted average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding. Common shares outstanding and per common share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect the 100 percent stock distribution in July 1993.
 
     In 1993 MascoTech, Inc. converted all of the $100 Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock into 7.8 million shares of Company common stock.
 
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
 
     During 1993 the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Lamons Metal
Gasket Co. ("Lamons") from MascoTech, Inc. for $60.3 million cash and the
assumption of certain liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The excess of cost over net assets acquired of approximately $46.6
million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. The results
of operations of Lamons have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from the effective date of the transaction. Additional purchase price
amounts, contingent upon the achievement of specified levels of future
profitability by Lamons, may be payable to MascoTech, Inc. beginning in 1997.
These payments, if required, will be recorded as additional excess of cost over
net assets of acquired businesses.

NOTE 7. NOTES RECEIVABLE
 
     Notes receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $.7
million at both December 31, 1994 and 1993, and consist principally of the
long-term portion of notes receivable arising from the sale of certain products
in the normal course of business. These notes bear various fixed interest rates
and mature through 2000. At December 31, 1994, the carrying value of these notes
receivable approximated their estimated fair value as calculated using the
interest rates in effect on that date.

     Borrowings from banks are owing under the Company's $350.0 million
revolving credit facility, maturing in 1998, with a group of domestic and
international banks. The facility permits the Company to borrow under several
different interest rate options. At December 31, 1994, the blended interest rate
on these borrowings equaled 6.3 percent. The facility contains certain
restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which, at December 31, 1994,
required $211.4 million of shareholders' equity. The Company had available
credit of $228.0 million under its revolving credit facility at December 31,
1994.
 
     The 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures are convertible into Company
common stock at $22 5/8 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The
Debentures are redeemable, at a premium, at the Company's option after August 1,
1996.
 
     In 1992 the Company retired subordinated debentures due in 1999, held by
MascoTech, Inc., and recognized a $9.0 million pre-tax extraordinary charge
($5.7 million after tax, or $.22 per common share) relative to the payment of
the redemption premium associated with the early extinguishment.

     Contributions to profit-sharing and other defined contribution plans are
generally determined as a percentage of the covered employee's annual salary.
 
     Defined benefit plans provide retirement benefits for salaried employees
based primarily on years of service and average earnings for the five highest
consecutive years of compensation. Defined benefit plans covering hourly
employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.
These plans are funded based on an actuarial evaluation and review of the
assets, liabilities and requirements of each plan. Plan assets are held by a
trustee and invested principally in cash equivalents and marketable equity and
fixed income instruments.
 
     Net periodic pension cost of defined benefit plans included the following
components:

     The Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
for certain eligible retired employees under unfunded plans. Some of the plans
have cost-sharing provisions. In 1992 the expense recognized for postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits was based on actual expenditures.
Effective January 1, 1993, the estimated costs of these postretirement benefits
are being accrued during the eligible employees' service periods. The Company is
amortizing the unrecognized accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
existing at January 1, 1993, over 20 years.

NOTE 16. INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

     Earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 1993 were
improved by $.06 and $.04, net, respectively, resulting from various year-end
adjustments to accrual estimates recorded earlier in each year.
 
     Quarterly earnings per common share amounts for both 1994 and 1993 do not
total to the full year amounts due to rounding in 1994 and to the change in the
number of common shares outstanding occurring during 1993.

                       AMENDMENT TO REGISTRATION AGREEMENT


      This is an Amendment dated as of May 26, 1994 to a Registration Agreement
dated as of December 27, 1988 and amended as of April 21, 1992 and January 5,
1993 (the "Registration Agreement") among TriMas Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("TriMas"), Masco Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Masco"), and
MascoTech, Inc. (formerly Masco Industries, Inc.), a Delaware corporation
("Industries").

      WHEREAS, the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of TriMas is referred
to herein as the "Common Stock";

      WHEREAS, Masco and Industries have certain registration rights pursuant to
the Registration Agreement with respect to their shares of Common Stock;

      WHEREAS, the Registration Agreement provides that Masco and Industries may
assign certain of their registration rights under certain circumstances to
transferees who purchase shares of Common Stock from Masco and Industries;

      WHEREAS, Masco and Industries sold certain shares of Common Stock (the
"Executive Shares") to certain members of their senior management (the
"Executives'), including Richard A. Manoogian, pursuant to letter agreements
dated June 29, 1989 (the "Executive Letter Agreements");

      WHEREAS, Masco and Industries gave the Executives certain registration
rights pursuant to the Executive Letter Agreements with respect to the Executive
Shares;

      WHEREAS, TriMas, Masco and Industries wish to amend the Registration
Agreement to alter the arrangements for registration of the Executive Shares
owned by Richard A. Manoogian; and

      WHEREAS, Masco, Industries and Richard A. Manoogian are entering into
conforming amendments to Richard A. Manoogian's Executive Letter Agreements
concurrently herewith.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

      A.    Paragraph 1(b) of the Registration Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:

      "(b)  Richard A. Manoogian.  Promptly on or after the date of this
Amendment, TriMas shall prepare and file a Common Stock Registration Statement
covering all of the Executive Shares which Richard A. Manoogian purchased under
his Executive Letter Agreements (as adjusted from time to time for stock splits,
dividends and similar events) and shall use its best efforts to cause the Common
Stock Registration Statement to become effective as soon as possible.  TriMas
shall use its best efforts to keep 

<PAGE>

such Common Stock Registration Statement effective and in compliance with the
Securities Act on a continuous basis (i.e., a "shelf" registration), and to
provide Richard A. Manoogian with prospectuses and prospectus supplements in
compliance with the Securities Act as may be required from time to time, until
the earlier of (A) June 30, 1996 or (B) the date when Richard A. Manoogian
ceases to own any of the Common Stock registered thereunder.  All expenses
(other than fees and expenses of counsel to Richard A. Manoogian) in connection
with such registration pursuant to this Paragraph 1(b) shall be borne by TriMas.
If Richard A. Manoogian proposes to sell any shares of Common Stock under such
Common Stock Registration Statement pursuant to this 
Paragraph 1(b), he shall notify the Vice President - General Counsel or the Vice
President - Investments of Masco, who in turn shall notify the President (or, if

the President is absent or unavailable, any Vice President) of TriMas, and he
shall not consummate such sale until the President or a Vice President of TriMas
has been notified (or if more than 10 days have elapsed since the last such
notice was given); provided, however, that following a "Change in Control" of
Masco (as defined in the Executive Letter Agreement) he may notify the President
(or, if the President is absent or unavailable, any Vice President) of TriMas
directly.  TriMas will have the right at any time to suspend all sales of
Executive Shares under this Paragraph 1(b), for a period not exceeding a total
of 90 days, by notice to Richard A. Manoogian if in its good faith judgment the
relevant prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact, or omits to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Richard
A. Manoogian shall sell his Executive Shares under the Common Stock Registration
Statement pursuant to this Paragraph 1(b) only in accordance with the terms of
the related prospectus and any prospectus supplements, and shall not sell any
Executive Shares pursuant to such Common Stock Registration Statement while any
suspension of sales thereunder is in effect.  In lieu of a Common Stock
Registration Statement, TriMas at its option may utilize a prospectus or
prospectus supplement under its currently effective shelf registration
statement, in which event the rights and obligations with respect thereto shall
be the same as if TriMas had filed a Common Stock Registration Statement."

      B.    Except as provided herein, the Registration Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and not otherwise be modified or affected by the
provisions hereof.  This Amendment to Registration Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts.

Registration Agreement as of the date first set forth above.

                      TRIMAS CORPORATION
                    1988 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                 (Restated September 15, 1993)
                               

Article I.  Purpose

     The purpose of the 1988 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
TriMas Corporation (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent in
stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the committee
responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely responsible for the
Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to accomplish this purpose
by offering such employees and consultants an opportunity to purchase shares of
the Common Stock of the Company.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any
corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing
more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock, and an "affiliated company" is any other corporation, at least twenty
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is
owned by the Company or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corpora-
tions, at least twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the
Company or a subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.

Article II.  Administration

     The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Upon registration of the Company's Common Stock under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), members of the Committee
shall be "disinterested persons" as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act or any rule which modifies, amends or replaces Rule 16b-3(d). 
The Committee shall have authority, consistent with the Plan:

          (a)  to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
     Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
     options;

          (b)  to determine the time or times when options shall be granted
     and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each option;

<PAGE>

          (c)  to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
     option and the method of payment of such price;

          (d)  to determine the time or times when each option becomes
     exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
     period;

          (e)  to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing
     options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required under
     the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;

          (f)  to designate options granted to key employees of the Company or
     its subsidiaries under the Plan as "incentive stock options" ("ISOs"), as
     such terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

          (g)  to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
     administration of the Plan and options and for its own acts and
     proceedings; and

          (h)  to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
     disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan.

     All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned.

Article III.  Participants

     Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its sub-
sidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or who
is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the corporation
in question), as may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its
discretion, are eligible to receive options under the Plan.  The grant of an
option to an employee or consultant shall not entitle such individual to other
grants or options, nor shall such grant disqualify such individual from further
participation.

Article IV.  Limitations

     No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1998, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.  Subject to adjustment
as provided in Article IX, the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company
which may 
                               2

<PAGE>

be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000; provided, however, that
such number of shares shall be reduced by the number of shares of the Company's
Common Stock awarded under the Company's 1988 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan
(other than shares awarded under such plan which are later forfeited to the
Company).  To the extent that any option granted under the Plan shall expire or
terminate unexercised or for any reason become unexercisable, any stock
theretofore subject to such expired or terminated option shall thereafter be
available for further grants under the Plan.  If an option granted under the
Plan shall be accepted for surrender pursuant to Article VIII, any stock subject
to such option shall not thereafter be available for further grants.

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:

          (a)  Such option must be granted on or prior to November 1, 1998,
     and such option by its terms must not be exercisable after the expiration
     of ten years from the date such option is granted;

          (b)  Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does
     not, determined at the time such option is granted, own capital stock
     representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
     stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) the
     option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value, determined
     at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to such option
     and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than five years from
     the date it is granted; and

          (c)  The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject to
     such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock subject
     to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee
     exercisable in the same calendar year (all determined at the respective
     dates of grant of such options) must not exceed $100,000.

Article V.  Stock to be Issued

     The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share.  Such stock may be authorized but unissued
shares or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not
limited to shares purchased on the open market.  The Board of Directors and the
officers of the Company shall take any appropriate action required for such
issuance.
                               3

Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

     All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such other
terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

     (a)  Option Price.  Each option shall have such per share option price as
the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair market value of Common
Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

     (b)  Term of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven years
from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which the option
is awarded by the Committee.

     (c)  Exercise of Options.

          (i)  Each option shall be made exercisable not less than six months
     from the date of grant and at such time or times, whether or not in
     installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the time the option is
     granted.

          (ii)  A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
     notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise
     of the option and the number of shares of stock elected for exercise, such
     notice to be accompanied by such instruments or documents as may be
     required by the Committee, and shall tender the purchase price of the
     stock elected for exercise unless otherwise directed by the Committee.

          (iii)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
     instruments evidencing options granted hereunder, in the case of a Change
     in Control of the Company, each option then outstanding shall immediately
     become exercisable in full.  A Change in Control shall occur if:

               (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used
          in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than pursuant
          to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the Board of
          Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise becomes the
          "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the Exchange Act)
          or has the right to acquire such beneficial ownership (whether or
          not such right is exercisable immediately, with the passage of time,
          or subject to any condition) of voting securities representing
          twenty-five percent or more of the combined voting power of all
          outstanding voting 
                               4
<PAGE>

          securities of (A) the Company, or (B) of an Affiliated Party (as
          hereinafter defined); or

               (2)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
          months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
          constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
          whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
          stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
          members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
          beginning  of the period or whose election or nomination for elec-
          tion as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease
          to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

An "Affiliated Party" shall mean (x) MascoTech, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("MascoTech"), provided MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent of the
combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company, or (y) Masco
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Masco"), provided Masco then owns (i) at
least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting securities of
the Company, or (ii) at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all
voting securities of MascoTech and MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent
of the combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company.

     (d)  Payment for Issuance of Stock.  At the time of exercise of any option
granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all stock then
being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the Committee, in whole
or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its then fair market value. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in its discretion permit the
issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as it deems reasonable,
provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase price shall be evidenced
by a promissory note at such rate of interest and upon such other terms and
conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.  In all cases where stock is
issued for less than present full payment of the purchase price, there shall be
placed upon the certificate or certificates representing such stock a legend
setting forth the amount paid at issuance, and the amount remaining unpaid
thereon, and stating that the stock is subject to call for the remainder and may
not be transferred by the holder until the balance due thereon shall be fully
paid.

     The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its procedures,
may permit a participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, the income tax
withholding obligations in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified stock
option by having 
                               5
<PAGE>

shares withheld from the shares to be issued upon the exercise of the option or
by delivering shares of Common Stock of the Company having a fair market value
equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

     (e)  Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue
any stock unless and until:

          (i)  if the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at the time listed
     upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be issued have been
     listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice of
     issuance, upon such exchange, and

          (ii)  in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
     compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
     delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
     Company's counsel.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the Se-
curities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be in
accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or otherwise. 
The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the Company in
such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a stockholder only as
and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the participant pursuant
to the Plan.

     (f)  Nontransferability of Options.  No options may be transferred by the
participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in subsection
(j) of this Article, or by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and
during the participant's lifetime the option may be exercised only by the par-
ticipant.

     (g)  Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must agree
to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or the
consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually agreed
upon) for at least ninety days from the date the option is granted.

     (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including termination
by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a subsidiary or
affiliated company) other than the participant's death or permanent and total
disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or after 

                               6
<PAGE>

normal retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the opinion of
the Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify termination
of the option, the participant may thereafter exercise the option as provided
below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of the participant, the
option may be exercised only within ten days after the day of termination.  If
such termination is involuntary on the part of the participant, the option may
be exercised within three months after the day of termination.  Except as ex-
pressly provided in the Plan or the option, whether the termination of
employment or consulting arrangement is voluntary or involuntary, options may be
exercised only if such options were exercisable at the date of such termination,
and an option may not be exercised at a time when the option would not have been
exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement continued. 
Notwithstanding the preceding three sentences, the Committee may extend the time
within which or alter the terms and conditions on which the participant may ex-
ercise an option after the termination of employment or the consulting
arrangement, and if the period within which an option may be exercised has been
extended, the Committee may terminate the unexercised portion of the option if
it shall determine that the participant has engaged in any activity detrimental
to the Company's interests.  For purposes of this Article VI(h), a participant's
employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated (i) in
the case of approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence (not to
exceed one year unless otherwise approved by the Committee), (ii) in the case of
a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among the Company, its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or (iii) by virtue of a change of status
from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee.

     (i)  Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an option
the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and
total disability, such option may be exercised to the extent exercisable on the
date of retirement or such termination, provided such option shall be exercised
within three months of the date of retirement or such termination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its discretion the Committee may extend the
time within which or alter the terms and conditions on which an option held by a
retired or disabled option holder may be exercised, and if the period within
which an option may be exercised has been extended, the Committee may terminate
the unexercised portion of the option if it shall determine that the participant
has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's interests.

                               7
<PAGE>

     (j)  Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise an
option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such further
period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised, as to all or
any of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase immediately
prior to death (or such additional shares covered by the option as the Committee
may allow), by the person or persons designated in writing by the participant in
such form of beneficiary designation as may be approved by the Company, or
failing designation by the participant's personal representative, executor or
administrator or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred by will
or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.  The Company may decline to
deliver shares to a designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against
claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company.  Except as so exercised
such option shall expire at the end of such period.

Article VII.  Replacement Options

     The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms and conditions
differing from those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted
in substitution for options held by employees of or consultants to other
entities who concurrently become employees of or consultants to the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company as the result of a merger, consolidation or
other reorganization of such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary or an
affiliated company, or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or an
affiliated company of the business, property or stock of such other entity.  The
Committee may direct that the replacement options be granted on such terms and
conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.

Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

     The Committee may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as
it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or shares
of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the date of
such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided that the
Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose of the Plan.

                               8
<PAGE>

Article IX.  Changes in Stock

     The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any, as
it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be granted
under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to options then
outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such outstanding
options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of capital stock, any
special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary transaction (including
a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to which the Company is a party.  The
determination of the Board of Directors as to such matters shall be conclusive
and binding on all persons.

Article X.  Employment Rights

     The adoption of the Plan, the grant of options hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not confer upon any employee of or
consultant to the Company or subsidiary or an affiliated company any right to
continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a sub-
sidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any way
impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company to
terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting arrangement
with any of its consultants at any time, with or without cause, unless a written
employment or consulting agreement provides otherwise.


Article XI.  Amendments

     The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the requirements
of changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other purpose which may
at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the extent permitted
under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company no
amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of stock available under
the Plan, alter the class of persons eligible to receive options under the Plan,
or without the consent of the participant void or diminish options previously
granted, nor increase or accelerate the conditions required for the exercise of
the same, except that nothing herein shall limit the Company's right under
Article VI(d) to call stock, issued for deferred payment which is evidenced by a
promissory note, where the participant is in default of the obligations of such
note.

                               TRIMAS CORPORATION

                      1988 RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                           (Restated February 8, 1995)


1.  Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the Plan is to aid TriMas Corporation (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in attracting and retaining key
employees and consultants of outstanding ability.  In addition, the Company
expects that it will benefit from the added interest which such individuals will
have in its welfare as a result of their ownership or increased ownership of the
Company's Common Stock.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any
corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing
more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock, and an "affiliated company" is any other corporation, at least twenty
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is
owned by the Company or by one or more other corporations in a chain of
corporations, at least twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by
the Company or a subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.

2.  Stock Subject to the Plan

      The shares which may be awarded under the Plan are shares of the Company's
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share.  Subject to adjustment as provided in
Paragraph 6, the total number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that may
be awarded under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000; provided, however, that
such number of shares shall be reduced by the number of shares of the Company's
Common Stock as to which options have been granted under the Company's 1988
Stock Option Plan (other than shares which are available for further grants
under Article IV of such plan notwithstanding the prior grant of options with
respect to such shares).  Such stock may be authorized but unissued shares or
shares reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to shares purchased
on the open market.  Shares of stock awarded under the Plan which are later re-
acquired by the Company as a result of forfeiture pursuant to the Plan shall
again become available for awards under the Plan.

3.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Upon registration of the 

<PAGE>

Company's Common Stock under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "Exchange Act"), members of the Committee shall be "disinterested persons"
as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act or any rule
which modifies, amends or replaces Rule 16b-3(d).  The Committee shall have the
authority, consistent with the Plan, to determine the terms and conditions of
each award, to interpret the Plan and the agreements entered into pursuant to
the Plan, to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for its ad-
ministration and the awards, and generally to conduct and administer the Plan
and to make all determinations in connection therewith which may be necessary or
advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding
upon all parties concerned.

4.  Eligibility

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the Committee
in its discretion, are eligible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee
shall determine in its sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to
each participant.

5.  Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in each Award Agreement
("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less
      than ninety days.  Such Restricted Period may differ among participants
      and may have different expiration dates with respect to portions of shares
      covered by the same award.  The Committee may also determine that the
      expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to such additional
      terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion and as set forth
      in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of Common Stock awarded to participants may not be sold,
      encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided,
      during the Restricted Period 

                                     2
<PAGE>

      pertaining to such shares.  Except for such restrictions on transfer, the
      participant shall have all the rights of a stockholder including but not
      limited to the right to receive all dividends paid on such shares (subject
      to the provisions of Paragraph 6) and the right to vote such shares.

            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any reason
      (including termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no
      longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other than death, permanent
      and total disability, or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or
      after normal retirement date, all shares of stock theretofore awarded to
      the participant which are still subject to the restrictions imposed by
      Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination of employment or the consulting
      relationship be forfeited and transferred back to the Company, provided,
      however, that if such employment or consulting relationship is terminated
      by action of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
      companies without cause or by agreement of the Company or any of its
      subsidiaries or affiliated companies and the participant, the Committee
      may, but need not, determine that some or all of the shares shall not be
      so forfeited, and provided further that the Committee may remove or modify
      restrictions on shares which are not forfeited.  For purposes of this
      Paragraph 5(c), a participant's employment or consulting arrangement shall
      not be considered terminated (i) in the case of transfers of employment or
      the consulting arrangement among the Company, its subsidiaries and
      affiliated companies, (ii) by virtue of a change of status from employee
      to consultant or from consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of
      interruption in service, not exceeding one year in duration unless
      otherwise approved by the Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona
      fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if an employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
      by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date, the
      restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to the
      shares then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided to the
      contrary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan shall not be
      evidenced by certificates until restrictions

                                     3
<PAGE>

      lapse but shall be registered in the name of the participant in book entry
      form in the Company's stock register.
            
            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the Company
      in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and conditions
      of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to the shares
      covered by the award, and such other matters, including compliance with
      applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of withholding or
      providing for the payment of required taxes, as the Committee in its sole
      discretion shall determine.  The Committee may at any time amend the terms
      of any Agreement consistent with the terms of the Plan, except that
      without the participant's written consent no such amendment shall
      adversely affect the rights of the participant.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares covered
      by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates deposited
      with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the Restricted Period
      has expired, as follows:

                  (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                  (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                  (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards granted hereunder, in the case of a Change
      in Control of the Company, each award theretofore granted shall immedi-
      ately become fully vested and non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be dis-
      tributed to participants as soon as practicable, free of all restrictions.
      A Change in Control shall occur if:

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used
            in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than pursuant
            to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the Board of
            Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise 

                                     4

            becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the 
            Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such beneficial ownership
            (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately, with the
            passage of time, or subject to any condition), of voting securities
            representing twenty-five percent or more of the combined voting
            power of all outstanding voting securities of (A) the Company, or
            (B) of an Affiliated Party (as hereinafter defined); or

                 (2)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election
            as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
            constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

An "Affiliated Party" shall mean (x) MascoTech, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("MascoTech"), provided MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent of the
combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company, or (y) Masco
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Masco"), provided Masco then owns (i) at
least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting securities of
the Company, or (ii) at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all
voting securities of MascoTech and MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent
of the combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a participant
      may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor trust
      established by the participant for the sole benefit of the participant
      during the life of the participant, and under the terms of which the
      participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or physical or
      mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a written in-
      strument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and the
      participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the agreement or
      other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment of the Committee
      the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign rights under an
      award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an assignment is
      permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after assignment, because
      of amendment, by force of law or any other reason such trust no longer
      meets such criteria, such attempted 

                                     5
<PAGE>

      assignment shall be void and may be disregarded by the Committee and the
      Company and all rights to any awards shall revert to and remain solely in
      the participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the participant,
      and not the trust to which rights under an award may be assigned, for the
      purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of the award shall
      continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as the case may be,
      of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such trust and the
      participant shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the
      Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other instrument
      of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents delivered
      to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe genuine and
      any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and
      binding upon the participant, his personal representatives and all persons
      asserting a claim based on an award granted pursuant to this Plan.  The
      delivery by a participant of a beneficiary designation, or an assignment
      of rights under an award as permitted by this Paragraph 5(i), shall
      constitute the participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the Commit-
      tee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees harmless against
      claims, including any cost or expense incurred in defending against
      claims, of any person (including the participant) which may be asserted or
      alleged to be based upon an award subject to a beneficiary designation or
      an assignment.  In addition, the Company may decline to deliver shares to
      a beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third parties
      satisfactory to the Company.  Issuance of shares as to which restrictions
      have lapsed in the name of, and delivery to, the trust to which rights may
      be assigned shall be conclusively considered issuance and delivery to the
      participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its
      procedures, may permit the participant to satisfy, in whole or in part,
      the applicable income tax withholding obligations when the restrictions
      imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse by having shares withheld from the shares
      as to which the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering shares of
      Common Stock of the Company having a fair market value equal to the amount
      needed to satisfy such obligations.
                                     6
<PAGE>

            (k)  In its sole discretion the Committee may also provide the
      participant with the right to receive cash payments in connection with
      shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan (including shares previously
      awarded), the amount of which payments are based, in whole or only in
      part, on the value of such Common Stock.  The right to receive such
      payments shall be subject to such other terms and conditions not
      inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may determine.

6.  Changes in Capitalization

      If there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or combination of,
stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the outstanding
Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and class of shares as
to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted by
the Committee whose determination thereof shall be conclusive.  Unless the Com-
mittee shall otherwise determine, any shares of stock or other securities
received by a participant with respect to shares still subject to the
restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the same restrictions
and shall be deposited with the Company.

      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the re-
strictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.

7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of the Company's stockholders no
amendment shall increase the number of shares which may be awarded under the
Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December 31,
1998 or change the standards of eligibility of employees or consultants eligible
to participate in the Plan.  The number of shares awardable under the Plan may,
however, without stockholder approval, be adjusted pursuant to the adjustment
provisions described in Paragraph 6 hereof.

8.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan, the award of stock hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not confer upon any employee of or
consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any right to
continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a 

                                     7
<PAGE>

subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any way
impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company to
terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting arrangement
with any of its consultants at any time, with or without cause, unless a written
employment or consulting agreement provides otherwise.

9.  Effective Date and Termination of Awards

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1998.

                                MASCO CORPORATION

                         RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated September 14, 1993)


1.    Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the Plan is to aid Masco Corporation (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in securing and retaining key
employees and consultants of outstanding ability and to motivate such
individuals to exert their best efforts on behalf of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies.  In addition, the Company expects that it
will benefit from the added interest which such individuals will have in its
welfare as a result of their ownership or increased ownership of the Company's
Common Stock.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For
purposes of Paragraph 4 of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other
corporation (and its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own
stock possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company or by one
or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent
of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another
corporation within such chain. 


2.   Stock Subject to the Plan

      The total number of shares of stock that may be awarded under the Plan is
4,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, $1.00 par value.  Such stock may
be authorized but unissued shares or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the
Company, including but not limited to shares purchased on the open market. 
Shares of stock awarded under the Plan which are later reacquired by the Company
as a result of forfeiture pursuant to the Plan shall again become available for
awards under the Plan.


3.    Administration

      The Board of Directors of the Company shall appoint a committee (the
"Committee") consisting of three or more members of the Board of Directors who
shall administer the Plan.  Members of the Committee shall not be eligible while
a member to participate in the Plan and shall not have at any time within one
year prior to appointment been eligible for selection as a person to whom stock 
<PAGE>

may have been allocated or to whom stock options of the Company may have been
granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company.  The Committee
shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, to determine the terms and
conditions of each award, to interpret the Plan and the agreements under the
Plan, to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the administration
of the Plan and the awards, and generally to conduct and administer the Plan and
to make all determinations in connection therewith which may be necessary or
advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be binding upon all
participants.


4.    Eligibility
      
      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company), as
may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are
eligible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to each such participant.


5.    Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants under this Plan shall
be subject to the following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and
conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in each Award
Agreement ("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less
      than one year.  Such Restricted Period may differ between and among
      participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of shares covered by the same award.  The Committee may also
      determine that the expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to
      such additional terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion
      and as set forth in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of stock awarded to participants may not be sold,
      encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided,
      during the Restricted Period pertaining to such shares.  Except for such
      restrictions on transfer, the participant shall have all the rights of a
      stockholder including but not limited to the right to receive all
      dividends paid on such shares (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6)
      and the right to vote such shares.

                                          2
<PAGE>

                  (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
            Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any
            reason (including termination by reason of the fact that any
            corporation is no longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other
            than death, permanent and total disability, or, in the case of an 
            employee, retirement on or after normal retirement date, all shares
            of stock theretofore awarded to the participant which are still 
            subject to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon
            such termination of employment or the consulting relationship be
            forfeited and transferred back to the Company, provided, however,
            that in the event such employment or consulting relationship is
            terminated by action of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
            affiliated companies without cause or by agreement of the Company or
            any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and the participant,
            the Committee may, but need not, determine that some or all of the
            shares shall be free of restrictions.  For purposes of this
            Paragraph 5(c), a participant's employment or consulting arrangement
            shall not be considered terminated (i) in the case of transfers of
            employment or the consulting arrangement among the Company, its
            subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by virtue of a change of
            status from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee,
            or (iii) in the case of interruption in service, not exceeding one
            year in duration unless otherwise approved by the Committee, for
            approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if an employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
      by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date, the
      restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to the
      shares then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided to the
      contrary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Each certificate issued in respect of shares awarded under the
      Plan shall be registered in the name of the participant and deposited by
      the participant with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in
      blank, and shall bear the following legend:

            "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this certificate and
      the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and
      conditions (including a contingent transfer obligation) contained in the
      Masco Corporation Restricted Stock Incentive Plan and an agreement entered
      into between the registered owner and Masco Corporation.  Copies of such
      Plan 

                                          3
<PAGE>

      and Agreement are on file in the office of the Secretary of Masco
      Corporation, Taylor, Michigan."

            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the Company
      in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and conditions
      of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to the shares
      covered by the award, and such other matters, including compliance with
      applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of withholding or
      providing for the payment of required taxes, as the Committee shall in its
      sole discretion determine.  The Committee may at any time amend the terms
      of any Agreement consistent with the terms of the Plan, except that
      without the participant's written consent no such amendment shall
      adversely affect the rights of the participant who is a party to such
      Agreement.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares covered
      by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates deposited
      with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the Restricted Period
      has expired, as follows:

                 (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                 (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                 (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder,
      in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each award granted at
      least one year prior thereto shall immediately become fully vested and
      non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be distributed to participants as soon
      as practicable, free of all restrictions.  A Change in Control shall occur
      if:

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used
            in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
            (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            
                                          4
<PAGE>
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such
            beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable
            immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any condition),
            of voting securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting
            power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; or

                 (2)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election
            as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
            constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a participant
      may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor trust
      established by the participant for the sole benefit of the participant
      during the life of the participant, and under the terms of which the
      participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or physical or
      mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a written
      instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and the
      participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the agreement or
      other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment of the Committee
      the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign rights under an
      award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an assignment is
      permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after assignment, because
      of amendment, by force of law or any other reason such trust no longer
      meets such criteria, such attempted assignment shall be void and may be
      disregarded by the Committee and the Company and all rights to any awards
      shall revert to and remain solely in the participant.  Notwithstanding a
      qualified assignment, the participant, and not the trust to which rights
      under an award may be assigned, for the purpose of determining compen-
      sation arising by reason of the award shall continue to be considered an
      employee or consultant, as the case may be, of the Company, a subsidiary
      or affiliated company, but such trust and the participant shall be bound
      by all of the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other instrument
      of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents delivered
      to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe genuine and
      any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive 

                                          5
<PAGE>

      and binding upon the participant, his personal representatives and all
      persons asserting a claim based on an award granted pursuant to this 
      Plan. The delivery by a participant of a beneficiary designation, or an
      assignment of rights under an award as permitted by this Paragraph 5(i),
      shall constitute the participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the
      Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees harmless
      against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in defending
      against claims, of any person (including the participant) which may be
      asserted or alleged to be based upon an award subject to a beneficiary
      designation or an assignment.  In addition, the Company may decline to
      deliver shares to a beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims
      of third parties satisfactory to the Company.  Issuance of shares as to
      which restrictions have lapsed in the name of, and delivery to, the trust
      to which rights may be assigned shall be conclusively considered issuance
      and delivery to the participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the
      procedures established by the Committee, may permit the participant to
      satisfy, in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding
      obligations when the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse:  (1) in
      the case of participants who are employees of or consultants to MascoTech,
      Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, by delivering from shares of common stock
      of MascoTech, Inc. owned by the participant such number of shares having a
      fair market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations;
      or (2) in the case of all other participants, by having withheld from the
      shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering from
      shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the participant such number
      of shares having a fair market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy
      such obligations.


6.   Changes in Capitalization

      In the event there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or
combination of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and class
of shares as to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall be appro-
priately adjusted by the Committee whose determination thereof shall be
conclusive.  Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, any shares of stock
or other securities received by a participant with respect to shares still
subject to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the
same restrictions and shall be deposited with the Company.

                                          6
<PAGE>
      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.


      7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of Stockholders no amendment shall
increase the total number of shares which may be awarded under the Plan, extend
the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December 31, 1991 or change
the standards of eligibility of employees eligible to participate in the Plan. 
The total number of shares awardable under the Plan may, however, without
stockholder approval, be adjusted pursuant to the adjustment provisions
described in Paragraph 6 hereof.


      8.  Effective Date and Termination of Plan

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1991.

                               MASCO CORPORATION 

                             1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                          (Restated September 14, 1993)


Article I.  Purpose

      The purpose of the 1984 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
Masco Corporation (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent in
stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the committee
responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely responsible for the
Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to accomplish this purpose
by offering such employees and consultants an opportunity to purchase shares of
the Common Stock of the Company.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any
corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing
more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock.  For purposes of Articles III and VII of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation (and its subsidiaries) in which the Company or
its subsidiaries own stock possessing at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the
Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by
the Company or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at
least twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.


Article II.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
No director shall become or remain a member of the Committee unless at the time
of exercise of any discretionary function as a Committee member such director is
not eligible, and has not at any time within one year prior to the exercise of
such discretion been eligible for selection as a person to whom stock may be
allocated or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted
pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of its affiliates
entitling the participants therein to acquire stock, stock options or stock
appreciation rights of the Company or any of its affiliates.  The Committee
shall have authority, consistent with the Plan:

<PAGE>

            (a) to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
      Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
      options;

            (b) to determine the time or times when options shall be granted and
      the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each option;

            (c) to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
      option and the method of payment of such price;

            (d) to determine the time or times when each option becomes
      exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
      period;

            (e) to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing any
      options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required under
      the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;
      
            (f) to designate options granted to key employees of the Company or
      its "subsidiaries" under the Plan as "incentive stock options" ("ISOs"),
      as such terms are defined under the Internal Revenue Code;

            (g) to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
      administration of the Plan and the options and for its own acts and
      proceedings; and

            (h) to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
      disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan. 

      All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be binding on all parties concerned.


Article III.  Participants

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries or
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its sub-
sidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company), as may
be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are eligible
to receive options under the Plan.  The grant of an option to an employee or 
consultant shall not entitle such individual to other grants or options, nor 
shall such grant disqualify such individual from further participation.

                                    2
<PAGE>

Article IV.  Limitations

      No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1999, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.  The number of shares
of Common Stock of the Company which may be issued under the Plan shall not
exceed 4,000,000 in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in Article
IX.  To the extent that any option granted under the Plan shall expire or
terminate unexercised or for any reason become unexercisable as to any stock
subject thereto, such stock shall thereafter be available for further grants
under the Plan, within the limit specified above.  If an option granted under
the Plan shall be accepted for surrender pursuant to Article VIII, any stock
covered by options so accepted shall not thereafter be available for the
granting of other options under the Plan.

      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied with
respect to such option:

            (a) Such option must be granted on or prior to April 24, 1994, and
      such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of ten
      years from the date such option is granted;
      
            (b) Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does not,
      determined at the time such option is granted, own capital stock
      representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
      stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) the
      option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value, determined
      at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to such option
      and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than five years from
      the date it is granted;

            (c) Such option by its terms is not exercisable while there is
      outstanding an ISO which was granted to the same employee at an earlier
      time.  For purposes of this clause (c), an ISO which has not been
      exercised in full shall be deemed to be outstanding, notwithstanding any
      cancellation or termination thereof, until the expiration of the period
      during which it could have been exercised under its original terms; and

            (d) The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject to
      such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock subject
      to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee in the
      same calendar year (all determined at the respective dates of grant of
      such options) must not exceed $100,000 (the "Basic Amount") plus the sum
      of the "Carry-Over Amounts" for each of the three calendar years
      immediately preceding the year in which such option is 

                                    3
<PAGE>

      granted.  The "Carry-Over Amount", as used in this clause (d) for any
      calendar year, shall mean (i) fifty percent of the amount by which
      $100,000 exceeds the fair market value, determined at the time of grant,
      of Common Stock subject to ISOs which were granted during such calendar
      year to the employee for whom the Carry-Over Amount is being determined,
      or (ii) $50,000 in the case such employee has not in such calendar year
      been granted any ISO.  No amount shall be included in a Carry-Over Amount
      for any year to the extent such amount was theretofore necessarily in-
      cluded as a Carry-Over Amount to permit the qualification of an ISO under
      this clause (d), and Carry-Over Amounts shall only be utilized to permit
      the qualification of an ISO under this clause (d) in the order in which
      they first arose and then only if the Basic Amount has not theretofore
      been utilized to permit such qualification.


Article V.  Stock to be Issued

      The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, $1 par value.  Such stock may be authorized but unissued shares or shares
of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to shares
purchased on the open market.  The Board of Directors and the officers of the
Company shall take any appropriate action required for such issuance.


Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

      All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such other
terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

      (a) Option Price.  Each option granted hereunder shall have such per share
option price as the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair market
value of Common Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

      (b) Term of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven years
from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which the option
is awarded by the Committee.

      (c) Exercise of Options.

             (i) Each option shall be made exercisable at such time or times,
      whether or not in installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the
      time the option is granted.

            (ii) A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
      notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise
      of the option and of the number of
 
                                    4
<PAGE>

      shares of stock elected for exercise, such notice to be accompanied by
      such instruments or documents as may be required by the Committee, and
      such person shall at the time of such exercise tender the purchase price
      of the stock elected for exercise unless otherwise directed by the
      Committee.

           (iii) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing options heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder,
      in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each Option then
      outstanding shall immediately become exercisable in full.  A Change in
      Control shall occur if:

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used
            in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
            (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such
            beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable
            immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any condition),
            of voting securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting
            power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; or

                 (2)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election
            as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
            constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

      (d) Payment for Issuance of Stock.  Upon and at the time of exercise of
any option granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all
such stock then being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the
Committee, in whole or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its then
fair market value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in its
discretion permit the issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as it
deems reasonable, provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase price
shall be evidenced by a promissory note at such rate of interest and upon such
other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.  In all
cases where stock is issued for less than present full payment of the purchase
price, there shall be placed upon the certificate or certificates representing
such stock a legend setting forth the 

                                    5
<PAGE>

amount paid at issuance, and the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and stating
that the stock is subject to call for the remainder and may not be transferred
by the holder until the balance due thereon shall be fully paid.

      The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the procedures
established by the Committee, may permit a participant to satisfy, in whole or
in part, the applicable income tax withholding obligations in connection with
the exercise of a non-qualified stock option under the Plan:  (1) in the case of
participants who are employees of or consultants to MascoTech, Inc. or any of
its subsidiaries, by delivering from shares of common stock of MascoTech, Inc.
owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market value equal
to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations; or (2) in the case of all
other participants, by having withheld from the shares to be issued upon the
exercise of the option or by delivering from shares of Common Stock of the
Company owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market
value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

      (e)  Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue
any stock unless and until:

             (i) in the event the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at the
      time listed upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be issued have
      been listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice of
      issuance, upon such exchange, and

            (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
      compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
      delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
      Company's counsel.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the
Securities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be in
accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or otherwise. 
The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the Company in
such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a stockholder only as
and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the participant pursuant
to the Plan.

      (f) Nontransferability of Options.  No option may be transferred by the
participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in subsection
(j) of this Article, or by 

                                    6
<PAGE>

will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during the participant's
lifetime the option may be exercised only by the participant.

      (g) Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must agree
to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or the
consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually agreed
upon) for at least one year from the date of the granting of the option, subject
to the right of the Company, its subsidiary or affiliated company to terminate
the participant's employment or consulting arrangement at any time.

      (h) Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including termination
by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a subsidiary or
affiliated company) other than the participant's death or permanent and total
disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or after normal
retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the opinion of the
Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify termination of
the option, the participant may thereafter exercise the option as provided
below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of the participant, the
option may be exercised only within ten days after the day of termination unless
a longer period is permitted by the Committee in its discretion.  If such
termination is involuntary on the part of the participant, the option may be
exercised within three months after the day of termination.  Except as expressly
provided in the Plan, in no event may a participant whose employment or
consulting arrangement has been terminated voluntarily or involuntarily exercise
an option at a time when the option would not have been exercisable had the
employment or consulting arrangement continued.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Committee may by the express terms of the grant of the option extend the
aforesaid periods of time within which the participant may exercise an option
after the termination of employment or the consulting arrangement.  For purposes
of this Article VI(h), a participant's employment or consulting arrangement
shall not be considered terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or
other bona fide leave of absence (not to exceed one year unless otherwise
approved by the Committee), (ii) in the case of a transfer of employment or the
consulting arrangement among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated
companies, or (iii) by virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant
or from consultant to employee.  Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan
or the grant of an option, an option may be exercised only to the extent
exercisable on the date of termination of employment or of the consulting ar-
rangement by reason of death, permanent and total disability, retirement or
otherwise.

      (i) Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an option
the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is 

                                    7
<PAGE>

terminated by reason of permanent and total disability, such option may be
exercised to the extent exercisable on the date of retirement or such
termination, provided such option shall be exercised within three months of the
date of retirement or such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its
discretion the Committee may permit the exercise of an option held by a retired
or disabled option holder upon other terms and conditions as it deems advisable
under the circumstances, and if the period within which an option may be exer-
cised has been extended the Committee may terminate all unexercised options if
it shall determine that the participant has engaged in any activity detrimental
to the Company's interests.

      (j) Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise an
option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such further
period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised as to all or any
of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase immediately prior
to death (unless the Committee shall have provided in the instrument evidencing
such option that all shares covered by the option are subject to purchase upon
death), by the person or persons designated in writing by the participant in
such form of beneficiary designation as may be approved by the Company, or
failing designation by the participant's personal representative, executor or
administrator or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred by will
or the applicable laws of descent and distribution. The Company may decline to
deliver shares to a designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against
claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company.  Except as so exercised
such option shall expire at the end of such period.


Article VII.  Replacement Options

      The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms differing from
those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted in substitution
for options held by employees of or consultants to other entities who
concurrently become employees of or consultants to the Company or a subsidiary
or an affiliated company as the result of a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization of such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary or an
affiliated company, or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or an
affiliated company of the business, property or stock of such other entity.  The
Committee may direct that the substitute options be granted on such terms and
conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.

                                    8
<PAGE>

Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

      The Committee may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as
it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or shares
of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the date of
such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided that the
Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose of the Plan.


Article IX.  Changes in Stock

      The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any, as
it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be granted
under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to options then
outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such outstanding
options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of capital stock, any
special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary transaction (including
a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to which the Company is a party.  The
determination of the Board of Directors as to such matters shall be binding on
all persons.


Article X.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan does not confer upon any employee of or
consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any right to
continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any way
impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company to
terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting arrangement
with any of its consultants at any time.


Article XI.  Amendments

      The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the Plan.
The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend any
outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of
any changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other purpose which may
at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the extent permitted
under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company no
such amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of stock available
under the Plan, or alter the class of 

                                    9
<PAGE>

persons eligible to receive options under the Plan, or without the consent of
the participant void or diminish options previously granted, nor increase or
accelerate the conditions and actions required for the exercise of the same,
except that nothing herein shall limit the Company's right to call stock, issued
for deferred payment which is evidenced by a promissory note, where the par-
ticipant is in default of the obligations of such note.

                                MASCO CORPORATION

                1984 RESTRICTED STOCK (INDUSTRIES) INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated September 14, 1993)


1.    Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the 1984 Restricted Stock (Industries) Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") is to aid Masco Corporation (the "Company") and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies in securing and retaining key employees and consultants of
outstanding ability and to motivate such individuals to exert their best efforts
on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies.  In
addition, the Company expects that it will benefit from the added interest which
such individuals will have in its welfare as a result of their ownership or
increased ownership in common stock of an affiliated Company, MascoTech, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (formerly Masco Industries, Inc. and referred to herein as
"Industries").  For purposes of this Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For
purposes of Paragraph 4 of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other cor-
poration (and its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own
stock possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company or by one
or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent
of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another
corporation within such chain.


2.    Stock Subject to the Plan

      The total number of shares of stock that may be awarded under the Plan is
12,000,000 shares of Common Stock of Industries, $1.00 par value.  Such stock
may be any shares of Industries Common Stock owned by the Company.  Shares of
stock awarded under the Plan which are later reacquired by the Company as a
result of forfeiture pursuant to the Plan shall again become available for
awards under the Plan.


3.    Administration

      The Board of Directors of the Company shall appoint a committee (the
"Committee") consisting of three or more members of the Board of Directors who
shall administer the Plan.  No director 

<PAGE>

shall become or remain a member of the Committee unless at the time of his
exercise of any discretionary function as a Committee member such director is
not eligible and has not at any time within one year prior to the exercise of
such discretion been eligible for selection as a person to whom stock may be
allocated or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted
pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of its affiliates
entitling the participants therein to acquire stock, stock options or stock
appreciation rights of the Company or any of its affiliates.  The Committee
shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, to determine the terms and
conditions of each award, to interpret the Plan and the agreements under the
Plan, to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the administration
of the Plan and the awards, and generally to conduct and administer the Plan and
to make all determinations in connection therewith which may be necessary or
advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be binding upon all par-
ticipants.


4.    Eligibility
      
      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company), as
may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are
eligible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to each such participant.


5.    Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Industries' Common Stock awarded to participants under this
Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, and to such other
terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in
each Award Agreement ("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" of transfer which shall
      be not less than one year.  Such Restricted Period may differ among
      participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of shares covered by the same award.  The Committee may also
      determine that the expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to
      such additional terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion
      and as set forth in the participant's Agreement.

                                    2
<PAGE>


            (b)  Shares of stock awarded to participants may not be sold,
      encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided,
      during the Restricted Period pertaining to such shares.  Except for such
      restrictions on transfer, the participant shall have all the rights of a
      stockholder including but not limited to the right to receive all
      dividends paid on such shares (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6)
      and the right to vote such shares.
      
            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any reason
      (including termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no
      longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other than death, permanent
      and total disability, or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or
      after normal retirement date, all shares of stock theretofore awarded to
      the participant which are still subject to the restrictions imposed by
      Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination be forfeited and transferred
      back to the Company, provided, however, that in the event such employment
      or consulting relationship is terminated by action of the Company or any
      of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies without cause or by agreement
      of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and the
      participant, the Committee may, but need not, determine that some or all
      of such shares shall not be forfeited but instead shall be subject to such
      restrictions as the Committee may establish or that some or all of such
      shares shall be free of restrictions.  For purposes of this Paragraph
      5(c), a participant's employment or consulting arrangement shall not be
      considered terminated (i) in the case of transfers of employment or the
      consulting arrangement among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated
      companies, (ii) by virtue of a change of status from employee to
      consultant or from consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of
      interruption in service, not exceeding one year in duration unless
      otherwise approved by the Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona
      fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if any employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
      by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date, the
      restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to the
      shares then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided to the
      contrary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Each certificate issued in respect of shares awarded under the
      Plan shall be registered in the name of the participant and deposited by
      the participant with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in
      blank, and shall bear the following legend:

            "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this certificate and
      the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and
      conditions (including a contingent transfer obligation) contained in the
      Masco Corporation's 1984 Restricted Stock (Industries) Incentive Plan and
      an Award Agreement entered into between the registered owner and Masco
      Corporation.  Copies of such Plan and Award Agreement are on file in the
      office of the Secretary of Masco Corporation, Taylor, Michigan."

            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the Company
      in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and conditions
      of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to the shares
      covered by the award, and such other matters, including compliance with
      applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of withholding or
      providing for the payment of required taxes, as the Committee shall in its
      sole discretion determine.  The Committee may at any time amend the terms
      of any Agreement consistent with the terms of the Plan, except that
      without the participant's written consent no such amendment shall
      adversely affect the rights of the participant who is a party to such
      Agreement.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares covered
      by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates deposited
      with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the Restricted Period
      has expired, as follows:

                 (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                 (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                 (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

                                    4
<PAGE>

            (h)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder,
      in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each award granted at
      least one year prior thereto shall immediately become fully vested and
      non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be distributed to participants as soon
      as practicable, free of all restrictions.  A Change in Control shall occur
      if:

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used
            in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
            (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such
            beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable
            immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any condition),
            of voting securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting
            power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; or

                 (2)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election
            as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
            constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a participant
      may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor trust
      established by the participant for the sole benefit of the participant
      during the life of the participant, and under the terms of which the
      participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or physical or
      mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a written
      instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and the
      participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the agreement or
      other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment of the Committee
      the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign rights under an
      award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an assignment is
      permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after assignment, because
      of amendment, by force of law or any other reason such trust no longer
      meets such criteria, such attempted assignment shall be void and may be
      disregarded by the Committee and the Company and all rights to any awards
      shall revert to and remain solely 

                                    5
<PAGE>

      in the participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the
      participant, and not the trust to which rights under an award may be
      assigned, for the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of
      the award shall continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as
      the case may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but
      such trust and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
      conditions of the Award Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents    and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other instrument
      of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents delivered
      to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe genuine and
      any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and
      binding upon the participant, his personal representatives and all persons
      asserting a claim based on an award granted pursuant to this Plan.  The
      delivery by a participant of a beneficiary designation, or an assignment
      of rights under an award as permitted by this Paragraph 5(i), shall
      constitute the participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the Commit-
      tee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees harmless against
      claims, including any cost or expense incurred in defending against
      claims, of any person (including the participant) which may be asserted or
      alleged to be based upon an award subject to a beneficiary designation or
      an assignment.  In addition, the Company may decline to deliver shares to
      a beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third parties
      satisfactory to the Company.  Issuance of shares as to which restrictions
      have lapsed in the name of, and delivery to, the trust to which rights may
      be assigned shall be conclusively considered issuance and delivery to the
      participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the
      procedures established by the Committee, may permit the participant to
      satisfy, in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding
      obligations when the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse:  (1) in
      the case of participants who are employees of or consultants to Industries
      or any of its subsidiaries, by having withheld from the shares as to which
      the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering from shares of Common
      Stock of Industries owned by the participant such number of shares having
      a fair market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such
      obligations; or (2) in the case of all other participants, by having
      withheld from the shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or
      by delivering from shares of Common Stock of Industries or common stock of
      the Company owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair
      market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

                                    6

6.   Changes in Capitalization

      In the event there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or
combination of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by Industries for its
outstanding Common Stock, the maximum aggregate number and class of shares as to
which awards may be granted under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the
Committee whose determination thereof shall be conclusive.  Unless the Committee
shall determine otherwise, any shares of stock or other securities received by a
participant with respect to shares still subject to the restrictions imposed by
Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the same restrictions and shall be deposited
with the Company.

      If Industries shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.


 7.   Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of  Stockholders of the Company no
amendment shall increase the total number of shares which may be awarded under
the Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December
31, 1999 or change the standard of eligibility to participate in the Plan.  The
total number of shares which may be awarded under the Plan may, however, be
adjusted without stockholder approval pursuant to the adjustment provisions de-
scribed in Paragraph 6 hereof.


8.    Effective Date and Termination of Plan

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1999.

Dear      :

     As you know, our company's Board of Directors has adopted a Plan
whereby supplemental retirement and other benefits, in addition to those
provided under the Company's pension and other benefit plans, will be made
available to those Company and subsidiary executives as may be designated from
time to time by the company's Chief Executive Officer.  You have been
previously designated as a participant in the Plan by a letter agreement signed
by you and dated February 14, 1994.  This agreement amends and replaces in its
entirety your previously signed letter agreement and describes in full your
benefits pursuant to the Plan and all of the Company's obligations to you and
yours to the Company under the Plan.  These benefits as described below are
contractual obligations of the Company.

     For the purposes of this Agreement, words and terms are defined as 
follows:

         a.   "Retirement" shall mean your termination of employment
     with the Company, on or after you attain age 65.  Your acting as a
     consultant shall not be considered employment.

         b.   "Average Compensation" shall mean the aggregate of your
     highest three years' total annual cash compensation paid to you by the
     Company, consisting of (i) base salaries and (ii) regular year-end
     cash bonuses paid with respect to the years in which such salaries are
     paid, divided by three.

         c.   If you become Disabled, "Total Compensation" shall mean
     your annual base salary rate in the year in which you become Disabled
     plus the regular year-end cash bonus paid to you for the year
     immediately prior thereto.

         d.   "Surviving Spouse" shall be the person to whom you shall
     be legally married (under the law of the jurisdiction of your
     permanent residence) at the date of (i) your Retirement or death after
     attaining age 65 (if death

     terminated employment with the Company) for the purposes of paragraphs
     1, 2 and 3, (ii) your death for the purposes of paragraph 5, and (iii)
     your Disability for the purposes of paragraphs 6 and 7.  For the
     purposes of paragraphs 10a, 10e, 10f, 10g and 10h, "Surviving Spouse"
     shall be any spouse entitled to survivor's benefits.

         e.   "Disability" and "Disabled" shall mean your being unable
     to perform your duties as a Company executive by reason of your
     physical or mental condition, prior to your attaining age 65, provided
     that you have been employed by the Company for two consecutive Years
     or more.

         f.   "Company" shall mean TriMas Corporation or any
     corporation in which TriMas Corporation or a subsidiary owns stock

     classes of stock.
         
         g.   "Year" shall mean twelve full consecutive months, and
     "year" shall mean a calendar year.

         h.   "Plan Limitation" for any year shall mean (x) for
     1989, $300,000 multiplied by the Cost of Living Factor for 1988, and
     (y) for any year subsequent to 1989, the Plan Limitation for the
     immediately preceding year multiplied by the Cost of Living Factor for
     such preceding year.

         i.   "Cost of Living Factor" for any year shall mean, except as
     otherwise provided generally with respect to the Plan by the Company's
     Board of Directors, the quotient (in no event to exceed 1.03 or to be
     less than .97) obtained by dividing the monthly Consumer Price Index
     Number (as compiled in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers by
     the Bureau of Labor Statistics) for the month of December in such year
     by the monthly Consumer Price Index Number for the immediately
     preceding month of December.

         j.   A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if,
     during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar months, the
     individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the
     Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors whose election by
     such Board or nomination for election by stockholders was approved by
     a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were
     either directors on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose
     election or nomination for election as directors was previously so
     approved, for any reason cease to constitute at least a majority of
     the members thereof.

     1.  In accordance with the Plan, upon your Retirement the Company will
pay you annually during your lifetime 60% of your Average Compensation, less:
(i) a sum equal to the annual benefit which would be payable to you upon your
Retirement if benefits payable to you under the Company funded qualified
pension plans and the defined benefit (pension) plan restoration provisions of
the Company's Retirement Benefits Restoration Plan and any similar plan were
converted to a life annuity, or if you are married when you retire, to a joint
and spouse survivor life annuity, (ii) a sum equal to the annual benefit which
would be payable to you upon Retirement if your vested accounts in the
Company's Future Service Profit Sharing Trust and the defined contribution
(profit sharing) restoration provisions of the Company's Retirement Benefits
Restoration Plan and any similar plan were converted to a life annuity, and
(iii) any retirement benefits payable to you by reason of employment by your
prior employers (excluding, however, from such deduction any portion thereof,
and earnings thereon, determined by the committee referred to in paragraph 10
to have been contributed by you rather than your prior employers).  In all
cases the amount offset pursuant to these subsections (i) and (ii) shall be
determined prior to the effect of any payments from the plans and trust
referred to therein which are authorized pursuant to a Qualified Domestic
Relations Order under ERISA.

     2.  Upon your death after Retirement or while employed by the Company
after attaining age 65, your Surviving Spouse shall receive for life 75% of the
annual benefit pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Agreement which was payable to
you prior to your death (or, if death terminated employment after attaining age
65, which would have been payable to you had your Retirement occurred
immediately prior to your death).

     3.  Upon your Retirement the Company will provide or purchase for you and
your spouse's benefit, or at its option reimburse you or your Surviving Spouse
for premiums paid, during your joint and several lives, such supplemental
medical insurance as the Company may deem advisable from time to time.

     4.  Under no circumstances (i) will any retirement benefits be paid
to you or your Surviving Spouse pursuant to this Agreement unless you were
employed by the Company or Disabled on your Retirement, or were employed by the
Company at the time of your death after attaining age 65, and (ii) will you or
your Surviving Spouse be entitled to receive retirement benefits under this
Agreement if your Retirement commences prior to your attaining age 65.

     5.  If while employed by the Company you die prior to your attaining age
65 leaving a Surviving Spouse, and provided you shall have been employed by the
Company for two consecutive Years or more, your Surviving Spouse shall receive
annually for life 45% of your Average Compensation, less:  (i) a sum equal to
the annual benefit which would be payable to your Surviving Spouse under
Company funded qualified pension plans and the defined benefit (pension) plan
restoration provisions of the Company's Retirement Benefits Restoration Plan
and any similar plan if such benefit were converted to a life annuity, and (ii)
a sum equal to the annual payments which would be received by your Surviving
Spouse as if your spouse were designated as the beneficiary of your vested
accounts in the Company's Future Service Profit Sharing Trust and the defined
contribution (profit sharing) restoration provisions of the Company's
Retirement Benefits Restoration Plan and any similar plan and such accounts
were converted to a life annuity.  In all cases the amount offset pursuant to
these subsections (i) and (ii) shall be determined prior to the effect of any
payments from the plans and trust referred to therein which are authorized
pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order under ERISA.  No death
benefits are payable except to your Surviving Spouse.

     6.  If you shall have been employed by the Company for two Years or more
and while employed by the Company you become Disabled prior to your attaining
age 65, until the earlier of your death, termination of Disability or attaining
age 65 the Company will pay you an annual benefit equal to 60% of your Total
Compensation less any benefits payable to you pursuant to long-term disability
insurance or other plans the cost of which is paid by the Company.  If your
Disability continues until you attain age 65, you shall be considered retired
and you shall receive retirement benefits pursuant to paragraph 1 above, based
upon your Average Compensation as of the date it is determined you became
Disabled.

     7.  If you die leaving a Surviving Spouse while receiving Disability
benefits pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Agreement, notwithstanding paragraph 4
you will be deemed to have retired on your death and your Surviving Spouse
shall receive for life 75% of the annual benefit which would have been payable
to you if you had retired on the date of your death and your benefit determined
pursuant to paragraph 1, based upon your Average Compensation as of your
becoming Disabled.

     8.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, the maximum
retirement, disability and death benefits payable to you and your spouse
pursuant to this Agreement for any year shall in no event exceed the higher of
(A) $500,000 less those sums to be deducted from benefits pursuant to clauses
(i),  (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 1, clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph
<PAGE>   5

                                           Page 5              February 28, 1995


5, or under paragraph 6, whichever is applicable, or (B) the Plan Limitation
for the year in which such benefits were first paid, less the aggregate annual
benefit with respect to the Company's Retirement Benefits Restoration Plan (and
any future non-qualified retirement plan) to be deducted (x) under clauses (i)
and (ii) of paragraph 1, (y) under paragraph 5 should you die while employed
prior to attaining age 65 or (z) under paragraph 6 should you become disabled
prior to attaining age 65.

     9.  If you are eligible to receive benefits hereunder, unless otherwise
specifically agreed by the Company in writing, you will not be able to receive
benefits under any other Company sponsored non-qualified retirement plans other
than the Company's Retirement Benefits Restoration Plan.

     10. We also agree upon the following:

         a.   The Compensation Committee of the company's Board of
     Directors, or any other committee however titled which shall be vested
     with authority with respect to the compensation of the company's
     officers and executives, shall have the exclusive authority to make
     all determinations which may be necessary in connection with this
     Agreement including the date of and whether you are Disabled, the
     amount of annual benefits payable to you by reason of employment by
     other employers, the interpretation of this Agreement, and all other
     matters or disputes arising under this Agreement.  The determinations
     and findings of the Compensation Committee or such other committee of
     the company's Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding,
     without appeal, upon both of us.

         b.   You will not during your employment or Disability, and
     after Retirement or the termination of your employment, for any reason
     disclose or make use of for your own or another person's benefit under
     any circumstances any of the Company's Proprietary Information.
     Proprietary Information shall include trade secrets, secret processes,
     information concerning products, developments, manufacturing
     techniques, new product or marketing plans, inventions, research and
     development information or results, sales, pricing and financial data,
     information relating to the management, operations or planning of the
     Company and any other information treated as confidential or
     proprietary.

         c.   If your employment by the Company shall terminate for any
     reason whatsoever prior to your Retirement other than by reason of
     your death or Disability, for a period of two years after the
     termination of your employment, and if your employment shall be
     terminated by reason of Retirement or any Disability during such time
     as you shall receive retirement or disability benefits pursuant to
     this 

<PAGE>   6
                                           Page 6              February 28, 1995



     Agreement, you agree that you will not directly or indirectly
     engage in any business activities, whether as a consultant, advisor or
     otherwise, in which the Company is engaged in any geographic area in
     which the products or services of the Company have been sold,
     distributed or provided during the five year period prior to the date
     of termination of employment or Retirement.

     In addition to the foregoing and provided no "Change in Control" has
     occurred, if while you are receiving retirement or other benefits
     pursuant to this Agreement, in the judgment of the committee you
     directly or indirectly engage in activity or act in a manner which can
     be considered adverse to the interest of the Company or any of its
     direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliated companies, the committee
     may terminate your rights to any further benefits hereunder.

         d.   Except as may be provided to the contrary in a duly
     authorized written agreement between yourself and the Company you
     acknowledge that the Company has made no commitments to you of any
     kind with respect to the continuation of your employment, which we
     expressly agree is an employment at will, and you or the Company shall
     have the unrestricted right to terminate your employment with or
     without cause, at any time in your or its discretion.

         e.   At the Company's request, expressed through a Company
     officer, you agree to provide such information with respect to matters
     which may arise in connection with this Agreement as may be deemed
     necessary by the Company or the Compensation or other committee,
     including for example only and not in limitation, information
     concerning benefits payable to you from third parties, and you further
     agree to submit to such medical examinations by duly licensed
     physicians as may be requested by the Company or such committee from
     time to time.  You also agree to direct third parties to provide such
     information, and your Surviving Spouse's cooperation in providing such
     information is a condition to the receipt of survivor's benefits under
     this Agreement.

         f.   To the extent permitted by law, no interest in this
     Agreement or benefits payable to you or to your Surviving Spouse shall
     be subject to anticipation, or to pledge, assignment, sale or transfer
     in any manner nor shall you or your Surviving Spouse have the power in
     any manner to charge or encumber such interest or benefits, nor shall
     such interest or benefits be liable or subject in any manner for the
     liabilities of you or your Surviving Spouse's debts, contracts, torts
     or other engagements of any kind.

         g.   No person other than you and your Surviving Spouse shall
     have any rights or property interest of any kind whatsoever pursuant
     to this Agreement, and neither you nor your Surviving Spouse shall
     have any rights hereunder other than those expressly provided in this
     Agreement.  Upon the death of you and your Surviving Spouse no further
     benefits of whatsoever kind or nature shall accrue or be payable
     pursuant to this Agreement.

         h.   All benefits payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
     paid in installments of one-twelfth of the annual benefit, or at such
     shorter intervals as may be deemed advisable by the Company in its
     discretion, upon receipt of your or your Surviving Spouse's written
     application, or by the applicant's personal representative in the
     event of disability.

         i.   All benefits under this Agreement shall be payable from
     the Company's general assets, which assets are subject to the claims
     of general creditors, and are not set aside for your or your Surviving
     Spouse's benefit.

         j.   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
     of Michigan.

     11. We have agreed that the determinations of the committee described in
paragraph 10a shall be conclusive as provided in such paragraph, but if for any
reason a claim is asserted which subverts the provisions of paragraph 10a, we
agree that, except for causes of action which may arise under paragraph 10b and
the first paragraph of paragraph 10c, arbitration shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy to resolve all disputes, claims or controversies which could
be the subject of litigation (hereafter referred to as "dispute") involving or
arising out of this Agreement.  It is our mutual intention that the arbitration
award will be final and binding and that a judgment on the award may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction and enforcement may be had according to
its terms.

     The arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association and the expenses of
the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute.  The
place of the arbitration shall be the principal offices of the American
Arbitration Association in the metropolitan Detroit area.

     The arbitrator's sole authority shall be to apply the clauses of this
Agreement.

     We agree that the provisions of this paragraph 11, and the decision of the
arbitrator with respect to any dispute, with only the exception provided in
this paragraph 11, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any alleged cause
of action in any manner based upon or arising out of this Agreement.  Subject
to the foregoing exception, we acknowledge that since arbitration is the
exclusive remedy, neither of us or any party claiming under this Agreement has
the right to resort to any federal, state or local court or administrative
agency concerning any matters dealt with by this Agreement and that the
decision of the arbitrator shall be a complete defense to any action or
proceeding instituted in any tribunal or agency with respect to any dispute.
The arbitration provisions contained in this paragraph shall survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement, and shall be binding on our
respective successors, personal representatives and any other party asserting a
claim based upon this Agreement.

     We further agree that any demand for arbitration must be made within one
year of the time any claim accrues which you or any person claiming hereunder
may have against the Company;  unless demand is made within such period it is
forever barred.

     We are pleased to be able to make this supplemental plan available to you.
Please examine the terms of this Agreement carefully and at your earliest
convenience indicate your assent to all of its terms and conditions by signing
and dating where provided below and returning a signed copy to me.

                                           Sincerely,

                                           TRIMAS CORPORATION

                          TRIMAS CORPORATION RETIREMENT
                            BENEFIT RESTORATION PLAN






                                    SECTION l
                                ADOPTION OF PLAN



          1.1   Adoption.  TriMas Corporation (TriMas) hereby adopts the TriMas
Corporation Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan (Plan), effective January 1,
1995 (Effective Date).

          1.2   Purpose.  The sole purpose of the Plan is to provide benefits
to a select group of management or highly compensated employees that would be
provided to such employees who terminate employment or retire after the
Effective Date under certain retirement plans of TriMas Corporation and its
subsidiaries, which plans are set forth in Appendix "A" hereto and are qualified
plans under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(Code) (the "Qualified Plans"), but for the benefit limitations of the Code, in
order to encourage the continued employment and diligent service of such
employees with TriMas following the Effective Date.  Accordingly (by way of
example and not limitation), in no event shall the provisions of the Plan be
construed to benefit any employee whose termination of employment occurred prior
to the Effective Date.

          1.3   Construction.  The Plan shall be construed in accordance with
Michigan law, except where preempted by federal law.  It is intended that the
Plan shall be unfunded and maintained by TriMas primarily for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees, so that the Plan is exempt from the requirements of Parts
2, 3 and 4 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA).  All provisions of the Plan shall be interpreted in accordance with
such intentions.

                                    SECTION 2
                                    COVERAGE 



          2.1   Covered Employees.  The coverage of the Plan shall be limited
to highly-compensated or management employees of TriMas and of those
subsidiaries of TriMas the Qualified Plans of which are listed in Appendix "A",
who (a) receive from TriMas or the subsidiary of TriMas which is the employer of
such person compensation otherwise eligible for coverage under the terms of such
Qualified Plan for any calendar year which compensation exceeds $150,000 or such
other adjusted limit as provided by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, or (b) whose
benefits or contributions under the Qualified Plans are reduced due to the
application of Section 415 of the Code.

          2.2   Commencement and Cessation of Coverage.  An employee shall be
covered under the Plan commencing on the later of (a) the Effective Date or (b)
the earlier of the date that his plan-eligible compensation described in Section
2.1 first exceeds the annual limitation amount described in Section 2.1 or the
date his benefits or contributions under the Qualified Plans are first reduced
by the application of Code Section 415.  An employee shall cease to be covered
by the Plan on his date of termination of employment from TriMas and its
subsidiaries.  If prior to such termination an employee ceases to qualify for
coverage under the Plan due to some other event (by way of examples and not as
limitation, a decrease in Plan-eligible compensation or the commencement of
employment with a TriMas subsidiary which has no Qualified Plan or has
discontinued its Qualified Plan), his coverage under the Plan shall cease as of
the time such disqualifying event occurs and only the benefits accrued hereunder
up to such time shall be payable from this Plan.

                                    SECTION 3
                                    BENEFITS



          3.1   Amount.  Subject to Section 3.3 hereof, a covered employee
shall be entitled to either or both, as applicable, the supplemental retirement
benefits described below:

                (a) An annual amount equal to the benefit which would have been
          payable to the employee under any defined benefit (pension) Qualified
          Plan in which he is a participant ("Qualified Pension Plan") but for
          any benefit limitations imposed by the Code on the computation of
          such benefit, reduced (but not below zero) by

                (b) any benefits which the employee is eligible to receive,
          prior to the giving effect to any qualified domestic relations order,
          under any such Qualified Pension Plan,

each benefit being expressed for this purpose in the normal form of payment
under said Qualified Pension Plan, plus

                (c) A single lump sum payment equal to the sum of amounts which
          would have been contributed to the account of the employee as a
          company contribution with respect to periods after December 31, 1993 
          under any defined contribution (profit sharing) Qualified Plan in
          which he is a participant (but in no case including any amounts,
          however characterized, which the employee or the company may have
          contributed to any such plan pursuant to the provisions of Section
          401(k) or 401(m) of the Code) ("Qualified Profit Sharing Plan") but
          for any benefit limitations imposed by the Code on the contribution
          amount, plus

                (d) investment adjustments applied to the contribution amounts
          of Section 3.1(c) which adjustments shall be applied to such accounts
          (i) utilizing the same provisions for calculating the effect of
          investment earnings (or losses) as prevail under the terms of any
          such Qualified Profit Sharing Plan and (ii) utilizing the amount of
          investment earnings (or loss) as is experienced in a given year in
          the TriMas Master Profit Sharing Trust or other investment vehicle in
          which the 

                                        3
<PAGE>
          assets of any such Qualified Profit Sharing Plan are invested (and in
          no case applying any adjustments for forfeitures of any kind) reduced
          (but not below zero) by

                (e) the covered employee's account balance attributable to
          company profit sharing contributions made with respect to periods
          after December 31, 1993 which the employee is eligible to receive,
          prior to the giving effect to any qualified domestic relations order,
          under any such Qualified Profit Sharing Plan,

provided, however, that any lump sum payment made pursuant to this Plan shall
have no adjustment the purpose of which is to make such payment equivalent after
the effect of any taxes which may have to be paid by the employee because such
lump sum payments from this Plan are taxable when received as ordinary income
and may not be eligible for rollover or other tax-advantaged treatment under the
Code.
 
          3.2   Timing and Form of Payments. (a) Retirement benefit payments
hereunder which are supplemental to a Qualified Pension Plan shall be made at
the same time as benefit payments are made from the Qualified Pension Plan and
shall be payable (i) for an employee who is unmarried at the time payments
commence, in the form of a single life annuity, or (ii) for any employee who is
married when payments commence, in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity
with the employee's spouse, unless, in either case, the employee validly elects
another form of payment for benefits under the Qualified Pension Plan, in which
case the supplemental retirement benefit hereunder shall be paid in the same
form as benefits are paid under the Qualified Pension Plan, computed using the
same formulas and actuarial factors as set forth for the determination of
optional forms of benefits under such plan;  for purposes of this Section
3.2(a), an employee's marital status and spouse shall be determined in
accordance with the Qualified Pension Plan.

          (b)  Retirement benefit payments hereunder which are supplemental to
a Qualified Profit Sharing Plan shall be payable in a lump sum and shall be made
at the time and to the same person as the lump sum payment is made from the
Qualified Profit Sharing Plan.

          3.3   Forfeitability.  Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be
conditioned upon receipt of benefit payments from the respective Qualified Plans
and shall be vested in the same manner and to the same extent as benefits under
such Qualified Plans.

                                        4
<PAGE>

          3.4  No Payment During Employment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
periodic payments computed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.1 of this
Plan shall be made during such time as any person both receives payments from
any Qualified Plan and is employed by TriMas or any affiliated company, and no
lump sum payment computed under paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of Section 3.1 of
this Plan shall be made until after the covered employee's termination of
employment. 

                                        5

                                    SECTION 4
                                COST OF BENEFITS



          4.1   Current Expense.  The entire cost of providing benefits under
the Plan, including the costs of the Plan Administrator, shall be paid by TriMas
out of its current operating budget, and TriMas's obligations under the Plan
shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay.  TriMas shall not be
obligated under any circumstances to separately fund its obligations under the
Plan.

          4.2   Option to Fund Informally.  Notwithstanding Section 4.1, TriMas
may, at its sole option, or by agreement, informally fund its obligations under
the Plan in whole or in part, provided, however, in no event shall such informal
funding be construed to create any trust fund, escrow account or other security
for an employee with respect to the payment of benefits under the Plan, other
than as permitted under Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor rules
and regulations for unfunded supplemental retirement plans.  Furthermore, if
TriMas decides to informally fund the Plan, in whole or in part, by procuring,
as owner, life insurance for its own benefit on the lives of employees, the form
of such insurance and the amounts thereof shall be the sole decision of TriMas,
and in no event shall an employee have any incidents of ownership in any such
policies of insurance.

          4.3   Physical Examinations.  If a physical examination is required
for TriMas to obtain insurance for covered employees under Section 4.2, each
employee agrees to undergo such physical examinations as may be required by the
insurance carrier.  Such physical examinations shall be conducted by a physician
approved by TriMas, at the expense of TriMas.

          4.4   No Employee Contributions or Loans.  No loans or hardship
distributions or contributions by employees are permitted or required under the
Plan.

                                    SECTION 5
                                 ADMINISTRATION



          5.1   Plan Administrator and Named Fiduciary.  The Plan Administrator
and Named Fiduciary of the Plan for purposes of ERISA shall be TriMas
Corporation whose business address is 315 East Eisenhower Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI
48108, and whose telephone number is (313) 747-7025.  TriMas shall have the
right to change the Plan Administrator and Named Fiduciary of the Plan at any
time, and to change the address and telephone number of the same.  TriMas shall
give each covered employee written notice of any such change in the Plan
Administrator and Named Fiduciary, or in the address or telephone number of the
same.

          5.2   Claims Procedure.  The Plan Administrator has the power to
interpret all provisions of the Plan and make final determinations concerning
the meaning of the Plan and the right of any person to benefits under the Plan. 

          Each covered employee, or other person claiming through the employee,
must file a written claim for benefits with the Plan Administrator as a
prerequisite to the payment of benefits under the Plan.  Any denial by the Plan
Administrator of a claim for benefits under the Plan by an employee or other
person (collectively referred to as "claimant") shall be stated in writing by
the Plan Administrator and delivered or mailed to the claimant within 90 days
after receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of
time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time is required,
written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the
termination of the initial 90-day period.  In no event shall such extension
exceed a period of 90 days from the end of the initial period.  

          Any notice of denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the
denial, specific reference to pertinent provisions of the Plan upon which the
denial is based, a description of any additional material or information
necessary for the claimant to perfect his claim, with an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary, and any explanation of claim review
procedures under the Plan, written to the best of the Plan Administrator's
ability in a manner that may be understood without legal or actuarial counsel. 

                                        7
<PAGE>

          A claimant whose claim for benefits has been wholly or partially
denied by the Plan Administrator may request, within 90 days following the date
of such denial, in a writing addressed to the Plan Administrator, a review of
such denial.  The claimant shall be entitled to submit such issues or comments
in writing or otherwise, as he shall consider relevant to a determination of his
claim, and may include a request for a hearing in person before the Plan
Administrator.  Prior to submitting his request, the claimant shall be entitled
to review such documents as the Plan Administrator shall agree are pertinent to
his claim.  The claimant may, at all stages of review, be represented by
counsel, legal or otherwise, of his choice, provided that the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be borne by the claimant.  

          All requests for review shall be promptly resolved.  The Plan
Administrator's decision with respect to any such review shall be set forth in
writing and shall be mailed to the claimant not later than 60 days following
receipt by the Plan Administrator of the claimant's request unless special
circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require an extension of time
for processing, in which case the Plan Administrator's decision shall be so
mailed not later than 120 days after receipt of such request.

          5.3   Arbitration.  Exhaustion of the claim and claim review
procedures of Section 5.2 is prerequisite to any further consideration of a
claim.  In the event that any claim remains fully or partially unresolved after
exhaustion of the claim and claim review procedures of Section 5.2, any
remaining dispute shall, within 30 days of the date of the Plan Administrator's
final decision on review, be submitted to arbitration, which shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy.  The arbitration decision shall be final and binding on
the Plan, TriMas, the claimant, and any other party involved.  All claims shall
be arbitrated in Taylor, Michigan.  The arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance
with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect, and the expense of the arbitration shall be shared
equally by TriMas and the claimant.  Any claim shall be deemed waived unless
presented within the time limits specified in Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3. 
The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to change, add to or
subtract from any of the provisions of the Plan.  The arbitrator's sole
authority shall be to interpret or apply the provisions of the Plan.  Because
arbitration is the exclusive remedy with respect to any claim hereunder, neither
TriMas, the claimant nor any other party has the right to resort to any federal,
state or local court or administrative agency concerning any claim, 

                                        8
<PAGE>

and the decision of the arbitrator shall be a complete defense to any suit,
action or proceeding instituted in any federal, state or local court or before
any administrative agency with respect to any dispute which is arbitrable as
herein set forth.  The arbitration provisions hereof shall, with respect to any
claim, survive the termination of the Plan.




                                    SECTION 6
                     LIMITATION OF COVERED EMPLOYEE'S RIGHTS



          6.1   No Contract of Employment.  The Plan shall not be deemed to
create a contract of employment between TriMas or any TriMas subsidiary and any
covered employee and shall create no right in any covered employee to continue
in the employ of TriMas or any of its subsidiaries for any specific period of
time, or to create any other rights in any covered employee or obligations on
the part of TriMas, except as are set forth explicitly herein or in a written
employment contract.  In consideration of his coverage hereunder each covered
employee shall be deemed to have agreed that TriMas has the right to terminate
him at any time, with or without cause, and nothing in the Plan shall restrict
the right of any covered employee to terminate his employment.

          6.2   Unsecured Creditor.  The rights of any employee or any person
claiming through the employee under the Plan shall be solely those of an
unsecured general creditor of TriMas.  Any employee, or any person claiming
through the employee, shall only have the right to receive from TriMas those
payments as specified herein.  Each covered employee agrees that he or any
person claiming through him shall have no rights or interests in any asset of
TriMas, including any insurance policies or contracts which TriMas may possess
to informally fund the Plan.

          6.3   No Trust.  No asset used or acquired by TriMas in connection
with the liabilities it has assumed under the Plan shall be deemed to be held
under any trust for the benefit of any employee nor shall any such asset be
considered security for the performance of the obligations of TriMas, but shall
be, and remain, a general unpledged and unrestricted asset of TriMas, except as
may be provided by separate agreement and as permitted under Internal Revenue
Service and Department of Labor rules and regulations for unfunded supplemental
retirement plans.

                                    SECTION 7
                            AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION



          7.1   Right to Amend or Terminate Plan.  TriMas reserves the right to
amend the Plan in any manner deemed appropriate by TriMas's Board of Directors,
and TriMas reserves the right to terminate the Plan for any reason and at any
time in whole or part by action of the Board of Directors.

          7.2   Limitations.  Notwithstanding Section 7.1, no such amendment or
termination shall reduce or otherwise affect the benefits payable to or on
behalf of any covered employee that have accrued prior to such amendment or
termination without the written consent of the employee (or beneficiary, if
applicable).  In addition, the complete or partial termination of this Plan,
should it occur or be deemed by facts and circumstances to have occurred, shall
have the same effect on the vesting of benefits accrued to date under this Plan
as in the case of a complete or partial termination of a Qualified Plan.

          7.3  Payment of Benefits Upon Termination.  Upon termination or
partial termination of the Plan TriMas may elect the method by which benefits
accrued through the date of such termination or partial termination shall be
provided.  Such election may include the payment of the present value of all
such accrued benefits directly to covered employees (or beneficiaries, if
applicable) or any other method of payment or funding which TriMas may, in its
sole discretion, determine.

                                    SECTION 8
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



          8.1   Independence of Benefits.  Except as otherwise provided herein
or pursuant to the terms of any separate agreement with an employee, the
benefits payable under the Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any
other benefits or compensation, whether by salary, or bonus or otherwise,
payable under any employment agreements that now exist or may hereafter exist
from time to time between TriMas and any employee.  The Plan does not involve a
reduction in salary or foregoing of an increase in future salary by any
employee, nor does the Plan in any way affect or reduce the existing and future
compensation and other benefits of any employee.

          8.2   Nonalienation of Benefits.  Except insofar as this provision
may be contrary to applicable law (such as an order of divorce or separation),
no sale, transfer, alienation, assignment, pledge, collateralization, or
attachment of any benefits under the Plan shall be valid or recognized by
TriMas.

          8.3   Payments for the Benefit of Employee.  In the event that TriMas
shall find that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is unable
to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, is otherwise mentally or
physically incompetent, or is unable to give a valid receipt, TriMas may cause
the payments becoming due to such person to be paid to another individual for
such person's benefit, without responsibility on the part of TriMas to follow
application of such payment.  Any such payment shall be a payment on account of
such person and shall operate as a complete discharge of TriMas from all
liability under the Plan.

          8.4   Use of Words.  Wherever any words are used in the Plan in the
masculine gender, they shall be construed as though they also were used in the
feminine gender in all cases where they would so apply, and wherever any words
are used in the Plan in the singular forms they shall be construed as though
