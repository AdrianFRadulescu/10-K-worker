                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
     TriMas Corporation is a diversified proprietary products company with
leadership positions in commercial, industrial and consumer niche markets.
TriMas Corporation's operations are conducted through sixteen operating
businesses principally manufacturing industrial container closures, pressurized
gas cylinders, specialty industrial gaskets, towing systems products, specialty
fasteners, specialty products for fiberglass insulation, specialty tapes and
precision cutting tools. TriMas Corporation's businesses are managed as
decentralized autonomous profit centers which emphasize entrepreneurial
management, high value-added products and services and strong cash flows.
 
     TriMas Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
in 1986 as Campbell Industries, Inc., and, in October, 1988, adopted the name
TriMas Corporation in connection with the transactions described below.
Immediately prior to such transactions, the Company was principally a
manufacturer of industrial fasteners as a result of an acquisition in December,
1986. Except as the context otherwise indicates, the terms "TriMas" and the
"Company" refer to TriMas Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
     Effective October 1, 1988, the Company acquired various businesses and cash
from MascoTech, Inc. ("MascoTech") in exchange for securities of the Company. In
a related transaction, Masco Corporation ("Masco"), which prior to the above
described acquisition had an equity ownership interest in the Company, acquired
additional shares of Company Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), in exchange for cash. The Company became a public
corporation in February, 1989 when approximately 28 percent of the then
outstanding Company Common Stock was distributed by Masco to its stockholders as
a special dividend. MascoTech currently holds approximately 41 percent of
Company Common Stock and Masco currently holds approximately 5 percent of
Company Common Stock.
 
     In January, 1990, the Company acquired three businesses from Masco which
are engaged in the manufacture of trailer hitches, tow bars and accessories,
winches, jacks and couplers as well as flame-retardant facings and jacketings
and pressure-sensitive tapes used in conjunction with insulation products. In
June, 1990, the Company acquired the operating assets and business of Draw-Tite,
Inc. Draw-Tite is engaged in the manufacture and sale of trailer hitches and
other related towing systems products. In October, 1991, the Company acquired
all of the capital stock of Monogram Aerospace Fasteners, Inc., a manufacturer
of highly engineered specialty fasteners for the domestic and international
aerospace industry. In November, 1993, the Company acquired from MascoTech all
of the capital stock of Lamons Metal Gasket Co., a manufacturer and distributor
of specialty industrial gaskets.
 
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     While each of the Company's businesses operates as an autonomous entity,
they are grouped into four distinct categories for financial reporting purposes:
Specialty Fasteners, Towing Systems, Specialty Container

SPECIALTY FASTENERS
 
     Lake Erie Screw Corporation, Eskay Screw Corporation, Monogram Aerospace
Fasteners, Inc. and Commonwealth Industries form the Company's Specialty
Fasteners segment. Lake Erie and Eskay are manufacturers of both standard and
custom-designed ferrous, nonferrous and special alloy fasteners sold to
commercial and industrial markets. Monogram Fasteners manufactures permanent
blind bolt and temporary fasteners used in aircraft construction and assembly.
Commonwealth provides specialized metallurgical services for fastener products
used in a variety of markets.
 
     Lake Erie specializes in manufacturing both standard and custom-designed
large diameter fasteners, generally in sizes  1/4" to 1 1/4". Lake Erie's design
and engineering capabilities enable the company to formulate fastener product
programs to meet demanding metallurgical and performance specifications for a
wide variety of customers. With this emphasis on design and engineering, coupled
with its ability to offer just-in-time delivery, the Company believes that Lake
Erie has established a premier reputation in the industry for product quality
and service. Lake Erie products are sold to distributors and manufacturers in
the agricultural, transportation, construction, fabricated metal products, and
commercial and industrial maintenance markets. Lake Erie is a leading
manufacturer of private brand products for the equipment maintenance
aftermarket, supplying national and regional private brand distributor
organizations.
 
     Eskay manufactures both ferrous and nonferrous standard and
specialty-designed small diameter fasteners, generally in sizes  3/8" and
smaller. Eskay's strategy is to focus on niche markets which require high
value-added products for critical applications. Eskay's ES-Form(R) and
ES-Form(R)II, Plask(R)I and Plask(R)II, Plask H/L(R), and Tri-Plask(R)
self-threading specialty fasteners, for example, are designed for use in
applications where the absence of drilling chip contamination is critical. A
typical application would be electronic or electrical assemblies installed
within metallic or plastic housings and requiring no chip contamination to
qualify for UL or other certification. Eskay products are marketed directly to
distributors and manufacturers in the electrical and electronic equipment,
appliance, fabricated metal products, furniture, transportation and agricultural
markets.
 
     Monogram Fasteners manufactures highly engineered specialty fasteners for
the domestic and international aerospace industry. Monogram Fasteners is the
leader in the development of blind bolt fastener technology for the aerospace
industry. Its Visu-Lok(R), Visu-Lok(R)II and Radial-Lok(TM) blind bolts, which
allow sections of aircraft to be joined together when access is provided to only
one side of the airframe, are lighter in weight and provide certain cost
efficiencies over conventional two-sided fastening devices. Monogram Fasteners'
Composi-Lok(R) and Composi-Lok(R)II blind bolts are designed to solve unique
fastening problems associated with the assembly of composite aircraft
structures, and are therefore particularly well suited to take advantage of the
increasing use of composite materials in aircraft construction.
 
     Commonwealth Industries provides commercial heat treating and specialized
metallurgical and finishing services for fastener products used in the
automotive, industrial, agricultural and construction markets.
 
     The Company's fasteners are sold through its own sales personnel and
independent sales representatives. Although the overall market for fasteners and
metallurgical services is highly competitive, these businesses primarily provide
products and services for specialized market niches, and principally compete as
quality and service oriented suppliers in their respective market segments.
 
TOWING SYSTEMS
 
     The Towing Systems segment comprises Draw-Tite, Inc., Reese Products, Inc.
and Fulton Performance Products, Inc. These three companies are leading
producers of vehicle hitches, jacks, winches, couplers and related accessories.
Draw-Tite, Reese and Fulton give TriMas the leading position in the design and
manufacture of towing systems products for domestic and imported passenger cars,
light trucks and recreational vehicles. The Company believes that product lines
offered by its Towing Systems companies are the most extensive in the industry,
permitting TriMas to provide custom-designed products for virtually every towing
vehicle and need.
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   6
 
     Each company conducts extensive testing of its products to assure reliable
and safe performance. Engineering, product design and fatigue testing are
performed utilizing computer aided design and finite element analysis. In
addition, on-road performance research is conducted on hitches with
instrumentation equipped trailers and towing vehicles. Extensive product testing
programs have improved product safety and reliability and reduced manufacturing
costs.
 
     The Company believes that Draw-Tite is the largest North American
manufacturer and distributor of premium towing systems products, including
hitches and towing accessories, such as hitch balls, sway controls, wiring
harnesses and brake controls. Draw-Tite has two manufacturing facilities and
seven regional distribution centers in the United States, as well as a sales and
distribution center in Canada. Draw-Tite sales are principally to independent
installers through its own sales organization. Rapid delivery and customer
service are emphasized, with most Draw-Tite orders shipped within twenty-four
hours of receipt.
 
     Reese manufactures premium towing systems products, including
weight-distributing hitches and towing accessories, which are sold to
independent installers, distributors, recreational vehicle manufacturers and
automotive aftermarket retailers. Sales in the United States are made by both
Reese sales personnel and independent sales representatives and are distributed
from five regional distribution centers. Reese also manufactures and distributes
hitches and towing accessories in Canada and Australia, and the Company believes
that Reese is the largest manufacturer of such products in Australia.
 
     Fulton is a major manufacturer of winches, jacks, couplers and accessories
for marine, recreational vehicle, agricultural and industrial markets. These
products are sold by Fulton marketing personnel to distributors, manufacturers
and aftermarket retailers.
 
     Sales by companies which form the Towing Systems segment are stronger
during the spring and summer of the year impacting the Company's net sales and
operating profits primarily in the second quarter.
 
SPECIALTY CONTAINER PRODUCTS
 
     The Company's Specialty Container Products segment consists of Rieke
Corporation, Norris Cylinder Company and Lamons Metal Gasket Co., leading
suppliers of products for the containment and dispensing of fluids and gases for
the chemical, agricultural, refining, food, petrochemical, health care and other
industries.
 
     The Company believes that Rieke is the largest manufacturer in North
America of steel and plastic industrial container closures and dispensing
products. Rieke's manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, as well as distribution capabilities in Europe and
the Far East, allow Rieke to service most major world markets for its products.
Industrial container closures are manufactured using metal forming and plastic
injection molding technologies, supplemented by automated material handling
systems.
 
     Rieke believes its investment in new product development and manufacturing
programs has enabled it to develop and produce precise quality, high performance
products while maintaining cost-efficient production capabilities. For more than
seventy-five years, Rieke's new product development programs have provided
innovative and attractive proprietary product opportunities, which have been an
integral part of its success. Among these products are the ViseGrip(R) steel
flange and plug closure, the Poly-ViseGrip(R) plastic closure, the all plastic,
environmentally safe, self-venting FlexSpout(R) flexible pouring spout and the
ViseGrip drum closure.
 
     Rieke sells its products through its own sales personnel primarily to
industrial container manufacturers who also utilize Rieke's specialty tooling to
install the closures. A significant portion of Rieke's products are specified by
end-users of industrial containers. Rieke believes it has been successful in
having end-users specify its products because of Rieke's history of new product
development, its product quality and performance characteristics and its
customer service standards.
 
     Norris is one of the world's leading suppliers of a complete line of large
and intermediate size, high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders for the
transportation, storage and dispensing of compressed gases. Norris is one of two
United States manufacturers of large high-pressure seamless compressed gas

principally for shipping, storing and dispensing oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium
and other gases for industrial and health care markets. In addition, Norris
offers a complete line of low-pressure welded cylinders used to contain and
dispense acetylene gas for the welding and cutting industries. The Company
believes that Norris is the largest United States manufacturer of large and
intermediate size high-pressure cylinders and is a major source of acetylene
cylinders.
 
     The Company believes that Norris is the leading product innovator in its
industry. Among Norris' product developments are the Ultrapure(R) seamless
stainless steel cylinder for the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries,
the Pacesetter cylinder, which was the first asbestos-free acetylene cylinder
available to satisfy increasing concerns about asbestos in the workplace
environment, and the Ultralight high-pressure cylinder designed to hold 30
percent more gas than standard cylinders of similar size, weight and diameter.
In addition, Norris has directed a portion of its research and new product
development efforts to specially-designed cylinders for natural gas powered
vehicles and related refueling facilities.
 
     Norris markets cylinders primarily to major industrial gas producers and
distributors, welding equipment distributors and equipment manufacturers.
Cylinder products are sold by Norris personnel organized in five geographic
sales regions. Sales for export markets and to national accounts are made by
personnel at Norris' corporate office.
 
     Lamons manufactures and distributes metallic and nonmetallic industrial
gaskets for refining, petrochemical and other industrial applications
principally in the United States and, through a wholly owned subsidiary, in
Canada. Gaskets are supplied both for original installations and replacement and
maintenance.
 
     The Company believes that Lamons is the largest gasket supplier to the
United States petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. Sales are made
direct from the factory to major customers, through seven company-owned
distribution facilities in major regional markets, or through a large network of
independent distributors. Lamons has maintained its market leadership position
through superior customer service and delivery and high product quality.
 
CORPORATE COMPANIES
 
     The Company has six businesses that compose its Corporate Companies
segment. The largest of these companies is Compac Corporation, believed by the
Company to be the leading manufacturer of flame-retardant facings and jacketings
used in conjunction with fiberglass insulation as temperature and vapor
barriers. These products are principally used for commercial and industrial
construction applications, and are sold to most major manufacturers of
fiberglass insulation.
 
     Compac's product line also includes pressure-sensitive specialty tape
products which are marketed to insulation manufacturers as well as to numerous
other customers. Pressure-sensitive products for the insulation industry are
utilized for sealing pipe jacketing, ducts and fiberglass wrappings to increase
the efficiency and cost effectiveness of heating and cooling installations.
Combined with Compac's facing and jacketing products, pressure-sensitive
specialty tapes enable Compac to offer customers the only complete systems
approach to insulation installation. With important product positions in several
specialty tape markets, Compac is pursuing further opportunities to expand its
presence in the industry. Utilizing existing pressure-sensitive adhesive
technologies, Compac continues to develop new product programs to expand its
pressure-sensitive product positions into subsegments of existing markets,
including the medical supply industry.
 
     The other businesses that constitute the Corporate Companies segment
produce a variety of specialty precision tools such as center drills, cutters,
end mills, reamers, master gears, gages and punches and provide specialty metal
finishing services. Principal markets served by these companies include the
automotive, aerospace, appliance, medical and electronics industries, with such
diverse products as miniature precision cutting tools for orthopedic surgery and
ophthalmic surgical products to high volume industrial cutting tools and master
gages.

GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     Except for the Company's businesses which form the Towing Systems segment,
no material portion of the Company's business is seasonal. No material portion
of the Company's business has special working capital requirements. The Company
does not consider backlog orders to be a material factor in its industry
segments, and no material portion of its business is dependent upon any one
customer or subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at
the election of the federal government. Compliance with federal, state and local
regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to
result in material capital expenditures by the Company or to have a material
effect on the Company's earnings or competitive position. In general, raw
materials required by the Company are obtainable from various sources and in the
quantities desired. Except for Rieke's facilities in Canada and Mexico, Lamons'
Canadian facilities and the Canadian and Australian operations of Reese, all of
the Company's manufacturing operations are in the United States. Approximately
six percent of the Company's net sales for 1995, approximately five percent of
the Company's net sales for 1994 and approximately seven percent of the
Company's net sales for 1993, were attributable to export sales from the United
States. Further financial information concerning the Company's operations in its

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
     During 1995 TriMas achieved record net sales and operating earnings for the
eighth consecutive year as it continued its focus on operating and financial
strategies to improve operating performance and shareholder returns. These
strategies include internal and external programs to strengthen the Company's
competitive positions in key markets, including increased levels of
manufacturing efficiency and customer service, new product development and
market share initiatives, and the acquisition of selected companies which can
enhance future growth and profitability.
 
     The discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the
financial statements and related footnotes to assist in understanding the
Company's results of operations, its financial position, cash flows, capital
structure and other relevant financial information.
 
ANALYSIS OF 1995 OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 1994 OPERATIONS
 
     Record net sales of $553.5 million in 1995 increased 3.4 percent over 1994
net sales of $535.5 million. TriMas' strategic diversification of products and
markets has balanced its operating risk over a broad range of industries,
moderating the cyclical impact of individual markets. As in 1994, the results of
the Company's strategic diversification, including emphasis on niche markets,
manufacturing efficiencies and market share initiatives, played an important
role in 1995's performance.
 
     The Company's gross margin percentage increased to 32.9 percent in 1995, up
from 32.5 percent in 1994. The improvement in 1995's gross margin reflects the
incremental profit impact of increased sales as well as the effects of ongoing
cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency initiatives. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased less than one percent in 1995 compared to
1994, and as a percentage of net sales declined to 15.1 percent, compared to
15.4 percent for 1994.
 
     Consolidated operating profit, after general corporate expense, equaled
$98.7 million during 1995, compared to $91.4 million in 1994, an increase of 8.0
percent, with operating profit margins of 17.8 percent and 17.1 percent in 1995
and 1994, respectively.
 
     A record year was experienced by the Specialty Fasteners segment in both
sales and operating profit as operating profit increased 12.4 percent to $27.3
million, compared to $24.3 million in 1994, while sales of $141.1 million were
1.7 percent higher than 1994 sales of $138.7 million. Higher levels of demand
for aerospace fasteners and from farm equipment and other off-road vehicle
manufacturers were partially offset by softness in demand from the construction
market and from customers for heat treating services. As a result of higher
sales levels and improved operating efficiencies, the segment operating profit
margin increased to 19.3 percent in 1995, compared to 17.5 percent in 1994. In
1995 inventory turnover was 5.0 times as compared to 5.5 times in 1994. Capital
expenditures during the year, primarily for Lake Erie Screw Corporation and
TriMas Fasteners, Inc., were $10.8 million, compared to 1994's $9.1 million.
 
     Record operating profit of the Towing Systems segment increased 21.1
percent to $31.1 million, compared to $25.7 million in 1994. Record segment
sales increased 7.3 percent to $175.0 million, compared to $163.1 million in
1994. Operating performance of the segment was favorably impacted by market
share initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from both 1994 and
1995 capital expenditure programs. The segment's 1995 operating profit margin
equaled 17.8 percent, compared to 15.7 percent in 1994. Inventory turnover
during the year was 3.2 times as compared to 3.1 times in 1994. Capital
expenditures decreased to $4.8 million, compared to $6.7 million in 1994.
 
     Sales of the Specialty Container Products segment equaled $165.7 million in
1995, a 1.1 percent increase compared to $163.9 million in 1994. Segment
operating profit totaled $39.0 million, compared to $39.1 million in the prior
year. The segment's operating profit margin in 1995 was 23.6 percent, compared
to 23.8 percent in 1994. The segment's inventory turnover was 6.3 times in both
1995 and 1994. Capital expenditures for the segment, primarily to further
improve manufacturing efficiencies and service capabilities, were $5.8 million,
compared to $5.4 million in 1994.
 
                                       11
<PAGE>   13
 
     The Corporate Companies segment experienced record sales during 1995 of
$71.8 million, an increase of 2.9 percent compared to $69.8 million in 1994.
Operating profit decreased 14.5 percent to $8.4 million, compared to $9.9
million in 1994. Significant price increases for certain raw materials were the
primary cause of the reduced operating profit. Operating profit margin in 1995
equaled 11.7 percent, compared to 14.1 percent in 1994. In 1995 inventory
turnover was 5.4 times as compared to 5.6 times in 1994. Capital expenditures
during the year decreased to $2.0 million, compared to $3.0 million in 1994.
 
     Primary earnings per common share increased 11.9 percent to $1.51 in 1995
based on 37.0 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding,
compared to $1.35 in 1994. Fully diluted earnings per common share in 1995 were
$1.42 based on 42.1 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding,
compared to $1.28 in 1994, an increase of 10.9 percent.
 
ANALYSIS OF 1994 OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 1993 OPERATIONS
 
     TriMas achieved net sales of $535.5 million in 1994, an increase of 20.8
percent over 1993 net sales of $443.2 million. As in 1993, the results of the
Company's strategic diversification, including emphasis on niche markets,
manufacturing efficiencies and market share initiatives, played an important
role in 1994's sales performance.
 
     The Company's gross margin percentage increased to 32.5 percent in 1994, up
from 32.1 percent in 1993. The improvement in 1994's gross margin reflects the
incremental profit impact of increased sales volumes as well as the effects of
ongoing cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency initiatives. Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 14.5 percent in 1994 compared to
1993, but as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.4 percent, compared to
16.3 percent for 1993.
 
     Consolidated operating profit, after general corporate expense, equaled
$91.4 million during 1994, compared to $70.0 million in 1993, an increase of
30.5 percent, with operating profit margins of 17.1 percent and 15.8 percent in
1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     The Specialty Fasteners segment operating profit increased 26.1 percent to
$24.3 million, compared to $19.3 million in 1993, while sales of $138.7 million
were 13.0 percent higher than 1993 sales of $122.7 million. Higher levels of
economic activity contributed to segment sales increases during 1994, reflected
by increased sales to the heavy-duty truck, distribution and other original
equipment markets. As a result of higher sales levels and improved operating
efficiencies, the segment operating profit margin increased to 17.5 percent in
1994, compared to 15.7 percent in 1993. In 1994 inventory turnover was 5.5 times
as compared to 5.1 times in 1993. Capital expenditures during the year,
primarily for Lake Erie Screw Corporation and TriMas Fasteners, Inc., were $9.1
million, compared to 1993's $9.2 million.
 
     Operating profit of the Towing Systems segment increased 15.8 percent to
$25.7 million, compared to $22.2 million in 1993. Segment sales increased 16.7
percent to $163.1 million, compared to $139.8 million in 1993. Operating
performance of the segment was favorably impacted by higher domestic vehicle
sales, market share initiatives and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from
both 1993 and 1994 capital expenditure programs. The segment's 1994 operating
profit margin equaled 15.7 percent, compared to 15.8 percent in 1993. Inventory
turnover during the year was 3.1 times as compared to 3.0 times in 1993. Capital
expenditures decreased to $6.7 million, compared to $7.9 million in 1993.
 
     In 1994 operating profit of the Specialty Container Products segment
increased 35.5 percent to $39.1 million, compared to $28.8 million in 1993.
Segment sales of $163.9 million were 37.7 percent higher than 1993's $119.0
million. Lamons Metal Gasket Co. was acquired in November 1993 and a full year
of its operations were included in 1994 segment results. The segment's operating
profit margin in 1994 of 23.8 percent was affected by full year acquisition
related expenses at Lamons. Although Lamons' historical operating profit margin
has been lower relative to the combined historical margin of the other two
segment companies, its margins have consistently met or exceeded the high
standards of the Company's acquisition criteria. In 1993 the segment's operating
margin equaled 24.2 percent. The segment's inventory turnover was 6.3 times in
1994, compared to 6.6 times during 1993. Capital expenditures for the segment,
primarily to

further improve manufacturing efficiencies and service capabilities, were $5.4
million, compared to $7.8 million in 1993.
 
     The Corporate Companies segment operating profit increased 38.5 percent to
$9.9 million, compared to $7.1 million in 1993. Segment sales of $69.8 million
increased 13.0 percent, compared to $61.7 million in 1993. The Precision Cutting
Tools group and Compac Corporation both benefited from the generally stronger
economy. Compac Corporation's continued expansion in specialty industrial tape
niche markets and the cost savings associated with the successful consolidation
of two industrial tape manufacturing facilities during the latter part of the
year also contributed to 1994's sales and earnings increases. All of these
factors contributed to the segment's 1994 operating profit margin of 14.1
percent exceeding that achieved in 1993 of 11.5 percent. In 1994 inventory
turnover was 5.6 times as compared to 5.3 times in 1993. Capital expenditures
during the year increased to $3.0 million, compared to $1.3 million in 1993.
 
     Primary earnings per common share increased 28.6 percent to $1.35 in 1994
based on 37.0 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding,
compared to $1.05 and 31.1 million shares and equivalents outstanding in 1993.
The increase in primary shares outstanding was principally the result of the
conversion of the Company's $100 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock in
December 1993. Fully diluted earnings per common share in 1994 were $1.28, based
on 42.1 million average common shares and equivalents outstanding, compared to
$1.01 and 39.1 million shares and equivalents outstanding in 1993. The increase
in fully diluted shares in 1994 was principally the result of the issuance of
the 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003 in August 1993, which are
convertible into 5.1 million common shares.
 
LIQUIDITY, WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH FLOWS
 
     Among the Company's financial strategies are maintaining relatively high
levels of liquidity and cash flow, which continued in 1995. Historically, TriMas
Corporation has generated significant cash flows from operating activities to
fund capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other operating
requirements. Cash flow generation has been enhanced by the Company's continuing
efforts to improve operating efficiencies, cost reductions and the management of
working capital requirements to support increased sales volumes.
 
     One of the Company's strengths is its ability to generate cash from
operations in excess of requirements for capital investments and dividends.
 
     "Free Cash Flow": Free Cash Flow is cash from operations remaining after
the Company has satisfied its capital investment initiatives to enhance
manufacturing efficiencies, expand productive capacity and avail itself of other
competitive opportunities. As one of its financial strategies, the Company
focuses on maximizing Free Cash Flow to achieve management's primary
objective--maximizing long-term shareholder value. The consolidated statements
of cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):

     In 1995 the Company again experienced strong operating cash flows as
operating activities provided $66.3 million. Increased cash flow from income and
noncash charges for depreciation and amortization during 1995 were partially
offset by working capital needs to support 1995's internal sales growth as new
product successes and marketing initiatives contributed to record sales levels
in all four segments. Capital expenditures to reduce
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   15
 
product costs, improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiencies and expand
productive capacity equaled $23.5 million in 1995, $24.3 million in 1994 and
$26.3 million in 1993. During the three year period approximately $18.6 million
of capital expenditures were for capacity expansion in the Specialty Fasteners
segment at the Company's TriMas Fasteners, Inc. facility in Indiana. The Company
continues its active corporate development efforts to complement internal growth
through significant investments for the acquisition of additional companies
which meet TriMas' selective criteria. In 1993 the Company acquired Lamons Metal
Gasket Co. for $60.3 million cash.
 
     In 1995 the Company used a portion of its significant cash resources to
retire $51.5 million of long-term debt. The majority of this amount, $50.0
million, was the repayment of borrowings under the Company's bank revolving
credit agreement which were originally incurred to finance prior acquisitions.
The Company borrowed $60.0 million in 1993 under its bank revolving credit
agreement to finance the acquisition of Lamons. Also in 1993 the Company issued
$115.0 million of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003. The net
proceeds of the offering of $112.0 million, together with $3.0 million of
available cash resources, were used to redeem $115.0 million of borrowings under
the Company's bank revolving credit agreement.
 
     Common stock dividends paid in 1995, 1994 and 1993 equaled $6.6 million,
$5.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. In 1993 the Company paid $12.3
million in preferred stock dividends representing dividends accrued through the
first three quarters of 1993 and the full year 1992.
 
     The Company believes its cash flows from operations, along with its
borrowing capacity and access to financial markets, are adequate to fund its
strategies for future growth, including working capital, expenditures for
manufacturing expansion and efficiencies, market share initiatives, and
corporate development activities.
 
     At December 31, 1995, the Company's current ratio was 4.6 to 1 and working
capital totaled $197.5 million, including $92.4 million of cash and cash
equivalents. At December 31, 1994, the current ratio was 4.5 to 1 and working
capital totaled $198.8 million, including $107.7 million of cash and cash
equivalents.
 
     The Company's working capital turnover was 2.7 times in 1995, compared to
3.0 times in 1994. Excluding cash, the working capital turnover was 5.4 times in
1995 as compared to 5.6 times in 1994. The Company's inventory turned over 4.5
times in 1995, compared to 4.6 times in 1994, while the accounts receivable
days-sales year end balance equaled 52 days in 1995, compared to 51 days in
1994.
 
     The Company has a $350.0 million revolving credit facility, maturing in
2000, with a group of domestic and international banks. The facility permits the
Company to borrow under several different interest rate options. At December 31,
1995, the Company had available credit of $278.0 million under the credit
agreement.
 
     In October 1995 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. The Company will adopt the disclosure requirements of this
Statement in 1996 and it will not have a material effect on its financial
statements.
 
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company maintains an active acquisition program, which has made
important contributions to the Company's growth. During 1993 the Company
acquired Lamons Metal Gasket Co. from MascoTech, Inc. for $60.3 million cash and
the assumption of certain liabilities, plus contingent payments based upon
Lamons achieving specified levels of future earnings.
 
     The Company utilizes well-disciplined criteria in selecting acquisitions,
including the long-term enhancement of its financial strength and shareholder
value.
 
     The initial earnings benefit of acquisitions to the Company is less than
the corresponding increase in sales since earnings are reduced by acquisition
related costs such as interest and added depreciation and amortization.
Generally, the anticipated earnings improvement for the Company comes from
subsequent growth of acquired companies, since future incremental sales are not
burdened with these fixed acquisition costs.

                               TRIMAS CORPORATION
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TriMas
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in prior period
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.
 
ESTIMATES
 
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
AFFILIATES
 
     As of December 31, 1995, MascoTech, Inc.'s common stock ownership in the
Company approximated 41.5 percent, and Masco Corporation's common stock
ownership approximated 5.3 percent. The Company has a corporate services
agreement with Masco Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
pays a fee to Masco Corporation for various corporate support staff,
administrative services, and research and development services. Such fee equals
 .8 percent of the Company's net sales, subject to certain adjustments.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
     The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 1995,
the Company had $79.5 million invested in prime commercial paper of several
United States issuers having the highest rating given by one of the two
principal rating agencies.
 
RECEIVABLES
 
     Receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.5
million and $2.0 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994.
 
INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with
cost determined principally by use of the first-in, first-out method.
 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Property and equipment additions, including significant betterments, are
recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or
loss is included in income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense
as incurred.
 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
     Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual depreciation rates are as
follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 1/2 to 5 percent, and machinery and
equipment, 6 2/3 to 33 1/3 percent. The excess of cost over net assets of
acquired companies is being amortized using the straight-line method over the
periods estimated to be benefited, not exceeding

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

40 years. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, accumulated amortization of the excess
of cost over net assets of acquired companies and other intangible assets was
$31.3 million and $26.8 million. Amortization expense was $5.0 million, $5.3
million and $4.5 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993.
 
     As of each balance sheet date management assesses whether there has been an
impairment in the value of excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies
by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from the related
operating activities with the carrying value. The factors considered by
management in performing this assessment include current operating results,
trends and prospects, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition and other economic factors. Based on this assessment there was no
impairment at December 31, 1995.
 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The carrying values of financial instruments classified in the balance
sheet as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair values. The
fair value of notes receivable, portions of which are classified as both
receivables and other assets, based on discounted cash flows using current
interest rates approximates the carrying value of $12.0 million at December 31,
1995.
 
     The carrying amount of borrowings from banks approximates fair value as the
floating rates applicable to this debt reflect changes in overall market
interest rates. The fair value of the Company's Convertible Subordinated
Debentures, based on quoted market prices, was $112.7 million at both December
31, 1995 and 1994, as compared to the carrying value on such dates of $115.0
million.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
     The Company has not provided for taxes on $15.5 million of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 1995, because such earnings are
generally considered permanently reinvested.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
     Net assets of the Company's operations outside of the United States are
translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates with the effects of
translation adjustments deferred and included as a separate component of
shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates
of exchange during the period.
 
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
 
     Primary earnings per common share in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were calculated on
the basis of 37.0 million, 37.0 million and 31.1 million weighted average common
and common equivalent shares outstanding. Fully diluted earnings per common
share in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were calculated on the basis of 42.1 million, 42.1
million and 39.1 million weighted average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding.
 
NOTE 2. ACQUISITION
 
     During 1993 the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Lamons Metal
Gasket Co. ("Lamons") from MascoTech, Inc. for $60.3 million cash and the
assumption of certain liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The excess of cost over net assets acquired of approximately $46.6
million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. Additional
purchase price amounts, contingent upon the achievement of specified levels of
future profitability by Lamons, may be payable to MascoTech, Inc. beginning in
1997. These payments, if required, will be recorded as additional excess of cost
over net assets of acquired businesses.

     Borrowings from banks are owing under the Company's $350.0 million
revolving credit facility, maturing in 2000, with a group of domestic and
international banks. During 1995 the Company repaid $50.0 million of these
borrowings which were originally incurred to finance prior acquisitions. The
facility permits the Company to borrow under several different interest rate
options. At December 31, 1995, the blended interest rate on these borrowings
equaled 6.1 percent. The facility contains certain restrictive covenants, the
most restrictive of which, at December 31, 1995, required $239.4 million of
shareholders' equity. The Company had available credit of $278.0 million under
its revolving credit facility at December 31, 1995.
 
     The 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures are convertible into Company
common stock at $22 5/8 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events. The
Debentures are redeemable, at a premium, at the Company's option after August 1,
1996.

     Contributions to profit-sharing and other defined contribution plans are
generally determined as a percentage of the covered employee's annual salary.
 
     Defined benefit plans provide retirement benefits for salaried employees
based primarily on years of service and average earnings for the five highest
consecutive years of compensation. Defined benefit plans covering hourly
employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.
These plans are funded based on an actuarial evaluation and review of the
assets, liabilities and requirements of each plan. Plan assets are held by a
trustee and invested principally in cash equivalents and marketable equity and
fixed income instruments.
 
     Net periodic pension cost of defined benefit plans includes the following

     The Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
for certain eligible retired employees under unfunded plans. Some of the plans
have cost-sharing provisions. Net periodic postretirement benefit costs during
1995, 1994 and 1993 were $.8 million, $.8 million and $1.0 million.
 
     The aggregate accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of these
unfunded plans was $7.1 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994.
The discount rates used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations and the net periodic postretirement benefit costs were 7.3 percent,
8.5 percent and 7.0 percent in 1995, 1994 and 1993. The assumed health care cost
trend rate in 1995 was 12.0 percent, decreasing to an ultimate rate in the years
subsequent to 2000 of seven percent. A one percent increase in the assumed
health care cost trend rates would have increased the net periodic
postretirement benefit cost by $.1 million during 1995 and would have increased
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1995, by $.9
million. The Company is amortizing the unrecognized transition accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation and subsequent plan net gains and losses in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106. The accrued
postretirement benefit obligation was $3.1 million and $2.8 million at December
31, 1995 and 1994.

            (xiii) delegate to directors of the Company who need not be

Section 4.  Shares Available for Awards

      (a)  Shares Available.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section
4(c):

            (i) Initial Authorization.  There shall be 2,000,000 Shares
      initially available for issuance under the Plan.

            (ii) Acquired Shares.  In addition to the amount set forth above,
      up to 2,000,000 Shares acquired by the Company subsequent to the
      effectiveness of the Plan as full or partial payment for the exercise
      price for an Option or any other stock option granted by the Company, or
      acquired by the Company, in open market transactions or otherwise, in
      connection with the Plan or any Award hereunder or any other employee
      stock option or restricted stock issued by the Company may thereafter be
      included in the Shares available for Awards. If any Shares covered by an
      Award or to which an Award relates are forfeited, or if an Award
      expires, terminates or is cancelled, then the Shares covered by such
      Award, or to which such Award relates, or the number of Shares otherwise
      counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan
      by reason of such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture,
      expiration, termination or cancellation, may thereafter be available for
      further granting of Awards and included as acquired Shares for purposes
      of the preceding sentence.









                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
            (iii) Additional Shares.  Shares acquired by the Company in the
      circumstances set forth in (ii) above in excess of the amount set forth
      therein may thereafter be included in the Shares available for Awards to
      the extent permissible for purposes of allowing the Plan to continue to
      satisfy the conditions of Rule 16b-3.

            (iv) Accounting for Awards.  For purposes of this Section 4, 

                  (A) if an Award (other than a Dividend Equivalent) is
            denominated in Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award,
            or to which such Award relates, shall be counted on the date of
            grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares avail-
            able for granting Awards under the Plan to the extent determinable
            on such date and insofar as the number of Shares is not then
            determinable under procedures adopted by the Committee consistent
            with the purposes of the Plan; and

                  (B) Dividend Equivalents and Awards not denominated in
            Shares shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares
            available for granting Awards under the Plan in such amount and at
            such time as the Committee shall determine under procedures
            adopted by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan;

      provided, however, that Awards that operate in tandem with (whether
      granted simultaneously with or at a different time from), or that are
      substituted for, other Awards or restricted stock awards or stock
      options granted under any other plan of the Company may be counted or
      not counted under procedures adopted by the Committee in order to avoid
      double counting. Any Shares that are delivered by the Company or its
      Affiliates, and any Awards that are granted by, or become obligations
      of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company of, or in sub-
      stitution for, outstanding restricted stock awards or stock options
      previously granted by an acquired company shall not, except in the case
      of Awards granted to Participants who are directors or officers of the
      Company for purposes of Section 16, be counted against the Shares
      available for granting Awards under the Plan.

            (v) Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards. Any Shares
      delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of
      authorized but unissued Shares or of Shares reacquired by the Company,
      including but not limited to Shares purchased on the open market.















                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
            (b)   Individual Stock-Based Awards.  Subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 4(c), no Participant may receive stock-based Awards under
the Plan in any calendar year that relate to more than 400,000 Shares;
provided, however, that such number may be increased with respect to any
Participant by any Shares available for grant to such Participant in
accordance with this Paragraph 4(b) in any prior years that were not granted
in such prior years.  No provision of this Paragraph 4(b) shall be construed
as limiting the amount of any cash-based Award which may be granted to any
Participant.

            (c)  Adjustments.  Upon the occurrence of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other
property), change in the capital or shares of capital stock, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other
securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase
Shares or other securities of the Company or extraordinary transaction or
event which affects the Shares, then the Committee shall have the authority to
make such adjustment, if any, in such manner as it deems appropriate, in (i)
the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) which
thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) outstanding Awards
including without limitation the number and type of Shares (or other
securities or property) subject thereto, and (iii) the grant, purchase or
exercise price with respect to outstanding Awards and, if deemed appropriate,
make provision for cash payments to the holders of outstanding Awards; pro-
vided, however,  that the number of Shares subject to any Award denominated in
Shares shall always be a whole number.


Section 5.  Eligibility

      Any employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate, including
any officer of the Company (who may also be a director, but excluding a member
of the Committee, any person who serves only as a director of the Company and
any consultant to the Company or an Affiliate who is also a director of the
Company and who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with
the entity in question), as may be selected from time to time by the Committee
or by the directors to whom authority may be delegated pursuant to Section 3
hereof in its or their discretion, is eligible to be designated a Participant.

Section 6.  Awards

      (a)  Options.  The Committee is authorized to grant Options to
Participants.

<PAGE>
            (i) Committee Determinations.  Subject to the terms of the Plan,
      the Committee shall determine:


                  (A) the purchase price per Share under each Option;

                  (B) the term of each Option; and

                  (C) the time or times at which an Option may be exercised,
            in whole or in part, the method or methods by which and the form
            or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
            Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a
            fair market value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exer-
            cise price) in which payment of the exercise price with respect
            thereto may be made or deemed to have been made. The terms of any
            Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all
            respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any
            successor provision thereto, and any regulations promulgated
            thereunder.

      Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may impose such
      conditions or restrictions on any Option as it deems appropriate.

            (ii) Other Terms.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee:

                  (A) A Participant electing to exercise an Option shall give
            written notice to the Company, as may be specified by the
            Committee, of exercise of the Option and the number of Shares
            elected for exercise, such notice to be accompanied by such in-
            struments or documents as may be required by the Committee, and
            shall tender the purchase price of the Shares elected for
            exercise.

                  (B) At the time of exercise of an Option payment in full in
            cash shall be made for all Shares then being purchased.

                  (C) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares
            unless and until:

                       (I) if the class of Shares at the time is listed upon
                  any stock exchange, the Shares to be issued have been
                  listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official
                  notice of issuance, upon such exchange, and













                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
                       (II) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has
                  been compliance with applicable law in connection with the
                  issuance and delivery of Shares and such issuance shall have
                  been approved by the Company's counsel.

                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Company may require from the Participant such investment
            representation or such agreement, if any, as the Company's counsel
            may consider necessary in order to comply with the Securities Act
            of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the Participant
            agree that any sale of the Shares will be made only in such manner
            as shall be in accordance with law and that the Participant will
            notify the Company of any intent to make any disposition of the
            Shares whether by sale, gift or otherwise. The Participant shall
            take any action reasonably requested by the Company in such
            connection. A Participant shall have the rights of a stockholder
            only as and when Shares have been actually issued to the
            Participant pursuant to the Plan.

                  (D) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that an entity is no longer an Affiliate) other
            than the Participant's death, the Participant may thereafter
            exercise the Option as provided below, except that the Committee
            may terminate the unexercised portion of the Option concurrently
            with or at any time following termination of the employment or
            consulting arrangement (including termination of employment upon a
            change of status from employee to consultant) if it shall de-
            termine that the Participant has engaged in any activity
            detrimental to the interests of the Company or an Affiliate. If
            such termination is voluntary on the part of the Participant, the
            option may be exercised only within ten days after the date of
            termination. If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
            Participant, if an employee retires on or after normal retirement
            date or if the employment or consulting relationship is terminated
            by reason of permanent and total disability, the Option may be
            exercised within three months after the date of termination or
            retirement. For purposes of this Paragraph (D), a Participant's
            employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered ter-
            minated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona fide
            leave of absence (not to exceed one year), (ii) in the case of a
            transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among the
            Company and Affiliates, or (iii) by virtue of a change of status
            from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee, except
            as provided above.

<PAGE>
                  (E) If a Participant dies at a time when entitled to
            exercise an Option, then at any time or times within one year
            after death such Option may be exercised, as to all or any of the
            Shares which the Participant was entitled to purchase immediately
            prior to death.  The Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims
            of third parties satisfactory to the Company. Except as so
            exercised such Option shall expire at the end of such period.

                  (F) An Option may be exercised only if and to the extent
            such Option was exercisable at the date of termination of
            employment or the consulting arrangement, and an Option may not be
            exercised at a time when the Option would not have been
            exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement contin-
            ued.

            (iii) Restoration Options.  The Committee may grant a Participant
      the right to receive a restoration Option with respect to an Option or
      any other option granted by the Company.  Unless the Committee shall
      otherwise determine, a restoration Option shall provide that the under-
      lying option must be exercised while the Participant is an employee of
      or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate and the number of Shares
      which are subject to a restoration Option shall not exceed the number of
      whole Shares exchanged in payment of the original option.

      (b)  Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder
thereof a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (i) the fair
market value of one Share on the date of exercise or, if the Committee shall
so determine in the case of any such right other than one related to any
Incentive Stock Option, at any time during a specified period before or after
the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right as specified by
the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall determine
the grant price, term, methods of exercise and settlement and any other terms
and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right and may impose such conditions
or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem
appropriate.

      (c)  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

            (i) Issuance.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
      Participants Awards of Restricted Stock, which shall consist of Shares,
      and Restricted Stock Units which shall give the Participant the right to
      receive cash, other securities, other Awards or other property, in each
      case subject to the 










                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>
      termination of the Restricted Period determined by the Committee.

            (ii) Restrictions.  The Restricted Period may differ among
      Participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of Shares covered by the same Award.  Subject to the terms of
      the Plan, Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
      have such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without
      limitation, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Stock or the
      right to receive any dividend or other right or property), which
      restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or
      times, in installments or otherwise. Unless the Committee shall
      otherwise determine, any Shares or other securities distributed with
      respect to Restricted Stock or which a Participant is otherwise entitled
      to receive by reason of such Shares shall be subject to the restrictions
      contained in the applicable Award Agreement. Subject to the
      aforementioned restrictions and the provisions of the Plan, Participants
      shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares of
      Restricted Stock.

            (iii) Registration.  Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may
      be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate,
      including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of
      stock certificates.

            (iv) Forfeiture.  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee:

                  (A) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that any entity is no longer an Affiliate),
            other than the Participant's death or permanent and total dis-
            ability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or after
            normal retirement date, all Shares of Restricted Stock theretofore
            awarded to the Participant which are still subject to restrictions
            shall upon such termination of employment or the consulting
            relationship be forfeited and transferred back to the Company.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing or Paragraph (C) below, if a
            Participant continues to hold an Award of Restricted Stock
            following termination of the employment or consulting arrangement
            (including retirement and termination of employment upon a change
            of status from employee to consultant), the Shares of Restricted
            Stock which remain subject to restrictions shall nonetheless be
            forfeited and transferred back to the Company if the Committee at
            any time thereafter determines that the Participant has engaged in
            any activity detrimental to the interests of the Company or an
            Affiliate. For purposes of this Paragraph (A), a Participant's em









                                    - 10 -

<PAGE>
            ployment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
            terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona
            fide leave of absence (not to exceed one year), (ii) in the case
            of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among
            the Company and Affiliates, or (iii) by virtue of a change of
            status from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee,
            except as provided above.

                  (B) If a Participant ceases to be employed or retained by
            the Company or an Affiliate by reason of death or permanent and
            total disability or if following retirement a Participant
            continues to have rights under an Award of Restricted Stock and
            thereafter dies, the restrictions contained in the Award shall
            lapse with respect to such Restricted Stock.

                  (C) If an employee ceases to be employed by the Company or
            an Affiliate by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement
            date, the restrictions contained in the Award of Restricted Stock
            shall continue to lapse in the same manner as though employment
            had not terminated.

                  (D) At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to Shares
            covered by an Award of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver
            the Shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired, as
            follows:

                       (1) if an assignment to a trust has been made in ac-
                  cordance with Section 6(g)(iv)(B)(1)(c), to such trust; or

                      (2) if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of
                  death and a beneficiary has been designated in a form
                  approved by the Company, to the beneficiary so designated;
                  or

                       (3) in all other cases, to the Participant or the legal
                  representative of the Participant's estate.

      (d)  Performance Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Performance Awards to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Performance Award granted under the Plan (i) may be denominated or payable in
cash, Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock), other
securities, other Awards, or other property and (ii) shall confer on the
holder thereof rights valued as determined by the Committee and payable to, or
exercisable by, the holder of the Performance Award, in whole or in part, upon
the achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as
the Committee shall establish. Subject to 









                                    - 11 -

<PAGE>
the terms of the Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any
performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any
Performance Award granted, the amount of any payment or transfer to be made
pursuant to any Performance Award and other terms and conditions shall be
determined by the Committee.

      (e)  Dividend Equivalents.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants Awards under which the holders thereof shall be entitled to
receive payments equivalent to dividends or interest with respect to a number
of Shares determined by the Committee, and the Committee may provide that such
amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares
or otherwise reinvested. Subject to the terms of the Plan, such Awards may
have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.

      (f)  Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in
whole or in part by reference to or otherwise based on or related to Shares
(including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are
deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan,
provided, however,  that such grants to persons who are subject to Section 16
must comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards.
Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted
under this Section 6(f) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may
be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms, including,
without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other
property or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine.

      (g)  General.

            (i) No Cash Consideration for Awards.  Awards may be granted for
      no cash consideration or for such minimal cash consideration as may be
      required by applicable law.

            (ii) Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together.  Awards may, in
      the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition
      to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or any award
      granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate. Awards
      granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in addition to
      or in tandem with awards granted under another plan of the Company or
      any Affiliate, may be granted either at the same time as or at a
      different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.

            (iii) Forms of Payment Under Awards.  Subject to the terms of the
      Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be
      made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise, or payment
      of an Award may 








                                    - 12 -

<PAGE>
      be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine,
      including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other
      Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof, and may be made
      in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred
      basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established
      by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include, without
      limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable
      interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting
      of Dividend Equivalents in respect of installment or deferred payments.

            (iv) Limits on Transfer of Awards.

                  (A) Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, no
            Award or right under any Award may be sold, encumbered, pledged,
            alienated, attached, assigned or transferred in any manner and any
            attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be void and unenforceable
            against the Company.

                  (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (A) above:

                        (1)   Except as set forth in Paragraph (2) below, a
                  Participant may assign or transfer an Option or rights under
                  an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units:

                             (a) to a beneficiary designated by the
                        Participant in writing on a form approved by the
                        Committee;

                             (b) by will or the applicable laws of descent and
                        distribution to the personal representative, executor
                        or administrator of the Participant's estate; or

                             (c) to a revocable grantor trust established by
                        the Participant for the sole benefit of the
                        Participant during the Participant's life, and under
                        the terms of which the Participant is and remains the
                        sole trustee until death or physical or mental
                        incapacity. Such assignment shall be effected by a
                        written instrument in form and content satisfactory to
                        the Committee, and the Participant shall deliver to
                        the Committee a true copy of the agreement or other
                        document evidencing such trust. If in the judgment of
                        the Committee the trust to which a Participant may at-
                        tempt to assign rights under such an 











                                    - 13 -

<PAGE>
                        Award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which
                        an assignment is permitted by the terms hereof, or if
                        after assignment, because of amendment, by force of
                        law or any other reason such trust no longer meets
                        such criteria, such attempted assignment shall be void
                        and may be disregarded by the Committee and the
                        Company and all rights to any such Awards shall revert
                        to and remain solely in the Participant. Not-
                        withstanding a qualified assignment, the Participant,
                        and not the trust to which rights under such an Award
                        may be assigned, for the purpose of determining
                        compensation arising by reason of the Award, shall
                        continue to be considered an employee or consultant,
                        as the case may be, of the Company or an Affiliate,
                        but such trust and the Participant shall be bound by
                        all of the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement
                        and this Plan. Shares issued in the name of and
                        delivered to such trust shall be conclusively con-
                        sidered issuance and delivery to the Participant.

                        (2) The Committee shall not permit directors or offi-
                  cers of the Company for purposes of Section 16 to transfer
                  or assign Awards except as permitted under Rule 16b-3.

                  (C) The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and
            employees may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or
            other instrument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any
            other documents delivered to them by or on behalf of the
            Participant which they believe genuine and any action taken by
            them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and binding upon the
            Participant, the personal representatives of the Participant's
            estate and all persons asserting a claim based on an Award. The
            delivery by a Participant of a beneficiary designation, or an
            assignment of rights under an Award as permitted hereunder, shall
            constitute the Participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the
            Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
            harmless against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in
            defending against claims, of any person (including the
            Participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based on an
            Award, subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment. In
            addition, the Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third
            parties satisfactory to the Company.












                                    - 14 -

<PAGE>
            (v) Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares or other
      securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the
      exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other
      restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the
      rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other
      securities are then listed and any applicable Federal or state
      securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be
      put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such
      restrictions.

            (vi) Change in Control.  (A) Notwithstanding any of the provisions
      of this Plan or instruments evidencing Awards granted hereunder, upon a
      Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) the vesting of all rights of
      Participants under outstanding Awards shall be accelerated and all
      restrictions thereon shall terminate in order that Participants may
      fully realize the benefits thereunder. Such acceleration shall include,
      without limitation, the immediate exercisability in full of all Options
      and the termination of restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted
      Stock Units. Further, in addition to the Committee's authority set forth
      in Section 4(c), the Committee, as constituted before such Change in
      Control, is authorized, and has sole discretion, as to any Award, either
      at the time such Award is made hereunder or any time thereafter, to take
      any one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the purchase
      of any such Award, upon the Participant's request, for an amount of cash
      equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of
      such Award or realization of the Participant's rights had such Award
      been currently exercisable or payable; (ii) make such adjustment to any
      such Award then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to
      reflect such Change in Control; and (iii) cause any such Award then
      outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by the
      acquiring or surviving corporation after such Change in Control.

            (B) With respect to any Award granted hereunder prior to December
      5, 1995, a Change in Control shall occur if:

                  (1) any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly pur-
            chases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is
            exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to
            any condition) of voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting 









                                    - 15 -

<PAGE>
            power of all outstanding voting securities of (A) the  Company or
            (B) an Affiliated Party (as hereinafter defined); or

                  (2) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

            An "Affiliated Party" shall mean (x) MascoTech, Inc., a
      Delaware corporation ("MascoTech"), provided MascoTech then owns
      at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting
      securities of the Company, or (y) Masco Corporation, a Delaware
      corporation ("Masco"), provided Masco then owns (i) at least
      twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting
      securities of the Company, or (ii) at least twenty percent of the
      combined voting power of all voting securities of MascoTech and
      MascoTech and Masco Corporation together then own an aggregate of
      at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting
      securities of the Company.

            (C)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B), with
      respect to Awards granted hereunder on or after December 5, 1995, a
      Change in Control shall occur only if the event described in this
      subparagraph (C) shall have occurred.  With respect to any other Award
      granted prior thereto, a Change in Control shall occur if any of the
      events described in subparagraphs (B) or (C) shall have occurred, unless
      the holder of any such Award shall have consented to the application of
      this subparagraph (C) in lieu of the foregoing subparagraph (B).  A
      Change in Control for purposes of this subparagraph (C) shall occur if,
      during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar months, the
      individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Company's
      Board of Directors, and any new directors (other than Excluded
      Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose election by such Board or
      nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
      on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
      nomination for election as directors was previously so approved, for any
      reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
      For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose 











                                    - 16 -

<PAGE>
      election by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder election
      occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of persons", as such
      terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act,
      commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the beneficial owner of,
      voting securities representing 25 percent or more of the combined voting
      power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than
      pursuant to a tender offer approved by the Board prior to its
      commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions approved by the Board
      prior to their representing 25 percent or more of such combined voting
      power.

            (D)(1)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
      is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
      the benefit of a Participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (D) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such Participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      Participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such Participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Section
      6(g)(vi)(D), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the Participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected Participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
      exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
      that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made
      by the Company which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y)










                                    - 17 -

<PAGE>
      certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have been made which should
      not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations
      required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such
      Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit
      of the affected Participant.  In the event that the Participant
      discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the amount thereof
      shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (vii)  Cash Settlement.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
      Plan or of any Award Agreement to the contrary, any Award outstanding
      hereunder may at any time be cancelled in the Committee's sole
      discretion upon payment of the value of such Award to the holder thereof
      in cash or in another Award hereunder, such value to be determined by
      the Committee in its sole discretion.

Section 7.  Amendment and Termination

      Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise
expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

      (a)  Amendments to the Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company may
amend the Plan and the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend any out-
standing Award; provided, however,  that (i) no Plan amendment shall be
effective until approved by stockholders of the Company insofar as stockholder
approval thereof is required in order for the Plan to continue to satisfy the
conditions of Rule 16b-3, and (ii) without the consent of affected
Participants no amendment of the Plan or of any Award may impair the rights of
Participants under outstanding Awards.

      (b)  Waivers.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under
any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the
consent of any Participant.

      (c)  Adjustments of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or
Nonrecurring Events.  The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in
the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation,
the events described in Section 4(c) hereof) affecting the Company, any
Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or of
changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever
the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits to be
made available under the Plan.

      (d)  Correction of Defects, Omissions, and Inconsistencies.  The
Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or 









                                    - 18 -

<PAGE>
reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the
extent it shall deem desirable to effectuate the Plan. 


Section 8.  General Provisions

      (a)  No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or other person shall have any
claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards
under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards of the same type and the
determination of the Committee to grant a waiver or modification of any Award
and the terms and conditions thereof need not be the same with respect to each
Participant.

      (b)  Withholding.  The Company or any Affiliate shall be authorized to
withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any
Award or under the Plan the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other
Awards or other property) of withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its
exercise or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to
take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company or
Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

      (c)  No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in
the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continu-
ing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including the
grant of options and other stock-based awards, and such arrangements may be
either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

      (d)  No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Award shall not be
construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of
the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any
time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any
claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in
any Award Agreement or other written agreement with the Participant.

      (e)  Governing Law.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan
and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable Federal law.

      (f)  Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or
becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any
Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall
be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot
be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the
Committee, 









                                    - 19 -

<PAGE>
materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall
be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the
Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

      (g)  No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall
create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a
fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant
or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive
payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right
shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
Company or any Affiliate.

      (h)  No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or
delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine
whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred
in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any
rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.

      (i)  Headings.  Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of
the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall
not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or
interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.

Section 9.  Effective Date of the Plan

      The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the
Company's stockholders.

                        (Restated December 5, 1995)
                                     

Article I.  Purpose

      The purpose of the 1988 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
TriMas Corporation (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent
in stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company
and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the
committee responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely
responsible for the Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to
accomplish this purpose by offering such employees and consultants an
opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  For
purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock, and an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company
or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least
twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.

Article II.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Upon registration of the Company's Common Stock under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), members of the Committee
shall be "disinterested persons" as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act or any rule which modifies, amends or replaces Rule
16b-3(d).  The Committee shall have authority, consistent with the Plan:

            (a)  to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
      Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
      options;

            (b)  to determine the time or times when options shall be granted
      and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each option;















<PAGE>

            (c)  to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
      option and the method of payment of such price;

            (d)  to determine the time or times when each option becomes
      exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
      period;

            (e)  to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing
      options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required
      under the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;

            (f)  to designate options granted to key employees of the Company
      or its subsidiaries under the Plan as "incentive stock options"
      ("ISOs"), as such terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of
      1986;

            (g)  to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
      administration of the Plan and options and for its own acts and
      proceedings; and

            (h)  to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
      disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan.

      All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned.

Article III.  Participants

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the
Committee in its discretion, are eligible to receive options under the Plan. 
The grant of an option to an employee or consultant shall not entitle such
individual to other grants or options, nor shall such grant disqualify such
individual from further participation.

Article IV.  Limitations

      No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1998, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.  Subject to
adjustment as provided in Article IX, the number of shares of Common Stock of
the Company which may 











                                     - 2 -

<PAGE>
be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000; provided, however, that
such number of shares shall be reduced by the number of shares of the
Company's Common Stock awarded under the Company's 1988 Restricted Stock
Incentive Plan (other than shares awarded under such plan which are later for-
feited to the Company).  To the extent that any option granted under the Plan
shall expire or terminate unexercised or for any reason become unexercisable,
any stock theretofore subject to such expired or terminated option shall
thereafter be available for further grants under the Plan.  If an option
granted under the Plan shall be accepted for surrender pursuant to Article
VIII, any stock subject to such option shall not thereafter be available for
further grants.

      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:

            (a)  Such option must be granted on or prior to November 1, 1998,
      and such option by its terms must not be exercisable after the
      expiration of ten years from the date such option is granted;

            (b)  Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does
      not, determined at the time such option is granted, own capital stock
      representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
      stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) the
      option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value,
      determined at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to
      such option and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than
      five years from the date it is granted; and

            (c)  The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject
      to such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock
      subject to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee
      exercisable in the same calendar year (all determined at the respective
      dates of grant of such options) must not exceed $100,000.

Article V.  Stock to be Issued

      The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share.  Such stock may be authorized but unissued
shares or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not
limited to shares purchased on the open market.  The Board of Directors and
the officers of the Company shall take any appropriate action required for
such issuance.

Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

      All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such
other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

      (a)  Option Price.  Each option shall have such per share option price
as the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair market value of
Common Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

      (b)  Term of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven
years from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which
the option is awarded by the Committee.

      (c)  Exercise of Options.

            (i)  Each option shall be made exercisable not less than six
      months from the date of grant and at such time or times, whether or not
      in installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the time the option
      is granted.

            (ii)  A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
      notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise
      of the option and the number of shares of stock elected for exercise,
      such notice to be accompanied by such instruments or documents as may be
      required by the Committee, and shall tender the purchase price of the
      stock elected for exercise unless otherwise directed by the Committee.

            (iii) (A) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing options granted hereunder, in the case of a
      Change in Control of the Company, each option then outstanding shall
      immediately become exercisable in full.  A Change in Control shall occur
      if any of the events described below in subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3)
      shall have occurred, unless the holder of any such option shall have
      consented to the application of subparagraph (3) in lieu of
      subparagraphs (1) and (2):

                  (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise
            becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the
            Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such beneficial
            ownership (whether or not such 











                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
            right is exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or
            subject to any condition) of voting securities representing
            twenty-five percent or more of the combined voting power of all
            outstanding voting securities of (A) the Company, or (B) of an Af-
            filiated Party (as hereinafter defined); 

                  (2)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning  of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

                  (3)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
            such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
            For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose
            election by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder
            election occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of
            persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
            the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the
            beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting
            securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer
            approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to
            stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their
            representing 25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

An "Affiliated Party" shall mean (x) MascoTech, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("MascoTech"), provided MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent of the
combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company, or (y) Masco
Corpora-













                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
tion, a Delaware corporation ("Masco"), provided Masco then owns (i) at least
twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting securities of the
Company, or (ii) at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all
voting securities of MascoTech and MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent
of the combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company.

            (B)(1) In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it is
      determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
      benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (B) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Article
      VI(c)(iii)(B), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
      exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
      that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made
      by the Company which should have been made (an 















                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
      "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have
      been made which should not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent
      with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an
      Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to
      or for the benefit of the affected participant.  In the event that the
      participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the
      amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (3)   This Article VI(c)(iii)(B) shall not apply to any option (x)
      that was granted prior to February 17, 1993 and (y) the holder of which
      is an executive officer of the Company, as determined under the Exchange
      Act.

      (d)  Payment for Issuance of Stock.  At the time of exercise of any
option granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all
stock then being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the
Committee, in whole or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its
then fair market value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in
its discretion permit the issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as
it deems reasonable, provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase
price shall be evidenced by a promissory note at such rate of interest and
upon such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate. 
In all cases where stock is issued for less than present full payment of the
purchase price, there shall be placed upon the certificate or certificates
representing such stock a legend setting forth the amount paid at issuance,
and the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and stating that the stock is subject
to call for the remainder and may not be transferred by the holder until the
balance due thereon shall be fully paid.

      The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its procedures,
may permit a participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, the income tax
withholding obligations in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified
stock option by having shares withheld from the shares to be issued upon the
exercise of the option or by delivering shares of Common Stock of the Company
having a fair market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such
obligations.

      (e)  Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to
issue any stock unless and until:

            (i)  if the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at the time
      listed upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be issued have
      been listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice
      of issuance, upon such exchange, and












                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
            (ii)  in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
      compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
      delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
      Company's counsel.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the Se-
curities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be
in accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or
otherwise.  The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the
Company in such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a
stockholder only as and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the
participant pursuant to the Plan.

      (f)  Nontransferability of Options.  No options may be transferred by
the participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in
subsection (j) of this Article, or by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and during the participant's lifetime the option may be
exercised only by the participant.

      (g)  Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must
agree to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or
the consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually
agreed upon) for at least ninety days from the date the option is granted.

      (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including
termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a
subsidiary or affiliated company) other than the participant's death or
permanent and total disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on
or after normal retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the
opinion of the Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify
termination of the option, the participant may thereafter exercise the option
as provided below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of the par-
ticipant, the option may be exercised only within ten days after the day of
termination.  If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
participant, the option may be exercised within three months after the day of
termination.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan or the option, whether
the termination of employment or consulting arrangement is voluntary or
involuntary, options may be exercised only if such options were exercisable at
the date of such termination, and an option may not be exercised at a time
when the option would not 










                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>
have been exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement continued. 
Notwithstanding the preceding three sentences, the Committee may extend the
time within which or alter the terms and conditions on which the participant
may exercise an option after the termination of employment or the consulting
arrangement, and if the period within which an option may be exercised has
been extended, the Committee may terminate the unexercised portion of the
option if it shall determine that the participant has engaged in any activity
detrimental to the Company's interests.  For purposes of this Article VI(h), a
participant's employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of
absence (not to exceed one year unless otherwise approved by the Committee),
(ii) in the case of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement
among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or (iii) by
virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from consultant to
employee.

      (i)  Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an
option the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and
total disability, such option may be exercised to the extent exercisable on
the date of retirement or such termination, provided such option shall be
exercised within three months of the date of retirement or such termination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its discretion the Committee may extend the
time within which or alter the terms and conditions on which an option held by
a retired or disabled option holder may be exercised, and if the period within
which an option may be exercised has been extended, the Committee may
terminate the unexercised portion of the option if it shall determine that the
participant has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's
interests.

      (j)  Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise
an option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such
further period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised, as to
all or any of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase im-
mediately prior to death (or such additional shares covered by the option as
the Committee may allow), by the person or persons designated in writing by
the participant in such form of beneficiary designation as may be approved by
the Company, or failing designation by the participant's personal represen-
tative, executor or administrator or the person or persons to whom the option
is transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution. 
The Company may decline to deliver shares to a designated beneficiary until it
receives indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the 













                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>
Company.  Except as so exercised such option shall expire at the end of such
period.

Article VII.  Replacement Options

      The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms and conditions
differing from those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted
in substitution for options held by employees of or consultants to other
entities who concurrently become employees of or consultants to the Company or
a subsidiary or an affiliated company as the result of a merger, consolidation
or other reorganization of such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary
or an affiliated company, or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or
an affiliated company of the business, property or stock of such other entity. 
The Committee may direct that the replacement options be granted on such terms
and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.

Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

      The Committee may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions
as it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or
shares of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the
date of such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided
that the Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose
of the Plan.


Article IX.  Changes in Stock

      The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any,
as it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be
granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to
options then outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such
outstanding options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of
capital stock, any special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary
transaction (including a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to which the
Company is a party.  The determination of the Board of Directors as to such
matters shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

Article X.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan, the grant of options hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not con-










                                    - 10 -

<PAGE>
fer upon any employee of or consultant to the Company or subsidiary or an
affiliated company any right to continue the employment or consulting
relationship with the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the
case may be, nor does it in any way impair the right of the Company or a sub-
sidiary or an affiliated company to terminate the employment of any of its
employees or the consulting arrangement with any of its consultants at any
time, with or without cause, unless a written employment or consulting
agreement provides otherwise.


Article XI.  Amendments

      The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the
extent permitted under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company no amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of stock
available under the Plan, alter the class of persons eligible to receive
options under the Plan, or without the consent of the participant void or
diminish options previously granted, nor increase or accelerate the conditions
required for the exercise of the same, except that nothing herein shall limit
the Company's right under Article VI(d) to call stock, issued for deferred
payment which is evidenced by a promissory note, where the participant is in
default of the obligations of such note.

                              TRIMAS CORPORATION

                     1988 RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated December 5, 1995)


1.  Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the Plan is to aid TriMas Corporation (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in attracting and retaining key
employees and consultants of outstanding ability.  In addition, the Company
expects that it will benefit from the added interest which such individuals
will have in its welfare as a result of their ownership or increased ownership
of the Company's Common Stock.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any
corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock
possessing more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock, and an "affiliated company" is any other corporation, at
least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of which is owned by the Company or by one or more other corporations in
a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent of the stock of each of which
is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another corporation within such
chain.

2.  Stock Subject to the Plan

      The shares which may be awarded under the Plan are shares of the
Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share.  Subject to adjustment as
provided in Paragraph 6, the total number of shares of the Company's Common
Stock that may be awarded under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000; provided,
however, that such number of shares shall be reduced by the number of shares
of the Company's Common Stock as to which options have been granted under the
Company's 1988 Stock Option Plan (other than shares which are available for
further grants under Article IV of such plan notwithstanding the prior grant
of options with respect to such shares).  Such stock may be authorized but
unissued shares or shares reacquired by the Company, including but not limited
to shares purchased on the open market.  Shares of stock awarded under the
Plan which are later reacquired by the Company as a result of forfeiture
pursuant to the Plan shall again become available for awards under the Plan.

3.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Upon registration of the 












<PAGE>
Company's Common Stock under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "Exchange Act"), members of the Committee shall be "disinterested
persons" as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act or
any rule which modifies, amends or replaces Rule 16b-3(d).  The Committee
shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, to determine the terms and
conditions of each award, to interpret the Plan and the agreements entered
into pursuant to the Plan, to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations
for its administration and the awards, and generally to conduct and administer
the Plan and to make all determinations in connection therewith which may be
necessary or advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned.

4.  Eligibility

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the
Committee in its discretion, are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. 
The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion the number of shares to
be awarded to each participant.

5.  Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in each Award Agreement
("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less
      than ninety days.  Such Restricted Period may differ among participants
      and may have different expiration dates with respect to portions of
      shares covered by the same award.  The Committee may also determine that
      the expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to such
      additional terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion and
      as set forth in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of Common Stock awarded to participants may not be
      sold, encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter
      provided, during the Restricted Peri-











                                     - 2 -

<PAGE>
      od pertaining to such shares.  Except for such restrictions on transfer,
      the participant shall have all the rights of a stockholder including but
      not limited to the right to receive all dividends paid on such shares
      (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6) and the right to vote such
      shares.

            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any
      reason (including termination by reason of the fact that any corporation
      is no longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other than death, per-
      manent and total disability, or, in the case of an employee, retirement
      on or after normal retirement date, all shares of stock theretofore
      awarded to the participant which are still subject to the restrictions
      imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination of employment or
      the consulting relationship be forfeited and transferred back to the
      Company, provided, however, that if such employment or consulting
      relationship is terminated by action of the Company or any of its
      subsidiaries or affiliated companies without cause or by agreement of
      the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and the
      participant, the Committee may, but need not, determine that some or all
      of the shares shall not be so forfeited, and provided further that the
      Committee may remove or modify restrictions on shares which are not
      forfeited.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5(c), a participant's
      employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated
      (i) in the case of transfers of employment or the consulting arrangement
      among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by
      virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from
      consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of interruption in service,
      not exceeding one year in duration unless otherwise approved by the
      Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if an employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
      companies by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date,
      the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to
      the shares then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided
      to the contrary in the Agreement.
















                                     - 3 -

<PAGE>
            (e)  Shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan shall not be
      evidenced by certificates until restrictions lapse but shall be
      registered in the name of the participant in book entry form in the
      Company's stock register.
            
            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the
      Company in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and
      conditions of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to
      the shares covered by the award, and such other matters, including com-
      pliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of
      withholding or providing for the payment of required taxes, as the
      Committee in its sole discretion shall determine.  The Committee may at
      any time amend the terms of any Agreement consistent with the terms of
      the Plan, except that without the participant's written consent no such
      amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the participant.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares
      covered by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates
      deposited with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the
      Restricted Period has expired, as follows:

                  (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                  (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                  (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h) (1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards granted hereunder, in the case of a Change
      in Control of the Company, each award theretofore granted shall immedi-
      ately become fully vested and non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be dis-
      tributed to participants as soon as practicable, free of all
      restrictions.  A Change in Control shall occur if any of the events
      described below in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) shall have occurred,
      unless the holder of any such award shall have consented 














                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
      to the application of subparagraph (C) in lieu of subparagraphs (A) and
      (B):

                 (A)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise
            becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the
            Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such beneficial
            ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately,
            with the passage of time, or subject to any condition), of voting
            securities representing twenty-five percent or more of the com-
            bined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of (A) the
            Company, or (B) of an Affiliated Party (as hereinafter defined); 

                 (B)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

                  (C) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
            such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
            For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose
            election by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder
            election occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of
            persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
            the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the
            beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting power of 













                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
            all outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than
            pursuant to a tender offer approved by the Board prior to its
            commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions approved by the
            Board prior to their representing 25 percent or more of such
            combined voting power.

An "Affiliated Party" shall mean (x) MascoTech, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("MascoTech"), provided MascoTech then owns at least twenty percent of the
combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company, or (y) Masco
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Masco"), provided Masco then owns (i) at
least twenty percent of the combined voting power of all voting securities of
the Company, or (ii) at least twenty percent of the combined voting power of
all voting securities of MascoTech and MascoTech then owns at least twenty
percent of the combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company.

            (2)(A) In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it is
      determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
      benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (2) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (B) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (B)   All determinations required to be made under this Section
      5(h)(2), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is required
      and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be made by
      Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm as the
      Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and the
      participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed 














                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
      supporting calculations to the Company and the affected participant
      within 15 business days of the date of the applicable Payment.  Except
      as hereinafter provided, any determination by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.,
      or such other national accounting firm, shall be binding upon the
      Company and the participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in the
      application of Section 4999 of the Code that may exist at the time of
      the initial determination hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain
      Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made by the Company
      which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payments will have been made which should not have been
      made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be
      made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such Underpayment
      shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
      affected participant.  In the event that the participant discovers that
      an Overpayment shall have occurred, the amount thereof shall be promptly
      repaid to the Company.

            (C)   This Section 5(h)(2) shall not apply to any Award (x) that
      was granted prior to February 17, 1993 and (y) the holder of which is an
      executive officer of the Company, as determined under the Exchange Act.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a
      participant may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor
      trust established by the participant for the sole benefit of the
      participant during the life of the participant, and under the terms of
      which the participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or
      physical or mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a
      written instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and
      the participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the
      agreement or other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment
      of the Committee the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign
      rights under an award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
      assignment is permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after
      assignment, because of amendment, by force of law or any other reason
      such trust no longer meets such criteria, such attempted assignment
      shall be void and may be disregarded by the Committee and the Company
      and all rights to any awards shall revert to and remain solely in the
      participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the participant,
      and not the trust to which rights under an award may be assigned, for
      the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of the award
      shall continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as the case
      may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such













                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
      trust and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
      conditions of the Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other in-
      strument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents
      delivered to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe
      genuine and any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be
      conclusive and binding upon the participant, his personal representa-
      tives and all persons asserting a claim based on an award granted
      pursuant to this Plan.  The delivery by a participant of a beneficiary
      designation, or an assignment of rights under an award as permitted by
      this Paragraph 5(i), shall constitute the participant's irrevocable
      undertaking to hold the Committee, the Company and its officers, agents
      and employees harmless against claims, including any cost or expense in-
      curred in defending against claims, of any person (including the
      participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based upon an award
      subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment.  In addition, the
      Company may decline to deliver shares to a beneficiary until it receives
      indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company. 
      Issuance of shares as to which restrictions have lapsed in the name of,
      and delivery to, the trust to which rights may be assigned shall be con-
      clusively considered issuance and delivery to the participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its
      procedures, may permit the participant to satisfy, in whole or in part,
      the applicable income tax withholding obligations when the restrictions
      imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse by having shares withheld from the
      shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering
      shares of Common Stock of the Company having a fair market value equal
      to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

            (k)  In its sole discretion the Committee may also provide the
      participant with the right to receive cash payments in connection with
      shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan (including shares
      previously awarded), the amount of which payments are based, in whole or
      only in part, on the value of such Common Stock.  The right to receive
      such payments shall be subject to such other terms and conditions not
      inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may determine.

6.  Changes in Capitalization

      If there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or combination
of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the outstanding
Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and class of shares
as to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall be appropriately
adjusted by the Committee whose determination thereof shall be conclusive. 
Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, any shares of stock or other
securities received by a participant with respect to shares still subject to
the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the same
restrictions and shall be deposited with the Company.

      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the re-
strictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.

7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of the Company's stockholders no
amendment shall increase the number of shares which may be awarded under the
Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December 31,
1998 or change the standards of eligibility of employees or consultants
eligible to participate in the Plan.  The number of shares awardable under the
Plan may, however, without stockholder approval, be adjusted pursuant to the
adjustment provisions described in Paragraph 6 hereof.

8.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan, the award of stock hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not confer upon any employee of
or consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any
right to continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company
or a subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in
any way impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated
company to terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting
arrangement with any of its consultants at any time, with or without cause,
unless a written employment or consulting agreement provides otherwise.

                                MASCOTECH, INC.

                     1984 RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated December 6, 1995)



l.    Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the 1984 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is
to aid MascoTech, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries and affiliated
companies in securing and retaining key employees and consultants of
outstanding ability and to motivate such individuals to exert their best
efforts on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliated
companies.  In addition, the Company expects that it will benefit from the
added interest which such individuals will have in its welfare as a result of
their ownership or increased ownership of the Company's Common Stock.  For
purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For purposes of
Paragraph 4 of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other corporation (and
its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own stock
possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company
or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least
twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.


2.    Stock Subject to the Plan

      The total number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that may be
awarded under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate 8,160,000 shares;
provided, however, that such total amount shall be reduced by the aggregate
number of shares of the Company's Common Stock as to which options have been
granted under the Company's 1984 Stock Option Plan since the original adoption
thereof (other than shares which are available for further grants under
Article IV of such Plan notwithstanding the prior grant of options with
respect to such shares).  Such stock may be authorized but unissued shares or
shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to
shares purchased on the open market.  Shares of stock awarded under the Plan
which are later reacquired by the Company as a result of forfeiture pursuant
to the Plan shall again become available for awards under the Plan.











<PAGE>
3.    Administration

      The Board of Directors of the Company shall appoint a committee (the
"Committee") consisting of two or more members of the Board of Directors who
shall administer the Plan.  No director shall become or remain a member of the
Committee unless at the time of his exercise of any discretionary function as
a Committee member such director is not and has not at any time within one
year prior to the exercise of such discretion been eligible for selection as a
person to whom stock may be allocated or to whom stock options or stock
appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of
the Company or any of its affiliates entitling the participants therein to
acquire stock, stock options or stock appreciation rights of the Company or
any of its affiliates.  The Committee shall have the authority, consistent
with the Plan, (a) to determine the terms and conditions of each award, (b) to
interpret the Plan and the agreements under the Plan, (c) to adopt, amend and
rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and the
awards, (d) to delegate to directors of the Company, who need not be
"disinterested persons" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the authority to amend awards granted to participants, provided
such participants are not directors or officers of the Company for purposes of
Section 16, and generally to conduct and administer the Plan and to make all
determinations in connection therewith which may be necessary or advisable. 
All such actions of the Committee shall be binding upon all participants.


4.    Eligibility

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company who are also employees
(who may also be directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person
who serves only as a director or as a non-employee officer of the Company and
any consultant to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
companies who is also a director of the Company or who is not rendering
services pursuant to a written agreement with the corporation in question), as
may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are eli-
gible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to each such participant.


5.    Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants under the Plan shall

shall be contained in each Award Agreement ("Agreement") referred to in
Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less
      than 90 days.  Such Restricted Period may differ among participants and
      may have different expiration dates with respect to portions of shares
      covered by the same award.  The Committee may also determine that the
      expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to such additional
      terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion and as set
      forth in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of stock awarded to participants may not be sold,
      encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided,
      during the Restricted Period pertaining to such shares.  Except for such
      restrictions on transfer and the restrictions applicable to non-cash
      distributions, the participant shall have all the rights of a
      stockholder including but not limited to the right to receive all
      dividends paid on such shares (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6)
      and the right to vote such shares.

            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any
      reason (including termination by reason of the fact that such
      corporation is no longer a subsidiary or affiliated company) other than
      death, permanent and total disability, or, in the case of an employee,
      retirement on or after normal retirement date, all shares of stock
      theretofore awarded to the participant which are still subject to the
      restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination be
      forfeited and transferred back to the Company, provided, however, that
      in the event such employment or consulting relationship is terminated by
      action of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
      without cause or by agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
      or affiliated companies and the participant, the Committee may, but need
      not, determine that some or all of the shares shall be free of
      restrictions.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5(c), a participant's
      employment or consulting agreement shall not be considered terminated
      (i) in the case of transfers of employment or the consulting arrangement
      among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by
      virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from
      consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of interruption in service,
      not exceeding one year in duration unless otherwise approved by the
      Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated 









                                     - 3 -

<PAGE>
      companies by reason of death or permanent and total disability or if an
      employee ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
      or affiliated companies by reason of retirement on or after normal re-
      tirement date, the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse
      with respect to the shares then subject to restrictions, except to the
      extent provided to the contrary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Each certificate issued in respect of shares awarded under
      the Plan shall be registered in the name of the participant and
      deposited by the participant with the Company, together with a stock
      power endorsed in blank, and shall bear the following legend:

            "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this certificate and
      the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and
      conditions (including a contingent transfer obligation) contained in the
      Masco Industries, Inc. 1984 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan and an Award
      Agreement entered into between the registered owner and MascoTech, Inc. 
      Copies of such Plan and Award Agreement are on file in the office of the
      Secretary of MascoTech, Inc., Taylor, Michigan."

            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the
      Company in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and
      conditions of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to
      the shares covered by the award, and such other matters, including com-
      pliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of
      withholding or providing for the payment of required taxes, as the
      Committee shall in its sole discretion determine.  The Committee may at
      any time amend the terms of any Agreement consistent with the terms of
      the Plan, except that without the participant's written consent no such
      amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the participant who is a
      party to such Agreement.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares
      covered by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates
      deposited with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the
      Restricted Period has expired, as follows:

                 (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                 (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or













                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
                 (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h) (1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder,
      in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each award
      theretofore granted shall immediately become fully vested and non-
      forfeitable and shall thereupon be distributed to participants as soon
      as practicable, free of all restrictions.  A Change in Control shall
      occur if any of the events described below in subparagraphs (A), (B) or
      (C) shall have occurred, unless the holder of any such award shall have
      consented to the application of subparagraph (C) in lieu of
      subparagraphs (A) and (B):

                 (A)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
            1934 (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
            in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exer-
            cisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any
            condition), of voting securities representing 25% or more of the
            combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of (A)
            the Company or (B) of Masco Corporation, a Delaware corporation
            ("Masco"); 

                 (B)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's or Masco's Board of Directors, and any
            new directors whose election by either such Board or nomination
            for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at least
            two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
            on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
            nomination for election as directors was previously so approved,
            for any reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the
            members thereof; or

                  (C) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by 








                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
            a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of such Board who
            were either directors on such Board at the beginning of the period
            or whose election or nomination for election as directors was
            previously so approved, for any reason cease to constitute at
            least a majority of the members thereof.  For purposes hereof,
            "Excluded Directors" are directors whose election by the Board or
            approval by the Board for stockholder election occurred within one
            year of any "person" or "group of persons", as such terms are used
            in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a
            tender offer for, or becoming the beneficial owner of, voting
            securities representing 25 percent or more of the combined voting
            power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company, other
            than pursuant to a tender offer approved by the Board prior to its
            commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions approved by the
            Board prior to their representing 25 percent or more of such
            combined voting power.

                  (2)(A)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in
            Control it is determined that any payment or distribution by the
            Company to or for the benefit of a participant, whether paid or
            payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of
            this Plan or otherwise, other than any payment pursuant to this
            subparagraph (2) (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax
            imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
            amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any interest or
            penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
            together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
            collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such
            participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within
            15 days following the determination described in (B) below, an
            additional payment ("Excise Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount
            such that after payment by such participant of all applicable
            Federal, state and local taxes (computed at the maximum marginal
            rates and including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
            to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Excise
            Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an amount of the
            Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon
            the Payments.

                  (B)   All determinations required to be made under this
            Section 5(h)(2), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment is required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment, shall be made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other
            national accounting firm as the Company, or, subsequent to a
            Change in Control, the Company and the participant jointly, may
            designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax, which shall provide
            detailed 









                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
            supporting calculations to the Company and the affected
            participant within 15 business days of the date of the applicable
            Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination by
            Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
            shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a
            result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
            the Code that may exist at the time of the initial determination
            hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payments will not have been made by the Company which should have
            been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax
            Adjustment Payments will have been made which should not have been
            made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations required
            to be made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such
            Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the
            benefit of the affected participant.  In the event that the
            participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the
            amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

                  (C)   This Section 5(h)(2) shall not apply to any award that
            was granted to an executive officer of the Company, as determined
            under the Exchange Act.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a
      participant may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor
      trust established by the participant for the sole benefit of the
      participant during the life of the participant, and under the terms of
      which the participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or
      physical or mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a
      written instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and
      the participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the
      agreement or other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment
      of the Committee the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign
      rights under an award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
      assignment is permitted by the terms of this Paragraph 5(i) or if after
      assignment, because of amendment, by force of law or any other reason
      such trust no longer meets such criteria, such attempted assignment
      shall be void and may be disregarded by the Committee and the Company
      and all rights to any awards shall revert to and remain solely in the
      participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the participant,
      and not the trust to which rights under an award may be assigned, for
      the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of the award,
      shall continue to be  considered an employee or consultant, as the case
      may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such
      trust and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
      conditions of the Agreement and the Plan.

<PAGE>
            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other in-
      strument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents
      delivered to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe
      genuine and any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be
      conclusive and binding upon the participant, his personal representa-
      tives and all persons asserting a claim based on an award granted
      pursuant to the Plan.  The delivery by a participant of a beneficiary
      designation, or an assignment of rights under an award as permitted by
      this Paragraph 5(i), shall constitute the participant's irrevocable
      undertaking to hold the Committee, the Company and its officers, agents
      and employees harmless against claims, including any cost or expense in-
      curred in defending against claims, of any person (including the
      participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based upon an award
      subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment.  In addition, the
      Company may decline to deliver shares to a beneficiary until it receives
      indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company. 
      Issuance of shares as to which restrictions have lapsed in the name of,
      and delivery to, the trust to which rights may be assigned shall be con-
      clusively considered issuance and delivery to the participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the
      procedures established by the Committee, may permit the participant to
      satisfy, in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding
      obligations when the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse by
      having withheld from the shares as to which the Restricted Period has
      expired or by delivering from shares of Common Stock of the Company
      owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market
      value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

            (k)  In its sole discretion the Committee may also provide the
      participant with the right to receive cash payments in connection with
      shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan (including shares
      previously awarded), the amount of which payments are based, in whole or
      only in part, on the value of such Common Stock.  The right to receive
      such payments shall be subject to such other terms and conditions not
      inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may determine.


6.    Changes in Capitalization

      In the event there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or
combination of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and
class of shares as to which awards may 










                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>
be granted under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee whose
determination thereof shall be conclusive.  Unless the Committee shall
otherwise determine, any shares of stock or other securities received by a
participant with respect to shares still subject to the restrictions imposed
by Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the same restrictions and shall be
deposited with the Company.

      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.


      7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of stockholders of the Company, no
amendment shall increase the total number of shares which may be awarded under
the Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December
31, 1999 or change the standards of eligibility to participate in the Plan. 
The total number of shares which may be awarded under the Plan may, however,
be adjusted without stockholder approval, pursuant to the adjustment
provisions described in Paragraph 6.


      8.  Effective Date and Termination of Plan

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1999.

                         MASCOTECH, INC.

                     1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                   (Restated December 6, 1995)


Article I.  Purpose

     The purpose of the 1984 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
MascoTech, Inc. (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent in
stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company
and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the
committee responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely
responsible for the Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to
accomplish this purpose by offering such employees and consultants an
opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  For
purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For purposes of Articles
III and VII of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other corporation (and
its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own stock
possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company
or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least
twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.


Article II.  Administration

     The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee")
consisting of three or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the
Board of Directors.  No director shall become or remain a member of the
Committee unless at the time of his exercise of any discretionary function as
a Committee member such director is not eligible, and has not at any time
within one year prior to the exercise of such discretion been eligible for
selection as a person to whom stock may be allocated or to whom stock options
or stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the Plan or any other
plan of the Company or any of its affiliates entitling the participants
therein to acquire stock, stock options or stock appreciation rights of the
Company or any of its affiliates.  The Committee shall have authority,
consistent with the Plan:












<PAGE>
          (a) to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
     Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
     options;

          (b) to determine the time or times when options shall be granted
     and the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each option;

          (c) to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
     option and the method of payment of such price;

          (d) to determine the time or times when each option becomes
     exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
     period;

          (e) to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing
     any options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required
     under the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;

          (f) to designate options granted to key employees of the Company
     or its "subsidiaries" under the Plan as "incentive stock options"
     ("ISOs"), as such terms are defined under the Internal Revenue Code;

          (g) to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
     administration of the Plan and the options and for its own acts and
     proceedings; and

          (h) to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
     disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan.

     All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be binding on all parties concerned.


Article III.  Participants

     Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries or
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company who are also employees
(who may also be directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person
who serves only as a director or a non-employee officer of the Company and any
consultant to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the
Committee in its discretion, are eligible to receive options under the Plan. 
The grant of an option to an employee or consultant shall not entitle such
individual to other grants or options, nor shall such grant disqualify such
individual from further participation.












                              - 2 -

Article IV.  Limitations

     No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1999, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.   Subject to
adjustment as provided in Article IX, the number of shares of Common Stock of
the Company which may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed in the
aggregate 8,160,000 shares; provided, however, that such total amount shall be
reduced by the aggregate number of shares of the Company's Common Stock
awarded under the Company's 1984 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan since the
original adoption thereof (other than shares forfeited to the Company which
are thereby available for further awards under Paragraph 2 of such Plan).  To
the extent that any option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate 
unexercised or for any reason become unexercisable as to any stock subject
thereto, such stock shall thereafter be available for further grants under the
Plan, within the limit specified above.  If an option granted under the Plan
shall be accepted for surrender pursuant to Article VIII, any stock covered by
options so accepted shall not thereafter be available for the granting of
other options under the Plan.

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied with
respect to such option:

           (a) Such option must be granted on or prior to May 1, 1994, and
     such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of ten
     years from the date such option is granted;

           (b) Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does
     not, determined at the time such option is granted, own capital  stock
     representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
     stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries,  or   (ii)
     the option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value,
     determined at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to
     such option and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than
     five years from the date it is granted;

           (c)   Such option by its terms is not exercisable while there is
     outstanding an ISO which was granted to the same employee at an earlier
     time.  For purposes of this clause (c), an ISO which has not been
     exercised in full shall be deemed to be outstanding, notwithstanding any
     cancellation or termination thereof, until the expiration of the period
     during which it could have been exercised under its original terms; and













                                    - 3 -

<PAGE>
           (d)   The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject
     to such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock
     subject to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee
     in the same calendar year (all determined at the respective dates of
     grant of such options) must not exceed $100,000 (the "Basic Amount")
     plus the sum of the "Carry-Over Amounts" for each of the three calendar
     years immediately preceding the year in which such option is granted.
     The "Carry-Over Amount", as used in this clause (d)  for any calendar
     year, shall mean (i) fifty percent of the amount by which $100,000
     exceeds the fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of
     Common Stock subject to ISOs which were granted during such calendar
     year to the employee for whom the Carry-Over Amount is being determined,
     or (ii) $50,000 in the case such employee has not in such calendar year
     been granted any ISO.    No amount shall be included in a Carry-Over
     Amount for any year to the extent such amount was theretofore
     necessarily included as a Carry-Over Amount to permit the qualification
     of an ISO under this clause (d), and Carry-Over Amounts shall only be
     utilized to permit the qualification of an ISO under this clause (d) in
     the order in which they first arose and then only if the Basic Amount
     has not theretofore been utilized to permit such qualification.


Article V.  Stock to be Issued

     The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, $1 par value.   Such Stock may be authorized but unissued shares or
shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to
shares purchased on the open market.   The Board of Directors and the officers
of the Company shall take any appropriate action required for such issuance.


Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

     All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such
other terms and condition as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

     (a)  Option Price.  Each option granted hereunder shall have such per
share option price as the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair
market value of Common Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

     (b) Terms of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven
years from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which
the option is awarded by the Committee.












                                    - 4 -

<PAGE>
     (c)  Exercise of Options.

           (i)  Each option shall be made exercisable not less than six
     months from the date of grant and at such time or times, whether or not
     in installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the time the option
     is granted.

           (ii) A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
     notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise
     of the option and of the number of shares of stock elected for exercise,
     such notice to be accompanied by such instruments or documents as may be
     required by the Committee, and such person shall at the time of such
     exercise tender the purchase price of the stock elected for exercise
     unless otherwise directed by the Committee.

           (iii) (A) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
     instruments evidencing options heretofore or hereafter granted
     hereunder, in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each
     Option then outstanding shall immediately become exercisable in full.  A
     Change in Control shall occur if any of the events described below in
     subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3) shall have occurred, unless the holder of
     any such option shall have consented to the application of subparagraph
     (3) in lieu of subparagraphs (1) and (2):

                 (1) any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
           used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
           1934 (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
           agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
           purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
           in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
           such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is
           exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to
           any condition), of voting securities representing 25% or more of
           the combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of
           (A) the Company or (B) of Masco Corporation, a Delaware
           corporation ("Masco");  
                 
                 (2) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
           months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
           constitute the Company's or Masco's Board of Directors, and any
           new directors whose election by either such Board or nomination
           for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at least
           two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
           on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
           nomination for election as directors was previously so 











                                    - 5 -

<PAGE>
           approved, for any reason cease to constitute at least a majority
           of the members thereof; or

                 (3)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
           months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
           constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
           (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
           election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
           was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
           such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
           beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
           election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
           cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
           For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose
           election by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder
           election occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of
           persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
           the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the
           beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or
           more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting
           securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer
           approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to
           stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their
           representing 25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

           (B)(1)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
     is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
     the benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
     distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
     than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (B) (a "Payment"), would
     be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any
     interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
     together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
     collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such participant
     shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
     the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
     Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
     participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
     at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
     imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
     upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an
     amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
     imposed upon the Payments.












                                    - 6 -

<PAGE>
           (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Article
     VI(c)(iii)(B), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
     required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
     made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
     as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
     the participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
     which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
     the affected participant within 15 business days of the date of the
     applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
     by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
     shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a result of
     the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
     exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
     that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made
     by the Company which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y)
     certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have been made which should
     not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations
     required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such
     Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit
     of the affected participant.  In the event that the participant
     discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the amount thereof
     shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

           (3)   This Article VI(c)(iii)(B) shall not apply to any  option
     that was granted to an executive officer of the Company, as determined
     under the Exchange Act.

     (d) Payment for Issuance of Stock.  Upon and at the time of exercise of
any option granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all
such stock then being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the
Committee, in whole or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its
then fair market value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in
its discretion permit the issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as
it deems reasonable, provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase
price shall be evidenced by a promissory note at such rate of interest and
upon such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate. 
In all cases where stock is issued for less than present full payment of the
purchase price, there shall be placed upon the certificate or certificates
representing such stock a legend setting forth the amount paid at issuance,
and the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and stating that the stock is subject
to call for the remainder and may not be transferred by the holder until the
balance due thereon shall be fully paid.

     The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the procedures
established by the Committee, may permit a participant 










                                    - 7 -

<PAGE>
to satisfy, in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding
obligations in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified stock option
under the Plan by having withheld from the shares to be issued upon the
exercise of the option or by delivering from shares of Common Stock of the
Company owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market
value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

     (e) Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue
any stock unless and until:

           (i) in the event of the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at
     the time listed upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be
     issued have been listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon
     official notice of issuance, upon such exchange, and

           (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
     compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
     delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
     Company's counsel.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the
Securities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be
in accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or
otherwise.  The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the
Company in such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a
stockholder only as and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the
participant pursuant to the Plan.

     (f) Nontransferability of Options.  No option may be transferred by the
participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in subsection
(j) of this Article, or by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and
during the participant's lifetime the option may be exercised only by the
participant.

     (g) Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must
agree to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or
the consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually
agreed upon) for at least one year from the date of the granting of the
option, subject to the right of the Company, its subsidiary or affiliated
company to terminate the participant's employment or consulting arrangement at
any time.









                                    - 8 -

<PAGE>
     (h) Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including
termination by reason of the fact that such corporation is no longer a
subsidiary of affiliated company) other than the participant's death or
permanent and total disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on
or after normal retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the
opinion of the Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify
termination of the option, the participant may thereafter exercise the option
as provided below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of the
participant, the option may be exercised only within ten days after the date
of termination unless a longer period is permitted by the Committee in its
discretion.  If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
participant, the option may be exercised within three months after the day of
termination.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan, in no event may a
participant whose employment or consulting agreement has been terminated
voluntarily or involuntarily exercise an option at a time when the option
would not have been exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement
continued.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may by the express
terms of the grant of the option extend the aforesaid periods of time within
which the participant may exercise an option after the termination of
employment or the consulting arrangement.  For purposes of this Article VI(h),
a participant's employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
terminated (i) in the case of sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence
(not to exceed one year unless otherwise approved by the Committee), (ii) in
the case of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among the
Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or (iii) by virtue of a
change of status from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee. 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or the grant of the option, an
option may be exercised only to the extent exercisable on the date of
termination of employment or of the consulting arrangement by reason of death,
permanent and total disability, retirement or otherwise.

     (i) Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an
option the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and
total disability, such option may be exercised to the extent exercisable on
the date of retirement or such termination, provided such option shall be
exercised within three months of the date of retirement or such termination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its discretion the Committee may permit the
exercise of an option held by a retired or disabled option holder upon other
terms and conditions as it deems advisable under the circumstances, and if the
period within which an option may be exercised has been extended the Committee
may terminate all unexercised options if it shall determine that the
participant has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's
interests.











                                    - 9 -

<PAGE>
     (j) Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise an
option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such further
period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised, as to all or
any of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase immediately
prior to death (unless the Committee shall have provided in the instrument
evidencing such option that all shares covered by the option are subject to
purchase upon death), by the person or persons designated in writing by the
participant in such form of beneficiary designation as may be approved by the
Company, or failing designation by the participant's personal representative,
executor or administrator or the person or persons to whom the option is
transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.  The
Company may decline to deliver shares to a designated beneficiary until it
receives indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the
Company.  Except as so exercised such option shall expire at the end of such
period.


Article VII.  Replacement Options

     The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms differing from
those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted in
substitution for options held by employees of or consultants who have written
agreement to render services to other entities who concurrently become
employees of or consultants to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated
company as the result of a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of
such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company,
or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company of
the business, property or stock of such other entity.  The Committee may
direct that the substitute options be granted on such terms and conditions as
the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.


Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

     The Committee may, in its discretion and under such terms and conditions
as it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or
shares of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the
date of such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided
that the Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose
of the Plan.












                                   - 10 -

<PAGE>
Article IX.  Changes in Stock

     The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any,
as it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be
granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to
options then outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such
outstanding options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of
capital stock, any special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary
transaction (including a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to which the
Company is a party.  The determination of the Board of Directors as to such
matters shall be binding on all persons. 


Article X.  Employment Rights

     The adoption of the Plan does not confer upon any employee of or
consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any right
to continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any
way impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company
to terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting
arrangement with any of its consultants at any time.


Article XI.  Amendments

     The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the
Plan.  The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of any changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the
extent permitted under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company no such amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of
stock available under the Plan, or alter the class of persons eligible to
receive options under the Plan, or without the consent of the participant void
or diminish options previously granted, nor increase or accelerate the
conditions and actions required for the exercise of the same, except that
nothing herein shall limit the Company's right to call stock, issued for
deferred payment which is evidenced by promissory note where the participant
is in default of the obligations on such note.

                          MASCO CORPORATION

                1988 RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated December 6, 1995)



1.  Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the Plan is to aid Masco Corporation (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in attracting and retaining key
employees and consultants of outstanding ability.  In addition, the Company
expects that it will benefit from the added interest which such individuals
will have in its welfare as a result of their ownership or increased ownership
of the Company's Common Stock.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any
corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock
possessing more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock, and an "affiliated company" is any other corporation, at
least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of which is owned by the Company or by one or more other corporations in
a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent of the stock of each of which
is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another corporation within such
chain.

2.  Stock Subject to the Plan

      The shares which may be awarded under the Plan are shares of the
Company's Common Stock, $1 par value.  Subject to adjustment as provided in
Paragraph 6, the total number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that may
be awarded under the Plan shall not exceed 8,000,000; provided, however, that
such number of shares shall be reduced by the number of shares of the
Company's Common Stock as to which options have been granted under the
Company's 1988 Stock Option Plan (other than shares which are available for
further grants under Article IV of such plan notwithstanding the prior grant
of options with respect to such shares).  Such stock may be authorized but
unissued shares or shares reacquired by the Company, including but not limited
to shares purchased on the open market.  Shares of stock awarded under the
Plan which are later reacquired by the Company as a result of forfeiture
pursuant to the Plan shall again become available for awards under the Plan.

<PAGE>
3.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Members of the Committee shall be "disinterested persons" as such term is
defined in Rule 16b-3(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act") or any rule which modifies, amends or replaces Rule 16b-3(d). 
The Committee shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, (a) to
determine the terms and conditions of each award, (b) to interpret the Plan
and the agreements entered into pursuant to the Plan, (c) to adopt, amend and
rescind rules and regulations for its administration and the awards, (d) to
delegate to directors of the Company, who need not be "disinterested persons"
within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
authority to amend awards granted to participants, provided such participants
are not directors or officers of the Company for purposes of Section 16, and
generally to conduct and administer the Plan and to make all determinations in
connection therewith which may be necessary or advisable, and all such actions
of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned.

4.  Eligibility

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the
Committee in its discretion, are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. 
The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion the number of shares to
be awarded to each participant.

5.  Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in each Award Agreement
("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

















                                      -2-

<PAGE>
            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less
      than ninety days.  Such Restricted Period may differ among participants
      and may have different expiration dates with respect to portions of
      shares covered by the same award.  The Committee may also determine that
      the expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to such
      additional terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion and
      as set forth in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of Common Stock awarded to participants may not be
      sold, encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter
      provided, during the Restricted Period pertaining to such shares. 
      Except for such restrictions on transfer, the participant shall have all
      the rights of a stockholder including but not limited to the right to
      receive all dividends paid on such shares (subject to the provisions of
      Paragraph 6) and the right to vote such shares.

            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any
      reason (including termination by reason of the fact that any corporation
      is no longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other than death,
      permanent and total disability, or, in the case of an employee,
      retirement on or after normal retirement date, all shares of stock
      theretofore awarded to the participant which are still subject to the
      restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination of
      employment or the consulting relationship be forfeited and transferred
      back to the Company, provided, however, that if such employment or
      consulting relationship is terminated by action of the Company or any of
      its subsidiaries or affiliated companies without cause or by agreement
      of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and
      the participant, the Committee may, but need not, determine that some or
      all of the shares shall not be so forfeited, and provided further that
      the Committee may remove or modify restrictions on shares which are not
      forfeited.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5(c), a participant's
      employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated
      (i) in the case of transfers of employment or the consulting arrangement
      among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by
      virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from
      consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of interruption in service,

















                                      -3-

<PAGE>
      not exceeding one year in duration unless otherwise approved by the
      Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if an employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
      companies by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date,
      the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to
      the shares then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided
      to the contrary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Each certificate or other evidence of ownership issued in
      respect of shares awarded under the Plan shall be registered in the name
      of the participant and deposited on behalf of the participant with the
      Company, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, and shall bear
      the following legend:

                  "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this
            certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject
            to the terms and conditions (including a contingent transfer ob-
            ligation) contained in the Masco Corporation 1988 Restricted Stock
            Incentive Plan and an award agreement entered into between the
            registered owner and Masco Corporation.  Copies of such Plan and
            Agreement are on file in the office of the Secretary of Masco
            Corporation, Taylor, Michigan."
            
            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the
      Company in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and
      conditions of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to
      the shares covered by the award, and such other matters, including
      compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and methods
      of withholding or providing for the payment of required taxes, as the
      Committee in its sole discretion shall determine.  The Committee may at
      any time amend the terms of any Agreement consistent with the terms of
      the Plan, except that without the participant's written consent no such
      amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the participant.



















                                      -4-

<PAGE>
            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares
      covered by any award, the Company shall deliver the stock certificates
      deposited with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the
      Restricted Period has expired, as follows:

                  (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                  (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                  (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h) (1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards granted hereunder, in the case of a Change
      in Control of the Company, each award theretofore granted shall immedi-
      ately become fully vested and non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be
      distributed to participants as soon as practicable, free of all
      restrictions.  A Change in Control shall occur if any of the events
      described below in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) shall have occurred,
      unless the holder of any such award shall have consented to the
      application of subparagraph (C) in lieu of subparagraphs (A) and (B):

                  (A)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise
            becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d3 under the
            Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such beneficial
            ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately,
            with the passage of time, or subject to any condition), of voting
            securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting power
            of all outstanding voting se-

<PAGE>
            curities of the Company; 

                  (B)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

                  (C) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
            such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
            For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose
            election by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder
            election occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of
            persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
            the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the
            beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting
            securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer
            approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to
            stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their
            representing 25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

                  (2)(A)  In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control
            it is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company
            to or for the benefit of a participant, whether paid or 



















                                      -6-

<PAGE>
            payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of
            this Plan or otherwise, other than any payment pursuant to this
            subparagraph (2) (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax
            imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
            amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any interest or
            penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
            together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
            collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such
            participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within
            15 days following the determination described in (B) below, an
            additional payment ("Excise Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount
            such that after payment by such participant of all applicable
            Federal, state and local taxes (computed at the maximum marginal
            rates and including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
            to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Excise
            Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an amount of the
            Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon
            the Payments.

                  (B)  All determinations required to be made under this
            Section 5(h)(2), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment is required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment, shall be made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other
            national accounting firm as the Company, or, subsequent to a
            Change in Control, the Company and the participant jointly, may
            designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax, which shall provide
            detailed supporting calculations to the Company and the affected
            participant within 15 business days of the date of the applicable
            Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination by
            Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
            shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a
            result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
            the Code that may exist at the time of the initial determination
            hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payments will not have been made by the Company which should have
            been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax
            Adjustment Payments will have been made which should not have been
            made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the 


















                                      -7-

<PAGE>
            calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an
            Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
            Company to or for the benefit of the affected participant.  In the
            event that the participant discovers that an Overpayment shall
            have occurred, the amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the
            Company.

                  (C)  This Section 5(h)(2) shall not apply to any award that
            was granted to an executive officer of the Company, as determined
            under the Exchange Act.
      
            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a
      participant may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor
      trust established by the participant for the sole benefit of the
      participant during the life of the participant, and under the terms of
      which the participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or
      physical or mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a
      written instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and
      the participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the
      agreement or other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment
      of the Committee the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign
      rights under an award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
      assignment is permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after
      assignment, because of amendment, by force of law or any other reason
      such trust no longer meets such criteria, such attempted assignment
      shall be void and may be disregarded by the Committee and the Company
      and all rights to any awards shall revert to and remain solely in the
      participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the participant,
      and not the trust to which rights under an award may be assigned, for
      the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of the award
      shall continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as the case
      may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such
      trust and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
      conditions of the Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other
      instrument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other docu-
      ments delivered to them by or on behalf of the participant which they
      believe genuine and any action 
















                                      -8-

<PAGE>
      taken by them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and binding upon
      the participant, his personal representatives and all persons asserting
      a claim based on an award granted pursuant to this Plan.  The delivery
      by a participant of a beneficiary designation, or an assignment of
      rights under an award as permitted by this Paragraph 5(i), shall
      constitute the participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the
      Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees harmless
      against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in defending
      against claims, of any person (including the participant) which may be
      asserted or alleged to be based upon an award subject to a beneficiary
      designation or an assignment.  In addition, the Company may decline to
      deliver shares to a beneficiary until it receives indemnity against
      claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company.  Issuance of shares
      as to which restrictions have lapsed in the name of, and delivery to,
      the trust to which rights may be assigned shall be conclusively
      considered issuance and delivery to the participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its
      procedures, may permit the participant to satisfy, in whole or in part,
      the applicable income tax withholding obligations when the restrictions
      imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse by having shares withheld from the
      shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering
      shares of Common Stock of the Company having a fair market value equal
      to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.

            (k)   In its sole discretion the Committee may also provide the
      participant with the right to receive cash payments in connection with
      shares of Common Stock awarded under the Plan (including shares
      previously awarded), the amount of which payments are based, in whole or
      only in part, on the value of such Common Stock.  The right to receive
      such payments shall be subject to such other terms and conditions not
      inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may determine.

6.  Changes in Capitalization

      If there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or combination
of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the outstanding
Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and class of shares
as to which awards may be granted under the Plan 

















                                      -9-
<PAGE>
shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee whose determination thereof
shall be conclusive.  Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, any
shares of stock or other securities received by a participant with respect to
shares still subject to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be
subject to the same restrictions and shall be deposited with the Company.

      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the re-
strictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.

7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of the Company's stockholders no
amendment shall increase the number of shares which may be awarded under the
Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December 31,
1998 or change the standards of eligibility of employees or consultants
eligible to participate in the Plan.  The number of shares awardable under the
Plan may, however, without stockholder approval, be adjusted pursuant to the
adjustment provisions described in Paragraph 6 hereof.

8.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan, the award of stock hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not confer upon any employee of
or consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any
right to continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company
or a subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in
any way impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated
company to terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting
arrangement with any of its consultants at any time, with or without cause,
unless a written employment or consulting agreement provides otherwise.

9.  Effective Date and Termination of Awards

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1998.

                             MASCO CORPORATION
                          1988 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                        (Restated December 6, 1995)


Article I.  Purpose

      The purpose of the 1988 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
Masco Corporation (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent
in stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company
and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the
committee responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely
responsible for the Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to
accomplish this purpose by offering such employees and consultants an
opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  For
purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock, and an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company
or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least
twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.

Article II.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
Members of the Committee shall be "disinterested persons" as such term is
defined in Rule 16b-3(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act") or any rule which modifies, amends or replaces Rule 16b-3(d). 
The Committee shall have authority, consistent with the Plan:

            (a)  to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
      Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
      options;

            (b)  to determine the time or times when options shall be granted
      and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each option;

            (c)  to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
      option and the method of payment of such price;

            (d)  to determine the time or times when each option becomes
      exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
      period;









<PAGE>
            (e)  to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing
      options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required
      under the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;

            (f)  to designate options granted to key employees of the Company
      or its subsidiaries under the Plan as "incentive stock options"
      ("ISOs"), as such terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of
      1986;

            (g)  to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
      administration of the Plan and options and for its own acts and
      proceedings; and

            (h)  to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
      disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan.

      All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned.

Article III.  Participants

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company or
who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with the
corporation in question), as may be selected from time to time by the
Committee in its discretion, are eligible to receive options under the Plan. 
The grant of an option to an employee or consultant shall not entitle such
individual to other grants or options, nor shall such grant disqualify such
individual from further participation.

Article IV.  Limitations

      No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1998, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.  Subject to
adjustment as provided in Article IX, the number of shares of Common Stock of
the Company which may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 8,000,000;
provided, however, that such number of shares shall be reduced by the number
of shares of the Company's Common Stock awarded under the Company's 1988
Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (other than shares awarded under such plan
which are later forfeited to the Company).  To the extent that any option
granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate unexercised or for any reason
become unexercisable, any stock theretofore subject to such expired or
terminated option shall thereafter be available for further grants under the
Plan.  If an option granted under the Plan shall be accepted for surrender
pursuant to Article VIII, any stock subject to such option shall not
thereafter be available for further grants.







                                      -2-

<PAGE>
      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:

            (a)  Such option must be granted on or prior to April 1, 1998, and
      such option by its terms must not be exercisable after the expiration of
      ten years from the date such option is granted;

            (b)  Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does
      not, determined at the time such option is granted, own capital stock
      representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
      stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) the
      option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value,
      determined at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to
      such option and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than
      five years from the date it is granted; and

            (c)  The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject
      to such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock
      subject to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee
      exercisable in the same calendar year (all determined at the respective
      dates of grant of such options) must not exceed $100,000.

Article V.  Stock to be Issued

      The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, $1 par value.  Such stock may be authorized but unissued shares or
shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to
shares purchased on the open market.  The Board of Directors and the officers
of the Company shall take any appropriate action required for such issuance.

Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

      All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such
other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.


      (a)  Option Price.  Each option shall have such per share option price
as the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair market value of
Common Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

      (b)  Term of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven
years from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which
the option is awarded by the Committee.

      (c)  Exercise of Options.










                                      -3-

<PAGE>
            (i)  Each option shall be made exercisable not less than six
      months from the date of grant and at such time or times, whether or not
      in installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the time the option
      is granted."

            (ii)  A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
      notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise
      of the option and the number of shares of stock elected for exercise,
      such notice to be accompanied by such instruments or documents as may be
      required by the Committee, and shall tender the purchase price of the
      stock elected for exercise unless otherwise directed by the Committee.

            (iii) (A) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing options granted hereunder, in the case of a
      Change in Control of the Company, each option then outstanding shall
      immediately become exercisable in full.  A Change in Control shall occur
      if any of the events described below in subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3)
      shall have occurred, unless the holder of any such option shall have
      consented to the application of subparagraph (3) in lieu of
      subparagraphs (1) and (2):

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise
            becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
            Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire such beneficial
            ownership (whether or not such right is exercisable immediately,
            with the passage of time, or subject to any condition) of voting
            securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting power
            of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; 

                 (2)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning  of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

                 (3)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
            such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as 





                                      -4-

<PAGE>
            directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
            constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.  For
            purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose election
            by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder election
            occurred within one year of any "person" or "group of persons", as
            such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange
            Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming the beneficial
            owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or more of the
            combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the
            Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer approved by the
            Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions
            approved by the Board prior to their representing 25 percent or
            more of such combined voting power.

            (B)(1) In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it is
      determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
      benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (B) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)  All determinations required to be made under this Article
      VI(c)(iii)(B), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
      exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
      that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made
      by the Company which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or 







                                      -5-

<PAGE>
      (y) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have been made which
      should not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the
      calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an
      Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to
      or for the benefit of the affected participant.  In the event that the
      participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the
      amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (3)  This Article VI(c)(iii)(B) shall not apply to any option that
      was granted  to an executive officer of the Company, as determined under
      the Exchange Act.

      (d)  Payment for Issuance of Stock.  At the time of exercise of any
option granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all
stock then being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the
Committee, in whole or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its
then fair market value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in
its discretion permit the issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as
it deems reasonable, provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase
price shall be evidenced by a promissory note at such rate of interest and
upon such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate. 
In all cases where stock is issued for less than present full payment of the
purchase price, there shall be placed upon the certificate or certificates
representing such stock a legend setting forth the amount paid at issuance,
and the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and stating that the stock is subject
to call for the remainder and may not be transferred by the holder until the
balance due thereon shall be fully paid.

      The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with its procedures,
may permit a participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, the income tax
withholding obligations in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified
stock option by having shares withheld from the shares to be issued upon the
exercise of the option or by delivering shares of Common Stock of the Company
having a fair market value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such
obligations.

      (e)  Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to
issue any stock unless and until:

            (i)  if the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at the time
      listed upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be issued have
      been listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice
      of issuance, upon such exchange, and

            (ii)  in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
      compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
      delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
      Company's counsel.








                                      -6-

<PAGE>
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the
Securities Act of 1933 as then in effect and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be
in accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or
otherwise.  The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the
Company in such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a
stockholder only as and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the
participant pursuant to the Plan.

      (f)  Nontransferability of Options.  No options may be transferred by
the participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in
subsection (j) of this Article, or by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and during the participant's lifetime the option may be
exercised only by the participant.

      (g)  Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must
agree to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or
the consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually
agreed upon) for at least ninety days from the date the option is granted.

      (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including
termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a
subsidiary or affiliated company) other than the participant's death or
permanent and total disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on
or after normal retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the
opinion of the Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify
termination of the option, the participant may thereafter exercise the option
as provided below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of the par-
ticipant, the option may be exercised only within ten days after the day of
termination.  If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
participant, the option may be exercised within three months after the day of
termination.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan or the option, whether
the termination of employment or consulting arrangement is voluntary or
involuntary, options may be exercised only if such options were exercisable at
the date of such termination, and an option may not be exercised at a time
when the option would not have been exercisable had the employment or
consulting arrangement continued.  Notwithstanding the preceding three sen-
tences, the Committee may extend the time within which or alter the terms and
conditions on which the participant may exercise an option after the termi-
nation of employment or the consulting arrangement, and if the period within
which an option may be exercised has been extended, the Committee may
terminate the unexercised portion of the option if it shall determine that the
participant has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's
interests.  For purposes of this Article VI(h), a participant's employment or
consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated (i) in the case of
approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence (not to exceed one
year unless otherwise approved by the Com-





                                      -7-

<PAGE>
mittee), (ii) in the case of a transfer of employment or the consulting ar-
rangement among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or
(iii) by virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from
consultant to employee.

      (i)  Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an
option the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and
total disability, such option may be exercised to the extent exercisable on
the date of retirement or such termination, provided such option shall be
exercised within three months of the date of retirement or such termination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its discretion the Committee may extend the
time within which or alter the terms and conditions on which an option held by
a retired or disabled option holder may be exercised, and if the period within
which an option may be exercised has been extended, the Committee may
terminate the unexercised portion of the option if it shall determine that the
participant has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's
interests.

      (j)  Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise
an option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such
further period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised, as to
all or any of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase im-
mediately prior to death (or such additional shares covered by the option as
the Committee may allow), by the person or persons designated in writing by
the participant in such form of beneficiary designation as may be approved by
the Company, or failing designation by the participant's personal representa-
tive, executor or administrator or the person or persons to whom the option is
transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.  The
Company may decline to deliver shares to a designated beneficiary until it
receives indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the
Company.  Except as so exercised such option shall expire at the end of such
period.

Article VII.  Replacement Options

      The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms and conditions
differing from those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted
in substitution for options held by employees of or consultants to other
entities who concurrently become employees of or consultants to the Company or
a subsidiary or an affiliated company as the result of a merger, consolidation
or other reorganization of such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary
or an affiliated company, or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or
an affiliated company of the business, property or stock of such other entity. 
The Committee may direct that the replacement options be granted on such terms
and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.










                                      -8-

<PAGE>
Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

      The Committee may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions
as it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or
shares of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the
date of such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided
that the Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose
of the Plan.

Article IX.  Changes in Stock

      The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any,
as it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be
granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to
options then outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such
outstanding options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of
capital stock, any special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary
transaction (including a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to which the
Company is a party.  The determination of the Board of Directors as to such
matters shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

Article X.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan, the grant of options hereunder and the
participation by a participant in the Plan do not confer upon any employee of
or consultant to the Company or subsidiary or an affiliated company any right
to continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any
way impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company
to terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting
arrangement with any of its consultants at any time, with or without cause,
unless a written employment or consulting agreement provides otherwise.

 Article XI.  Amendments

      The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the
extent permitted under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company no amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of stock
available under the Plan, alter the class of persons eligible to receive
options under the Plan, or without the consent of the participant void or
diminish options previously granted, nor increase or accelerate the conditions
required for the exercise of the same, except that nothing herein shall limit
the Company's right 






                                      -9-

<PAGE>
under Article VI(d) to call stock, issued for deferred payment which is evi-
denced by a promissory note, where the participant is in default of the
obligations of such note.

                               MASCO CORPORATION

               1984 RESTRICTED STOCK (INDUSTRIES) INCENTIVE PLAN

                          (Restated December 6, 1995)


1.    Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the 1984 Restricted Stock (Industries) Incentive Plan
(the "Plan") is to aid Masco Corporation (the "Company") and its subsidiaries
and affiliated companies in securing and retaining key employees and
consultants of outstanding ability and to motivate such individuals to exert
their best efforts on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies.  In addition, the Company expects that it will benefit
from the added interest which such individuals will have in its welfare as a
result of their ownership or increased ownership in common stock of an
affiliated Company, MascoTech, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly Masco
Industries, Inc. and referred to herein as "Industries").  For purposes of
this Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For purposes of Paragraph 4 of
the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other corporation (and its
subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own stock possessing at
least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any
other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power
of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company or by one or more
other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent of the
stock of each of which is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another
corporation within such chain.


2.    Stock Subject to the Plan

      The total number of shares of stock that may be awarded under the Plan
is 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock of Industries, $1.00 par value.  Such
stock may be any shares of Industries Common Stock owned by the Company. 
Shares of stock awarded under the Plan which are later reacquired by the Com-
pany as a result of forfeiture pursuant to the Plan shall again become
available for awards under the Plan.


3.    Administration

      The Board of Directors of the Company shall appoint a committee (the
"Committee") consisting of three or more members of the Board of Directors who
shall administer the Plan.  No director 









<PAGE>
shall become or remain a member of the Committee unless at the time of his
exercise of any discretionary function as a Committee member such director is
not eligible and has not at any time within one year prior to the exercise of
such discretion been eligible for selection as a person to whom stock may be
allocated or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted
pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of its affiliates
entitling the participants therein to acquire stock, stock options or stock
appreciation rights of the Company or any of its affiliates.  The Committee
shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, (a) to determine the terms
and conditions of each award, (b) to interpret the Plan and the agreements
under the Plan, (c) to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
administration of the Plan and the awards, (d) to delegate to directors of the
Company, who need not be "disinterested persons" within the meaning of Rule
16b-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the authority to amend awards granted
to participants, provided such participants are not directors or officers of
the Company for purposes of Section 16, and generally to conduct and adminis-
ter the Plan and to make all determinations in connection therewith which may
be necessary or advisable.  All such actions of the Committee shall be binding
upon all participants.


4.    Eligibility
      
      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company),
as may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are
eligible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine in
its sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to each such partici-
pant.


5.    Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Industries' Common Stock awarded to participants under
this Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, and to such
other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as shall be
contained in each Award Agreement ("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

            (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the
      shares of each participant a "Restricted Period" of transfer which shall
      be not less than one year.  Such Restricted Period may differ among
      participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of shares 










                                     - 2 -

<PAGE>
      covered by the same award.  The Committee may also determine that the
      expiration of any Restricted Period shall be subject to such additional
      terms and conditions as it decides in its sole discretion and as set
      forth in the participant's Agreement.

            (b)  Shares of stock awarded to participants may not be sold,
      encumbered or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided,
      during the Restricted Period pertaining to such shares.  Except for such
      restrictions on transfer, the participant shall have all the rights of a
      stockholder including but not limited to the right to receive all
      dividends paid on such shares (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6)
      and the right to vote such shares.
      
            (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any
      reason (including termination by reason of the fact that any corporation
      is no longer a subsidiary or affiliated company), other than death, per-
      manent and total disability, or, in the case of an employee, retirement
      on or after normal retirement date, all shares of stock theretofore
      awarded to the participant which are still subject to the restrictions
      imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination be forfeited and
      transferred back to the Company, provided, however, that in the event
      such employment or consulting relationship is terminated by action of
      the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies without
      cause or by agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
      affiliated companies and the participant, the Committee may, but need
      not, determine that some or all of such shares shall not be forfeited
      but instead shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may
      establish or that some or all of such shares shall be free of restric-
      tions.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5(c), a participant's employment
      or consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated (i) in the
      case of transfers of employment or the consulting arrangement among the
      Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by virtue of a
      change of status from employee to consultant or from consultant to
      employee, or (iii) in the case of interruption in service, not exceeding
      one year in duration unless otherwise approved by the Committee, for ap-
      proved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence.

            (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of
      death or permanent and total disability or if any employee ceases to be
      employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated
      companies by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement date,
      the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall lapse with respect to
      the shares 










                                     - 3 -

<PAGE>
      then subject to restrictions, except to the extent provided to the con-
      trary in the Agreement.

            (e)  Each certificate issued in respect of shares awarded under
      the Plan shall be registered in the name of the participant and
      deposited by the participant with the Company, together with a stock
      power endorsed in blank, and shall bear the following legend:

            "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this certificate and
      the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and
      conditions (including a contingent transfer obligation) contained in the
      Masco Corporation's 1984 Restricted Stock (Industries) Incentive Plan
      and an Award Agreement entered into between the registered owner and
      Masco Corporation.  Copies of such Plan and Award Agreement are on file
      in the office of the Secretary of Masco Corporation, Taylor, Michigan."

            (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the
      Company in a form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and
      conditions of the award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to
      the shares covered by the award, and such other matters, including com-
      pliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and methods of
      withholding or providing for the payment of required taxes, as the
      Committee shall in its sole discretion determine.  The Committee may at
      any time amend the terms of any Agreement consistent with the terms of
      the Plan, except that without the participant's written consent no such
      amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the participant who is a
      party to such Agreement.

            (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares
      covered by any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates
      deposited with it pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the
      Restricted Period has expired, as follows:

                 (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance
            with Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

                 (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death
            and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the
            Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                 (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
            representative of the participant's estate.

      Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent
      that such certificates may be reissued without legend.

            (h) (1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing awards heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder,
      in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each award granted at
      least one year prior thereto shall immediately become fully vested and
      non-forfeitable and shall thereupon be distributed to participants as
      soon as practicable, free of all restrictions.  

            (2) With respect to any award granted hereunder prior to December
      6, 1995, a Change in Control shall occur if:

                 (A)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
            1934 (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
            in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exer-
            cisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any
            condition), of voting securities representing 25% or more of the
            combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the
            Company; or

                 (B)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

            (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (2),
      with respect to awards granted hereunder on or after December 6,
      1995, a Change in Control shall occur only if the event described
      in this subparagraph (3) shall have occurred.  With respect to any
      other Award granted prior thereto, a Change in Control shall occur
      if any of the events described in subparagraphs (2) or (3) shall
      have occurred, unless the holder of any such Award shall have
      consented to the application of this subparagraph (3) in lieu of
      the foregoing subparagraph (2).  A Change in Control for purposes
      of this subparagraph (3) shall occur if, during any period of
      twenty-four consecutive calendar months, the individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Company's Board of
      Directors, and any new directors (other than Excluded Directors,
      as hereinafter defined), whose election by such Board or









                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
      nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
      on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
      nomination for election as directors was previously so approved, for any
      reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
      For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose election
      by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder election occurred
      within one year of any "person" or "group of persons", as such terms are
      used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a
      tender offer for, or becoming the beneficial owner of, voting securities
      representing 25 percent or more of the combined voting power of all
      outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a
      tender offer approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant
      to stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their representing
      25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

                  (4)(A)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in
            Control it is determined that any payment or distribution by the
            Company to or for the benefit of a participant, whether paid or
            payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of
            this Plan or otherwise, other than any payment pursuant to this
            subparagraph (4) (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax
            imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
            amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any interest or
            penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
            together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
            collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such
            participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within
            15 days following the determination described in (B) below, an
            additional payment ("Excise Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount
            such that after payment by such participant of all applicable
            Federal, state and local taxes (computed at the maximum marginal
            rates and including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
            to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Excise
            Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an amount of the
            Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon
            the Payments.

                  (B)   All determinations required to be made under this
            Section 5(h)(4) , including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment is required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payment, shall be made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other
            national accounting firm as the Company, or, subsequent to a
            Change in Control, the Company and the participant jointly, may
            designate, for 











                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
            purposes of the Excise Tax, which shall provide detailed
            supporting calculations to the Company and the affected
            participant within 15 business days of the date of the applicable
            Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination by
            Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
            shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a
            result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
            the Code that may exist at the time of the initial determination
            hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment
            Payments will not have been made by the Company which should have
            been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax
            Adjustment Payments will have been made which should not have been
            made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations required
            to be made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such
            Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the
            benefit of the affected participant.  In the event that the
            participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the
            amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

                  (C)   This Section 5(h)(4)shall not apply to any Award (x)
            that was granted prior to February 17, 1993 and (y) the holder of
            which is an executive officer of the Company, as determined under
            the Exchange Act.

            (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a
      participant may assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor
      trust established by the participant for the sole benefit of the
      participant during the life of the participant, and under the terms of
      which the participant is and remains the sole trustee until death or
      physical or mental incapacity.  Such assignment shall be effected by a
      written instrument in form and content satisfactory to the Committee and
      the participant shall deliver to the Committee a true copy of the agree-
      ment or other document evidencing such trust.  If in the judgment of the
      Committee the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign rights
      under an award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
      assignment is permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after
      assignment, because of amendment, by force of law or any other reason
      such trust no longer meets such criteria, such attempted assignment
      shall be void and may be disregarded by the Committee and the Company
      and all rights to any awards shall revert to and remain solely in the
      participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified assignment, the participant,
      and not the trust to which rights under an award may be assigned, for
      the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason of the award
      shall continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as the case
      may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such 










                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
      trust and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
      conditions of the Award Agreement and this Plan.

            The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
      may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other in-
      strument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any other documents
      delivered to them by or on behalf of the participant which they believe
      genuine and any action taken by them in reliance thereon shall be
      conclusive and binding upon the participant, his personal representa-
      tives and all persons asserting a claim based on an award granted
      pursuant to this Plan.  The delivery by a participant of a beneficiary
      designation, or an assignment of rights under an award as permitted by
      this Paragraph 5(i), shall constitute the participant's irrevocable
      undertaking to hold the Committee, the Company and its officers, agents
      and employees harmless against claims, including any cost or expense in-
      curred in defending against claims, of any person (including the
      participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based upon an award
      subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment.  In addition, the
      Company may decline to deliver shares to a beneficiary until it receives
      indemnity against claims of third parties satisfactory to the Company. 
      Issuance of shares as to which restrictions have lapsed in the name of,
      and delivery to, the trust to which rights may be assigned shall be con-
      clusively considered issuance and delivery to the participant.

            (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the
      procedures established by the Committee, may permit the participant to
      satisfy, in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding
      obligations when the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse:  (1)
      in the case of participants who are employees of or consultants to
      Industries or any of its subsidiaries, by having withheld from the
      shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or by delivering
      from shares of Common Stock of Industries owned by the participant such
      number of shares having a fair market value equal to the amount needed
      to satisfy such obligations; or (2) in the case of all other
      participants, by having withheld from the shares as to which the
      Restricted Period has expired or by delivering from shares of Common
      Stock of Industries or common stock of the Company owned by the partic-
      ipant such number of shares having a fair market value equal to the
      amount needed to satisfy such obligations.


6.   Changes in Capitalization

      In the event there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or
combination of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by Industries for its
outstanding Common Stock, the maximum 









                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>
aggregate number and class of shares as to which awards may be granted under
the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee whose determination
thereof shall be conclusive.  Unless the Committee shall determine otherwise,
any shares of stock or other securities received by a participant with respect
to shares still subject to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be
subject to the same restrictions and shall be deposited with the Company.

      If Industries shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same
or equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.


 7.   Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of  Stockholders of the Company no
amendment shall increase the total number of shares which may be awarded under
the Plan, extend the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December
31, 1999 or change the standard of eligibility to participate in the Plan. 
The total number of shares which may be awarded under the Plan may, however,
be adjusted without stockholder approval pursuant to the adjustment provisions
described in Paragraph 6 hereof.


8.    Effective Date and Termination of Plan

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1999.

                              MASCO CORPORATION 

                            1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                          (Restated December 6, 1995)


Article I.  Purpose

      The purpose of the 1984 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to secure for
Masco Corporation (the "Company") and its stockholders the benefits inherent
in stock ownership by selected key employees of and consultants to the Company
and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies who in the judgment of the
committee responsible for the administration of the Plan are largely
responsible for the Company's growth and success.  The Plan is designed to
accomplish this purpose by offering such employees and consultants an
opportunity to purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company.  For
purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in which the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For purposes of Articles
III and VII of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other corporation (and
its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own stock
possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company
or by one or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least
twenty percent of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a
subsidiary or another corporation within such chain.


Article II.  Administration

      The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of three
or more of the Company's directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
No director shall become or remain a member of the Committee unless at the
time of exercise of any discretionary function as a Committee member such
director is not eligible, and has not at any time within one year prior to the
exercise of such discretion been eligible for selection as a person to whom
stock may be allocated or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights
may be granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of
its affiliates entitling the participants therein to acquire stock, stock
options or stock appreciation rights of the Company or any of its affiliates. 
The Committee shall have authority, consistent with the Plan:













<PAGE>
            (a) to determine which key employees of and consultants to the
      Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies shall be granted
      options;

            (b) to determine the time or times when options shall be granted
      and the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each option;

            (c) to determine the option price of the stock subject to each
      option and the method of payment of such price;

            (d) to determine the time or times when each option becomes
      exercisable, limitations on exercise, and the duration of the exercise
      period;

            (e) to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing
      any options granted under the Plan and of any other instruments required
      under the Plan, and to change such forms from time to time;
      
            (f) to designate options granted to key employees of the Company
      or its "subsidiaries" under the Plan as "incentive stock options"
      ("ISOs"), as such terms are defined under the Internal Revenue Code;

            (g) to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
      administration of the Plan and the options and for its own acts and
      proceedings; and

            (h) to decide all questions and settle all controversies and
      disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan. 

      All decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee shall
be binding on all parties concerned.


Article III.  Participants

      Key employees of and consultants to the Company, its subsidiaries or
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only
as a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company),
as may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are
eligible to receive options under the Plan.  The grant of an option to an
employee or consultant shall not entitle such individual to other grants or
options, nor shall such grant disqualify such individual from further
participation.











                                     - 2 -

Article IV.  Limitations

      No options shall be granted under the Plan after December 31, 1999, but
options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.  The number of shares
of Common Stock of the Company which may be issued under the Plan shall not
exceed 4,000,000 in the aggregate, subject to adjustment as provided in
Article IX.  To the extent that any option granted under the Plan shall expire
or terminate unexercised or for any reason become unexercisable as to any
stock subject thereto, such stock shall thereafter be available for further
grants under the Plan, within the limit specified above.  If an option granted
under the Plan shall be accepted for surrender pursuant to Article VIII, any
stock covered by options so accepted shall not thereafter be available for the
granting of other options under the Plan.

      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, no option may
be designated an ISO unless all of the following conditions are satisfied with
respect to such option:

            (a) Such option must be granted on or prior to April 24, 1994, and
      such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of ten
      years from the date such option is granted;
      
            (b) Either (i) the employee to whom such option is granted does
      not, determined at the time such option is granted, own capital stock
      representing more than ten percent of the voting power of all classes of
      stock of the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) the
      option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value,
      determined at the time such option is granted, of the stock subject to
      such option and such option by its terms is not exercisable more than
      five years from the date it is granted;

            (c) Such option by its terms is not exercisable while there is
      outstanding an ISO which was granted to the same employee at an earlier
      time.  For purposes of this clause (c), an ISO which has not been
      exercised in full shall be deemed to be outstanding, notwithstanding any
      cancellation or termination thereof, until the expiration of the period
      during which it could have been exercised under its original terms; and

            (d) The aggregate fair market value of the Common Stock subject to
      such option plus the aggregate fair market value of Common Stock subject
      to ISOs previously or concurrently granted to the same employee in the
      same calendar year (all determined at the respective dates of grant of
      such options) must not exceed $100,000 (the "Basic Amount") plus the sum
      of the "Carry-Over Amounts" for each of the three calendar years
      immediately preceding the year in which such option is










                                     - 3 -

<PAGE>
      granted.  The "Carry-Over Amount", as used in this clause (d) for any
      calendar year, shall mean (i) fifty percent of the amount by which
      $100,000 exceeds the fair market value, determined at the time of grant,
      of Common Stock subject to ISOs which were granted during such calendar
      year to the employee for whom the Carry-Over Amount is being determined,
      or (ii) $50,000 in the case such employee has not in such calendar year
      been granted any ISO.  No amount shall be included in a Carry-Over
      Amount for any year to the extent such amount was theretofore necessari-
      ly included as a Carry-Over Amount to permit the qualification of an ISO
      under this clause (d), and Carry-Over Amounts shall only be utilized to
      permit the qualification of an ISO under this clause (d) in the order in
      which they first arose and then only if the Basic Amount has not
      theretofore been utilized to permit such qualification.


Article V.  Stock to be Issued

      The stock as to which options may be granted is the Company's Common
Stock, $1 par value.  Such stock may be authorized but unissued shares or
shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including but not limited to
shares purchased on the open market.  The Board of Directors and the officers
of the Company shall take any appropriate action required for such issuance.


Article VI.  Terms and Conditions of Options

      All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions (except as otherwise provided in Article VII) and to such
other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

      (a) Option Price.  Each option granted hereunder shall have such per
share option price as the Committee may determine, but not less than the fair
market value of Common Stock of the Company on the date the option is granted.

      (b) Term of Options.  The term of an option shall not exceed eleven
years from the date of grant.  The date of grant shall be the date on which
the option is awarded by the Committee.

      (c) Exercise of Options.

             (i) Each option shall be made exercisable at such time or times,
      whether or not in installments, as the Committee shall prescribe at the
      time the option is granted.

            (ii) A person electing to exercise an option shall give written
      notice to the Company, as may be specified by the Committee, of exercise

      shares of stock elected for exercise, such notice to be accompanied by
      such instruments or documents as may be required by the Committee, and
      such person shall at the time of such exercise tender the purchase price
      of the stock elected for exercise unless otherwise directed by the
      Committee.

           (iii) (A)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or
      instruments evidencing options heretofore or hereafter granted
      hereunder, in the case of a Change in Control of the Company, each
      option then outstanding shall immediately become exercisable in full.  A
      Change in Control shall occur if any of the events described below in
      subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3) shall have occurred, unless the holder of
      any such option shall have consented to the application of subparagraph
      (3) in lieu of subparagraphs (1) and (2):

                 (1)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
            1934 (the "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or
            agreement previously approved by the Board directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
            in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exer-
            cisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any
            condition), of voting securities representing 25% or more of the
            combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the
            Company; 

                 (2)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

                  (3)  during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            (other than Excluded Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose
            election by such Board or nomination for election by stockholders
            was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of
            such Board who were either directors on such Board at the
            beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for 









                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
            any reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the members
            thereof.  For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors
            whose election by the Board or approval by the Board for
            stockholder election occurred within one year of any "person" or
            "group of persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and
            14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or
            becoming the beneficial owner of, voting securities representing
            25 percent or more of the combined voting power of all outstanding
            voting securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender
            offer approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant
            to stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their
            representing 25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

            (B)(1)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
      is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
      the benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (B) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Article
      VI(c)(iii)(B), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code 











                                      -6-

<PAGE>
      that may exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is
      possible that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have
      been made by the Company which should have been made (an
      "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have
      been made which should not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent
      with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an
      Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to
      or for the benefit of the affected participant.  In the event that the
      participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the
      amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (3)   This Article VI(c)(iii)(B) shall not apply to any  option
      that was granted to an executive officer of the Company, as determined
      under the Exchange Act.

      (d) Payment for Issuance of Stock.  Upon and at the time of exercise of
any option granted pursuant to the Plan, payment in full shall be made for all
such stock then being purchased either in cash or, at the discretion of the
Committee, in whole or in part in Common Stock of the Company valued at its
then fair market value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in
its discretion permit the issuance of stock upon such other plan of payment as
it deems reasonable, provided that the then unpaid portion of the purchase
price shall be evidenced by a promissory note at such rate of interest and
upon such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate. 
In all cases where stock is issued for less than present full payment of the
purchase price, there shall be placed upon the certificate or certificates
representing such stock a legend setting forth the amount paid at issuance,
and the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and stating that the stock is subject
to call for the remainder and may not be transferred by the holder until the
balance due thereon shall be fully paid.

      The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the procedures
established by the Committee, may permit a participant to satisfy, in whole or
in part, the applicable income tax withholding obligations in connection with
the exercise of a non-qualified stock option under the Plan:  (1) in the case
of participants who are employees of or consultants to MascoTech, Inc. or any
of its subsidiaries, by delivering from shares of common stock of MascoTech,
Inc. owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market value
equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations; or (2) in the case of
all other participants, by having withheld from the shares to be issued upon
the exercise of the option or by delivering from shares of Common Stock of the
Company owned by the participant such number of shares having a fair market
value equal to the amount needed to satisfy such obligations.













                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
      (e)  Conditions to Issuance.  The Company shall not be obligated to
issue any stock unless and until:

             (i) in the event the Company's outstanding Common Stock is at the
      time listed upon any stock exchange, the shares of stock to be issued
      have been listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official
      notice of issuance, upon such exchange, and

            (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has been
      compliance with applicable law in connection with the issuance and
      delivery of stock and such issuance shall have been approved by the
      Company's counsel.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may require from
the participant such investment representation or such agreement, if any, as
counsel for the Company may consider necessary in order to comply with the
Securities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the participant
agree that any sale of the stock will be made only in such manner as shall be
in accordance with law and that the participant will notify the Company of any
intent to make any disposition of the stock whether by sale, gift or
otherwise.  The participant shall take any action reasonably requested by the
Company in such connection.  A participant shall have the rights of a
stockholder only as and when shares of stock have been actually issued to the
participant pursuant to the Plan.

      (f) Nontransferability of Options.  No option may be transferred by the
participant other than by designation of beneficiary as provided in subsection
(j) of this Article, or by will or by the laws of descent and distribution,
and during the participant's lifetime the option may be exercised only by the
participant.

      (g) Consideration for Option.  Each person receiving an option must
agree to remain as an employee or consultant upon the terms of employment or
the consulting arrangement then existing (unless different terms are mutually
agreed upon) for at least one year from the date of the granting of the
option, subject to the right of the Company, its subsidiary or affiliated
company to terminate the participant's employment or consulting arrangement at
any time.

      (h) Termination of Employment.  If the employment of or consulting
arrangement with a participant terminates for any reason (including
termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a
subsidiary or affiliated company) other than the participant's death or
permanent and total disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on
or after normal retirement date, unless discharged for misconduct which in the
opinion of the Committee casts such discredit on the participant as to justify
termination of the option, the participant may thereafter exercise 








                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>
the option as provided below.  If such termination is voluntary on the part of
the participant, the option may be exercised only within ten days after the
day of termination unless a longer period is permitted by the Committee in its
discretion.  If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
participant, the option may be exercised within three months after the day of
termination.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan, in no event may a par-
ticipant whose employment or consulting arrangement has been terminated
voluntarily or involuntarily exercise an option at a time when the option
would not have been exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement
continued.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may by the express
terms of the grant of the option extend the aforesaid periods of time within
which the participant may exercise an option after the termination of
employment or the consulting arrangement.  For purposes of this Article VI(h),
a participant's employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of
absence (not to exceed one year unless otherwise approved by the Committee),
(ii) in the case of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement
among the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, or (iii) by
virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant or from consultant to
employee.  Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or the grant of an
option, an option may be exercised only to the extent exercisable on the date
of termination of employment or of the consulting arrangement by reason of
death, permanent and total disability, retirement or otherwise.

      (i) Retirement; Disability.  If prior to the expiration date of an
option the employee shall retire on or after normal retirement date or if the
employment or consulting relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and
total disability, such option may be exercised to the extent exercisable on
the date of retirement or such termination, provided such option shall be
exercised within three months of the date of retirement or such termination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its discretion the Committee may permit the
exercise of an option held by a retired or disabled option holder upon other
terms and conditions as it deems advisable under the circumstances, and if the
period within which an option may be exercised has been extended the Committee
may terminate all unexercised options if it shall determine that the partic-
ipant has engaged in any activity detrimental to the Company's interests.

      (j) Death.  If a participant dies at a time when entitled to exercise an
option, then at any time or times within one year after death (or such further
period as the Committee may allow) such option may be exercised as to all or
any of the shares which the participant was entitled to purchase immediately
prior to death (unless the Committee shall have provided in the instrument
evidencing such option that all shares covered by the option are subject to
purchase upon death), by the person or persons 











                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>
designated in writing by the participant in such form of beneficiary
designation as may be approved by the Company, or failing designation by the
participant's personal representative, executor or administrator or the person
or persons to whom the option is transferred by will or the applicable laws of
descent and distribution. The Company may decline to deliver shares to a
designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third
parties satisfactory to the Company.  Except as so exercised such option shall
expire at the end of such period.


Article VII.  Replacement Options

      The Committee may grant options under the Plan on terms differing from
those provided for in Article VI where such options are granted in
substitution for options held by employees of or consultants to other entities
who concurrently become employees of or consultants to the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company as the result of a merger, consolidation
or other reorganization of such other entity with the Company or a subsidiary
or an affiliated company, or the acquisition by the Company or a subsidiary or
an affiliated company of the business, property or stock of such other entity. 
The Committee may direct that the substitute options be granted on such terms
and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.


Article VIII.  Surrender of Options

      The Committee may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions
as it deems appropriate, accept the surrender by a participant of a presently
exercisable right to purchase stock granted under an option and authorize
payment by the Company in consideration therefor of an amount equal to the
difference obtained by subtracting the option price of the stock from its fair
market value on the date of such surrender, such payment to be in cash or
shares of the Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market value on the
date of such surrender, or partly in such stock and partly in cash, provided
that the Committee determines such settlement is consistent with the purpose
of the Plan.


Article IX.  Changes in Stock

      The Board of Directors is authorized to make such adjustments, if any,
as it shall deem appropriate in the number and kind of shares which may be
granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares which are subject to
options then outstanding and the purchase price of shares subject to such
outstanding options, in the event of any change in capital or shares of
capital stock, any special distribution to stockholders or any extraordinary
transaction (including a merger, consolidation or dissolution) to 








                                    - 10 -

<PAGE>
which the Company is a party.  The determination of the Board of Directors as
to such matters shall be binding on all persons.


Article X.  Employment Rights

      The adoption of the Plan does not confer upon any employee of or
consultant to the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company any right
to continue the employment or consulting relationship with the Company or a
subsidiary or an affiliated company, as the case may be, nor does it in any
way impair the right of the Company or a subsidiary or an affiliated company
to terminate the employment of any of its employees or the consulting
arrangement with any of its consultants at any time.


Article XI.  Amendments

      The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the
Plan.  The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of any changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, provided that except to the
extent permitted under Article IX, without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company no such amendment shall increase the maximum number of shares of
stock available under the Plan, or alter the class of persons eligible to re-
ceive options under the Plan, or without the consent of the participant void
or diminish options previously granted, nor increase or accelerate the
conditions and actions required for the exercise of the same, except that
nothing herein shall limit the Company's right to call stock, issued for
deferred payment which is evidenced by a promissory note, where the par-
ticipant is in default of the obligations of such note.

                                                   Exhibit 10.o

                                MASCO CORPORATION

                         RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

                           (Restated December 6, 1995)


1.    Purpose of the Plan

      The purpose of the Plan is to aid Masco Corporation (the "Company") and
its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in securing and retaining key
employees and consultants of outstanding ability and to motivate such
individuals to exert their best efforts on behalf of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies.  In addition, the Company expects that it
will benefit from the added interest which such individuals will have in its
welfare as a result of their ownership or increased ownership of the Company's
Common Stock.  For purposes of the Plan a "subsidiary" is any corporation in
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than fifty
percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock.  For
purposes of Paragraph 4 of the Plan, an "affiliated company" is any other
corporation (and its subsidiaries) in which the Company or its subsidiaries own
stock possessing at least twenty percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock, and for all other purposes of the Plan, an "affiliated
company" is any other corporation, at least twenty percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of which is owned by the Company or by one
or more other corporations in a chain of corporations, at least twenty percent
of the stock of each of which is held by the Company or a subsidiary or another
corporation within such chain. 


2.   Stock Subject to the Plan

      The total number of shares of stock that may be awarded under the Plan is
4,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, $1.00 par value.  Such stock may
be authorized but unissued shares or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the
Company, including but not limited to shares purchased on the open market. 
Shares of stock awarded under the Plan which are later reacquired by the Company
as a result of forfeiture pursuant to the Plan shall again become available for
awards under the Plan.


3.    Administration

      The Board of Directors of the Company shall appoint a committee (the
"Committee") consisting of three or more members of the Board of Directors who
shall administer the Plan.  Members of the Committee shall not be eligible while
a member to participate in the Plan and shall not have at any time within one
year prior to appointment been eligible for selection as a person to whom stock








<PAGE>
may have been allocated or to whom stock options of the Company may have been
granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company.  The Committee
shall have the authority, consistent with the Plan, (a) to determine the terms
and conditions of each award, (b) to interpret the Plan and the agreements under
the Plan, (c) to adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the
administration of the Plan and the awards, (d) to delegate to directors of the
Company, who need not be "disinterested persons" within the meaning of Rule 16b-
3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the authority to amend awards granted to
participants, provided such participants are not directors or officers of the
Company for purposes of Section 16, and (e) generally to conduct and administer
the Plan and to make all determinations in connection therewith which may be
necessary or advisable, and all such actions of the Committee shall be binding
upon all participants.


4.    Eligibility
      
      Key employees of and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliated companies, including officers of the Company (who may also be
directors, but excluding members of the Committee, any person who serves only as
a director of the Company and any consultant to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliated companies who is also a director of the Company), as
may be selected from time to time by the Committee in its discretion, are
eligible to receive awards under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine in its
sole discretion the number of shares to be awarded to each such participant.


5.    Terms and Conditions of Awards

      All shares of Common Stock awarded to participants under this Plan shall
be subject to the following terms and conditions, and to such other terms and
conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as shall be contained in each Award
Agreement ("Agreement") referred to in Paragraph 5(f):

      (a)  At the time of each award there shall be established for the shares
of each participant a "Restricted Period" which shall be not less than one 
year. Such Restricted Period may differ between and among participants and may 
have different expiration dates with respect to portions of shares covered by 
the same award.  The Committee may also determine that the expiration of any 
Restricted Period shall be subject to such additional terms and conditions as 
it decides in its sole discretion and as set forth in the participant's 
Agreement.













                                      - 2 -

<PAGE>
      (b)  Shares of stock awarded to participants may not be sold, encumbered
or otherwise transferred, except as hereinafter provided, during the Restricted
Period pertaining to such shares.  Except for such restrictions on transfer, the
participant shall have all the rights of a stockholder including but not limited
to the right to receive all dividends paid on such shares (subject to the
provisions of Paragraph 6) and the right to vote such shares.

      (c)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies for any reason (including
termination by reason of the fact that any corporation is no longer a subsidiary
or affiliated company), other than death, permanent and total disability, or, in
the case of an employee, retirement on or after normal retirement date, all
shares of stock theretofore awarded to the participant which are still subject
to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall upon such termination of
employment or the consulting relationship be forfeited and transferred back to
the Company, provided, however, that in the event such employment or consulting
relationship is terminated by action of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliated companies without cause or by agreement of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and the participant, the Committee may,
but need not, determine that some or all of the shares shall be free of
restrictions.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5(c), a participant's employment
or consulting arrangement shall not be considered terminated (i) in the case of
transfers of employment or the consulting arrangement among the Company, its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies, (ii) by virtue of a change of status from
employee to consultant or from consultant to employee, or (iii) in the case of
interruption in service, not exceeding one year in duration unless otherwise ap-
proved by the Committee, for approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of
absence.

      (d)  If a participant ceases to be employed or retained by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of death or permanent
and total disability or if an employee ceases to be employed by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies by reason of retirement on or
after normal retirement date, the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) shall
lapse with respect to the shares then subject to restrictions, except to the
extent provided to the contrary in the Agreement.

      (e)  Each certificate issued in respect of shares awarded under the Plan
shall be registered in the name of the participant and deposited by the
participant with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, and
shall bear the following legend:

            "The sale, encumbrance, or other transfer of this certificate and
      the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and
      conditions (including a contingent transfer obligation) contained in the
      Masco Corporation Restricted 










                                      - 3 -
<PAGE>
      Stock Incentive Plan and an agreement entered into between the registered
      owner and Masco Corporation.  Copies of such Plan and Agreement are on
      file in the office of the Secretary of Masco Corporation, Taylor,
      Michigan."

      (f)  The participant shall enter into an Agreement with the Company in a
form specified by the Committee agreeing to the terms and conditions of the
award, the expiration of the Restricted Period as to the shares covered by the
award, and such other matters, including compliance with applicable federal and
state securities laws and methods of withholding or providing for the payment of
required taxes, as the Committee shall in its sole discretion determine.  The
Committee may at any time amend the terms of any Agreement consistent with the
terms of the Plan, except that without the participant's written consent no such
amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the participant who is a party to
such Agreement.

      (g)  At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to shares covered by
any award, the Company shall redeliver the stock certificates deposited with it
pursuant to Paragraph 5(e) and as to which the Restricted Period has expired, as
follows:

           (1)  if an assignment to a trust has been made in accordance with
      Paragraph 5(i), to such trust; or

            (2)  if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of death and a
      beneficiary has been designated in form approved by the Company, to the
      beneficiary so designated; or

           (3)  in all other cases, to the participant or the legal
      representative of the participant's estate.

Upon written request, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent that
such certificates may be reissued without legend.

      (h) (1) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or instruments
evidencing awards heretofore or hereafter granted hereunder, in the case of a
Change in Control of the Company, each award granted at least one year prior
thereto shall immediately become fully vested and non-forfeitable and shall
thereupon be distributed to participants as soon as practicable, free of all
restrictions.  A Change in Control shall occur if any of the events described
below in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) shall have occurred, unless the holder of
any such award shall have consented to the application of subparagraph (C) in
lieu of subparagraphs (A) and (B):

           (A)  any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are used in
      Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
      "Exchange Act") other than pursuant to a transaction or agreement
      previously approved by the Board

      directly or indirectly purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial
      owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right
      to acquire such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is exer-
      cisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to any condi-
      tion), of voting securities representing 25% or more of the combined
      voting power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company;

            (B)  during any period of twenty four consecutive calendar months,
      the individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the
      Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors whose election by such
      Board or nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of
      at least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
      on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomina-
      tion for election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
      cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof; or

            (C) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar months,
      the individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the
      Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors (other than Excluded
      Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose election by such Board or
      nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at least
      two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors on such
      Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
      election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason cease to
      constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.  For purposes
      hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose election by the Board or
      approval by the Board for stockholder election occurred within one year of
      any "person" or "group of persons", as such terms are used in Sections
      13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or
      becoming the beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25
      percent or more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting
      securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer approved
      by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions
      approved by the Board prior to their representing 25 percent or more of
      such combined voting power.

            (2)(A)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
      is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
      the benefit of a participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other than
      any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (2) (a "Payment"), would be
      subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
      Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), or any interest
      or penalties with respect to 











                                      - 5 -


<PAGE>
      such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
      penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"),
      then such participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company,
      within 15 days following the determination described in (B) below, an
      additional payment ("Excise Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such
      that after payment by such participant of all applicable Federal, state
      and local taxes (computed at the maximum marginal rates and including any
      interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any
      Excise Tax, imposed upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such
      participant retains an amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal
      to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

            (B)   All determinations required to be made under this Section
      5(h)(2), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is required
      and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be made by
      Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm as the
      Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and the
      participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax, which
      shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and the
      affected participant within 15 business days of the date of the applicable
      Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination by Coopers &
      Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm, shall be binding
      upon the Company and the participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in
      the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may exist at the time of
      the initial determination hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain
      Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made by the Company
      which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax
      Adjustment Payments will have been made which should not have been made
      (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made
      hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be
      promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the affected
      participant.  In the event that the participant discovers that Overpayment
      shall have occurred, the amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the
      Company.

            (C)   This Section 5(h)(2) shall not apply to any award  that was
      granted to an executive officer of the Company, as determined under the
      Exchange Act.

      (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, a participant may
assign all rights under any award to a revocable grantor trust established by
the participant for the sole benefit of the participant during the life of the
participant, and under the terms of which the participant is and remains the
sole trustee until death or physical or mental incapacity.  Such assignment
shall be effected by a written instrument in form and content 











                                      - 6 -

<PAGE>
satisfactory to the Committee and the participant shall deliver to the Committee
a true copy of the agreement or other document evidencing such trust.  If in the
judgment of the Committee the trust to which a participant may attempt to assign
rights under an award does not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
assignment is permitted by the terms of this paragraph, or if after assignment,
because of amendment, by force of law or any other reason such trust no longer
meets such criteria, such attempted assignment shall be void and may be
disregarded by the Committee and the Company and all rights to any awards shall
revert to and remain solely in the participant.  Notwithstanding a qualified
assignment, the participant, and not the trust to which rights under an award
may be assigned, for the purpose of determining compensation arising by reason
of the award shall continue to be considered an employee or consultant, as the
case may be, of the Company, a subsidiary or affiliated company, but such trust
and the participant shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the
Award Agreement and this Plan.

      The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees may rely
upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or other instrument of transfer,
copies of trust agreements and any other documents delivered to them by or on
behalf of the participant which they believe genuine and any action taken by
them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and binding upon the participant,
his personal representatives and all persons asserting a claim based on an award
granted pursuant to this Plan.  The delivery by a participant of a beneficiary
designation, or an assignment of rights under an award as permitted by this
Paragraph 5(i), shall constitute the participant's irrevocable undertaking to
hold the Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees harmless
against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in defending against
claims, of any person (including the participant) which may be asserted or
alleged to be based upon an award subject to a beneficiary designation or an
assignment.  In addition, the Company may decline to deliver shares to a
beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third parties satis-
factory to the Company.  Issuance of shares as to which restrictions have lapsed
in the name of, and delivery to, the trust to which rights may be assigned shall
be conclusively considered issuance and delivery to the participant.

      (j)  The Committee, in its discretion and in accordance with the
procedures established by the Committee, may permit the participant to satisfy,
in whole or in part, the applicable income tax withholding obligations when the
restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) lapse:  (1) in the case of participants
who are employees of or consultants to MascoTech, Inc. or any of its sub-
sidiaries, by delivering from shares of common stock of MascoTech, Inc. owned by
the participant such number of shares having a fair market value equal to the
amount needed to satisfy such obligations; or (2) in the case of all other
participants, by 












                                      - 7 -

<PAGE>
having withheld from the shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired or
by delivering from shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the
participant such number of shares having a fair market value equal to the amount
needed to satisfy such obligations.


6.   Changes in Capitalization

      In the event there is a change in, reclassification, subdivision or
combination of, stock dividend on, or exchange of stock by the Company for the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and class
of shares as to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall be appro-
priately adjusted by the Committee whose determination thereof shall be
conclusive.  Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, any shares of stock
or other securities received by a participant with respect to shares still
subject to the restrictions imposed by Paragraph 5(b) will be subject to the
same restrictions and shall be deposited with the Company.

      If the Company shall be consolidated or merged with another corporation,
the stock, securities or other property which a participant is entitled to
receive by reason of his ownership of the shares of stock subject to the
restrictions imposed pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) shall be subject to the same or
equivalent restrictions unless the Committee shall determine otherwise at that
time.


      7.  Amendment of the Plan

      The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or discontinue the
Plan, except that without the approval of Stockholders no amendment shall
increase the total number of shares which may be awarded under the Plan, extend
the date for awards of shares under the Plan beyond December 31, 1991 or change
the standards of eligibility of employees eligible to participate in the Plan. 
The total number of shares awardable under the Plan may, however, without
stockholder approval, be adjusted pursuant to the adjustment provisions
described in Paragraph 6 hereof.


      8.  Effective Date and Termination of Plan

      The Plan shall become effective when approved by the stockholders of the
Company and no shares may be awarded under the Plan after December 31, 1991.

Section 4.  Shares Available for Awards

      (a)  Shares Available.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section
4(b):

            (i) Initial Authorization.  There shall be 8,000,000 Shares
      initially available for issuance under the Plan.

            (ii) Acquired Shares.  In addition to the amount set forth above,
      up to 8,000,000 Shares acquired by the Company subsequent to the
      effectiveness of the Plan as full or partial payment for the exercise
      price for an Option or any other stock option granted by the Company, or
      acquired by the Company, in open market transactions or otherwise, in
      connection with the Plan or any Award hereunder or any other employee
      stock option or restricted stock issued by the Company may thereafter be
      included in the Shares available for Awards. If any Shares covered by an
      Award or to which an Award relates are forfeited, or if an Award
      expires, terminates or is cancelled, then the Shares covered by such
      Award, or to which such Award relates, or the number of Shares otherwise
      counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan
      by reason of such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture,
      expiration, termination or cancellation, may thereafter be available for
      further granting of Awards and included as acquired Shares for purposes
      of the preceding sentence.










                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
            (iii) Additional Shares.  Shares acquired by the Company in the
      circumstances set forth in (ii) above in excess of the amount set forth
      therein may thereafter be included in the Shares available for Awards to
      the extent permissible for purposes of allowing the Plan to continue to
      satisfy the conditions of Rule 16b-3.

            (iv) Shares Under Prior Plans.  In addition to the amounts set
      forth above, shares remaining available for issuance upon any
      termination of authority to make further awards under both the Company's
      1988 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan and its 1988 Stock Option Plan
      shall thereafter be available for issuance hereunder.

            (v) Accounting for Awards.  For purposes of this Section 4, 

                  (A) if an Award (other than a Dividend Equivalent) is
            denominated in Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award,
            or to which such Award relates, shall be counted on the date of
            grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares avail-
            able for granting Awards under the Plan to the extent determinable
            on such date and insofar as the number of Shares is not then
            determinable under procedures adopted by the Committee consistent
            with the purposes of the Plan; and

                  (B) Dividend Equivalents and Awards not denominated in
            Shares shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares
            available for granting Awards under the Plan in such amount and at
            such time as the Committee shall determine under procedures
            adopted by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan;

      provided, however, that Awards that operate in tandem with (whether
      granted simultaneously with or at a different time from), or that are
      substituted for, other Awards or restricted stock awards or stock
      options granted under any other plan of the Company may be counted or
      not counted under procedures adopted by the Committee in order to avoid
      double counting. Any Shares that are delivered by the Company or its
      Affiliates, and any Awards that are granted by, or become obligations
      of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company of, or in sub-
      stitution for, outstanding restricted stock awards or stock options
      previously granted by an acquired company shall not, except in the case
      of Awards granted to Participants who are directors or officers of the
      Company for purposes of Section 16, be counted against the Shares
      available for granting Awards under the Plan.

            (vi) Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards.  Any Shares
      delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or 










                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
      in part, of authorized but unissued Shares or of Shares reacquired by
      the Company, including but not limited to Shares purchased on the open
      market.

      (b)  Adjustments.  Upon the occurrence of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other
property), change in the capital or shares of capital stock, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other
securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase
Shares or other securities of the Company or extraordinary transaction or
event which affects the Shares, then the Committee shall have the authority to
make such adjustment, if any, in such manner as it deems appropriate, in (i)
the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) which
thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) outstanding Awards
including without limitation the number and type of Shares (or other
securities or property) subject thereto, and (iii) the grant, purchase or
exercise price with respect to outstanding Awards and, if deemed appropriate,
make provision for cash payments to the holders of outstanding Awards; pro-
vided, however,  that the number of Shares subject to any Award denominated in
Shares shall always be a whole number.


Section 5.  Eligibility

      Any employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate, including
any officer of the Company (who may also be a director, but excluding a member
of the Committee, any person who serves only as a director of the Company and
any consultant to the Company or an Affiliate who is also a director of the
Company and who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with
the entity in question), as may be selected from time to time by the Committee
or by the directors to whom authority may be delegated pursuant to Section 3
hereof in its or their discretion, is eligible to be designated a Participant.

            (i) Committee Determinations.  Subject to the terms of the Plan,

                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
                  (C) the time or times at which an Option may be exercised,
            in whole or in part, the method or methods by which and the form
            or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
            Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a
            fair market value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exer-
            cise price) in which payment of the exercise price with respect
            thereto may be made or deemed to have been made. The terms of any
            Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all
            respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any
            successor provision thereto, and any regulations promulgated
            thereunder.

      Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may impose such
      conditions or restrictions on any Option as it deems appropriate.

            (ii) Other Terms.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee:

                  (A) A Participant electing to exercise an Option shall give
            written notice to the Company, as may be specified by the
            Committee, of exercise of the Option and the number of Shares
            elected for exercise, such notice to be accompanied by such in-
            struments or documents as may be required by the Committee, and
            shall tender the purchase price of the Shares elected for
            exercise.

                  (B) At the time of exercise of an Option payment in full in
            cash shall be made for all Shares then being purchased.

                  (C) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares
            unless and until:

                       (I) if the class of Shares at the time is listed upon
                  any stock exchange, the Shares to be issued have been
                  listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official
                  notice of issuance, upon such exchange, and

                       (II) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has
                  been compliance with applicable law in connection with the
                  issuance and delivery of Shares and such issuance shall have
                  been approved by the Company's counsel.


                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Company may require from the Participant such investment
            representation or such agreement, if any, as the Company's counsel
            may consider necessary in order to 









                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
            comply with the Securities Act of 1933 as then in effect, and may
            require that the Participant agree that any sale of the Shares
            will be made only in such manner as shall be in accordance with
            law and that the Participant will notify the Company of any intent
            to make any disposition of the Shares whether by sale, gift or
            otherwise. The Participant shall take any action reasonably
            requested by the Company in such connection. A Participant shall
            have the rights of a stockholder only as and when Shares have been
            actually issued to the Participant pursuant to the Plan.

                  (D) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that an entity is no longer an Affiliate) other
            than the Participant's death, the Participant may thereafter
            exercise the Option as provided below, except that the Committee
            may terminate the unexercised portion of the Option concurrently
            with or at any time following termination of the employment or
            consulting arrangement (including termination of employment upon a
            change of status from employee to consultant) if it shall de-
            termine that the Participant has engaged in any activity
            detrimental to the interests of the Company or an Affiliate. If
            such termination is voluntary on the part of the Participant, the
            option may be exercised only within ten days after the date of
            termination. If such termination is involuntary on the part of the
            Participant, if an employee retires on or after normal retirement
            date or if the employment or consulting relationship is terminated
            by reason of permanent and total disability, the Option may be
            exercised within three months after the date of termination or
            retirement. For purposes of this Paragraph (D), a Participant's
            employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered ter-
            minated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona fide
            leave of absence (not to exceed one year), (ii) in the case of a
            transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among the
            Company and Affiliates, or (iii) by virtue of a change of status
            from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee, except
            as provided above.

                  (E) If a Participant dies at a time when entitled to
            exercise an Option, then at any time or times within one year
            after death such Option may be exercised, as to all or any of the
            Shares which the Participant was entitled to purchase immediately
            prior to death.  The Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims
            of third parties satisfactory to the Company. Except as so












                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>
            exercised such Option shall expire at the end of such period.

                  (F) An Option may be exercised only if and to the extent
            such Option was exercisable at the date of termination of
            employment or the consulting arrangement, and an Option may not be
            exercised at a time when the Option would not have been
            exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement contin-
            ued.

            (iii) Restoration Options.  The Committee may grant a Participant
      the right to receive a restoration Option with respect to an Option or
      any other option granted by the Company.  Unless the Committee shall
      otherwise determine, a restoration Option shall provide that the under-
      lying option must be exercised while the Participant is an employee of
      or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate and the number of Shares
      which are subject to a restoration Option shall not exceed the number of
      whole Shares exchanged in payment of the original option.

      (b)  Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder
thereof a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (i) the fair
market value of one Share on the date of exercise or, if the Committee shall
so determine in the case of any such right other than one related to any
Incentive Stock Option, at any time during a specified period before or after
the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right as specified by
the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall determine
the grant price, term, methods of exercise and settlement and any other terms
and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right and may impose such conditions
or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem
appropriate.

      (c)  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

            (i) Issuance.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
      Participants Awards of Restricted Stock, which shall consist of Shares,
      and Restricted Stock Units which shall give the Participant the right to
      receive cash, other securities, other Awards or other property, in each
      case subject to the termination of the Restricted Period determined by
      the Committee.

            (ii) Restrictions.  The Restricted Period may differ among
      Participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of Shares covered by the same Award.  Subject to the terms of
      the Plan, Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
      have such restrictions as the 









                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>
      Committee may impose (including, without limitation, limitations on the
      right to vote Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or
      other right or property), which restrictions may lapse separately or in
      combination at such time or times, in installments or otherwise. Unless
      the Committee shall otherwise determine, any Shares or other securities
      distributed with respect to Restricted Stock or which a Participant is
      otherwise entitled to receive by reason of such Shares shall be subject
      to the restrictions contained in the applicable Award Agreement. Subject
      to the aforementioned restrictions and the provisions of the Plan,
      Participants shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect
      to Shares of Restricted Stock.

            (iii) Registration.  Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may
      be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate,
      including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of
      stock certificates.

            (iv) Forfeiture.  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee:

                  (A) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that any entity is no longer an Affiliate),
            other than the Participant's death or permanent and total dis-
            ability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or after
            normal retirement date, all Shares of Restricted Stock theretofore
            awarded to the Participant which are still subject to restrictions
            shall upon such termination of employment or the consulting
            relationship be forfeited and transferred back to the Company.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing or Paragraph (C) below, if a
            Participant continues to hold an Award of Restricted Stock
            following termination of the employment or consulting arrangement
            (including retirement and termination of employment upon a change
            of status from employee to consultant), the Shares of Restricted
            Stock which remain subject to restrictions shall nonetheless be
            forfeited and transferred back to the Company if the Committee at
            any time thereafter determines that the Participant has engaged in
            any activity detrimental to the interests of the Company or an
            Affiliate. For purposes of this Paragraph (A), a Participant's em-
            ployment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
            terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona
            fide leave of absence (not to exceed one year), (ii) in the case
            of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among
            the Company and Affiliates, or (iii) by virtue of a change of
            status from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee,
            except as provided above.

<PAGE>
                  (B) If a Participant ceases to be employed or retained by
            the Company or an Affiliate by reason of death or permanent and
            total disability or if following retirement a Participant
            continues to have rights under an Award of Restricted Stock and
            thereafter dies, the restrictions contained in the Award shall
            lapse with respect to such Restricted Stock.

                  (C) If an employee ceases to be employed by the Company or
            an Affiliate by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement
            date, the restrictions contained in the Award of Restricted Stock
            shall continue to lapse in the same manner as though employment
            had not terminated.

                  (D) At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to Shares
            covered by an Award of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver
            the Shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired, as
            follows:

                       (1) if an assignment to a trust has been made in ac-
                  cordance with Section 6(g)(iv)(B)(2)(c), to such trust; or

                       (2) if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of
                  death and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved
                  by the Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                       (3) in all other cases, to the Participant or the legal
                  representative of the Participant's estate.

      (d)  Performance Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Performance Awards to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Performance Award granted under the Plan (i) may be denominated or payable in
cash, Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock), other
securities, other Awards, or other property and (ii) shall confer on the
holder thereof rights valued as determined by the Committee and payable to, or
exercisable by, the holder of the Performance Award, in whole or in part, upon
the achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as
the Committee shall establish. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the
performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of
any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted, the
amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award
and other terms and conditions shall be determined by the Committee.

      (e)  Dividend Equivalents.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants Awards under which the holders thereof shall be entitled to
receive payments equivalent to dividends or interest 










                                    - 11 -

<PAGE>
with respect to a number of Shares determined by the Committee, and the
Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been
reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested. Subject to the terms
of the Plan, such Awards may have such terms and conditions as the Committee
shall determine.

      (f)  Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in
whole or in part by reference to or otherwise based on or related to Shares
(including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are
deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan,
provided, however,  that such grants to persons who are subject to Section 16
must comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards.
Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted
under this Section 6(f) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may
be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms, including,
without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other
property or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine.

      (g)  General.

            (i) No Cash Consideration for Awards.  Awards may be granted for
      no cash consideration or for such minimal cash consideration as may be
      required by applicable law.

            (ii) Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together.  Awards may, in
      the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition
      to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or any award
      granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate. Awards
      granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in addition to
      or in tandem with awards granted under another plan of the Company or
      any Affiliate, may be granted either at the same time as or at a
      different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.

            (iii) Forms of Payment Under Awards.  Subject to the terms of the
      Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be
      made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise, or payment
      of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall
      determine, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
      securities, other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof,
      and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on
      a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures
      established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include,
      without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of
      reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the









                                    - 12 -

<PAGE>
      grant or crediting of Dividend Equivalents in respect of installment or
      deferred payments.

            (iv) Limits on Transfer of Awards.

                  (A) Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, no
            Award or right under any Award may be sold, encumbered, pledged,
            alienated, attached, assigned or transferred in any manner and any
            attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be void and unenforceable
            against the Company.

                  (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (A) above:

                       (1) An Option may be transferred:

                             (a) to a beneficiary designated by the
                        Participant in writing on a form approved by the
                        Committee; or

                             (b) by will or the applicable laws of descent and
                        distribution to the personal representative, executor
                        or administrator of the Participant's estate.

                        (2) A Participant may assign or transfer rights under
                  an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units:

                             (a) to a beneficiary designated by the
                        Participant in writing on a form approved by the
                        Committee;

                             (b) by will or the applicable laws of descent and
                        distribution to the personal representative, executor
                        or administrator of the Participant's estate; or

                             (c) to a revocable grantor trust established by
                        the Participant for the sole benefit of the
                        Participant during the Participant's life, and under
                        the terms of which the Participant is and remains the
                        sole trustee until death or physical or mental
                        incapacity. Such assignment shall be effected by a
                        written instrument in form and content satisfactory to
                        the Committee, and the Participant shall deliver to
                        the Committee a true copy of the agreement or other
                        document evidencing such trust. If in the judgment of
                        the Committee the trust to which a Participant 










                                    - 13 -

<PAGE>
                        may attempt to assign rights under such an Award does
                        not meet the criteria of a trust to which an
                        assignment is permitted by the terms hereof, or if
                        after assignment, because of amendment, by force of
                        law or any other reason such trust no longer meets
                        such criteria, such attempted assignment shall be void
                        and may be disregarded by the Committee and the
                        Company and all rights to any such Awards shall revert
                        to and remain solely in the Participant. Not-
                        withstanding a qualified assignment, the Participant,
                        and not the trust to which rights under such an Award
                        may be assigned, for the purpose of determining
                        compensation arising by reason of the Award shall
                        continue to be considered an employee or consultant,
                        as the case may be, of the Company or an Affiliate,
                        but such trust and the Participant shall be bound by
                        all of the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement
                        and this Plan. Shares issued in the name of and
                        delivered to such trust shall be conclusively con-
                        sidered issuance and delivery to the Participant.

                        (3) The Committee shall not permit directors or offi-
                  cers of the Company for purposes of Section 16 to transfer
                  or assign Awards except as permitted under Rule 16b-3.

                  (C) The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and
            employees may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or
            other instrument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any
            other documents delivered to them by or on behalf of the
            Participant which they believe genuine and any action taken by
            them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and binding upon the
            Participant, the personal representatives of the Participant's
            estate and all persons asserting a claim based on an Award. The
            delivery by a Participant of a beneficiary designation, or an
            assignment of rights under an Award as permitted hereunder, shall
            constitute the Participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the
            Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
            harmless against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in
            defending against claims, of any person (including the
            Participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based on an
            Award subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment. In
            addition, the Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third
            parties satisfactory to the Company.











                                    - 14 -

<PAGE>
            (v) Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares or other
      securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the
      exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other
      restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the
      rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other
      securities are then listed and any applicable Federal or state
      securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be
      put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such
      restrictions.

            (vi) Change in Control.  (A) Notwithstanding any of the provisions
      of this Plan or instruments evidencing Awards granted hereunder, upon a
      Change in Control of the Company (as hereinafter defined) the vesting of
      all rights of Participants under outstanding Awards shall be accelerated
      and all restrictions thereon shall terminate in order that Participants
      may fully realize the benefits thereunder. Such acceleration shall
      include, without limitation, the immediate exercisability in full of all
      Options and the termination of restrictions on Restricted Stock and
      Restricted Stock Units. Further, in addition to the Committee's
      authority set forth in Section 4(b), the Committee, as constituted
      before such Change in Control, is authorized, and has sole discretion,
      as to any Award, either at the time such Award is made hereunder or any
      time thereafter, to take any one or more of the following actions: (i)
      provide for the purchase of any such Award, upon the Participant's
      request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been
      attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Partici-
      pant's rights had such Award been currently exercisable or payable; (ii)
      make such adjustment to any such Award then outstanding as the Committee
      deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control; and (iii) cause any
      such Award then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted
      therefor, by the acquiring or surviving corporation after such Change in
      Control.

            (B)   With respect to any Award granted hereunder prior to
      December 6, 1995, a Change in Control shall occur if:

                  (1) any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly pur-
            chases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is
            exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to
            any condition) of voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting 









                                    - 15 -

<PAGE>
            power of all outstanding voting securities of the Company; or

                  (2) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's Board of Directors, and any new directors
            whose election by such Board or nomination for election by
            stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
            members of such Board who were either directors on such Board at
            the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for
            election as directors was previously so approved, for any reason
            cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof.

            (C)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B), with
      respect to Awards granted hereunder on or after December 6, 1995, a
      Change in Control shall occur only if the event described in this
      subparagraph (C) shall have occurred.  With respect to any other Award
      granted prior thereto, a Change in Control shall occur if any of the
      events described in subparagraphs (B) or (C) shall have occurred, unless
      the holder of any such Award shall have consented to the application of
      this subparagraph (C) in lieu of the foregoing subparagraph (B).  A
      Change in Control for purposes of this subparagraph (C) shall occur if,
      during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar months, the
      individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Company's
      Board of Directors, and any new directors (other than Excluded
      Directors, as hereinafter defined), whose election by such Board or
      nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at
      least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors
      on such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
      nomination for election as directors was previously so approved, for any
      reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the members thereof. 
      For purposes hereof, "Excluded Directors" are directors whose election
      by the Board or approval by the Board for stockholder election occurred
      within one year of any "person" or "group of persons", as such terms are
      used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a
      tender offer for, or becoming the beneficial owner of, voting securities
      representing 25 percent or more of the combined voting power of all
      outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than pursuant to a
      tender offer approved by the Board prior to its commencement or pursuant
      to stock acquisitions approved by the Board prior to their representing
      25 percent or more of such combined voting power.

            (D)(1)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
      is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
      the benefit of a Participant, whether 











                                    - 16 -

<PAGE>
      paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of
      this Plan or otherwise, other than any payment pursuant to this
      subparagraph (D) (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax
      imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with
      respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such
      interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
      "Excise Tax"), then such Participant shall be entitled to receive from
      the Company, within 15 days following the determination described in (2)
      below, an additional payment ("Excise Tax Adjustment Payment") in an
      amount such that after payment by such Participant of all applicable
      Federal, state and local taxes (computed at the maximum marginal rates
      and including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such
      taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Excise Tax Adjustment
      Payment, such Participant retains an amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment
      Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Section
      6(g)(vi)(D), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the Participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected Participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
      exist at the time of the initial determination hereunder, it is possible
      that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will not have been made
      by the Company which should have been made (an "Underpayment"), or (y)
      certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments will have been made which should
      not have been made (an "Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations
      required to be made hereunder.  In the event of an Underpayment, such
      Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit
      of the affected Participant.  In the event that the Participant
      discovers that an Overpayment shall have occurred, the amount thereof
      shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (3)   This Section 6(g)(vi)(D) shall not apply to any Award (x)
      that was granted prior to February 17, 1993 and (y) the holder of which
      is an executive officer of the Company, as determined under the Exchange
      Act.













                                    - 17 -

<PAGE>
            (vii)  Cash Settlement.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
      Plan or of any Award Agreement to the contrary, any Award outstanding
      hereunder may at any time be cancelled in the Committee's sole
      discretion upon payment of the value of such Award to the holder thereof
      in cash or in another Award hereunder, such value to be determined by
      the Committee in its sole discretion.


Section 7.  Amendment and Termination

      Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise
expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

      (a)  Amendments to the Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company may
amend the Plan and the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend any out-
standing Award; provided, however,  that (i) no Plan amendment shall be
effective until approved by stockholders of the Company insofar as stockholder
approval thereof is required in order for the Plan to continue to satisfy the
conditions of Rule 16b-3, and (ii) without the consent of affected
Participants no amendment of the Plan or of any Award may impair the rights of
Participants under outstanding Awards.

      (b)  Waivers.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under
any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the
consent of any Participant.

      (c)  Adjustments of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or
Nonrecurring Events.  The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in
the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation,
the events described in Section 4(b) hereof) affecting the Company, any
Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or of
changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever
the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits to be
made available under the Plan.

      (d)  Correction of Defects, Omissions, and Inconsistencies.  The
Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it
shall deem desirable to effectuate the Plan. 


Section 8.  General Provisions

      (a)  No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or other person shall have any
claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants 







                                    - 18 -

<PAGE>
or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions
of Awards of the same type and the determination of the Committee to grant a
waiver or modification of any Award and the terms and conditions thereof need
not be the same with respect to each Participant.

      (b)  Withholding.  The Company or any Affiliate shall be authorized to
withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any
Award or under the Plan the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other
Awards or other property) of withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its
exercise or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to
take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company or
Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

      (c)  No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in
the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continu-
ing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including the
grant of options and other stock-based awards, and such arrangements may be
either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

      (d)  No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Award shall not be
construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of
the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any
time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any
claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in
any Award Agreement or other written agreement with the Participant.

      (e)  Governing Law.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan
and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable Federal law.

      (f)  Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or
becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any
Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall
be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot
be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the
Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such
provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the
remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and
effect.

      (g)  No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall
create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a
fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant
or any other person. To the extent that 










                                    - 19 -

<PAGE>
any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any
Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right
of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.

      (h)  No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or
delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine
whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred
in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any
rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.

      (i)  Headings.  Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of
the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall
not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or
interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.


Section 9.  Effective Date of the Plan

      The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the
Company's stockholders.

Section 4. Shares Available for Awards

      (a)  Shares Available.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section
4(b):

            (i)  Initial Authorization.  There shall be 6,000,000 Shares
      initially available for issuance under the Plan.

            (ii)  Acquired Shares.  In addition to the amount set forth above,
      up to 6,000,000 Shares acquired by the Company subsequent to the
      effectiveness of the Plan as full or partial payment for the exercise
      price for an Option or any other stock option granted by the Company, or
      acquired by the Company, in open market transactions or otherwise, in
      connection with the Plan or any Award hereunder or any other employee
      stock option or restricted stock issued by the Company may thereafter be
      included in the Shares available for Awards. If any Shares covered by an
      Award or to which an Award relates are forfeited, or if an Award
      expires, terminates or is cancelled, then the Shares covered by such
      Award, or to which such Award relates, or the number of Shares otherwise
      counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan
      by reason of such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture,
      expiration, termination or cancellation, may thereafter be available for
      further granting of Awards and included as acquired Shares for purposes
      of the preceding sentence.

            (iii)  Additional Shares.  Shares acquired by the Company in the
      circumstances set forth in (ii) above in excess of the amount set forth
      therein may thereafter be included in the Shares available for Awards to
      the extent permissible for 








                                     - 4 -

<PAGE>
      purposes of allowing the Plan to continue to satisfy the conditions of
      Rule 16b-3.

            (iv)  Shares Under Prior Plans.  In addition to the amount set
      forth above, shares remaining available for issuance upon any
      termination of authority to make further awards under both the Company's
      1984 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan and its 1984 Stock Option Plan
      shall thereafter be available for issuance hereunder.

            (v)  Accounting for Awards.  For purposes of this Section 4,

                  (A) if an Award (other than a Dividend Equivalent) is
            denominated in Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award,
            or to which such Award relates, shall be counted on the date of
            grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares
            available for granting Awards under the Plan to the extent
            determinable on such date and insofar as the number of Shares is
            not then determinable under procedures adopted by the Committee
            consistent with the purposes of the Plan; and

                  (B) Dividend Equivalents and Awards not denominated in
            Shares shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares
            available for granting Awards under the Plan in such amount and at
            such time as the Committee shall determine under procedures
            adopted by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan;

provided, however, that Awards that operate in tandem with (whether granted
simultaneously with or at a different time from), or that are substituted for,
other Awards or restricted stock awards or stock options granted under any
other plan of the Company may be counted or not counted under procedures
adopted by the Committee in order to avoid double counting. Any Shares that
are delivered by the Company or its Affiliates, and any Awards that are
granted by, or become obligations of, the Company, through the assumption by
the Company of, or in substitution for, outstanding restricted stock awards or
stock options previously granted by an acquired company shall not, except in
the case of Awards granted to Participants who are directors or officers of
the Company for purposes of Section 16, be counted against the Shares avail-
able for granting Awards under the Plan.

            (vi)  Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards.  Any Shares
      delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of
      authorized but unissued Shares or of Shares reacquired by the Company,
      including but not limited to Shares purchased on the open market.

      (b)  Adjustments.  Upon the occurrence of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other
property), change in the capital or shares of capital stock, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, 







                                     - 5 -

<PAGE>
merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or
exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or
other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or
extraordinary transaction or event which affects the Shares, then the
Committee shall have the authority to make such adjustment, if any, in such
manner as it deems appropriate, in (i) the number and type of Shares (or other
securities or property) which thereafter may be made the subject of Awards,
(ii) outstanding Awards including without limitation the number and type of
Shares (or other securities or property) subject thereto, and (iii) the grant,
purchase or exercise price with respect to outstanding Awards and, if deemed
appropriate, make provision for cash payments to the holders of outstanding
Awards; provided, however,  that the number of Shares subject to any Award
denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number.


Section 5. Eligibility

      Any employee of or consultant to the Company or any Affiliate, including
any officer of the Company (who may also be a director, but excluding a member
of the Committee, any person who serves only as a director of the Company and
any consultant to the Company or an Affiliate who is also a director of the
Company and who is not rendering services pursuant to a written agreement with
the entity in question), as may be selected from time to time by the Committee
or by the directors to whom authority may be delegated pursuant to Section 3
hereof in its or their discretion, is eligible to be designated a Participant.


Section 6. Awards

      (a)  Options.  The Committee is authorized to grant Options to
Participants.

            (i)  Committee Determinations.  Subject to the terms of the Plan,
      the Committee shall determine:

                  (A) the purchase price per Share under each Option;

                  (B) the term of each Option; and

                  (C) the time or times at which an Option may be exercised,
            in whole or in part, the method or methods by which and the form
            or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
            Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a
            fair market value on the exercise date equal to the relevant
            exercise price) in which payment of the exercise price with
            respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made. The terms
            of any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply
            in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or








                                     - 6 -

<PAGE>
            any successor provision thereto, and any regulations promulgated
            thereunder.

      Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may impose such
      conditions or restrictions on any Option as it deems appropriate.

            (ii)  Other Terms.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee:

                  (A) A Participant electing to exercise an Option shall give
            written notice to the Company, as may be specified by the
            Committee, of exercise of the Option and the number of Shares
            elected for exercise, such notice to be accompanied by such
            instruments or documents as may be required by the Committee, and
            shall tender the purchase price of the Shares elected for
            exercise.

                  (B) At the time of exercise of an Option payment in full in
            cash shall be made for all Shares then being purchased.

                  (C) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares
            unless and until:

                        (I) if the class of Shares at the time is listed upon
                  any stock exchange, the Shares to be issued have been
                  listed, or authorized to be added to the list upon official
                  notice of issuance, upon such exchange, and

                        (II) in the opinion of the Company's counsel there has
                  been compliance with applicable law in connection with the
                  issuance and delivery of Shares and such issuance shall have
                  been approved by the Company's counsel.

                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Company may require from the Participant such investment
            representation or such agreement, if any, as the Company's counsel
            may consider necessary in order to comply with the Securities Act
            of 1933 as then in effect, and may require that the Participant
            agree that any sale of the Shares will be made only in such manner
            as shall be in accordance with law and that the Participant will
            notify the Company of any intent to make any disposition of the
            Shares whether by sale, gift or otherwise. The Participant shall
            take any action reasonably requested by the Company in such
            connection. A Participant shall have the rights of a stockholder
            only as and when Shares have been actually issued to the
            Participant pursuant to the Plan.

                  (D) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that an entity is no longer 






                                     - 7 -

<PAGE>
            an Affiliate) other than the Participant's death, the Participant
            may thereafter exercise the Option as provided below, except that
            the Committee may terminate the unexercised portion of the Option
            concurrently with or at any time following termination of the
            employment or consulting arrangement (including termination of
            employment upon a change of status from employee to consultant) if
            it shall determine that the Participant has engaged in any
            activity detrimental to the interests of the Company or an
            Affiliate. If such termination is voluntary on the part of the
            Participant, the option may be exercised only within ten days
            after the date of termination. If such termination is involuntary
            on the part of the Participant, if an employee retires on or after
            normal retirement date or if the employment or consulting
            relationship is terminated by reason of permanent and total
            disability, the Option may be exercised within three months after
            the date of termination or retirement. For purposes of this
            Paragraph (D), a Participant's employment or consulting
            arrangement shall not be considered terminated (i) in the case of
            approved sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence (not to
            exceed one year), (ii) in the case of a transfer of employment or
            the consulting arrangement among the Company and Affiliates, or
            (iii) by virtue of a change of status from employee to consultant
            or from consultant to employee, except as provided above.

                  (E) If a Participant dies at a time when entitled to
            exercise an Option, then at any time or times within one year
            after death such Option may be exercised, as to all or any of the
            Shares which the Participant was entitled to purchase immediately
            prior to death.  The Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            designated beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims
            of third parties satisfactory to the Company. Except as so
            exercised such Option shall expire at the end of such period.

                  (F) An Option may be exercised only if and to the extent
            such Option was exercisable at the date of termination of
            employment or the consulting arrangement, and an Option may not be
            exercised at a time when the Option would not have been
            exercisable had the employment or consulting arrangement contin-
            ued.

            (iii)  Restoration Options.  The Committee may grant a Participant
      the right to receive a restoration Option with respect to an Option or
      any other option granted by the Company.  Unless the Committee shall
      otherwise determine, a restoration Option shall provide that the
      underlying option must be exercised while the Participant is an employee
      of or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate and the number of Shares
      which are subject to a 








                                     - 8 -

<PAGE>
      restoration Option shall not exceed the number of whole Shares exchanged
      in payment of the original option.

      (b)  Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder
thereof a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (i) the fair
market value of one Share on the date of exercise or, if the Committee shall
so determine in the case of any such right other than one related to any
Incentive Stock Option, at any time during a specified period before or after
the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right as specified by
the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall determine
the grant price, term, methods of exercise and settlement and any other terms
and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right and may impose such conditions
or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem
appropriate.

      (c)  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

            (i)  Issuance.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
      Participants Awards of Restricted Stock, which shall consist of Shares,
      and Restricted Stock Units which shall give the Participant the right to
      receive cash, other securities, other Awards or other property, in each
      case subject to the termination of the Restricted Period determined by
      the Committee.

            (ii)  Restrictions.  The Restricted Period may differ among
      Participants and may have different expiration dates with respect to
      portions of Shares covered by the same Award.  Subject to the terms of
      the Plan, Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
      have such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without
      limitation, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Stock or the
      right to receive any dividend or other right or property), which
      restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or
      times, in installments or otherwise. Unless the Committee shall
      otherwise determine, any Shares or other securities distributed with
      respect to Restricted Stock or which a Participant is otherwise entitled
      to receive by reason of such Shares shall be subject to the restrictions
      contained in the applicable Award Agreement. Subject to the
      aforementioned restrictions and the provisions of the Plan, Participants
      shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares of
      Restricted Stock.

            (iii)  Registration.  Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may
      be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate,
      including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of
      stock certificates.

            (iv)  Forfeiture.  Except as otherwise determined by the
      Committee:






                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>
                  (A) If the employment of or consulting arrangement with a
            Participant terminates for any reason (including termination by
            reason of the fact that any entity is no longer an Affiliate),
            other than the Participant's death or permanent and total
            disability or, in the case of an employee, retirement on or after
            normal retirement date, all Shares of Restricted Stock theretofore
            awarded to the Participant which are still subject to restrictions
            shall upon such termination of employment or the consulting
            relationship be forfeited and transferred back to the Company.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing or Paragraph (C) below, if a
            Participant continues to hold an Award of Restricted Stock
            following termination of the employment or consulting arrangement
            (including retirement and termination of employment upon a change
            of status from employee to consultant), the Shares of Restricted
            Stock which remain subject to restrictions shall nonetheless be
            forfeited and transferred back to the Company if the Committee at
            any time thereafter determines that the Participant has engaged in
            any activity detrimental to the interests of the Company or an
            Affiliate. For purposes of this Paragraph (A), a Participant's
            employment or consulting arrangement shall not be considered
            terminated (i) in the case of approved sick leave or other bona
            fide leave of absence (not to exceed one year), (ii) in the case
            of a transfer of employment or the consulting arrangement among
            the Company and Affiliates, or (iii) by virtue of a change of
            status from employee to consultant or from consultant to employee,
            except as provided above.

                  (B) If a Participant ceases to be employed or retained by
            the Company or an Affiliate by reason of death or permanent and
            total disability or if following retirement a Participant
            continues to have rights under an Award of Restricted Stock and
            thereafter dies, the restrictions contained in the Award shall
            lapse with respect to such Restricted Stock.

                  (C) If an employee ceases to be employed by the Company or
            an Affiliate by reason of retirement on or after normal retirement
            date, the restrictions contained in the Award of Restricted Stock
            shall continue to lapse in the same manner as though employment
            had not terminated.

                  (D) At the expiration of the Restricted Period as to Shares
            covered by an Award of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver
            the Shares as to which the Restricted Period has expired, as
            follows:

                        (1) if an assignment to a trust has been made in
                  accordance with Section 6(g)(iv)(B)(2)(c), to such trust; or
                  








                                    - 10 -

<PAGE>
                        (2) if the Restricted Period has expired by reason of
                  death and a beneficiary has been designated in form approved
                  by the Company, to the beneficiary so designated; or

                        (3) in all other cases, to the Participant or the
                  legal representative of the Participant's estate.

      (d)  Performance Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant
Performance Awards to Participants. Subject to the terms of the Plan, a
Performance Award granted under the Plan (i) may be denominated or payable in
cash, Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock), other
securities, other Awards, or other property and (ii) shall confer on the
holder thereof rights valued as determined by the Committee and payable to, or
exercisable by, the holder of the Performance Award, in whole or in part, upon
the achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as
the Committee shall establish. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the
performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of
any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted, the
amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award
and other terms and conditions shall be determined by the Committee.

      (e)  Dividend Equivalents.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants Awards under which the holders thereof shall be entitled to
receive payments equivalent to dividends or interest with respect to a number
of Shares determined by the Committee, and the Committee may provide that such
amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares
or otherwise reinvested. Subject to the terms of the Plan, such Awards may
have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.

      (f)  Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee is authorized to grant to
Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in
whole or in part by reference to or otherwise based on or related to Shares
(including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are
deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan,
provided, however,  that such grants to persons who are subject to Section 16
must comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Subject to the terms of the
Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards.
Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted
under this Section 6(f) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may
be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms, including,
without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other
property or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine.

      (g)  General.

            (i)  No Cash Consideration for Awards.  Awards may be granted for
      no cash consideration or for such minimal cash consideration as may be
      required by applicable law.

            (ii)  Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together.  Awards may,
      in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in
      addition to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or
      any award granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate.
      Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in
      addition to or in tandem with awards granted under another plan of the
      Company or any Affiliate, may be granted either at the same time as or
      at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.

            (iii)  Forms of Payment Under Awards.  Subject to the terms of the
      Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be
      made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise, or payment
      of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall
      determine, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
      securities, other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof,
      and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on
      a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures
      established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include,
      without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of
      reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or
      crediting of Dividend Equivalents in respect of installment or deferred
      payments.

            (iv)  Limits on Transfer of Awards.

                  (A) Except as the Committee may otherwise determine, no
            Award or right under any Award may be sold, encumbered, pledged,
            alienated, attached, assigned or transferred in any manner and any
            attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be void and unenforceable
            against the Company.

                  (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (A) above:

                        (1) An Option may be transferred:

                             (a) to a beneficiary designated by the
                        Participant in writing on a form approved by the
                        Committee; or

                             (b) by will or the applicable laws of descent and
                        distribution to the personal representative, executor
                        or administrator of the Participant's estate.

<PAGE>
                        (2) A Participant may assign or transfer rights under
                  an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units:

                             (a) to a beneficiary designated by the
                        Participant in writing on a form approved by the
                        Committee;

                             (b) by will or the applicable laws of descent and
                        distribution to the personal representative, executor
                        or administrator of the Participant's estate; or

                             (c) to a revocable grantor trust established by
                        the Participant for the sole benefit of the
                        Participant during the Participant's life, and under
                        the terms of which the Participant is and remains the
                        sole trustee until death or physical or mental
                        incapacity. Such assignment shall be effected by a
                        written instrument in form and content satisfactory to
                        the Committee, and the Participant shall deliver to
                        the Committee a true copy of the agreement or other
                        document evidencing such trust. If in the judgment of
                        the Committee the trust to which a Participant may
                        attempt to assign rights under such an Award does not
                        meet the criteria of a trust to which an assignment is
                        permitted by the terms hereof, or if after assignment,
                        because of amendment, by force of law or any other
                        reason such trust no longer meets such criteria, such
                        attempted assignment shall be void and may be
                        disregarded by the Committee and the Company and all
                        rights to any such Awards shall revert to and remain
                        solely in the Participant. Notwithstanding a qualified
                        assignment, the Participant, and not the trust to
                        which rights under such an Award may be assigned, for
                        the purpose of determining compensation arising by
                        reason of the Award shall continue to be considered an
                        employee or consultant, as the case may be, of the
                        Company or an Affiliate, but such trust and the
                        Participant shall be bound by all of the terms and
                        conditions of the Award Agreement and this Plan.
                        Shares issued in the name of and delivered to such
                        trust shall be conclusively considered issuance and
                        delivery to the Participant.

                        (3) The Committee shall not permit directors or
                  officers of the Company for purposes of Section 16 to
                  transfer or assign Awards except as permitted under Rule
                  16b-3.

                  (C) The Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and
            employees may rely upon any beneficiary designation, assignment or
            other instrument of transfer, copies of trust agreements and any
            other documents delivered to them by or on behalf of the
            Participant which they believe genuine and any action taken by
            them in reliance thereon shall be conclusive and binding upon the
            Participant, the personal representatives of the Participant's
            estate and all persons asserting a claim based on an Award. The
            delivery by a Participant of a beneficiary designation, or an
            assignment of rights under an Award as permitted hereunder, shall
            constitute the Participant's irrevocable undertaking to hold the
            Committee, the Company and its officers, agents and employees
            harmless against claims, including any cost or expense incurred in
            defending against claims, of any person (including the
            Participant) which may be asserted or alleged to be based on an
            Award subject to a beneficiary designation or an assignment. In
            addition, the Company may decline to deliver Shares to a
            beneficiary until it receives indemnity against claims of third
            parties satisfactory to the Company.

            (v)  Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares or other
      securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the
      exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other
      restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the
      rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other
      securities are then listed and any applicable Federal or state
      securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be
      put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such
      restrictions.

            (vi)  Change in Control.  (A) Notwithstanding any of the
      provisions of this Plan or instruments evidencing Awards granted
      hereunder, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as hereinafter
      defined) the vesting of all rights of Participants under outstanding
      Awards shall be accelerated and all restrictions thereon shall terminate
      in order that Participants may fully realize the benefits thereunder.
      Such acceleration shall include, without limitation, the immediate
      exercisability in full of all Options and the termination of
      restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Further, in
      addition to the Committee's authority set forth in Section 4(b), the
      Committee, as constituted before such Change in Control, is authorized,
      and has sole discretion, as to any Award, either at the time such Award
      is made hereunder or any time thereafter, to take any one or more of the
      following actions: (i) provide for the purchase of any such Award, upon
      the Participant's request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount
      that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or
      realization of the Participant's rights had such Award been currently
      exercisable or payable; (ii) make such adjustment to any such Award then
      outstanding as the Committee 





                                    - 14 -

<PAGE>
      deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control; and (iii) cause any
      such Award then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted
      therefor, by the acquiring or surviving corporation after such Change in
      Control.

            (B) With respect to any Award granted hereunder prior to
      December 6, 1995, a Change in Control shall occur if:

                  (1) any "person" or "group of persons" as such terms are
            used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than
            pursuant to a transaction or agreement previously approved by the
            Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
            purchases or otherwise becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined
            in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or has the right to acquire
            such beneficial ownership (whether or not such right is
            exercisable immediately, with the passage of time, or subject to
            any condition) of voting securities representing 25 percent or
            more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting
            securities of (A) the Company or (B) of Masco Corporation, a
            Delaware corporation ("Masco"); or

                  (2) during any period of twenty-four consecutive calendar
            months, the individuals who at the beginning of such period
            constitute the Company's or Masco's Board of Directors, and any
            new directors whose election by such Board or nomination for
            election by stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-
            thirds of the members of such Board who were either directors on
            such Board at the beginning of the period or whose election or
            nomination for election as directors was previously so approved,
            for any reason cease to constitute at least a majority of the
            members thereof.

            (C)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B),
      with respect to Awards granted hereunder on or after December 6,
      1995, a Change in Control shall occur only if the event described
      in this subparagraph (C) shall have occurred.  With respect to any
      other Award granted prior thereto, a Change in Control shall occur
      if any of the events described in subparagraphs (B) or (C) shall
      have occurred, unless the holder of any such Award shall have
      consented to the application of this subparagraph (C) in lieu of
      the foregoing subparagraph (B).  A Change in Control for purposes
      of this subparagraph (C) shall occur if, during any period of
      twenty-four consecutive calendar months, the individuals who at
      the beginning of such period constitute the Company's Board of
      Directors, and any new directors (other than Excluded Directors,
      as hereinafter defined), whose election by such Board or
      nomination for election by stockholders was approved by a vote of
      at least two-thirds of the members of such Board who were either
      directors on such Board at the beginning of 






                                    - 15 -

<PAGE>
      the period or whose election or nomination for election as directors was
      previously so approved, for any reason cease to constitute at least a
      majority of the members thereof.  For purposes hereof, "Excluded
      Directors" are directors whose election by the Board or approval by the
      Board for stockholder election occurred within one year of any "person"
      or "group of persons", as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and
      14(d) of the Exchange Act, commencing a tender offer for, or becoming
      the beneficial owner of, voting securities representing 25 percent or
      more of the combined voting power of all outstanding voting securities
      of the Company, other than pursuant to a tender offer approved by the
      Board prior to its commencement or pursuant to stock acquisitions
      approved by the Board prior to their representing 25 percent or more of
      such combined voting power.

            (D)(1)      In the event that subsequent to a Change in Control it
      is determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for
      the benefit of a Participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or
      distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise, other
      than any payment pursuant to this subparagraph (D) (a "Payment"), would
      be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any
      interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
      together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
      collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then such Participant
      shall be entitled to receive from the Company, within 15 days following
      the determination described in (2) below, an additional payment ("Excise
      Tax Adjustment Payment") in an amount such that after payment by such
      Participant of all applicable Federal, state and local taxes (computed
      at the maximum marginal rates and including any interest or penalties
      imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
      upon the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, such Participant retains an
      amount of the Excise Tax Adjustment Payment equal to the Excise Tax
      imposed upon the Payments.

            (2)   All determinations required to be made under this Section
      6(g)(vi)(D), including whether an Excise Tax Adjustment Payment is
      required and the amount of such Excise Tax Adjustment Payment, shall be
      made by Cooper & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm
      as the Company, or, subsequent to a Change in Control, the Company and
      the Participant jointly, may designate, for purposes of the Excise Tax,
      which shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and
      the affected Participant within 15 business days of the date of the
      applicable Payment.  Except as hereinafter provided, any determination
      by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., or such other national accounting firm,
      shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  As a result of
      the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code that may
      exist at the time of the initial determination 









                                    - 16 -

<PAGE>
      hereunder, it is possible that (x) certain Excise Tax Adjustment
      Payments will not have been made by the Company which should have been
      made (an "Underpayment"), or (y) certain Excise Tax Adjustment Payments
      will have been made which should not have been made (an "Overpayment"),
      consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the
      event of an Underpayment, such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by
      the Company to or for the benefit of the affected Participant.  In the
      event that the Participant discovers that an Overpayment shall have
      occurred, the amount thereof shall be promptly repaid to the Company.

            (3)   This Section 6(g)(vi)(D) shall not apply to any Award (x)
      that was granted prior to February 17, 1993 and (y) the holder of which
      is an executive officer of the Company, as determined under the Exchange
      Act.

            (vii)  Cash Settlement.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
      Plan or of any Award Agreement to the contrary, any Award outstanding
      hereunder may at any time be cancelled in the Committee's sole
      discretion upon payment of the value of such Award to the holder thereof
      in cash or in another Award hereunder, such value to be determined by
      the Committee in its sole discretion.


Section 7. Amendment and Termination

      Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise
expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

      (a)  Amendments to the Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company may
amend the Plan and the Board of Directors or the Committee may amend any
outstanding Award; provided, however,  that (i) no Plan amendment shall be
effective until approved by stockholders of the Company insofar as stockholder
approval thereof is required in order for the Plan to continue to satisfy the
conditions of Rule 16b-3, and (ii) without the consent of affected
Participants no amendment of the Plan or of any Award may impair the rights of
Participants under outstanding Awards.

      (b)  Waivers.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under
any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the
consent of any Participant.

      (c)  Adjustments of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or
Nonrecurring Events.  The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in
the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in
recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation,
the events described in Section 4(b) hereof) affecting the Company, any
Affiliate, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or of
changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever
the Committee determines that 






                                    - 17 -

<PAGE>
such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement
of the benefits or potential benefits to be made available under the Plan.

      (d)  Correction of Defects, Omissions, and Inconsistencies.  The
Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it
shall deem desirable to effectuate the Plan.


Section 8. General Provisions

      (a)  No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or other person shall have any
claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards
under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards of the same type and the
determination of the Committee to grant a waiver or modification of any Award
and the terms and conditions thereof need not be the same with respect to each
Participant.

      (b)  Withholding.  The Company or any Affiliate shall be authorized to
withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any
Award or under the Plan the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other
Awards or other property) of withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its
exercise or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to
take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company or
Affiliate to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

      (c)  No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in
the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continu-
ing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including the
grant of options and other stock-based awards, and such arrangements may be
either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

      (d)  No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Award shall not be
construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of
the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any
time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any
claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in
any Award Agreement or other written agreement with the Participant.

      (e)  Governing Law.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan
and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable Federal law.

      (f)  Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or
becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan








                                    - 18 -

<PAGE>
or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision
shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it
cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the
Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such
provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the
remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and
effect.

      (g)  No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall
create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a
fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant
or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive
payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right
shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
Company or any Affiliate.

      (h)  No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or
delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine
whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred
in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any
rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.

      (i)  Headings.  Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of
the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall
not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or
interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.


Section 9. Effective Date of the Plan

      The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the
Company's stockholders.
