                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

     Unitog Company, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries is referred
to herein as the "Company".  The Company was first incorporated in Missouri in
1948 and was reincorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1969.  The Company's
executive offices are located at 101 West 11th Street, Kansas City, Missouri
64105, and its telephone number is (816) 474-7000.

A.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

     Information incorporated herein by reference from the Company's Annual
Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1995, page 23.

B.   NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

GENERAL

     The Company is a leading provider of high quality uniform rental services
to a variety of industries and sells custom-designed uniforms primarily to
national companies in connection with their corporate image programs.  The
Company manufactures substantially all the uniforms it rents or sells.  The
Company provides national uniform programs for many of the largest companies in
the United States on both a rental and direct sale basis.  In addition, the
Company believes it is one of the largest suppliers of uniforms to employees of
the United States Postal Service.  Rental operations accounted for 70.6%, 70.3%
and 67.9% of the Company's total revenues in fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Uniform Direct sales accounted for the remaining revenues.

RENTAL OPERATIONS

     The Company rents uniforms and other industrial items, such as dust mops,
wiping towels and entrance mats, and, to a lesser extent, linen items, such as
sheets, pillowcases, tablecloths and napkins, to customers who prefer a rental
laundry service instead of purchasing and maintaining such items themselves.

     Uniform Rentals.  The Company's rental services are designed to address
customers' requirements for managing employee uniform programs.  The services
provided by Unitog include assistance in selecting fabrics, styles and colors
appropriate for a customer's needs;  maintaining necessary inventory to match
the customer's changing employment levels;  replacing worn items and providing
pick-up, cleaning, maintenance and delivery services on a regularly scheduled
basis.





                                       2
<PAGE>   3


     The Company provides rental services in 44 markets to customers in 26
states.   Rental services are provided through industrial laundry facilities at
which the cleaning and processing of garments is performed.   In addition, the
Company operates sales and service branches which serve as sales offices and
warehouse and distribution sites, allowing the Company to provide rental
services to customers in geographic areas adjacent to the immediate area of  an
industrial laundry facility.

     Generally, the Company's uniform rental service contracts cover a
multi-year term and provide compensation to Unitog in the event a customer
terminates the contract before the end of the term.  In addition, if a rental
item is lost, stolen or destroyed, Unitog receives a specified replacement
value.

     Linen Rentals.  The Company rents linens, such as sheets, pillowcases,
tablecloths and napkins, primarily to customers in the hotel and food service
industries.  Unitog has historically retained linen volume if the linen volume
does not adversely impact the operating efficiency of the rental plant.  In
those instances where operating efficiency was affected, the Company has sold
linen volume.

DIRECT SALES

     The Company has over 60 years of experience in supplying custom-designed
uniforms to national customers in connection with corporate image programs.  A
majority of the Company's direct sales are to companies in diverse industries,
including automotive services, petroleum, brewing, soft drink bottling and
transportation industries.  The Company believes that it has remained a leader
in uniform sales by consistently offering superior program management, prompt
order fulfillment and high quality uniforms in a variety of styles, colors and
fabrics.

     Unitog provides a total uniform management program to its customers.  The
Company assists its customers in designing attractive, readily recognizable
uniforms to complement the customer's overall corporate identity.  The
Company's product line consists of shirts, trousers, jackets, coveralls,
rainwear, selected women's apparel and related accessories.  In many cases, a
national customer selects a particular style of uniform and designates approved
suppliers to sell the uniforms to the customer's independent distributors,
franchisees or employees throughout the customer's distribution system.  Unitog
specializes in assisting these national customers by promoting the benefits of
approved uniform programs through the use of professionally designed brochures,
promotional programs and direct sales contacts.

     The Company has sold uniforms to employees of the United States Postal
Service under the Brookfield label for over 25 years.  The Postal Service
provides an annual allotment ranging from $50 to





                                      3
<PAGE>   4

$310 to each postal employee for uniform purchases.  The individual employee is
then free to select uniforms from any supplier approved by the Postal Service.
Payment is made by the Postal Service directly to the Company to the extent of
the employee's allotment and any excess is paid directly by the employee.

SALES AND MARKETING

     The Company considers its target market to be national and regional
customers seeking improved image and employee recognition as well as higher
levels of product quality and customer service.

     The selling efforts of the Rental and Direct sales forces are combined 
under common regional sales managers, creating a company-wide marketing 
approach to maximize cross-selling opportunities by identifying customers' 
needs, whether rental or direct sale. Unitog believes the program has resulted 
in a more professional sales team, upgraded sales training and improved 
salesperson productivity.

     Uniform programs on the national level are handled by the national account
marketing department, whose members call directly on existing and prospective
rental and direct sale national accounts.  The Company's Rental sales force is
comprised of salespersons based at the rental locations who call on customers
within the geographic service area of the rental location.  In addition to the
Rental sales force, the Company's route salespersons have responsibility for
increasing sales to customers on their routes.  The Company maintains a Direct
sales force that covers the continental United States, with each member being
assigned a specific sales territory.  Sales of Postal Service uniforms are made
through direct sales calls on postal employees by commissioned representatives.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

     The Company manufactures garments and emblems for both the Rental and
Direct sales operations at four plants located in Missouri, one plant located
in Arkansas and one plant located in  Honduras.  The Company performs
manufacturing operations, consisting mainly of cutting, sewing and finishing
garments, for substantially all its product line.  From time to time Unitog
contracts with independent garment manufacturers for a portion of its
requirements.  Certain uniform accessories sold or rented by the Company, such
as shoes, ties and belts, are purchased from other manufacturers.

     The Company maintains distribution centers in Ontario, California,
Atlanta, Georgia and Kansas City and Warrensburg, Missouri where its uniforms
are stored pending shipment to customers.  The Company believes that its
experience and efficiency





                                       4
<PAGE>   5

in the manufacturing and distribution processes enable the Company to provide
quick delivery of customized products.

SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS

     Substantially all of the fabrics used by Unitog in its manufacturing
process are acquired from textile mills located in the United States.
Alternative sources of these materials are generally available.

SEASONALITY

     Rental operations are not generally  subject to seasonality. Subject to
the effects of the introduction of new programs with national accounts, Direct
sales have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the
sale of fall and winter garments.  As a result, operating income can be higher
in such quarters.

CUSTOMERS

     No material part of the business of the Company is dependent upon a single
customer or a small number of customers.

COMPETITION

     The business in which Unitog is engaged is highly competitive, and the
Company competes in both the sale and rental of uniforms with a large number of
other firms.  The Company believes that the primary competitive factors that
affect its operations are design, quality, service and price.  The Company
believes it maintains prices comparable to those of its major competitors and
endeavors to offer prompt and high quality service to its customers and
superior products as the principal methods of distinguishing itself from its
competition.  Unitog's Rental operation competes with a number of national,
regional and local companies in the geographic areas it serves.  The Company's
Direct sales operation also competes on a national basis with other suppliers
and uniform manufacturers.   Some of these competitors are larger and have
greater financial resources than the Company.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use
and disposal of various wastes, including  wastewater from its washing
processes.  The Company has a continuing program to upgrade wastewater
treatment processes, where necessary, to avoid improper disposal.  Although the
Company is subject to administrative and judicial proceedings from time to time
involving environmental matters, the Company does not believe that costs
incurred in connection with environmental compliance





                                       5
<PAGE>   6

will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of
the Company.

     The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws which
require the investigation and, in some cases, remediation of environmental
contamination.  The Company is currently engaged in soil and groundwater
investigations at its Phoenix, Minneapolis and Los Angeles rental plants.  The
Phoenix and Los Angeles plants are located in federal superfund sites several
square miles in size.  The Company, along with certain unaffiliated parties,
has been designated by the U.S. EPA as a potentially responsible party under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with
respect to the Phoenix site.  The Company entered into a consent order with EPA
requiring a soil and groundwater investigation at the Phoenix site.  The cost
of the investigation will be borne by two other parties pursuant to a
settlement agreement with the Company.  Test results at the Phoenix site
indicate that volatile organic compound contamination is present in the soil,
necessitating soil remediation.  Groundwater tests have not detected on-site
contamination, although additional periodic groundwater testing is expected.
Test results at the Minneapolis and Los Angeles plants indicate that volatile
organic compound contamination is present in the soil and groundwater at those
plants.  The Company believes that it will be required to remediate the soil at
the Minneapolis plant and has begun soil remediation at Los Angeles.
Additional testing is being conducted to determine if groundwater remediation
will be required at those facilities.  The Company's estimate of the expense
related to all three of these sites has been accrued and charged to operating
expense.  Based on information currently available, the Company does not
believe that additional costs of investigation and remediation at these sites
are individually or in the aggregate material to the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, as of September 10, 1993, the Borrowers, the Banks and the
Agent entered into a Loan and Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement (the
"LOAN AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which the Banks provided to the Borrowers
revolving loans of up to Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) and issued

         WHEREAS, the Letter of Credit was issued to Peoples Bank & Trust
Company as trustee (the "TRUSTEE") under a Trust Indenture (the "INDENTURE")
dated as of December 1, 1988, for the purpose of securing certain notes (the
"Notes")  issued by the Borrowers pursuant to the Indenture.

         WHEREAS, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes have agreed to waive
the requirement that the Notes be secured by the Letter of Credit, as
specifically set forth in Amendment No. 2 to Trust Indenture, dated December
29, 1994.

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Loan Agreement to reflect the
elimination of the Letter of Credit and to reflect certain other changes.

promises contained herein, the parties mutually agree as follows:

             Cancellation of the Letter of Credit; Installment Loan

     3.1 Cancellation of the Letter of Credit.  Each of the Banks consents to
the cancellation and return of the Letter of Credit and agrees that all
obligations of the Borrowers with respect to the Letter of Credit are
terminated including, without limitation, the obligation of the Borrowers to
pay any commission in connection with the issuance or maintenance of the Letter
of Credit.

     3.2 Installment Loan.  If the Borrowers are in full and complete
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, upon the written election of the
Borrowers to the Agent, the Banks agree to loan to the Borrowers an amount
equal to the then outstanding principal balance of the Credit Enhanced Notes,
plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption, which loan shall be
used by the Borrowers for the sole purpose of redeeming the Credit Enhanced
Notes in full.  Such loan shall be an installment loan obligation payable over
a term of four (4)  years in equal quarterly payments of principal calculated
on a seven (7) year amortization of such principal amount and a final principal
payment in the amount of the remaining outstanding principal loan amount.  Such
installment loan shall bear interest payable quarterly in arrears on the same
date as each principal payment is due and at a rate per annum equal to the
3-month LIBOR rate, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, plus the Applicable
Margin for LIBOR Advances plus 25 basis points, adjusted each ninety (90) days.
Upon receipt by the Agent of notice of any such election by the Borrowers, the
Agent shall immediately notify the Banks of such election.  Three (3) Banking
Days after receipt of such notification, Harris and NBD shall each transfer to
the Agent by wire transfer or deposit to any correspondent account which Agent
may maintain with such Bank an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the
principal amount of the loan as provided above in this Section 3.2 and UMB
shall immediately transfer forty percent (40%) of such amount to the Agent.
Upon receipt by the Agent of notes executed by the Borrowers in the form of
Exhibit E attached hereto payable to each of the Banks in each Bank's Pro Rata
Share of such loan, the Agent shall disburse the amount of the loan to the
Borrowers by depositing the same in the Company's account at UMB, and the
Borrowers hereby authorize the disbursement of the loan in such manner.  The
Agent shall handle the notes in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto and all
collections thereon in the same manner as provided in this Agreement for
collections on Revolving Credit Loans as respects the Banks."

     3.  References to Installment Loan.  Each reference in the Loan Agreement
to the installment loan provided for in Section 3.8 shall be amended to mean
and refer to the installment loan provided for in Section 3.2 of the Loan
Agreement.

     4.  Amendment to Section 9.2.1.  Section 9.2.1 of the Loan Agreement is
amended by deleting therefrom the phrase "may cause NBD to cause the Trustee to

Credit."

                                AMENDMENT NO. 2
                               TO TRUST INDENTURE


     This Amendment is entered into this 29th day of December, 1994 between
UNITOG COMPANY and UNITOG RENTAL SERVICES, INC. (the "Companies") and PEOPLES
BANK & TRUST COMPANY (the "Trustee").

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS, the Companies and the Trustee entered into a Trust Indenture,
dated as of December 1, 1988, governing the Companies' 9.68% Fixed Rate Credit
Enhanced Notes due December 1, 1998 (the "Original Notes"), which Indenture was
subsequently amended as of September 10, 1993 (as amended, the "Indenture").

     WHEREAS, the Original Notes are secured by, among other things, a Letter
of Credit, dated as of September 10, 1993, issued by NBD Bank, N.A. (the
"Letter of Credit").

     WHEREAS, the Original Notes are held by the Lincoln National Life
Insurance Company (the "Noteholder") and the Noteholder has agreed to waive the
requirement that the Original Notes and the Replacement Notes (as hereinafter
defined) be secured by the Letter of Credit, in exchange for certain changes to
the Indenture and in exchange for the issuance by the Companies of notes that
will replace the Original Notes and that have a higher interest rate than the
Original Notes.

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Indenture as set forth herein to
reflect the elimination of the Letter of Credit and certain other changes.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

     1.  Elimination of Letter of Credit.  Effective as of the date hereof, the
requirement that the Original Notes (and any replacements thereof, including,
without limitation, the Replacement Notes) be secured by a letter of credit is
eliminated and the Indenture is amended to reflect the elimination of the
requirement to provide a letter of credit.  The Trustee shall immediately
return the Letter of Credit to NBD Bank, N.A. for cancellation.

     2.  Replacement Notes: No Effect on Redemption.

        (a)  On the date hereof, the Companies shall issue to the Noteholder
the Companies' 10.055% Fixed Rate Notes due December 1, 1998 (the "Replacement
Notes"), which Replacement Notes shall be in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A, in exchange for and as a replacement to the Original Notes.
Simultaneously with the issuance of the Replacement Notes, the Original Notes   
shall be cancelled and the Noteholder shall immediately return the originals
thereof to the Trustee for cancellation and the Trustee following cancellation
shall immediately 





<PAGE>   2

return the originals thereof to the Companies.  All references in the
Indenture and in this Amendment No. 2 to the Notes shall from and after the
date hereof mean the Replacement Notes.

         (b)  The Trustee and the Noteholder (by signing the consent in the
form attached hereto) acknowledge that the agreement by the Companies to enter
into this Amendment No. 2 and the issuance by the Companies of the Replacement
Notes is predicated in part, on the absolute right of the Companies to redeem
the Replacement Notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest
thereon to the date of such redemption, on and after December 1, 1995.
Accordingly, the Trustee and the Noteholder (by signing the consent in the form
attached hereto) acknowledge and agree that nothing in the Indenture, this
Amendment No. 2 or otherwise shall impair, restrict or otherwise adversely
affect the Companies' absolute right to redeem the Replacement Notes, as stated
above on or after December 1, 1995.

     3.  Payments Under the Indenture.  Commencing on the date hereof, all
amounts required to be paid by the Companies under the Replacement Notes
(including interest, optional and mandatory redemptions) shall be paid by the
Companies to the Trustee on the due dates thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.  Attached hereto as Exhibit B are the wire
instructions for payments to the Trustee.

     4.  Amendment to Second Paragraph. The second paragraph of the Indenture
is amended by deleting therefrom the words "and the Credit Bank."

     5.  Amendment to Section 2.10.  Section 2.10 of the Indenture is deleted
in its entirety and replaced with the following:

         "Section 2.10.  Security.  The Notes are secured by the Mortgages and,
may after the date hereof, be secured from time to time by Additional
Collateral (as hereinafter defined).  The Trustee shall consent to, and shall
have no right to disapprove, any release of collateral covered by the Mortgages
or Additional Collateral and shall promptly execute all documentation necessary
to effect the release (the "Release") upon the delivery by the Companies to the
Trustee of a certificate stating that the principal amount of the Notes
outstanding at the time of a request for a Release (the "Outstanding Amount")
will not, after giving effect to any such Release, exceed (x) ninety percent
(90%) for the period from and including the date hereof through and including
March 31, 1990, and (y) eighty-five percent (85%) for periods thereafter (the
"Applicable Percentage"), of (A) the fair market value of the collateral then
subject to Mortgages as determined by an independent appraisal, satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole and absolute discretion, dated as of a date not earlier
than eighteen (18) months prior to the date of any such proposed Release plus
(B) the amount of Additional Collateral (together referred to herein as the
"Collateral Value"), it being the intent of the parties hereto and the
Noteholders that upon the presentation of such certificate, the Trustee shall
be absolutely required to execute such documentation as may be necessary to
effect the Release, without any requirement of obtaining the consent of the
Noteholders.  If the Companies seek to obtain a Release and if the Outstanding
Amount exceeds the Applicable Percentage of the Collateral Value, or would
exceed the Applicable Percentage of the Collateral Value after giving effect to
the Release, the Companies



                                       2

<PAGE>   3

acknowledge and agree that the collateral sought to be released may not be
released without the prior written consent of the Trustee and Initial Holders;
provided, however, that if the Companies elect to deposit with the Trustee, to
be held as additional collateral securing the obligations of the Companies
under this Indenture, cash or its equivalent equal to the amount by which the
Outstanding Amount exceeds the Applicable Percentage of the Collateral Value of
the collateral after giving effect to the proposed Release ("Additional
Collateral), then the Trustee shall be required to execute promptly
documentation necessary to effect the Release as above provided upon delivery
of the required certificate above described.  The Trustee shall hold such
Additional Collateral in a separate account pledged for the benefit of the
Trustee to secure its obligations under the Indenture.  The Trustee shall be
permitted to invest such Additional Collateral in Investment Securities and, so
long as there is no Event of Default by the Companies hereunder, interest or
other income derived from such Investment Securities shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Companies and the Trustee shall not have a security interest in
such interest.  Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary
whatsoever, the Applicable Percentage may not be waived or otherwise amended
without the prior written consent of the Initial Holders, so long as they own
any of the Notes.

         The Trustee shall be required to accept such additional real estate
collateral hereunder to be included in the Mortgages for all purposes under
this Indenture as the Companies shall elect to deliver to the Trustee provided
that the Trustee shall receive customary opinions of counsel, title insurance
and representations and warranties with respect to the validity, binding nature
and enforceability of any such Mortgage.

         The Companies hereby agree to grant on or before March 31, 1989 to the
Trustee a Mortgage on that certain real property of Unitog Rental Services,
Inc. located in Duluth, Minnesota and the Companies shall promptly notify the
Trustee of the recording of such Mortgage."

     6.  Amendment to Section 3.01(a).  Section 3.01(a) of the Indenture is
deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

         "(a)      Redemption at Option of Companies.  On and after December 1,
1995 (but not prior to December 1, 1995), all Notes or a portion of the

     6.  Restriction on Transfer.  This Note has not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state
securities law.  The holder of this Note, by the acceptance hereof, represents
and warrants that it is acquiring this Note for investment purposes and not for
the purpose of distribution thereof.  No transfer of this Note or any interest
herein shall be made unless such transfer is made pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or is made in a transaction
that does not require such registration.  Until such time as this Note shall be
registered pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act,
this Note and any Note issued upon the transfer or replacement hereof shall
bear a legend to the effect set forth in the preceding sentence.  In the event
that registration of a transfer is to be made in reliance upon an exemption of
the transfer from the Securities Act, the Companies or the Trustee may require,
in order to assure compliance with the Securities Act, the prospective
transferor and transferee to certify to the Companies and the Trustee in
writing the facts surrounding such proposed transfer.  In the event that such
certificate of facts does not, in the reasonable judgment of the Companies or
the Trustee, on its face establish the availability of an exemption under the
Securities Act, the Companies or the Trustee may require an Opinion of Counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Companies or the Trustee, as the case may be,
that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption from the Securities
Act.  In lieu of the certification of facts surrounding a proposed transfer,
the prospective transferor or transferee may provide the Opinion of Counsel
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence.  Any such Opinion of Counsel
shall be obtained at the expense of the prospective transferee and not at the
expense of the Companies or the Trustee, and shall be delivered to the
Companies and Trustee prior to or contemporaneously with any such transfer.
Neither the Companies nor the Trustee is obligated to register the Notes under
the Securities Act or to take any other action not otherwise required under
this Agreement to permit the transfer of  Notes without registration.

     7.  No Recourse Against Others.  A director, officer, employee or
stockholder, as such, of either Company shall not have any liability for any
obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture of for any claim
based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.
Each Noteholder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the
Notes.

     8.  Joint and Several Liability.  The Companies' obligations hereunder and
under the Indenture are both joint and several and each Company expressly binds
itself, both jointly with the other company and individually to the Trustee for
the full payment and performance of such obligations, and acknowledges and
agrees that both may be sued together for the enforcement of such obligations
or that the Trustee may select either Company alone as the object of such suit.
The obligations of the Companies hereunder and under the Indenture are absolute
and unconditional, shall be without relief from valuation or appraisement laws
and shall remain in full force and effect until all such obligations have been
fully paid or performed, and such obligations shall not be affected, modified
or impaired upon the happening from time to time of any event or matter that
might be raised in avoidance of, or in defense against, an action to enforce
such obligations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994

Revenues for fiscal 1995 were $189.1 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or
6% over fiscal 1994.

Rental revenues were $133.5 million for fiscal 1995, an increase of $8.5
million, or 7% over last year.  Internal growth from our existing locations was
4% for fiscal 1995.  Revenue increases for industrial rentals were stronger
than last year. A decline in our linen rental business together with little
development in the Southern California region during fiscal 1995 combined to
offset the industrial rental gain.  Southern California continued to experience
difficult economic conditions which resulted in slim, if any, job growth within
our customer base in this region.

Direct sales were $55.7 million for fiscal 1995, an increase of $2.7 million,
or 5% over last year.  Direct sales were impacted by a 12% increase in sales of
U.S. Postal Service uniforms and increased demand for industrial garments.
Several new national industrial uniform customer programs were developed in
fiscal 1995 which will start shipping in fiscal 1996.

Rental operating contribution was $26.4 million for fiscal 1995, an increase of
$3.5 million, or 15% over last year.  Rental operating contribution was 19.8%
of rental revenue compared to 18.3% in fiscal 1994.  This improvement was
brought about by lower garment costs and better plant processing and handling
efficiencies.  

Direct sales operating contribution for fiscal 1995 was $10.7 million, 
an increase of $750,000, or 8% over fiscal 1994.  Direct sales
operating contribution was 19.2% of sales compared to 18.7% last year.
Increased sales and cost controls created the gain over fiscal 1994.

General and administrative costs for fiscal 1995 were $8.2 million, a 17%
increase over fiscal 1994. Increased spending on technology enhancement
projects and other general expenses contributed to the higher costs in fiscal
1995.

Interest expense for fiscal 1995 of $2.6 million was $700,000 or 21% less than
the prior year.  Debt repayments from our April 1993 public stock offering and
the replacement of higher cost bank debt with $20 million of 5.8% privately
placed notes in fiscal 1994 produced the interest expense savings during fiscal
1995.





<PAGE>   2

Net earnings were $10 million for fiscal 1995, an increase of $2.2 million, or
28% over fiscal 1994.  The gain was caused by improved operating contributions
from both the Rental and Direct sales business segments and reduced  interest
expense which offset higher general and administrative costs.  Net earnings per
share were $1.07 per share in fiscal 1995 compared to $.87 per share last year,
a 23% gain.  The 28% increase in net earnings was offset slightly by 4% more
average shares outstanding due to our public offering in April 1993.

FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993

Revenues for fiscal 1994 were $177.9 million, an increase of $7.8 million or 5%
over fiscal 1993.  Rental revenues increased 8% over fiscal 1993 to $125
million.  Direct sales declined 3% from the prior year to $52.9 million.
Internal rental revenue growth for fiscal 1994 was 5% with all our service
regions showing improvement over fiscal 1993, exclusive of Southern California.
The decline in Direct sales was expected due to the typical reduction in orders
during the second year of several image programs introduced in fiscal 1993 with
national customers.  Fiscal 1993 included an additional week of revenue
compared to fiscal 1994.

Rental operating contribution for fiscal 1994 was $22.9 million, an increase of
$2.1 million or 10% over fiscal 1993.  Rental operating contribution was 18.3%
of rental revenue in fiscal 1994 compared to 18.0% in fiscal 1993.  The
improved rental operating contribution was due to reductions in garment costs,
plant production costs and lower general operating expenses.

Direct sales operating contribution for fiscal 1994 was $9.9 million, an
increase of $850,000, or 9% over fiscal 1993.  Direct sales operating
contribution was 18.7% of sales in fiscal 1994 compared to 16.6% in the prior
year.  Improved distribution efficiencies and continued expense control created
the increase over fiscal 1993, despite a slight sales decrease.

Interest expense for fiscal 1994 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $1.5 million
or 31% from the prior year.  Debt repayments from our April 1993 public stock
offering and cash provided from operating activities combined with our bank
debt refinancing activities to create the decrease.

The Company's fiscal 1994 income tax rate was 39% compared to 37% in fiscal
1993.  During the third quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company adjusted its
deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of the August 1993
increase in federal corporate income tax rates.  The amount of the adjustment
was $165,000 or $.02 per share.

Net earnings for fiscal 1994 were $7.8 million or $.87 per share compared to
$5.9 million or $.78 per share in fiscal 1993.  Net earnings increased 32% over
the prior year due to profitability improvements from the operations of both
the Rental and Direct sales businesses and reduced interest costs.  Net
earnings per share in fiscal 1994 increased $.09 per share or 12% over the
prior year.  The 32% improvement in net earnings in fiscal 1994 was offset by
18% more average shares outstanding due to our public stock offering in April
1993.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 1995 were $7.7 million, an increase of
$4.3 million over last year.  At January 29, 1995 the Company's capitalization
ratio was 32% compared to 35% one year ago.  The Company's long-term debt is
at a blended fixed rate of 7.6%.  There were no borrowings outstanding under
the Company's $35 million long-term bank credit facility at year end.  On or
after December 1, 1995 the Company may prepay at par value all or a portion of
$14.6 million of 10% long-term notes due in 1998.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 1995 was $20 million, about
the same as last year.  Working capital was $40.3 million at January 29, 1995
compared to $34.4 million at January 30, 1994.  The increase in working capital
was due to higher levels of garments in service and increases in cash and cash
equivalents.  The Company raised its semi-annual dividend by 20% in fiscal 1995
to $.04 per share.  Capital expenditures were $9.2 million for fiscal 1995.
Planned capital expenditures for fiscal 1996 are $15 million.

During fiscal 1995, the Company completed four acquisitions which will add $5.5
million in annual rental revenues.  These purchases expanded our market
presence in Los Angeles, Toledo and Dallas.

Management believes that cash provided by operations and its bank credit
facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for rental
acquisitions and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to
environmental matters, including laws which require the investigation and, in
some cases, remediation of environmental contamination.  The Company is
currently engaged in soil and groundwater investigations at its Phoenix,
Minneapolis, and Los Angeles rental plants.  The Phoenix and Los Angeles plants
are located in federal superfund sites several square miles in size.  The
Company, along with certain unaffiliated parties, has been designated by the
U.S. EPA as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with respect to the
Phoenix site.  The Company entered into a consent order with EPA requiring a
soil and groundwater investigation at the Phoenix site. The cost of the 
investigation will be borne by two other parties pursuant to a settlement 
agreement with the Company.  Test results at the Phoenix site indicate that 
volatile organic compound contamination is present in the soil, necessitating 
soil remediation.  Groundwater tests have not detected on-site contamination, 
although additional periodic groundwater testing is expected.  Test results 
at the Minneapolis and Los Angeles plants indicate that volatile organic 
compound contamination is present in the soil and groundwater at those plants.  
The Company believes that it will be required to remediate the soil at the 
Minneapolis plant and has begun soil remediation at Los Angeles.  Additional 
testing is being conducted to determine if ground-water remediation will be 
required at those facilities.  The Company's estimate of the expense related 
to all three of these sites has been accrued and charged to operating expense.  
Based on information currently available, the Company does not believe that 
additional costs of investigation and remediation at these sites are 
individually or in the aggregate material to the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company.

Inflation has not significantly affected the Company in recent years.  Labor
and raw materials are the Company's primary operating costs.  Inventories are
valued on the LIFO (last-in first-out) method, which management believes more
accurately matches current costs with current revenues.

Unitog Company and Subsidiaries

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

Unitog Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unitog Company
and subsidiaries as of January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended January 29, 1995.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Unitog Company and
subsidiaries at January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended January 29, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      YEARS ENDED JANUARY 29, 1995, JANUARY 30, 1994 AND JANUARY 31, 1993

(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company recognizes Rental revenues when the services are delivered to
customers.  The Company records Direct sales upon shipment to the customer.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company uses a fifty-two/fifty-three week period ending on the last Sunday
in January.  Fifty-two week periods were included in the years ended January
29, 1995 and January 30, 1994.  A fifty-three week period was included in the
year ended January 31, 1993.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money market deposits, and investments
in highly-liquid tax-exempt municipal bond funds.  For purposes of reporting
cash flows, the Company considers investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with costs applied on the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

RENTAL GARMENTS IN SERVICE

Rental garments in service are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the garments, generally twelve to eighteen months.  Accumulated
amortization of rental garments in service was $18,102,000 and $17,721,000 at
January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994, respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized to the appropriate
asset accounts.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred.
On sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
applicable to such assets are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is reflected in earnings.  Losses on the disposal of plant and
equipment were $165,000, $67,000 and $234,000 for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
<PAGE>   10

Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the various assets.  Useful lives range from ten to thirty-five
years for buildings and improvements and from three to ten years for machinery
and equipment.

OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS

Debt origination and placement fees and acquisition related expenditures
associated with noncompetition agreements, customer contracts and other
acquired intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the
underlying agreements and estimated useful lives.

At January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994 the cost and related accumulated
amortization pertaining to noncompetition agreements was $10,246,000 and
($4,175,000) and $9,498,000 and ($3,113,000), respectively.  The contractual
term for noncompetition agreements is generally three to eight years.  At
January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994 the cost and related accumulated
amortization pertaining to acquired customer contracts was $15,302,000 and
($5,219,000) and $13,325,000 and ($3,756,000), respectively.  The estimated
useful lives of the customer contracts is generally eight to twelve years.

EXCESS COST OVER NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED

The Company's acquisitions of rental operations were accounted for by using the
purchase method.  The purchase method allocates the amounts paid to the net
assets acquired based on their respective fair values.  The amounts paid in
excess of the fair value of the acquired net assets is amortized on a
straight-line basis over twenty years.

OTHER LIABILITIES

The Company, under certain insurance programs, retains portions of expected
losses.  The Company, upon consultation with its insurance carriers and
advisors, records the estimated aggregate liabilities for claims incurred and
projects their future settlement dates.  The Company provides letters of credit
and funded trust arrangements for certain of these insurance programs.

INCOME TAXES

Provisions are made for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between
amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Net earnings per common share are computed based upon the weighted average
number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding.  For fiscal
1995, 1994 and 1993, employee stock options were the Company's only common
stock equivalents; there were no other potentially dilutive securities.
<PAGE>   11

(2)  ACQUISITIONS  OF RENTAL OPERATIONS

During fiscal 1995 and 1994, the Company acquired rental routes and equipment
for approximately $4.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively,  in cash
and notes payable.  The operating results of these rental acquisitions have
been included in the consolidated results of the Company since their purchase
with an insignificant effect on revenues and net earnings.

On March 27, 1992 the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Mid
West Services, Inc., and Hertz and Hertz, L.P., (Mid West) for approximately
$30 million in cash.  The operating results of Mid West have been included in
the consolidated results of the Company since the date of acquisition.  During
fiscal 1993, the Company also acquired certain uniform rental routes and
equipment for approximately $2.2 million in cash and notes payable.  The
operating results of these rental acquisitions have been included in the
consolidated results of the Company since their acquisition.

</TABLE>

The use of the LIFO method reduced net earnings by approximately $142,000 ($.02
per share), $43,000 ($.01 per share) and $124,000 ($.02 per share) for fiscal
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

(4)  COMMON STOCK

On August 26, 1994 the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split.  The
split was in the form of a stock dividend paid on September 23, 1994 to
stockholders of record on September 9, 1994.  The outstanding common shares,
weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, net earnings
per share and other related per share data have been restated for all prior
periods to reflect the stock split.

In April 1993, the Company completed the sale of 1,725,000 shares of its common
stock.  The public offering price was $13.50 per share.  The net proceeds of
approximately $21.7 million were used to reduce long-term indebtedness.

</TABLE>

In December 1993, the Company issued $20 million of 5.79% Senior Notes (the
"Senior Notes") to an insurance company.  The Senior Notes have an average life
of seven years and mature in 2003.  The proceeds were used to repay long-term
bank debt.

In September 1993, the Company refinanced its long-term bank debt by entering
into a  three-year Bank Credit Agreement (the "Bank Agreement").  The Bank
Agreement provides for borrowings on a revolving basis of up to $35 million at
an interest rate based upon LIBOR or prime.  At January 29, 1995 the Company
had no outstanding borrowings under the Bank Agreement.

Both the Senior Notes and the Bank Agreement require the Company, among other
things, to maintain certain minimum levels of stockholders' equity and fixed
charge coverage and they set a minimum current ratio and a maximum
capitalization ratio.  The agreements also contain certain restrictions on
dividends and stock redemptions.  At January 29, 1995 the Company had $16.5
million in unrestricted stockholders' equity.

The Fixed Rate Notes mature serially in annual installments ranging from        
$525,000 to $650,000 through 1997 with the balance due in 1998.  The Fixed Rate
Notes bear interest at 10.06% and are secured by certain real estate of the 
Company.  The Company may prepay at par value all or a portion of the unpaid
balance of the Fixed Rate Notes on or after December 1, 1995.

The approximate aggregate principal installments of long-term debt for the next
five fiscal years are: 1996 - $827,000; 1997 - $821,000; 1998 - $2,422,000;
1999 - $16,010,000; 2000 - $3,109,000 and for all years thereafter -
$12,476,000.  The principal installments for fiscal 1996 do not include any
optional prepayments of the Fixed Rate Notes.

</TABLE>

Certain real estate taxes on leased property are obligations of the Company. It
is anticipated that leases that expire will be renewed or replaced, and future  
lease commitments are not expected to aggregate less than the amount shown for
fiscal 1996.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations relating
to environmental matters, including laws which require the investigation and,
in some cases, remediation of environmental contamination.   The Company's
policy is to accrue and charge to operations environmental investigation and
remediation expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
an amount is reasonably estimable.

The Company is also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the
conduct of its business, including personal injury and employment claims.

Based on information currently available, management does not believe the
liability, if any, arising from settlement of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the
Company.
