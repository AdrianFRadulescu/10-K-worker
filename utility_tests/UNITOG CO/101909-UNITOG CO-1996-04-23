ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

     Unitog Company, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries is referred
to herein as the "Company".  The Company was first incorporated in Missouri in
1948 and was reincorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1969.  The Company's
executive offices are located at 101 West 11th Street, Kansas City, Missouri
64105, and its telephone number is (816) 474-7000.

A.   GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

     On November 10, 1995, the Company purchased all of the issued and
outstanding stock of Ace-Tex Corporation, a Michigan corporation ("Ace-Tex").
Ace-Tex is engaged in the rental, supply, service and sale of industrial
uniforms and garments, linens, dust control products and related products and
services in certain portions of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Maryland (the
"Uniform Rental Business").  Ace-Tex was also engaged in the manufacture and
sale of wiping and polishing cloths, tack cloths, disposable paper products and
rags (the "Wiper Business").  In conjunction with the purchase of the stock of
Ace-Tex, the Wiper Business and the assets of Ace-Tex used in the Wiper Business
were sold to the former principals of Ace-Tex.  As a result, from and after the
completion of the purchase, Ace-Tex will only be engaged in the Uniform Rental
Business.

     In addition to the Ace-Tex acquisition, the Company completed acquisitions
in northern Iowa, Los Angeles, California, Dallas, Texas and Columbus, Ohio
during fiscal 1996.  In March 1996, the Company purchased two rental operations,
one in Michigan and the other in Philadelphia.  In the past 14 months, the
Company has acquired approximately $58 million in annual rental revenues.

B.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

     Information incorporated herein by reference from the Company's Annual
Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 28, 1996, page 26.

C.   NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

GENERAL

     The Company is a leading provider of high quality uniform rental services
to a variety of industries and sells custom-designed uniforms primarily to
national companies in connection with their corporate image programs.  The
Company manufactures substantially all the uniforms it rents or sells.  The
Company provides national uniform programs for many of the largest companies in
the United States on both a rental and direct sale

                                       2
<PAGE>
         
basis.  In addition, the Company believes it is one of the largest suppliers of
uniforms to employees of the United States Postal Service.  Rental operations
accounted for 73.8%, 70.6% and 70.3% of the Company's total revenues in fiscal
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Uniform Direct sales accounted for the
remaining revenues.

RENTAL OPERATIONS

     The Company rents uniforms and other industrial items, such as dust mops,
wiping towels and entrance mats, and, to a lesser extent, linen items, such as
sheets, pillowcases, tablecloths and napkins, to customers who prefer a rental
laundry service instead of purchasing and maintaining such items themselves.

     Uniform Rentals.  The Company's rental services are designed to address
customers' requirements for managing employee uniform programs.  The services
provided by Unitog include assistance in selecting fabrics, styles and colors
appropriate for a customer's needs; maintaining necessary inventory to match
the customer's changing employment levels; replacing worn items and providing
pick-up, cleaning, maintenance and delivery services on a regularly scheduled
basis.

     The Company provides rental services in 52 markets to customers in 33
states.   Rental services are provided through industrial laundry facilities at
which the cleaning and processing of garments is performed.   In addition, the
Company operates sales and service branches which serve as sales offices and
warehouse and distribution sites, allowing the Company to provide rental
services to customers in geographic areas adjacent to the immediate area of  an
industrial laundry facility.

     Generally, the Company's uniform rental service contracts cover a multi-
year term and provide compensation to Unitog in the event a customer terminates
the contract before the end of the term.  In addition, if a rental item is lost,
stolen or destroyed, Unitog receives a specified replacement value.

     Linen Rentals.  The Company rents linens, such as sheets, pillowcases,
tablecloths and napkins, primarily to customers in the hotel and food service
industries.  Unitog has historically retained linen volume if the linen volume
does not adversely impact the operating efficiency of the rental plant.  In
those instances where operating efficiency was affected, the Company has sold
linen volume.

DIRECT SALES

     The Company has over 60 years of experience in supplying custom-designed
uniforms to national customers in connection with corporate image programs.  A
majority of the Company's direct sales

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
are to companies in diverse industries, including automotive services,
petroleum, brewing, soft drink bottling and transportation industries.  The
Company believes that it has remained a leader in uniform sales by consistently
offering superior program management, prompt order fulfillment and high quality
uniforms in a variety of styles, colors and fabrics.

     Unitog provides a total uniform management program to its customers.  The
Company assists its customers in designing attractive, readily recognizable
uniforms to complement the customer's overall corporate identity.  The Company's
product line consists of shirts, trousers, jackets, coveralls, rainwear,
selected women's apparel and related accessories.  In many cases, a national
customer selects a particular style of uniform and designates approved suppliers
to sell the uniforms to the customer's independent distributors, franchisees or
employees throughout the customer's distribution system.  Unitog specializes in
assisting these national customers by promoting the benefits of approved uniform
programs through the use of professionally designed brochures, promotional
programs and direct sales contacts.

     The Company has sold uniforms to employees of the United States Postal
Service under the Brookfield label for over 25 years.  The Postal Service
provides an annual allotment ranging from $50 to $341 to each postal employee
for uniform purchases.  The individual employee is then free to select uniforms
from any supplier approved by the Postal Service.  Payment is made by the Postal
Service directly to the Company to the extent of the employee's allotment and
any excess is paid directly by the employee.

SALES AND MARKETING

     The Company considers its target market to be national and regional
customers seeking improved image and employee recognition as well as higher
levels of product quality and customer service.

     The selling efforts of the Rental and Direct sales forces are combined
under common regional sales managers, creating a company-wide marketing approach
to maximize cross-selling opportunities by identifying customers' needs, whether
rental or direct sale.  Unitog believes the combined selling effort has resulted
in a more professional sales team, upgraded sales training and improved
salesperson productivity.

     Uniform programs on the national level are handled by the national account
marketing department, whose members call directly on existing and prospective
rental and direct sale national accounts.  The Company's Rental sales force is
comprised of salespersons based at the rental locations who call on customers
within the geographic service area of the rental location.  In addition to the
Rental sales force, the Company's route salespersons have responsibility for
increasing sales to customers

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
on their routes.  The Company maintains a Direct sales force that covers the
continental United States, with each member being assigned a specific sales
territory.  Sales of Postal Service uniforms are made through direct sales calls
on postal employees by commissioned representatives.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

     The Company manufactures garments and emblems for both the Rental and
Direct sales operations at four plants located in Missouri, one plant located in
Alabama, one plant located in Arkansas and one plant located in Honduras.  The
Company performs manufacturing operations, consisting mainly of cutting, sewing
and finishing garments, for substantially all its product line.  From time to
time Unitog contracts with independent garment manufacturers for a portion of
its requirements.  Certain uniform accessories sold or rented by the Company,
such as shoes, ties and belts, are purchased from other manufacturers.

     The Company maintains distribution centers in Stevenson, Alabama, Ontario,
California and Kansas City and Warrensburg, Missouri where its uniforms are
stored pending shipment to customers.

SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS

     Substantially all of the fabrics used by Unitog in its manufacturing
process are acquired from textile mills located in the United States.
Alternative sources of these materials are generally available.

SEASONALITY

     Rental operations are not generally subject to seasonality. Subject to the
effects of the introduction of new programs with national accounts, Direct sales
have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the sale
of fall and winter garments.  As a result, operating income can be higher in
such quarters.

CUSTOMERS

     No material part of the business of the Company is dependent upon a single
customer or a small number of customers.

COMPETITION

     The business in which Unitog is engaged is highly competitive, and the
Company competes in both the sale and rental of uniforms with a large number of
other firms.  The Company believes that the primary competitive factors that
affect its operations are design, quality, service and price.  The Company
believes it maintains

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
prices comparable to those of its major competitors and endeavors to offer
prompt and high quality service to its customers and superior products as the
principal methods of distinguishing itself from its competition.  Unitog's
Rental operation competes with a number of national, regional and local
companies in the geographic areas it serves.  The Company's Direct sales
operation also competes on a national basis with other suppliers and uniform
manufacturers.  Some of these competitors are larger and have greater financial
resources than the Company.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws governing the use
and disposal of various wastes, including  wastewater from its washing
processes.  The Company has a continuing program to upgrade wastewater treatment
processes, where necessary, to avoid improper disposal.  Although the Company is
subject to administrative and judicial proceedings from time to time involving
environmental matters, the Company does not believe that costs incurred in
connection with environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

     The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws which
require the investigation and, in some cases, remediation of environmental
contamination.  Environmental contamination has been detected at the Company's
Tempe, Arizona, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Whittier, California rental plants.
The Tempe and Whittier plants are located in federal superfund sites several
square miles in size.  The Company, along with certain unaffiliated parties, has
been designated by the U.S. EPA as a potentially responsible party under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with
respect to the Tempe site.  The Company entered into a consent order with EPA
requiring a soil and groundwater investigation at the Tempe site.  The cost of
the investigation was borne by two other parties pursuant to a settlement
agreement with the Company.  Test results at the Tempe site indicate that
volatile organic compound contamination is present in the soil, necessitating
soil remediation.  Groundwater tests have not detected on-site contamination,
although additional periodic groundwater testing is expected.  Test results at
the Minneapolis and Whittier plants indicate that volatile organic compound
contamination is present in the soil and groundwater at those plants.  The
Company believes that it will be required to remediate the soil and groundwater
at the Minneapolis plant and has begun soil remediation at Whittier.  Additional
testing is being conducted to determine if groundwater remediation will be
required at Whittier.  The Company's estimate of the expense related to all
three of these sites has been accrued and charged to operating expense.  Based
on information currently available, the Company does not believe that additional
costs of investigation and remediation at these sites are individually or in the
aggregate

                                       6

material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

of every type and description, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due
or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising, on account of the Loans,
including, without limitation, any Advances made pursuant to any discretionary
extension of the Commitment by the Banks beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date or pursuant to any other amendment of the Loan Documents, and whether or
not contemplated by the Borrowers or the Banks as of the date of this Agreement,
(ii) the Borrowers' duty to reimburse the Banks, as the case may be, for all
amounts paid by the Banks in honoring drafts under the Direct Pay Letter(s) of
Credit, described in Section 2.2.2(c) hereof, or the documentary trade and
standby letters of credit described in Section 2.2.2(b) and the Borrowers' duty
to pay the Banks, as the case may be, the fees and commissions required
hereunder for issuing a Direct Pay Letter of Credit and such other letters of
credit, (iii) all other commitment fees and similar charges provided for in the
Loan Documents, and (iv) all other obligations arising under the Loan Documents
including, without limitation, all costs of collection and enforcement of any
and all of the Loan Documents, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
(to the extent permitted by applicable law).

          b.  The amounts of the revolving credit commitments of the Banks set

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
2.   Amendment to Section 2.2.1 of the Loan Agreement. Section 2.2.1 of the Loan
     Agreement is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

          Subject to the conditions of Section 7, from the date hereto to the
          Revolving Credit Maturity Date including any extension thereof, the
          Banks agree to make Advances (collectively, the "Revolving Credit
          Loans") or to provide the other financial accommodations described in
          this Section 2.2 to the Borrowers from time to time in an aggregate
          amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the aggregate
          Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that it is expressly
          agreed that Four Million Five Hundred Sixty One Thousand Six Hundred
          Forty Four Dollars ($4,561,644) of the aggregate Revolving Credit
          Commitments can be used only for purpose of Direct Pay Letters of
          Credit issued pursuant to Section 2.2.2(c).  Each Advance shall be
          made by the Banks concurrently and in accordance with its Pro Rata
          Share.

     3.   Amendment of Section 2.2.2(b) of the Loan Agreement.  Section 2.2.2(b)
     of the Loan Agreement is amended to provide that the aggregate of the
     documentary trade and standby letters of credit issued thereunder, when
     taken together with the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit
     Loans and the aggregate Direct Pay Letters of Credit then outstanding,
     shall at no time exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.

     4.   New Section 2.2.2(c).  Section 2.2.2 of the Agreement is amended by
     inserting at the end thereof the following new Section 2.2.2(c):

               (c) Direct Pay Letters of Credit.      Subject to the terms and
          conditions hereof, the Revolving Credit Commitments, at the option of
          either Borrower, may also be utilized in the form of irrevocable
          direct pay letters of credit (individually, "Direct Pay Letter of
          Credit") issued by a Bank (the "Issuing Bank") selected by such
          Borrower for the account of such Borrower as credit enhancement for
          such Borrower's obligations with respect to Industrial Development
          Bonds.  Each Direct Pay Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this
          Section 2.2.2(c) shall count against and reduce the Revolving Credit
          Commitments by the amount of such Direct Pay Letter of Credit
          outstanding unless and until such Direct Pay Letter of Credit expires
          by its terms or otherwise terminates, in which event the Revolving
          Credit Commitments shall be reinstated by the amount of such Direct
          Pay Letter of Credit.  The amount of any Direct Pay Letter of Credit
          outstanding at any time for all purposes hereof shall be the maximum
          amount which could be drawn thereunder under any circumstances from
          and after the date of determination.  The outstanding portion of each
          Direct Pay Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize a Pro Rata
          Share of the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Bank.  The aggregate
          of Direct Pay Letters of Credit issued hereunder, when taken together
          with the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans and the
          aggregate 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
          documentary trade and standby letters of credit then outstanding,
          shall at no time exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
                    The terms and provisions of each Direct Pay Letter of Credit
          issued hereunder shall be determined by the Issuing Bank and the
          Borrowers, subject to the approval of the other Banks and shall be set
          forth in an application and agreement regarding such Direct Pay Letter
          of Credit ("Reimbursement Agreement"), howsoever denominated, executed
          by the Borrower(s) requesting the issuance of the Direct Pay Letter of
          Credit and the Issuing Bank.  On request of the Issuing Bank, the
          other Banks will provide the Issuing Bank with written notice of their
          approval of the issuance of a Direct Pay Letter of Credit hereunder
          and the terms and provisions of such Direct Pay Letter of Credit and
          the Reimbursement Agreement regarding the same.

                    Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, each Direct
          Pay Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date not later than one
          (1) day before the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, will be issued
          subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and will be
          available to pay the principal portion of and all accrued interest on
          the obligations of the Borrower with respect to which it is issued.
          Any draw under a Direct Pay Letter of Credit not reimbursed by the
          Borrowers on the Banking Day on which such draw is made shall be
          converted to an Advance under the Revolving Credit Loans by the
          Issuing Bank giving notice thereof to the Agent, and the Borrowers and
          the Banks hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, upon receipt of such
          notice, to refinance, with notice to the Borrowers or the Banks, the
          reimbursement Obligation of the Borrowers arising out of any such
          drawing into Revolving Credit Loans, evidenced by the Revolving Credit
          Notes and for all purposes under, on and subject to the terms and
          conditions of this Agreement, but without regard to the conditions
          precedent as to making an Advance under the Revolving Credit Loans or
          any requirement of this Agreement that such Revolving Credit Loan be
          in a minimum amount or Permissible Increment.

                    Nothwithstanding the terms of any Reimbursement Agreement,
          any discretionary action by the Issuing Bank thereunder, including but
          not limited to the waiver of conditions precedent or compliance with
          any affirmative or negative covenants or the exercise of any remedies
          thereunder, shall be subject to the approval of all the Banks in
          accordance with Section 10.17 of this Agreement.  Borrowers authorize
          an Issuing Bank to, and such Issuing Bank shall, discuss and furnish
          to Banks and Agent any notices and other information received by such
          Issuing Bank pertaining to  Borrower whether given under a
          Reimbursement Agreement by a Borrower or otherwise received by such
          Issuing Bank.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall
          supersede any terms of any Reimbursement Agreement or other documents
          which are irreconcilably inconsistent with the terms hereof or
          thereof. Except 

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
          as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Section 2.2.2(c) shall
          be deemed to constitute a waiver of a Default or an Event of Default
          caused by the failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent to
          making Revolving Credit Loans.

                    Borrowers agree to pay the Issuing Bank letter of credit
          fees for each Direct Pay Letter of Credit issued and outstanding
          hereunder quarterly in arrears from the date of issuance computed at a
          rate equal to the greater of (i) the Applicable Margin for LIBOR
          Advances minus 25 bp or (ii) 25 bp, multiplied by the face amount of
          such Direct Pay Letter of Credit, and further multiplied by a fraction
          the numerator of which shall equal the actual number of days elapsed
          in the immediately preceeding three (3) month period during which such
          Direct Pay Letter of Credit was issued and outstanding and the
          denominator of which is 365.  Such fees shall be allocated between the
          Banks in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share and shall be
          remitted by the Issuing Bank to the other Banks promptly upon receipt.
          In addition, the Issuing Bank may charge and receive for its sole
          account additional fees or commission as agreed upon between the
          Issuing Bank and Borrowers.

                    In the event Banks and Borrowers agree hereafter to an
          extension of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and this Agreement,
          Banks agree to extend, renew or reissue any Direct Pay Letter of
          Credit then outstanding to a date one (1) day prior to such extended
          Revolving Credit Maturity Date under the terms and subject to the
          conditions of this Agreement and the Reimbursement Agreement with
          respect to such Direct Pay Letter of Credit; provided, however, that
          upon any such extension, renewal or reissuance, Borrowers shall pay
          the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
          expenses, incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with such
          extension, renewal or reissuance.  Nothing herein or in any
          Reimbursement Agreement shall be deemed to impose any obligation upon
          Banks to agree to the extension of this Agreement or the Revolving
          Credit Maturity Date.

                    Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this
          Agreement, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
          Banks shall not extend, renew or reissue any outstanding Direct Pay
          Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.2.2(c).


     5.   Amendment of Section 2.2.5 of the Loan Agreement.  Section 2.2.5 of
the Loan Agreement is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

          Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.1, Advances of the Revolving
          Credit Loans may be used (i) to fund acquisitions, (ii) to meet
          ongoing working capital requirements of the Borrowers and (iii) for
          other corporate purposes not prohibited by this Agreement.

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
     6.   Amendment of Section 6.2 of the Loan Agreement.  Section 6.2 of the
Loan Agreement is amended by deleting the last sentence of such section in its
entirety and replacing such sentence with the following:

          "The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall not prohibit loans between
          the Borrowers and any of their Subsidiaries or guarantees by the
          Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries of their respective obligations
          or guarantees by a Borrower in connection with such Borrower's
          obligations with respect to Industrial Development Bonds.


     7.   Restatement of Section 12.8 of the Loan Agreement.  Borrowers
restate and affirm the provisions of Section 12.8 of the Loan Agreement and
expressly acknowledge that the terms thereof apply with respect to the
Obligations arising under or pursuant to any Direct Pay Letter of Credit and any
Reimbursement Agreement related thereto.

     8.   Second Amended and Restated Master Credit Revolving Note.  Borrowers
agree to execute and deliver to each of the Banks a Second Amended and Restated
Master Revolving Credit Note ("Second Amended Note") in the form of Exhibit C
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference payable to each of the
Banks in accordance with the amount of their respective Revolving Credit
Commitments as increased hereunder.  Following the execution and delivery of the
Second Amended Note to each Bank, the Second Amended Note shall evidence all the
indebtedness evidenced by Amended and Restated Master Revolving Credit Note
executed and delivered to such Bank by Borrower dated November 9, 1995, which
shall then be marked "Modified pursuant to that certain Second Amended and
Restated Master Revolving Credit Note, dated [the date hereof]" and returned to
Borrowers.  Exhibit C to the Loan Agreement shall be deleted and replaced in its
entirety by Exhibit C hereto.

     9.   No Other Modifications.  Except as hereby modified and amended, all of
the terms, conditions and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.

     10.  Representations and Warranties.  The Borrowers hereby represent and
warrant that:

          a.   The representations and warranties contained in the Loan
Agreement and in each certificate or document furnished by the Borrowers and
delivered therewith are true and correct in all material respects on and as of
the date hereof as though made on and as of the date hereof;

          b.   No Event of Default, and to the Borrowers' knowledge no event
which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both could become an
Event of Default, exists on the date hereof, and no offsets or defenses exist
against their obligations under the Loan Agreement or the documents delivered in
connection therewith;

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
          c.   This Amendment has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
so as to constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrowers,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting creditor's rights generally and general principles of equity;

          d.   The execution, delivery and performance of this Amendment will

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Fiscal 1996 Compared to Fiscal 1995

Revenues for fiscal 1996 were $214.3 million, an increase of $25.2 million or 
13% over fiscal 1995 revenues of $189.1 million.

Rental revenues were $158.1 million for fiscal 1996, an increase of $24.6 
million, or 18% over last year. During the year we acquired five rental 
operations which should add approximately $40 million in annual revenue. These 
acquisitions contributed revenues of $14.2 million in fiscal 1996. Internal 
growth from our existing locations totaled 6% for fiscal 1996. Revenues from 
uniform rentals were stronger than last year, although offset by a decline in 
our linen rental business. Revenues from the Southern California market were 
stable during fiscal 1996 compared to declines we experienced in fiscal 1995.

Direct sales were $56.2 million for fiscal 1996, which were essentially the same
as last year. Sales of postal uniforms increased over last year aided by new 
products introduced during the year. Direct sales of industrial uniforms 
declined slightly as a result of limited implementations of new programs for 
national accounts.

Rental operating contribution was $30.5 million for fiscal 1996, an increase of 
$4.1 million, or 16% over last year. Rental operating contribution was 19.3% of
rental revenue compared to 19.8% in fiscal 1995. Costs related to assimilating 
five acquisitions and the lower margins of newly acquired rental operations 
reduced the operating contribution percentage during the year.

Direct sales operating contribution for fiscal 1996 was $10.2 million, a 
decrease of $450,000, or 4% from fiscal 1995. Direct sales operating 
contribution was 18.2% of sales in fiscal 1996 compared to 19.2% last year. 
One-time costs incurred to close our Atlanta distribution operations and to 
start-up a manufacturing and distribution facility in Stevenson, Alabama reduced
the operating contribution in fiscal 1996.

Depreciation and amortization charges for fiscal 1996 increased by $1.4 million 
over last year due to our acquisition activity and a higher level of capital 
expenditures during the year. The construction of new facilities and plant 
expansions resulted in the increase in capital outlays to $22 million in fiscal 
1996 compared to $9 million last year. General and administrative costs for 
fiscal 1996 of $7.8 million or 3.6% of revenues were about the same as the $8.2 
million incurred in fiscal 1995, although lower as a percentage of revenues.

                                       8

<PAGE>

Interest expense for fiscal 1996 of $3.3 million was $700,000 or 26% more than
the prior year. Borrowings to fund our acquisitions during the year increased
our interest costs. Income taxes declined as a percentage of pretax earnings to
38% in fiscal 1996 compared to 39% in fiscal 1995 due to reductions in state and
local taxes.

Net earnings were $11.5 million for fiscal 1996, an increase of $1.5 million, or
15% over fiscal 1995. Improved operating contribution from the Rental business
offset higher depreciation, amortization and interest expenses. Net earnings per
share were $1.23 per share in fiscal 1996 compared to $1.07 per share last year,
a 15% gain.

Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994

Revenues for fiscal 1995 were $189.1 million, an increase of $11.2 million or 6%
over fiscal 1994. Rental revenues increased 7% over fiscal 1994 to $133.5 
million. Internal rental revenue growth for fiscal 1995 was 4%. Revenues from 
uniform rentals improved over the previous year. Declining revenues from linen 
operations and softness in the Southern California market reduced the Company's 
overall internal rental revenue growth. Direct sales increased 5% over the prior
year to $55.7 million. A 12% increase in sales of postal uniforms combined with 
increased demand for industrial uniforms to produce higher Direct sales.

Rental operating contribution for fiscal 1995 was $26.4 million, an increase of
$3.5 million or 15% over fiscal 1994. Rental operating contribution was 19.8% of
rental revenue in fiscal 1995 compared to 18.3% in fiscal 1994. The improved
rental operating contribution was due to reductions in garment costs and better
plant processing and handling efficiencies.

Direct sales operating contribution for fiscal 1995 was $10.7 million, an 
increase of $750,000, or 8% over fiscal 1994. Direct sales operating 
contribution was 19.2% of sales in fiscal 1995 compared to 18.7% in the prior 
year. Increased sales and cost controls created the gain over fiscal 1994.

General and administrative costs for fiscal 1995 were $8.2 million, a 17% 
increase over fiscal 1994. Increased spending on technology enhancement projects
and other general expenses contributed to the higher costs in fiscal 1995.

Interest expense for fiscal 1995 of $2.6 million was $700,000 or 21% less than 
the prior year. Debt repayments from our April 1993 public stock offering and 
the replacement of higher cost bank debt with $20 million of 5.8% privately 
placed notes in fiscal 1994 produced the interest expense savings during fiscal 
1995.

Net earnings for fiscal 1995 were $10 million or $1.07 per share compared to 
$7.8 million or $.87 per share in fiscal 1994. Net earnings increased 28% over 
the prior year due to profitability improvements from the operations of both the
Rental and Direct sales businesses and reduced interest costs which offset 
higher general and administrative costs. Net earnings per share in fiscal 1995 
increased $.20 per share or 23% over the prior year. The 28% improvement in net 
earnings in fiscal 1995 was offset slightly by 4% more average shares 
outstanding due to our public stock offering in April 1993.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company completed the acquisition of five rental operations during
fiscal 1996, spending over $43 million. These acquisitions will add
approximately $40 million in annual rental revenue and expanded our market 
presence in northern Iowa, Los Angeles, Dallas, Columbus, Detroit, Toledo, South
Bend and southern Michigan. These purchases were for cash and were financed 
principally by $40 million in 6.8% privately-placed notes with an insurance 
company. Since year-end we completed the purchase of rental routes and 
facilities in northern and central Michigan and eastern Illinois and an entrance
mat and industrial dust control business in Philadelphia. These acquisitions 
will add approximately $18 million in annual rental revenues.

Cash and cash equivalents at January 28, 1996 decreased $7.7 million from last 
year as invested cash was spent on acquisitions and capital expenditures. At 
January 28, 1996, the Company's capitalization ratio was 49% compared to 32% one
year ago. The Company's long-term debt increased $49 million due to funding of 
acquisitions and the assumption of industrial revenue bonds in connection with 
acquisition activity. The Company used its bank credit facility to prepay 
without penalty $15 million of 10% long-term notes that were due in 1998. At 
January 28, 1996 long-term debt carried a blended interest rate of 6.3% compared
to 7.6% last year. There were $17 million in borrowings outstanding under the 
Company's $55 million long-term bank credit facility at year-end. On March 7, 
1996 the Company issued $4.5 million in tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds 
related to its facility in Stevenson, Alabama.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 1996 was $24.7 million, a 24% 
increase over last year. Working capital was $37.9 million at January 28, 1996 
compared to $40.3 million at January 29, 1995. The decrease in working capital 
was due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents. The Company raised its 
semi-annual dividend by 25% in fiscal 1996 to $.05 per share. Capital 
expenditures were $22.1 million during fiscal 1996 compared to $9.2 million in 
fiscal 1995. Spending to construct facilities in Stevenson and Las Vegas, to 
expand both manufacturing and rental plants and to implement technology 
enhancement projects, created the increase over fiscal 1995. Planned capital 
expenditures for fiscal 1997 will approximate fiscal 1996.

Management believes that cash provided by operations and its bank credit 
facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for rental 
acquisitions and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to 
environmental matters, including laws which require the investigation and, in 
some cases, remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental 
contamination has been detected at the Company's Tempe, Minneapolis and Whittier
rental plants. The Company's Tempe and Whittier rental plants are located in 
federal superfund sites several square miles in size. The Company, along with 
certain unaffiliated parties, has been designated by the U.S. EPA as a 
potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act with respect to the Tempe site. The Company 
entered into a consent order with EPA requiring a soil and groundwater 
investigation at the Tempe site. The cost of the investigation was borne by two 
other parties pursuant to a settlement agreement with the Company. Test results 
at the Tempe site indicate that volatile organic compound contamination is 
present in the soil, necessitating soil remediation. Groundwater tests have not 
detected on-site contamination, although additional periodic groundwater testing
is expected. Test results at the Minneapolis and Whittier plants indicate that 
volatile organic compound contamination is present in the soil and groundwater 
at those plants. The Company believes that it will be required to remediate the
soil and groundwater at the Minneapolis plant and has begun soil remediation at 
Whittier. Additional testing is being conducted to determine if groundwater 
remediation will be required at Whittier. The Company's estimate of the expense 
related to all three of these sites has been accrued and charged to operating 
expense. Based on information currently available, the Company does not believe 
that additional costs of investigation and remediation at these sites are 
individually or in the aggregate material to the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company.

Inflation has not significantly affected the Company in recent years. Labor and 
raw materials are the Company's primary operating costs. Inventories are valued 
on the LIFO (last-in first-out) method, which management believes more 
accurately matches current costs with current revenues.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Unitog Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unitog Company 
and subsidiaries as of January 28, 1996 and January 29, 1995, and the related 
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended January 28, 1996. These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Unitog Company and 
subsidiaries at January 28, 1996 and January 29, 1995 and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 
ended January 28, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

UNITOG COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      Years ended January 28, 1996, January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
Company recognizes rental revenues when the services are delivered to customers.
The Company records direct sales upon shipment to the customer.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company uses a fifty-two/fifty-three week period ending on the last Sunday 
in January. Fifty-two week periods were included in the years ended January 28, 
1996, January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994, respectively.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money market deposits, and investments 
in highly liquid tax-exempt municipal bond funds. For purposes of reporting cash
flows, the Company considers investments with original maturities of three 
months or less to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with costs applied on the 
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

RENTAL GARMENTS IN SERVICE

Rental garments in service are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. 
Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the garments, generally twelve to eighteen months. Accumulated 
amortization of rental garments in service was $18,547,000 and $18,102,000 at 
January 28, 1996 and January 29, 1995, respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized to the appropriate 
asset accounts. Maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred. On 
sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation 
applicable to such assets are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain 
or loss is reflected in earnings. Gains (losses) on the disposal of plant and 
equipment were $25,000, ($165,000) and ($67,000) for fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the various assets. Useful lives range from ten to thirty-five 
years for buildings and improvements and from three to ten years for machinery 
and equipment.

                                      18
<PAGE>
 
OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS

Debt origination and placement fees and acquisition related expenditures 
associated with noncompetition agreements, customer contracts and other acquired
intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization
is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the underlying 
agreements and estimated useful lives.

At January 28, 1996 and January 29, 1995 the cost and related accumulated 
amortization pertaining to noncompetition agreements was $13,877,000 and 
($5,112,000) and $10,246,000 and ($4,175,000), respectively. The contractual 
term for noncompetition agreements is generally three to eight years. At January
28, 1996 and January 29, 1995 the cost and related accumulated amortization 
pertaining to acquired customer contracts was $26,596,000 and ($7,104,000) and 
$15,302,000 and ($5,219,000), respectively. The estimated useful lives of the 
customer contracts is generally eight to twelve years.

EXCESS COST OVER NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED

The Company's acquisitions of rental operations were accounted for by using the 
purchase method. The purchase method allocates the amounts paid to the net 
assets acquired based on their respective fair values. The amounts paid in 
excess of the fair value of the acquired net assets is amortized on a 
straight-line basis over periods up to thirty-five years. The Company assesses 
the recoverability of goodwill by determining whether the amortization of the 
goodwill balance over the remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted 
future operating cash flows.

OTHER LIABILITIES

The Company under certain insurance programs retains portions of expected 
losses. The Company, upon consultation with its insurance carriers and advisors,
records the estimated aggregate liabilities for claims incurred and projects 
their future settlement dates. The Company provides funded trust arrangements 
for certain of these insurance programs.

INCOME TAXES

Provisions are made for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between 
amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Net earnings per common share are computed based upon the weighted average 
number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding. For fiscal 
1996, 1995 and 1994, employee stock options were the Company's only common stock
equivalents; there were no other potentially dilutive securities.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions 
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. The Company is not a party to any financial 
derivative instruments. The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable and 
trade accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of 
these instruments. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt was not 
significantly different than its carrying value at January 28, 1996 and January 
29, 1995.

(2) ACQUISITIONS OF RENTAL OPERATIONS

On November 10, 1995, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding 
stock of Ace-Tex Corporation (Ace-Tex). Ace-Tex was engaged in the rental 
supply, service and sale of industrial uniforms and related products (the 
Uniform Rental Business) and the manufacture and sale of wiping and polishing 
cloths (the Wiper Business). In conjunction with the purchase of the stock of 
Ace-Tex, the Company sold the Wiper Business and the assets of Ace-Tex used in 
the Wiper Business to the former principals of Ace-Tex. As a result, after the 
purchase, Ace-Tex was only engaged in the Uniform Rental Business under the name
Mechanics Uniform Rental Co. (Mechanics).

The net purchase price of Mechanics was as follow:

(4) COMMON STOCK

In May 1995, the stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized 
shares of common stock from 15,000,000 shares to 30,000,000 shares.

In August 1994, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split. The split
was in the form of a stock dividend paid on September 23, 1994 to stockholders 
of record on September 9, 1994. The outstanding common shares, weighted average 
common and common equivalent shares outstanding, net earnings per share and

In February 1996, the Company amended its Bank Credit Agreement (the Bank
Agreement). The amended Bank Agreement provides for borrowings on a revolving
basis of up to $55 million at an interest rate based upon LIBOR or prime. The
interest rate in effect at January 28, 1996 was 5.98%. The Bank Agreement
expires in September 1998. At January 28, 1996 the Company had $33 million in
available borrowings under the Bank Agreement.

In October 1995, the Company issued $40 million of 6.83% Senior Notes to an 
insurance company. The 6.83% Senior Notes have an average life of seven years 
and mature in 2005. The proceeds were used to repay long-term debt and to fund 
acquisitions. In December 1995, the Company prepaid without penalty the 10.06% 
Fixed Rate Notes.

In December 1993, the Company issued $20 million of 5.79% Senior Notes to an 
insurance company. The 5.79% Senior Notes have an average life of seven years 
and mature in 2003. The proceeds were used to repay long-term bank debt.

The 6.83% Senior Notes, the 5.79% Senior Notes and the Bank Agreement require 
the Company, among other things, to maintain certain minimum levels of 
stockholders' equity and fixed charge coverage and they set a minimum current 
ratio and a maximum capitalization ratio. The agreements also contain certain 
restrictions on dividends and stock redemptions. At January 28, 1996, the 
Company had $21.5 million in unrestricted stockholders' equity.

The Company's Industrial Revenue Bond obligations bear interest at stated 
interest rates or interest rates that vary based upon market conditions for 
floating tax-exempt bonds. The weighted average interest rate on the bond 
obligations at January 28, 1996 was 4.27%. The bond issues are generally 
secured by an irrevocable bank letter of credit. The bond issues mature at 
varying dates through 2015. Included in other assets in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheets were $1.7 million in unexpended proceeds related to 
these bond issues to be used for future facility construction and related 
equipment purchases. On March 7, 1996 the Company issued $4.5 million in 
tax-exempt Industrial Revenue Bonds which mature in 2020. The bonds bear 
interest at floating rates based upon market conditions for tax-exempt issues. 
The bonds are secured by a bank letter of credit. Proceeds from the bond 
offering were used to reduce bank debt which had been incurred to finance 
construction of facilities.

The approximate aggregate principal installments of long-term debt for the next
five fiscal years are: 1997, $481,000; 1998, $2,042,000; 1999, $20,110,000; 
2000, $6,521,000; 2001, $9,520,000 and for all years thereafter, $45,538,000.

(7) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has contributory thrift plans covering substantially all of its 
salaried and clerical employees and certain employees subject to collective 
bargaining agreements. Under the provisions of these plans, employees are 
permitted to contribute a maximum of 6% of their earnings and the Company makes 
matching contributions of 25% to 50%. Employees may make additional unmatched 
contributions to the plans of up to 9% of their earnings. The Company's 
contributions were $874,000, $814,000 and $645,000 for the fiscal years ended 
January 28, 1996, January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994, respectively.

The Company has an employee stock option plan which provides for the 
discretionary granting of options for up to 450,000 shares of the Company's 
common stock to employees selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. The exercise price of the options may not be less than the fair
market value at the date of grant. The options granted to date were nonqualified
stock options which vest ratably over four years and expire ten years after the
date of grant. At January 28, 1996, 113,813 options were available for grant
under the plan and 221,750 shares under option were exercisable. The Company
granted a nonqualified stock option for 60,000 shares of common stock to an

</TABLE> 

Certain real estate taxes on leased property are obligations of the Company. It 
is anticipated that leases that expire will be renewed or replaced, and future 
lease commitments are not expected to aggregate less than the amount shown for 
fiscal 1997.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local regulations relating 
to environmental matters, including laws which require the investigation and, in
some cases, remediation of environmental contamination. The Company's policy is 
to accrue and charge to operations environmental investigation and remediation 
expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is
reasonably estimable. The Company is also subject to legal proceedings and 
claims arising from the conduct of its business, including personal injury, 
customer contract and employment claims.

Based on information currently available, management does not believe the 
liability, if any, arising from settlement of these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

which the Company provides pick-up, cleaning, maintenance and delivery of its 
rental products. The Company is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of 
uniforms used by industrial personnel and other individuals who are in contact

segment revenues all costs and expenses directly related to the operations of 
the segments, excluding depreciation and amortization, general and 
administrative expense, other expense and interest expense. Identifiable assets
are those used directly in the segments' operations. Other corporate assets
