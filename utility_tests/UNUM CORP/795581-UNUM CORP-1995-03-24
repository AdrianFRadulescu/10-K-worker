ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

A. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

    UNUM Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized in 1985 as an insurance
holding  company.  UNUM Corporation  and subsidiaries  ("UNUM") are  the leading
provider of group  long term disability  insurance ("group LTD")  in the  United
States  and  the United  Kingdom.  UNUM is  also  a major  provider  of employee
benefits, individual  disability insurance  and special  risk reinsurance.  UNUM
also  markets long term  care and retirement income  products. The operations of
the following subsidiaries account for substantially all of UNUM's  consolidated
assets  and revenues. UNUM  Corporation is based in  Portland, Maine and through
its affiliates  has operations  in North  America, the  United Kingdom  and  the
Pacific Rim.

    UNUM  conducts  its operations  in  the United  States  through a  number of
wholly-owned  subsidiaries:  UNUM  Life  Insurance  Company  of  America  ("UNUM
America"),  a Maine life insurance company licensed in 49 states and Canada, the
leading provider of group disability insurance in the nation, and a provider  of
employee  benefits,  long term  care and  retirement  products; First  UNUM Life
Insurance Company ("First UNUM"), a New York life insurance company;  Commercial
Life  Insurance  Company, a  Wisconsin life  insurance company  and a  leader in
special  risk  insurance  and  professional  association  insurance   marketing;
Duncanson & Holt, Inc., a New York corporation and a leading accident and health
reinsurance  underwriting manager; Colonial Companies,  Inc., a Delaware holding
company; and  UNUM Holding  Company,  a Delaware  corporation. Colonial  Life  &
Accident  Insurance Company,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of  Colonial Companies,
Inc., is the leader in  payroll-deducted voluntary employee benefits offered  to
employees  at their  worksites. Through  UNUM Holding  Company, UNUM Corporation
also owns  UNUM  Sales Corporation,  a  licensed broker-dealer  incorporated  in
Delaware,  and Claims Service International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which
provides claims administration services.

    UNUM Corporation also  holds all of  the outstanding capital  stock of  UNUM
European  Holding Company, which  is incorporated in  the United Kingdom. UNUM's
United Kingdom operations  are conducted by  UNUM Limited, which  is the  United
Kingdom's  leader in group disability insurance and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
UNUM European Holding Company, and Duncanson & Holt Europe Ltd., a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Duncanson & Holt, Inc.

    UNUM's  Japanese operations are conducted through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
UNUM Japan  Accident  Insurance  Company  Limited  ("UNUM  Japan"),  a  Japanese
non-life insurance company, which was established in 1994.

    On  December 3, 1992, UNUM and Colonial Companies, Inc. ("Colonial"), signed
a definitive merger agreement. On March 26, 1993, Colonial Class A common  stock
shareholders  voted to approve  the merger. Under  the agreement, UNUM exchanged
0.731 shares of its common stock for each share of Colonial Class A and B common
stock outstanding  on March  26, 1993.  UNUM issued  approximately 11.4  million
shares of common stock from treasury in connection with the merger. In addition,
outstanding  options to  acquire shares  of Colonial  Class B  common stock were
converted into options to  acquire shares of UNUM  common stock. The merger  was
accounted for as a pooling of interests.

    UNUM  reports its operations principally  in six business segments: Employee
Benefits,  Related  Businesses,   Colonial  Companies,  Individual   Disability,
Retirement  Security and Other Operations. Corporate includes transactions which
are generally non-insurance related, expenses incurred in connection with UNUM's
long-term strategic  investment  in Japan,  and  interest expense  on  corporate
borrowings.

    Refer to Item 7 and Item 8 (Note 16) for more information.

B.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SEGMENT

    The  Employee Benefits segment, which in  1994 accounted for 47.3% of UNUM's
revenues and 129.8% of its income before income taxes, markets a range of  group
disability, group life and other specialty insurance products to employers.

    Group LTD is the Employee Benefits segment's principal product. UNUM targets
sales  of group  LTD to executive,  administrative and  management personnel and
other professionals. Since 1976, UNUM has been the nation's leading provider  of
group  LTD  according to  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT  PLAN  REVIEW, a  recognized industry
publication.

    Group LTD provides employees with insurance  coverage for loss of income  in
the event of inability to work due to sickness or injury. Most of these policies
begin  providing benefits following  90 or 180 day  waiting periods and continue
providing benefits until the employee reaches age 65-70. Group LTD benefits  are
paid monthly and generally are limited to


<PAGE>
two-thirds  of the employee's  earned income up to  a specified maximum benefit.
Premiums for  group  LTD  insurance  are  based  upon  the  expected  mortality,
morbidity and persistency of the insured group as well as assumptions concerning
operating expenses and future interest rates.

    UNUM's  group life insurance product  provides term insurance for employees.
It is marketed primarily to executive, administrative and management  personnel.
As  reported by EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN REVIEW FOR 1993, the most recent available
data, UNUM was the third largest writer of group life insurance, based on number
of contracts inforce.

    Group short term disability insurance ("Group STD") provides employees  with
insurance  coverage for loss of income in the  event of inability to work due to
sickness or injury. Most of these policies begin providing benefits  immediately
for  accidents or following a one week  waiting period for sickness and continue
providing benefits for up to  26 weeks. Group STD  benefits are paid weekly  and
generally  are limited to 60% of the  employee's earned income up to a specified
maximum benefit. As reported  by EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN  REVIEW, UNUM was one  of
the  top five providers  of STD for 1993,  based on premium  and number of lives
inforce.

    UNUM markets other employee benefits products including accidental death and
dismemberment, and dental insurance.  UNUM's flexible benefits product  provides
employees  with the  opportunity to allocate  benefit dollars  among the various
combinations of employee benefits products.

    Employee Benefits' group insurance is sold primarily on a basis that permits
annual repricing. This  enables UNUM to  adjust the pricing  of its products  to
more   closely  match  the   underlying  claim  experience   and  interest  rate
environment.

    UNUM markets its Employee Benefits' insurance products through a network  of
33  offices in the United States and  Canada, which distribute these products as
well as  the  products  offered  by the  Retirement  Security  segment,  through
brokers.  As of December 31, 1994, these branch offices were organized into four
regions and were staffed with  approximately 590 management, sales, service  and
administrative personnel.

    Refer  to Item 7 and  Item 8 (Note 16)  under the caption "Employee Benefits
Segment" for more information.

C.  RELATED BUSINESSES SEGMENT

    The Related  Businesses  segment  in  1994 accounted  for  15.6%  of  UNUM's
revenues  and 30.4%  of its income  before income taxes.  The Related Businesses
segment includes UNUM Limited in  the United Kingdom, Commercial Life  Insurance
Company  ("Commercial Life"),  and reinsurance operations  including Duncanson &
Holt, Inc.

    On July 2,  1990, UNUM acquired  all of the  outstanding shares of  National
Employers'  Life  Assurance Company  Limited ("NEL").  On  August 1,  1990, UNUM
acquired certain remaining  policyholder interests of  a NEL subsidiary,  N.E.L.
Permanent  Health Insurances Limited  (now known as UNUM  Limited). In the third
quarter of  1990, UNUM  announced plans  to restructure  the operations  of  its
United  Kingdom  acquisition  by  continuing  to  develop  the  permanent health
insurance (long term disability) business through UNUM Limited and by  divesting
the  life, pension and mortgage  businesses of NEL. On  January 6, 1992, the NEL
businesses were sold.

    UNUM Limited is the leading provider of group long term disability insurance
in the United Kingdom. UNUM Limited targets group long term disability sales  to
management  personnel, other  professionals and technical  and skilled artisans.
These products  are marketed  through  a network  of independent  brokers.  UNUM
Limited's  long  term  disability  products  provide  employees  with  insurance
coverage for loss of income in the event of inability to work due to sickness or
injury.  UNUM   Limited  also   markets  individual   disability  insurance   to
self-employed  individuals and  those not  covered under  group policies through
brokers and agents.

    In May 1994, UNUM Limited assumed the management of the group risk portfolio
of Windsor Life Assurance Company Limited ("Windsor Life"), which included group
long term disability and group life products. Windsor Life was the third largest
group long term disability provider in  the United Kingdom in 1993, as  reported
by Employers Re. International.

    Commercial  Life  is  a  leading provider  of  group  special  risk accident
products, including group  travel and voluntary  accident insurance.  Commercial
Life  also  provides  group  universal  life, group  term  life,  and  long term
disability, along  with  payroll  deduction programs  for  employees  through  a
network of independent brokers and specialty agents. Commercial Life is a leader
in  the  association  group marketplace,  offering  disability  income, business
overhead expense,  accidental death  and dismemberment,  hospital indemnity  and
term life insurance to members of professional associations.


<PAGE>
    On  July 30, 1992, UNUM purchased Duncanson  & Holt, Inc. ("D&H"), a leading
accident and health reinsurance underwriting manager. As a reinsurance  manager,
D&H provides pool management as well as marketing, underwriting, administration,
claims  payment and actuarial  services for client companies,  but does not bear
any insurance risk. D&H has offices throughout the United States and in  London,
Toronto, and Singapore.

    Refer  to Item 7 and Item 8  (Note 16) under the caption "Related Businesses
Segment" for more information.

D. COLONIAL COMPANIES SEGMENT

    The Colonial  Companies  segment  in  1994 accounted  for  13.1%  of  UNUM's
revenues  and  31.6%  of its  income  before income  taxes.  Colonial Companies'
principal subsidiary,  Colonial Life  &  Accident Insurance  Company  ("Colonial
Life"),  markets  a  broad  line  of  payroll-deducted,  voluntary  benefits  to
employees at their  worksites. Colonial  Life focuses on  personal accident  and
sickness, life and cancer insurance plans.

    Colonial  Life's accident  policies generally  provide benefit  payments for
disability income, death, dismemberment or  major injury. Accident policies  are
designed  to  supplement  other  benefits  available  through  Social  Security,
workers' compensation, and other  insurance plans. Colonial  Life offers a  wide
range  of life insurance products, with universal life and whole life accounting
for most  of  the life  insurance  sold.  Colonial Life's  cancer  policies  are
designed to provide payments for hospitalization and scheduled medical benefits,
with  the amounts of such payments established  by the policies. All of Colonial
Life's insurance policies are issued on a nonparticipating basis.

    More than  95%  of Colonial  Life's  premiums  for 1994  were  derived  from
policies  marketed to employees at their  worksites, with premiums in most cases
to be  collected  through payroll  deduction.  Such  policies are  issued  on  a
"guaranteed  renewable for  life" basis, which  means that  Colonial Life cannot
refuse  to   renew  any   policy,  but   it  does   reserve  the   right  on   a
product-by-product  basis to increase premiums  for inforce policies. This right
to change premiums is  or may be subject  to various state insurance  department
rules, regulations and approvals.

    Since  1985, Colonial Life has marketed  its accident and health products as
qualified fringe benefits that can be purchased with pretax dollars as part of a
flexible benefits program pursuant to Section 125 of the Internal Revenue  Code.
In  1994,  premiums  from  sales to  employees  participating  in  such programs
accounted for approximately 48% of  total premiums. A flexible benefits  program
assists  employers  in managing  their  benefits and  compensation  packages and
provides policyholders with the  ability to choose the  benefits that best  meet
their  needs. Although Congress might change the  tax laws to limit or eliminate
fringe benefits available on  a pretax basis  and such a  change could limit  or
eliminate  Colonial Life's  ability to continue  marketing its  products in this
way, Colonial Life believes its products provide policyholders value, which will
remain even  if the  tax advantages  offered by  flexible benefit  programs  are
eliminated.

    Colonial   Life  markets   its  products  nationwide   primarily  through  a
5,300-member independent contractor sales force. Approximately 1,150 home office
employees provide corporate administration, sales support, internal services and
systems, claims processing, policyholder services, and employer services.

    Colonial Companies'  subsidiary,  BenefitAmerica,  Inc.  ("BenefitAmerica"),
offers  employers administrative  services for their  employee benefit programs.
The services offered by BenefitAmerica  include claims adjudication and  payment
for reimbursement plans, which are offered under an employer's flexible benefits
plan  pursuant to  Section 125 of  the Internal  Revenue Code, as  well as other
administrative services to those plans.  The services offered by  BenefitAmerica
complement the services and products offered to employers by Colonial Life.

    Refer  to Item 7 and Item 8  (Note 16) under the caption "Colonial Companies
Segment" for more information.

E.  INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY SEGMENT

    The Individual Disability segment accounted for 12.2% of UNUM's revenues and
(94.8)% of  its income  before income  taxes in  1994. This  segment's  products
provide  coverage for  loss of  income for  professionals, corporate executives,
business owners and administrative support personnel in the event of disability.
As  reported  in  the  Life  Insurance  Marketing  Research  Association's  1993
INDIVIDUAL  HEALTH ISSUES  AND INFORCE  SURVEY for  the United  States, the most
recent available  data,  UNUM was  the  fourth largest  provider  of  individual
disability income policies measured by premium inforce.

    UNUM  announced  in November  1994  that it  will  discontinue sales  of the
traditional, fixed  price, non-cancellable  product in  the United  States  upon
introduction  of  new  disability  products  in  each  state.  Subject  to state
regulatory approval, UNUM expects  to introduce the  new disability products  to
most states during the second quarter of 1995.


<PAGE>
    Until the new products are introduced, UNUM will continue to sell individual
disability  products on  a non-cancellable basis,  with a fixed  premium for the
duration of  the policy.  The basic  individual disability  policy provides  the
insured  with  a portion  of the  earned income  which  is lost  as a  result of
sickness or injury.  Monthly benefits  available range from  30% to  70% of  the
insured's  earned income up to a  specified maximum benefit. Various options are
available that permit tailoring of an insurance policy to the specific  client's
needs.  The most common options include the length of period before benefits are
paid, the  length  of  the  benefit period,  partial  disability  payments,  and
cost-of-living  adjustments, college benefits and retirement benefits. UNUM also
markets buy/sell and key person coverage and policies that provide reimbursement
for  business  overhead  expenses  incurred  during  a  period  of   disability.
Individual  Disability insurance premium rates  are based on expected mortality,
morbidity and  persistency  as well  as  assumptions concerning  policy  related
expenses, inflation and investment income.

    UNUM  currently distributes this segment's products in the United States and
Canada  through  a   branch  office  system   of  Individual  Disability   sales
consultants,  who distribute these  products as well as  products offered by the
Retirement Security Segment, through brokers and  agents. UNUM has a network  of
36  Individual Disability  offices in  the United  States that  are staffed with
approximately 105  management,  sales,  service  and  administrative  employees.
Another  11 sales  offices, staffed by  approximately 39  employees, are located
throughout Canada.

    Refer to  Item  7  and  Item  8 (Note  16)  under  the  caption  "Individual
Disability Segment" for more information.

F.  RETIREMENT SECURITY SEGMENT

    The  Retirement Security segment  accounted for 8.0%  of UNUM's revenues and
12.9% of  its income  before income  taxes  in 1994.  This segment  markets  and
services tax-sheltered annuities ("TSA"), long term care insurance and lifestyle
security protection ("LSP") products.

    TSA  products (Section  403(b) plans  under the  Internal Revenue  Code) are
marketed to  non-profit hospitals  and organizations.  These contracts  offer  a
fixed  fund  which provides  for annual  renewable  guarantees of  principal and
interest. In  addition, some  TSA contracts  offer variable  annuity  investment
alternatives.   These  investment  alternatives  are  mutual  funds  offered  as
subaccounts in a UNUM separate account. The mutual funds, managed by  nationally
recognized  investment managers,  include a variety  of choices  such as growth,
balanced and stock  index funds.  UNUM also offers  recordkeeping and  reporting
services to TSA contractholders.

    LSP  products  are  marketed  to employers  to  supplement  their employees'
retirement planning needs. It provides plan participants with insurance coverage
for retirement savings  in the  event of  the inability  to continue  retirement
contributions due to death or disability.

    UNUM markets its TSA and LSP products through a network of 13 offices in the
United  States, which distribute these products  as well as the products offered
by the Employee Benefits segment, primarily through brokers.

    UNUM markets long term  care insurance to  employer groups, continuing  care
retirement  communities  and individuals.  The group  product  is offered  on an
employer or  employee paid  basis, and  employer groups  may offer  coverage  to
retirees,  spouses, parents and grandparents, in  addition to the employee. UNUM
distributes long term  care products in  the United States  through brokers  and
agents  from the branch office system as  described in the Employee Benefits and
Individual Disability Segments.

    Refer to Item 7 and Item 8 (Note 16) under the caption "Retirement  Security
Segment" for more information.

G. OTHER OPERATIONS SEGMENT

    The  Other Operations segment accounted for 3.6% of UNUM's revenues and 4.3%
of its income before income taxes in 1994. This segment includes individual life
insurance  business  of  UNUM  America,  group  medical  insurance,   guaranteed
investment  contracts  ("GICs"),  deposit administration  accounts  ("DAs"), and
401(k) plans, all of which are no longer actively marketed by UNUM.

    In the fourth  quarter of 1991,  UNUM announced plans  to withdraw from  the
401(k)  market  by  the  end  of  1992.  UNUM  has  transferred  401(k)  service
responsibilities to  its formerly  wholly-owned subsidiary,  Preferred  Benefits
Corporation, which was sold in the second quarter of 1992.

    UNUM discontinued active marketing of GICs and DAs primarily due to the lack
of  demand and  the level  of investment  risk. UNUM  discontinued new  sales of
universal life and other  individual life policies as  of January 1, 1988.  UNUM
began  exiting the group medical product line in 1987 with the discontinuance of
new sales  on  the  traditional  group  medical  product.  In  1990,  management
announced  its intention to  exit the group  medical product entirely. Beginning
with


<PAGE>
the February 1991 renewals, policyholders  had the option of transferring  their
group  medical product to another insurer.  UNUM services commitments to inforce
policyholders, which  include  conversions  of  group  life  and  group  medical
insurance.

    Refer  to Item 7  and Item 8  (Note 16) under  the caption "Other Operations
Segment" for more information.

I.  RISK MANAGEMENT AND REINSURANCE

    Risk management,  which  includes  product  design,  pricing,  underwriting,
reserving  and benefits  management, involves  a determination  of the  type and
amount of risk that an insurer is willing to accept, administration of  business
inforce,  and control of claims. UNUM has underwriters organized within business
segments who evaluate policy applications  on the basis of information  provided
by the applicant and other sources.

    UNUM  reinsures with other  companies portions of  the insurance policies it
has underwritten. Reinsurance allows UNUM to sell policies with greater benefits
than the entire risk that UNUM is willing to assume. UNUM remains liable to  the
insured  for the payment of policy benefits  if the reinsurers cannot meet their
obligations under the reinsurance agreements.

    In the  Employee Benefits  segment,  UNUM has  underwriters for  each  major
product  line. Quotes for  prospective customers are  based on UNUM's experience
with the  profitability  and  persistency  of  the  respective  employer's  risk
category.  The maximum group LTD  and group STD monthly  benefit varies, but the
usual maximum monthly amount available is $35,000 and $2,500, respectively.  For
group  life insurance products, UNUM retains  up to $750,000 per individual life
and reinsures the balance with other insurance carriers.

    Colonial Life has reinsurance on its cancer insurance products that provides
coverage for claim payments in excess of $50,000 in any one year, per  claimant,
up to a lifetime maximum of $1 million per claimant.

    The financial and  medical underwriting  areas of  UNUM Limited  handle the
underwriting  of  group  and  individual  disability  policies  and  group life
policies.  The  maximum  yearly  benefit   for  group  LTD  is   326,000 pounds
sterling.   UNUM  Limited  retains  75,000  pounds  sterling  of this  risk and
reinsures  the   balance.   The  maximum  yearly initial benefit for individual
disability insurance is 125,000 pounds sterling and amounts  over 40,000 pounds
sterling per annum are  reinsured. On group life business, UNUM Limited retains
60% of the risk up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds sterling per individual life.

    Commercial Life reinsures the risk on its accidental death and dismemberment
contracts that exceed $400,000 on any  one life. Commercial Life also  reinsures
the risk on individual, group, and franchise life contracts that exceed $250,000
on any one life.

    UNUM requires medical examinations, financial data, and other information to
make a decision on the acceptability of the individual risk and to appropriately
classify an applicant for individual disability insurance products. On new sales
of  the existing non-cancellable product, UNUM retains  up to $8,000 plus 25% of
amounts in  excess of  $8,000  basic monthly  indemnity  per life  for  personal
disability  coverages, $20,000 plus 25% of amounts in excess of $20,000 per life
for business  overhead expenses  coverages and  $500,000 per  life for  buy/sell
coverages. UNUM announced in November 1994 that it will discontinue sales of the
traditional,  fixed  price, non-cancellable  product in  the United  States upon
introduction of new  disability products  in each state.  Subject to  regulatory
approval,  UNUM  expects to  introduce new  disability  products to  most states
during the second quarter of 1995.

    UNUM (except  for  Colonial Life)  reinsures  the risk  of  individual  life
insurance  contracts that exceed $425,000 on  any one life. Colonial Life limits
its risk for death and dismemberment benefits to $100,000 per life.


<PAGE>
    In addition to the reinsurance arrangements above, UNUM (except for Colonial
Life, UNUM Limited and Commercial  Life) is covered by catastrophe  reinsurance,
which  provides additional protection  against aggregate losses  in excess of $1
million up to a maximum of  $100 million. This protection is activated  whenever
one  event causes  the disability  and/or death of  five or  more people covered
under  UNUM's  life  or  disability  contracts.  Colonial  Life  is  covered  by
catastrophe reinsurance for accidental deaths totaling more than $300,000 from a
single  disaster, up to a  limit of $5 million.  UNUM Limited's group disability
business  is   partially  covered   by   catastrophe  reinsurance  of 3 million
pounds  sterling for  losses  from  one  event involving more  than twenty-five
lives. Commercial Life is covered  by  catastrophe  reinsurance, which provides
additional protection against aggregate losses in  excess of $1 million up to a
maximum of $54 million  for losses   involving   three  or more covered  lives.
Also,  UNUM purchased  excess-of-loss reinsurance  totaling  $60  million  over
three  years through  a Lloyd's  of  London  syndicate  for the non-cancellable
individual disability business of UNUM America and First UNUM.

    Reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded for the year ended December 31, 1994,
were $170.7  million and  $112.5 million,  respectively. No  current or  planned
reinsurance  activity is expected to have a significant impact on the ability of
UNUM to underwrite additional insurance.

J.  RESERVES

    The reserves  reported  in the  consolidated  financial statements  of  UNUM
Corporation  and subsidiaries  have been  computed in  accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP")  for  stock life  insurance  companies.
These  reserve balances generally differ from those specified by the laws of the
various states  and those  carried in  the statutory  financial statements.  The
differences  between GAAP and statutory reserves arise from the use of different
mortality, morbidity, interest, expense and lapse assumptions.

    Pursuant to insurance laws of the states of Maine, New York, South Carolina,
and Wisconsin, the United  Kingdom and of  Japan, UNUM's insurance  subsidiaries
(UNUM America, First UNUM, Colonial Life, Commercial Life, UNUM Limited and UNUM
Japan,  respectively) set up statutory reserves, carried as liabilities, to meet
obligations on  their various  policies. These  statutory reserves  are  amounts
which,  together with premiums to  be received and interest  on such reserves at
assumed rates, are calculated to be  sufficient to meet the policy and  contract
obligations  of  UNUM's insurance  subsidiaries. Pursuant  to insurance  laws of
Canada, UNUM America has established regulatory reserves to meet the obligations
of policies written in its Canadian branch.

    Statutory, GAAP  and regulatory  reserves are  based upon  UNUM's  insurance
subsidiaries' experience as adjusted to provide for possible adverse deviations.
These estimates are periodically reviewed and compared to actual experience. The
assumptions  are revised when  it is determined  that future expected experience
differs from the assumed estimates.

K.  EMPLOYEES

    At December 31, 1994, UNUM had approximately 7,200 full-time employees. UNUM
does not have collective bargaining agreements with employees.

L.  COMPETITION

    The principal competitive factors affecting UNUM's business are  reputation,
financial  strength,  quality of  service, risk  management, product  design and
price.  There  is  competition  among  insurance  companies  for  the  types  of
individual  and group insurance and retirement products sold by UNUM. At the end
of 1994, there were approximately  1,900 legal reserve life insurance  companies
in  the  United States  and  Canada and  life  assurance offices  in  the United
Kingdom, which may offer insurance products  similar to those marketed by  UNUM.
UNUM  also  competes with  banks, investment  advisors,  mutual funds  and other
financial entities  to  provide  products  and  services.  All  areas  of  group
insurance  are  highly  competitive because  of  the large  number  of insurance
companies and other entities offering these products.

M. REGULATION

    UNUM's insurance subsidiaries are subject  to regulation and supervision  in
the  jurisdictions  in  which they  do  business.  Although the  extent  of such
regulation varies, U.S. state, Canadian,  United Kingdom and Japanese  insurance
laws   generally  establish  supervisory  agencies,   such  as  state  insurance
departments,  the  Office  of  the  Superintendent  of  Financial   Institutions
("OSFI"),  The  Department of  Trade and  Industry ("DTI")  and the  Ministry of
Finance ("MOF"), respectively,  with broad administrative  powers. These  powers
relate  chiefly  to the  granting  and revocation  of  the licenses  to transact
business, and  establishing reserve  requirements and  the form  and content  of
required  financial statements. Such powers also include the licensing of agents
in the U.S.  and the  approval of  policy forms in  the U.S.  and Japan.  UNUM's
insurance  operations and subsidiaries must meet the standards and tests for its
investments promulgated by insurance  laws and regulations  of Maine, New  York,
South Carolina, Wisconsin, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan, as applicable.

    UNUM's  United States domiciled insurance  subsidiaries are required to file
quarterly and annual statements with the various insurance departments in  state
jurisdictions  in which they do business. These statements comply with the rules
of  the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  ("NAIC").   UNUM's
insurance  subsidiaries are examined periodically by  examiners of the states of
Maine, New  York,  South Carolina  and  Wisconsin and  of  other states  (on  an
"association"


<PAGE>
or  "zone" basis) in  which they are  licensed to do  business. UNUM's insurance
branch operation  in  Canada  is periodically  examined  by  Canadian  insurance
regulatory  authorities and is required to  file annual reports that comply with
the insurance laws  of Canada and  with the rules  of the OSFI  of the  Canadian
Federal  government and each of the  provinces. UNUM's United Kingdom subsidiary
is required to file  financial statements annually with  the DTI, in  accordance
with  United Kingdom law and regulation. UNUM Japan is required to file periodic
financial statements  with  the  MOF,  in  accordance  with  Japanese  laws  and
regulations.

    UNUM's  insurance subsidiaries  operate under insurance  laws, which require
that they establish and carry, as liabilities, actuarial reserves to meet  their
obligations  on  their  life,  disability,  accident  and  health  policies  and
annuities. These reserves are verified periodically by various regulators.

    UNUM's reinsurance underwriting manager, Duncanson & Holt, Inc., ("D&H")  is
a  licensed reinsurance intermediary in New York. It is subject to regulation in
New York and other states where it does business. Duncanson & Holt Underwriters,
Ltd., a subsidiary  of D&H, is  a corporate member  of Lloyds of  London and  is
subject to all rules applicable to such members.

    UNUM  Sales  Corporation, a  registered broker-dealer,  is regulated  by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It  is  the principal  underwriter  for variable  annuity  contracts
offered by UNUM America and First UNUM.

    The  laws of the State of  Maine require periodic registration and reporting
by insurance companies domiciled within  its jurisdiction, which control or  are
controlled  by other corporations or persons. This constitutes, by definition, a
holding company system.  UNUM America is  domiciled in Maine  and is subject  to
these  laws.  New York,  which is  the  domiciliary state  of First  UNUM; South
Carolina, which is the domiciliary state of Colonial Life; and Wisconsin,  which
is the domiciliary state of Commercial Life, have similar laws. Accordingly, the
UNUM  insurance  subsidiaries  are registered  as  members of  the  UNUM holding
company system in the states of  Maine, New York, South Carolina and  Wisconsin.
The statutes of these states require periodic disclosure concerning the ultimate
controlling  person and  intercorporate transactions within  the holding company
system, some of which require prior approval.

    Effective  December  31,  1991,  UNUM  America  merged  with  two  of   UNUM
Corporation's   wholly-owned  Maine  life   insurance  subsidiaries,  UNUM  Life
Insurance Company ("UNUM Life") and UNUM Pension and Insurance Company ("UPIC"),
with UNUM America remaining as the surviving corporation. In connection with the
merger of UNUM Life and UPIC into UNUM America, UNUM Life ceased to maintain its
licensing status in the State of New York effective December 31, 1991, with  all
future  New York business being transacted by  First UNUM. As a condition of New
York regulatory approval, UNUM America agreed to maintain a security deposit  in
the  State of New York equal to 102% of outstanding statutory liabilities to New
York policyholders, insureds and  claimants of UNUM  Life. The security  deposit
consists  of certain cash  and invested assets.  An initial deposit  was made in
February 1992 and at December 31, 1994, the required deposit was $819.2 million.
UNUM America  has  the ability  to  withdraw assets  from  this account  and  to
substitute  other assets at its discretion.  The balance of the security deposit
will be  reviewed and  adjusted at  least annually  based upon  the  outstanding
liabilities described above.

N. PARTICIPATION FUND ACCOUNT

    Participating  policies issued  prior to  November 14,  1986, by  the former
Union Mutual Life Insurance Company  ("Union Mutual") will remain  participating
as  long as they remain in force.  A Participation Fund Account ("PFA") has been
established  for  the  sole  benefit   of  all  of  Union  Mutual's   individual
participating life and annuity policies and contracts. At December 31, 1994, the
PFA  had $347.0  million in  assets, which  are held  by UNUM  America. UNUM has
agreed to pay certain expenses associated with the PFA and at December 31, 1994,
the reserve for the present value of such expenses was $15.9 million.

    PFA assets, investment earnings and income from operations are not available
to UNUM America or UNUM during the operation or upon the termination of the PFA.
In the unlikely event that the assets of the PFA are not adequate to provide for
policyholder benefits (exclusive of dividends,  which are not guaranteed),  UNUM
America  would be required  to provide for  any shortfall, and  such amounts, if
any, would reduce earnings of UNUM America and UNUM.

    All  operating  data  of  the  individual  participating  life  and  annuity
contracts  has been excluded from the  Consolidated Statements of Income and all
other operating data included in this report unless otherwise noted. The  assets
and  liabilities  associated with  the  participating business  are  included in
UNUM's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    UNUM owns home office property consisting of five office buildings and  four
service buildings located throughout the Portland, Maine area. UNUM also owns an
office  building  in  the United  Kingdom,  which  is the  home  office  of UNUM

<PAGE>
Limited. The home office of the Colonial Companies is located in Columbia, South
Carolina, and  is also  owned by  UNUM.  In addition,  UNUM leases,  on  periods
principally  from five to ten  years, office and warehouse  space for use by its
home office affiliates and sales forces.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    In the  normal  course of  its  business  operations, UNUM  is  involved  in
litigation  from time  to time with  claimants, beneficiaries and  others, and a
number of  lawsuits  were  pending at  December  31,  1994. In  the  opinion  of
management,  the ultimate liability, if any, arising from this litigation is not
expected to  have  a  material  adverse effect  on  the  consolidated  financial
position or the consolidated operating results of UNUM.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    No  matter was submitted to a  vote of shareholders, through solicitation of
proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter 1994.

CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW

During 1994, UNUM reported decreased income before income taxes, which was
primarily attributable to unfavorable claims experience in two of UNUM's largest
product lines, individual disability as reported in the Individual Disability
segment, and group long term disability, as reported in the Employee Benefits
segment.

As further described in the Individual Disability segment, throughout 1994
UNUM's individual disability business in the United States experienced a higher
incidence of new claims and a disproportionate number of larger claims that
management has attributed to certain geographical and occupational segments,
particularly physicians.  As a result, in 1994 UNUM increased reserves for
existing claims by $83.3 million and established a reserve for future estimated
losses of $109.1 million.  These increased reserves reflect management's current
expectations for morbidity trends for the existing individual disability
business, as reported in the Individual Disability segment.  This reserve
strengthening resulted in an increase to benefits to policyholders in the
Consolidated Statement of Income of $192.4 million and a decrease to net income
of $125.1 million, or $1.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1994.  It
is not possible to predict whether morbidity trends will be consistent with
UNUM's current assumptions.

During 1994, UNUM's North American group long term disability results, as
reported in the Employee Benefits segment, were adversely affected through a
combination of increased incidence of new claims and an increased number of
large claims.  Management continues to address these unfavorable claim trends by
increasing prices on selected new and inforce business, implementing more
stringent underwriting guidelines, and strengthening risk management programs.
Management believes these actions will strengthen UNUM's ability to deal with
these disability claims trends into the future, and that the level of future
earnings of the group long term disability product will be a function of the
effectiveness of these continuing actions and the time required for these
actions to take effect.

<PAGE>

During 1994, several of UNUM's businesses were contending with various proposals
to reform the health care delivery system in the United States.  While proposed
federal health care legislation was not enacted in 1994, structural reform is
under way, which UNUM believes has and will continue to alter the medical
profession, as well as the social and economic environment of the health care
industry.  Management believes the uncertainties as to how the health care
industry will emerge from such structural reform, as well as changes in and
consolidation of the health care delivery system, contributed to a higher
incidence of new and larger claims for physicians.

The interest rate environment changed dramatically during 1994, as long-term
interest rates rose from a more than twenty-year low experienced in 1993, along
with increases in the prime lending rates and short-term rates.  However,
average investment yields on new fixed maturity purchases for the past two years
remain below the existing average portfolio yield, which has decreased the
average rate used to discount disability claim reserve liabilities and decreased
levels of investment income in 1994 and 1993, despite continued growth in
invested assets.  Management anticipates that the average investment portfolio
yield will further decline, since UNUM invests its cash flows in high quality
assets that currently have yields below the existing average portfolio yields.

Economic indicators at the end of 1994 and in early 1995 were predicting modest
growth in 1995 for UNUM's major markets:  the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom.  In February 1995, the Federal Reserve Board tightened credit
policy, due to continued concerns about inflation, by raising the federal funds
rate to 6%, the highest level in four years.  This represents an increase of
three full percentage points since the Federal Reserve Board started raising
rates in February 1994.  Also in 1994, the central banks in Canada and the
United Kingdom increased interest rates.  During 1994, long-term yields
increased; however, since long-term yields are based on market dynamics,
management cannot predict the impact of a higher short-term rate on future long-
term yields.

The increase in income before income taxes in 1993 was primarily due to expense
management, favorable claims experience in the Individual Disability segment and
unusually favorable interest spread margins on tax sheltered annuities in the
Retirement Security segment.  Expenses of $9.6 million, or $0.12 per share,
incurred in connection with the merger of  UNUM and Colonial Companies, Inc.,
included in Corporate, and unfavorable group life claims experience in the
Employee Benefits segment partially offset these results.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 1994, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
which specified the accounting and reporting for certain investments in equity
securities and for all investments in debt securities.  UNUM adopted the
provisions of FAS 115 for these investments held as of or acquired after January
1, 1994.  Upon the adoption of FAS 115, UNUM increased unrealized gains on
available for sale securities included in stockholders' equity on January 1,
1994, by $41.8 million (net of deferred taxes of $22.5 million) to reflect the
unrealized holding gains on fixed maturities classified as available for sale
which were previously carried at amortized cost.  In accordance with FAS 115,
prior year consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect
the change in accounting principle.  The adoption of FAS 115 did not affect 1994
net income.

Included in 1993 net income were the cumulative and incremental effects of the
adoption of FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions," and FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted FAS 106, which changed the method for
recognition of the cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions from a
cash basis to an accrual basis over the years in which employees render the
related services.  UNUM elected to recognize the FAS 106 liability at January 1,
1993, of $48.8 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change which
decreased net income by $32.1 million, or $0.40 per share, in 1993. The
incremental effect of FAS 106 for 1993 was increased operating expenses of
approximately $6.0 million from 1992.

Also effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted FAS 109, which changed the method
for calculating and reporting deferred income taxes in the financial statements
from the deferred method to the liability method.  The cumulative effect of this
accounting change amounted to a $20.0 million increase, or $0.25 per share, in
1993 net income.

UNUM also adopted FAS No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts," effective January 1, 1993, which
resulted in an increase in other assets of $80.0 million and a corresponding
increase in future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses, but did
not affect 1993 net income.


<PAGE>

INCOME TAXES

Effective tax rates, which reflect income tax expense as a percentage of pretax
income, were 22.1%, 32.2% and 26.9% for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
significant reduction in the effective tax rate for 1994 resulted primarily from
reduced pretax earnings.  Reported income tax expense was below the federal
statutory tax rate of 35% for 1994 and 1993, and 34% for 1992, primarily due to
tax savings from investments in tax-exempt securities.  Although investments in
tax-exempt securities result in increased consolidated net income, these
investments reduce UNUM's business segments' income before income taxes.

In 1993, UNUM's growth in pretax income outpaced the growth of income from tax-
exempt securities, which resulted in an increased effective tax rate.  On August
10, 1993,  legislation was enacted to increase the federal corporate income tax
rate of 34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993.  The change in tax rates
resulted in a $7.8 million, or $0.10 per share, charge related to the adjustment
of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding the adjustment to deferred income tax
expense of $7.8 million for the enacted tax rate change, the 1993 effective tax
rate would have been 30.5%.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SEGMENT

The Employee Benefits segment includes group long term disability ("group LTD"),
group life and other employee benefits products including short term disability,
accidental death and dismemberment and dental insurance, which are sold by UNUM
Life Insurance Company of America ("UNUM America") and First UNUM Life Insurance
Company ("First UNUM").

Increased sales and selected price increases on new and inforce cases
contributed to the premium growth of 6.5% in the Employee Benefits segment in
1994.  Rate increases to address unfavorable experience on selected segments of
the inforce business contributed to the decline in both the group LTD and group
life premium persistency rates in 1994.  In general, case terminations resulting
from rate increases have occurred in less profitable segments of these
businesses.  Management expects to continue to seek inforce case rate increases,
as appropriate, given claims experience, to improve profitability.  However,
such rate actions may increase case terminations and decrease persistency rates
for these businesses.  In 1994 and 1993, group LTD was active in acquiring
closed blocks of claims which generated one-time premiums totaling $8.6 million
and $58.3 million, respectively.  Management intends to pursue additional claim
block acquisitions in the future.

The 22.1% premium growth in 1993 reflected record sales in all of the Employee
Benefits segment's product lines.  Premium growth also reflected selected price
increases, acquisitions of closed blocks of claims, and slight growth of the
employment and salary levels for group LTD's existing customer base.  Renewal
rate actions for group LTD had a minimal impact on the premium persistency rate
for 1993.

During 1994, the group LTD business experienced a higher incidence of new claims
and an increased number of large claims, which were the primary causes of the
increased benefit ratio for the Employee Benefits segment from 1993.  Management
has identified a number of geographical and occupational segments of the group
LTD business which are experiencing higher than expected claims.  Management
continues to pursue these segments of the business for underwriting and pricing
actions, and is addressing increased incidence rates, lower recovery rates, and
the more subjective nature of the types of disability claims by implementing
new, and enhancing existing, risk management programs.

Group LTD earnings in 1994 were also adversely affected by a decrease in the
discount rate used to determine reserves, from 9.34% at December 31, 1993, to
9.18% at December 31, 1994, which resulted in an increase to claim reserves.
The discount rate is a composite yield of assets specifically matched with the
group LTD reserves.  Management expects the discount rate will further decline,
since current cash flows are invested in high quality assets at current yields,
which are below the composite yields of the existing assets purchased in prior
years.  UNUM has increased prices on both existing and new business in order to
mitigate the impact of the interest rate environment.

<PAGE>

Reserves for unpaid claims are estimates based on UNUM's historical experience
and other actuarial assumptions, which consider the effects of current
developments, anticipated trends, risk management programs and renewal actions.
Many factors affect actuarial calculations of claim reserves, including but not
limited to interest rates, and current and anticipated incidence rates, recovery
rates, and economic and societal conditions.  Reserve estimates and assumptions
are periodically reviewed and updated with any resulting adjustments to reserves
reflected in current operating results.  Given the complexity of the reserving
process, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such estimates
indicate.

During 1994, management implemented and strengthened various risk management
programs to address the unfavorable claims trends experienced in group LTD.  In
addition to the selected price increases on new and inforce business, more
stringent underwriting practices, and reducing benefit options for certain
segments of the business, management has established special units to address
specific aspects of disability claims, including complex and fraudulent claims.
Additionally, management has implemented new group LTD contract provisions which
provide risk management features and claimant rehabilitation incentives.  Also,
management continually reviews the benefits management process to identify and
strengthen risk management policies and procedures.

Management believes these underwriting, pricing and risk management actions will
strengthen UNUM's ability to deal with these disability claims trends into the
future, and that the level of future earnings of the group LTD product will be a
function of the effectiveness of these continuing actions and the time required
for these actions to take effect.

The group life business reported favorable claims experience in 1994.
Management continues to address higher than expected claims in certain portions
of the business by imposing more stringent underwriting requirements and
increasing prices.  Management believes these actions improved overall claims
experience for group life products in 1994.

The ratio of operating expenses to premiums was 20.2%, 21.0%, and 23.4% in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.   The decreases in 1994 and 1993 were attributable
to continued efforts to manage expense growth and increased premium from claim
block purchases in 1993, which do not have proportionally higher expenses.
Deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 1994 and 1993 due primarily to
deferrals of higher marketing costs associated with increased sales and renewal
activity.

In summary, the improvement in income before income taxes for the Employee
Benefits segment in 1994 was primarily due to favorable claims experience in the
group life and short term disability businesses, a lower operating expense
ratio, and increased realized investment gains, which were partially offset by
unfavorable claims experience in the group LTD business.  Strong premium growth
and a lower operating expense ratio, which were partially offset by unfavorable
claims experience in the group life business and lower realized investment
gains, resulted in increased income before income taxes for 1993 as compared
with 1992.

RELATED BUSINESSES SEGMENT

The Related Businesses segment includes: UNUM Limited, the United Kingdom's
leader in group disability insurance; Commercial Life Insurance Company
("Commercial"), a leader in special risk insurance and professional association
insurance marketing; and Reinsurance Operations, which includes  Duncanson &
Holt, Inc. ("D&H"), a leading accident and health reinsurance underwriting
manager, and other special risk reinsurance operations.

UNUM LIMITED
The depressed economic environment that affected the United Kingdom in 1992 and
1993 experienced a modest recovery in 1994, which positively affected UNUM
Limited's ability to sell long term disability insurance.  UNUM Limited
experienced strong premium growth in 1994 as sales increased and persistency
rates improved.  Also in 1994, claim block acquisitions generated one-time
premium of $25.8 million.  A reallocation of capital from UNUM Limited in 1992,
and a decreasing interest rate environment, resulted in decreased investment
income for the Related Businesses segment in 1993.

UNUM Limited experienced favorable claims levels for most of 1994, which
improved the benefit ratio from 1993.  However, in late 1994, UNUM Limited
incurred unfavorable claims experience, which management is evaluating to
determine the need for pricing actions, changes in underwriting standards or
risk management programs.  If the unfavorable claims experience that developed
in late 1994 were to continue, UNUM Limited's earnings could be negatively
affected.  Due to the nature of the risks insured and the relative size of the
U.K. block of business, UNUM Limited's operating results can exhibit claims
variability.  Investment in administrative procedures and systems was the
primary reason for increased operating expenses in 1993.

On April 1, 1995, the United Kingdom's new Social Security (Incapacity for Work)
Act of 1994 will be effective, and will shift a greater financial responsibility
for disability benefits from the U.K. government to the private sector.
Management believes this legislation will increase awareness of the need for
disability insurance and expand the U.K. insurance market for long term
disability products, which could favorably affect UNUM Limited's sales.
However, it is unclear when the effects of this legislation will be evidenced.

During 1994, the U.S. dollar weakened slightly against the British pound
sterling, increasing UNUM Limited's earnings as reported in U.S. dollars.  This
reversed the trend in 1993 and 1992 when the U.S. dollar strengthened against
the British pound sterling, decreasing earnings as reported in U.S. dollars.
The weighted average exchange rate was approximately $1.53, $1.51 and $1.78 for
the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  At December 31, 1994, the
spot rate had increased to $1.56.

<PAGE>

COMMERCIAL
Increased sales across all lines of Commercial's businesses in 1994 benefited
premium growth, which was partially offset by higher than expected case
terminations.  The 1994 benefit ratio was driven by favorable experience in the
special risk product line, offset by unfavorable claims experience in the
association group disability business within certain occupational groups and
geographical areas.  Management is implementing rate increases and stronger
underwriting policies to mitigate this unfavorable claims experience. The
decrease in the benefit ratio in 1993 was primarily due to more favorable claims
experience in the association group disability business.  Due to the nature of
the risks underwritten and relative size of the block of business, Commercial's
special risk products can exhibit claims variability.

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS
In 1994, Reinsurance Operations had unfavorable claims experience in certain
reinsurance pools and decreased fee income for D&H due to increased competition
and contract terminations.  Fee income and operating expenses increased in the
Related Businesses segment in 1993 due to the full year inclusion of D&H, which
was acquired in third quarter 1992.

SUMMARY
Income before income taxes increased in 1994 for the Related Businesses segment,
primarily due to strong premium growth and favorable claims experience at UNUM
Limited, partially offset by unfavorable claims experience in Commercial's
association group disability business and in certain reinsurance pools.  The
principal reason for the increase in income before income taxes for the Related
Businesses segment in 1993 was the inclusion of D&H results for a full year,
which was partially offset by less favorable earnings for UNUM Limited due to a
lower weighted average exchange rate.

COLONIAL COMPANIES SEGMENT

The Colonial Companies segment includes Colonial Life & Accident Insurance
Company and affiliates, which offer payroll-deducted, voluntary employee
benefits to employees at their worksites.  The Colonial Companies segment
("Colonial") markets accident and sickness, cancer, and life insurance products
primarily through independent sales representatives.

In 1994, Colonial experienced an increase in sales, which was attributed to
increased productivity from the sales organization and the offering of a number
of new products.  In 1993, Colonial experienced a slight decrease in sales,
which management attributed to uncertainty in the marketplace as to the types of
coverage that would be included in health care reform proposals.  Management
does not feel that 1994 sales were as negatively affected by health care reform
fears, as the focus shifted away from legislative health care restructuring
toward private market restructuring.  Additionally, management views health care
reform as an opportunity for UNUM by allowing Colonial to leverage its expertise
in worksite marketing, since the workplace is considered to be a primary means
of access to insurance benefits in the developing healthcare environment.  While
premium growth slowed in 1994, enhanced customer conservation programs have
partially offset the weaker sales levels in 1993 and 1992 by improving
persistency.

Realized investment gains for 1993 include approximately $8.5 million of gains
associated with Colonial's sales of higher yielding but callable investments to
realign its investment portfolio with UNUM's investment philosophy.  Fees and
other income for 1992 reflect $4.0 million received from the settlement of a
lawsuit against a competitor.

Colonial's benefit ratio improved to 50.4% in 1994 from 51.4% in 1993.  The
lower 1994 benefit ratio was driven by favorable claims experience and improved
incidence rates in most product lines, particularly in the cancer product line.
Management expects the benefit ratio to increase in the future as Colonial
continues to shift its product mix toward products with higher benefit ratios,
lower expense ratios and better persistency.

During 1994, the expense ratio increased because of higher than expected costs
associated with a sales organization realignment and litigation expenses, which
were partially offset by continued expense control efforts. The decline in
1993's expense ratio reflected management's efforts to control expenditures and
improve operational efficiencies.

Income before income taxes decreased in 1994 primarily because of reduced
realized investment gains and increased expenses, partially offset by favorable
claims experience.  For 1993, Colonial's income before income taxes increased
primarily through continued expense control and a higher level of realized
investment gains attributed to the investment portfolio realignment.

INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY SEGMENT

The Individual Disability segment includes disability income products sold in
the United States and Canada through UNUM America and First UNUM, as well as
private label agreements through these companies.

The loss before income taxes of $(188.2) million for the Individual Disability
segment for 1994 is primarily due to the $192.4 million reserve strengthening
recorded in the third quarter of 1994 and a $12.3 million restructuring charge
incurred in the fourth quarter as a result of the decision to stop selling non-
cancellable disability income policies in the United States.  During 1994, the
Individual Disability segment experienced a higher incidence of new claims and a
disproportionate number of large claims that management has attributed to
certain geographic and occupational segments of the business, particularly
physicians.  Management believes that changes in and consolidation of the health
care delivery system in the United States and the increased prevalence of
emerging and often subjective types of disabilities have contributed to
increased benefit costs.

During the third quarter of 1994, management concluded that the deterioration of
claims experience was not a temporary fluctuation in certain segments of the
business, but was indicative of expected claim trends for the future.  Unlike
the group long term disability product, management has limited ability to manage
the claims risk associated with non-cancellable individual disability business,
since UNUM is contractually unable to reprice or cancel inforce policies that
have become unprofitable because of changes in claims experience that were
unforeseen when the policy was sold.  The combination of these factors prompted
UNUM to assess the adequacy of future premiums to provide for future benefits
and expenses and the assumptions used in the existing claim reserves for the
Individual Disability segment.  As a result, in third quarter 1994, UNUM
increased reserves for existing claims by $83.3 million and established a
reserve for estimated future losses of $109.1 million.  These increased reserves
reflect management's current expectations for morbidity trends and record the
estimated future losses for the existing individual disability business, as
reported in the Individual Disability segment.

It is not possible to predict whether future morbidity trends will be consistent
with UNUM's current assumptions.  During the fourth quarter of 1994, excess-of-
loss reinsurance totaling $60 million over three years was purchased through a
Lloyd's of London syndicate to cover UNUM's exposure to claims exceeding levels
assumed in the strengthened reserves.  Management continues to evaluate its
financial options for this business, including reinsurance opportunities.

<PAGE>

UNUM announced in November 1994 that it will discontinue sales of the
traditional, fixed price, non-cancellable product in the United States upon
introduction of new disability products in each state.  Subject to state
regulatory approval, UNUM expects to introduce the new disability products to
most states during the second quarter of 1995.  In connection with these product
changes, management expects to incur costs during 1995 to develop and market the
new individual disability products.

UNUM has further tightened underwriting rules and practices, and made other
product design limitations for the interim sales of the existing product.  As a
result of the tightened underwriting of the existing product and the time needed
to develop the new products, management expects that sales of the Individual
Disability segment will decrease significantly in 1995 from levels in 1994.

UNUM is in continuing discussions with its private label partners as it develops
the new disability products to determine the future course of its private label
agreements.  Private label agreements allow other insurance companies to market
UNUM's individual disability product under their own names.

In the fourth quarter of 1994, UNUM recorded a pretax charge of $12.3 million
related to the restructuring of the individual disability business and resulting
consolidation of home office operations in UNUM America, which was comprised of
$7.1 million for severance costs for 150 field and 150 home office employees and
$5.2 million for exit costs of certain leased facilities and equipment, expiring
through 1998.  The severance costs are expected to be paid by the end of 1995.

The increase in income before income taxes for the Individual Disability segment
in 1993 from 1992 was primarily due to more favorable claims experience and
continued expense management.

RETIREMENT SECURITY SEGMENT

The Retirement Security segment includes tax sheltered annuities ("TSAs"), long
term care insurance, and beginning in 1993, lifestyle security protection
products, all of which are marketed by UNUM America and First UNUM.

During 1994 and 1993, UNUM offered the holders of certain types of TSA contracts
the opportunity to modify such contracts.  The proposed contract amendments
provide for UNUM to increase the minimum guaranteed credited rates in return for
contractholders relinquishing the right to make lump-sum withdrawals without an
associated fee.  As expected, certain contractholders elected to withdraw their
funds rather than convert to the modified contract provisions, which affected
the overall growth of invested assets under management.  Management expects
these types of withdrawals to continue, which may affect future growth of
invested assets under management for TSAs.

During 1994, UNUM implemented an investment strategy to increase investments in
tax-exempt securities which has reduced income before income taxes for the
segment.  Although investments in tax-exempt securities resulted in increased
consolidated net income, this investment strategy reduced the Retirement
Security segment's income before income taxes by approximately $6.7 million in
1994.  In addition, the low interest rate environment during the past two years
has reduced the investment yields on TSA assets.  As a result of these factors,
investment income decreased by $8.4 million and increased by only $0.8 million,
during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

As interest rates declined in 1993, the rate and level of interest credited to
TSA contractholders declined as well.  Despite a rising interest rate
environment in 1994, the level of interest credited to TSA contractholders
continued to decline.  As a result, the TSA business experienced unusually
favorable interest spread margins in 1994 and 1993.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the
amount of interest credited to funds on deposit amounted to 70.3%, 70.5%, and
77.3% of investment income, respectively.  Management does not expect interest
spread margins experienced by TSAs in 1994 and 1993 to continue at the same
level, which may reduce future earnings for the Retirement Security segment.

Management believes the failure of the last Congress to pass health care reform
legislation positively affected long term care insurance products, which
experienced premium and sales growth during 1994 after lower than expected
growth in 1993 due to the announcement of President Clinton's health care reform
proposal that included long term care coverage.  During 1994, block acquisitions
generated one-time net premiums for long term care insurance products of $15.0
million.  Management may pursue additional block acquisitions in the future.
Long term care insurance products experienced an increased incidence of new
claims during 1994, which management has addressed by implementing new
underwriting guidelines.


<PAGE>


Income before income taxes increased in 1994 reflecting continued premium growth
and expense reductions in the long term care insurance products partially offset
by unfavorable claims experience.  Additionally, during 1994 UNUM continued its
investment in the development of long term care and lifestyle security
protection products, and in a TSA business initiative which management expects
will improve customer acquisition and service functions as well as reduce future
operating expenses.  Unusually favorable interest spread margins on tax
sheltered annuities were the primary reason for increased income before income
taxes in 1993.

OTHER OPERATIONS SEGMENT

The Other Operations segment includes individual life insurance business of UNUM
Life Insurance Company of America, group medical insurance, guaranteed
investment contracts ("GICs"), deposit administration accounts ("DAs"), and
401(k) plans, all of which are no longer actively marketed by UNUM.

The reduced invested asset base under management for GICs, DAs and 401(k) plans
resulted in lower revenues from investment income and reduced amounts of
interest credited.  Management expects continued decreases in the amounts of
investment income and interest credited as the related GIC, DA and 401(k)
contracts mature or terminate.  Management expects future earnings in the Other
Operations segment to decline, reflecting the run-off nature of these closed
blocks of businesses.

During 1992, UNUM released the remaining restructuring reserve for the costs of
withdrawal from the 401(k) business since actual costs were less than expected,
resulting in increased pretax income of $5.3 million.  The gain associated with
the release of this restructuring reserve reduced operating expenses in the 1992
Consolidated Statement of Income.

Corporate includes transactions that are generally non-insurance related,
expenses incurred in conjunction with UNUM's long-term strategic investment in
Japan and interest expense on corporate borrowings.  The increased loss before
income taxes in 1994 in Corporate was primarily due to increased interest
expense and increased costs related to the investment in Japan.  The increased
loss before income taxes in 1993 was primarily due to the expenses incurred in
connection with the March 26, 1993, merger of UNUM Corporation and Colonial
Companies, Inc., decreased interest income and increased investment in Japan.

UNUM JAPAN

On June 20, 1994, the Japanese Ministry of Finance granted UNUM a provisional
operating license which allowed UNUM to establish a non-life insurance company,
UNUM Japan Accident Insurance Company Limited ("UNUM Japan"), to market
disability and other accident products in Japan.  UNUM Japan has subsequently
received an official license and began selling group long term disability
products in the fourth quarter of 1994, with the first policies effective
January 1, 1995.

UNUM Japan formed a cooperative relationship with Japan's leading short term
disability insurer, Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. to develop the new
long term disability products and introduce them in Japan.  The two companies
continue to work together on market and product development and will also market
their own separate long term disability products.  UNUM expects to continue
incurring costs to develop UNUM Japan's distribution network, advertising and
risk management programs.

INVESTMENTS

UNUM has a fairly conservative investment philosophy, with a portfolio that is
concentrated in investment grade bonds.  UNUM evaluates total expected return
after consideration of all associated expenses and losses, within criteria
established for each product line.  Product line investment strategies are
developed to complement business risks by meeting the liquidity and solvency
requirements of each product.  UNUM purchases assets whose maturities, expected
cash flows and prepayment conditions are consistent with these strategies.  The
nature and quality of the types of investments comply with policies established
by management, which are more stringent overall than the statutes and
regulations imposed by the jurisdictions in which UNUM's insurance subsidiaries
are licensed.

UNUM's investments are reported in the consolidated financial statements net of
any allowances for probable losses.  Allowances are established based on a
review of specific assets as well as the overall portfolio, considering the
carrying value of the underlying assets.  If a decline in market value is
considered to be other than temporary, the investment is reduced to estimated
net realizable value and the reduction is recorded as a realized investment
loss.  UNUM discontinues the accrual of investment income on invested assets
when it is determined that collectability is doubtful.  Management monitors the
risk associated with the invested asset portfolio and regularly reviews and
adjusts the allowance for probable losses.

At December 31, 1994, the composition of UNUM's $10,433.8 million of invested
assets was 75.4% fixed maturities, 11.7% mortgage loans, 6.0% equity securities,
1.8% real estate and 5.1% other invested assets.  Gross realized investment
gains were $117.0 million, $85.2 million and $94.4 million, and gross realized
investment losses were $71.4 million, $35.8 million and $52.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

FIXED MATURITIES:

Effective January 1, 1994, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
which specified the accounting and reporting for certain investments in equity
securities and for all investments in debt securities.  UNUM adopted the
provisions of FAS 115 for these investments held as of or acquired after January
1, 1994, which are classified and accounted for as follows:

 -   Fixed maturities that UNUM has the positive intent and ability to hold to
     maturity are classified as "held to maturity" and are reported at amortized
     cost, less an allowance for probable losses.  The majority of UNUM's
     insurance reserve liabilities are generally long-term in nature and not
     subject to withdrawal.  Since UNUM purchases assets whose maturities,
     expected cash flows, and prepayment conditions complement business risks
     by meeting the liquidity and solvency requirements of each product, the



<PAGE>


     majority of UNUM's fixed maturities have been classified as "held to
     maturity" to match the longer term nature of UNUM's products.

 -   Fixed maturities and equity securities classified as "available for sale"
     are reported at fair value.  Related unrealized holding gains and losses,
     net of deferred taxes, are reported in a separate component of
     stockholders' equity.  Fair values of fixed maturities are generally
     obtained from external quoted market sources, and if not externally quoted,
     are determined by UNUM primarily by using discounted cash flow models.

Upon the adoption of FAS 115, UNUM increased unrealized gains on available for
sale securities included in stockholders' equity on January 1, 1994, by $41.8
million (net of deferred taxes of $22.5 million) to reflect the unrealized
holding gains on fixed maturities classified as available for sale which were
previously carried at amortized cost.  In accordance with FAS 115, prior year
consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change
in accounting principle.  UNUM reclassified certain fixed maturities from held
to maturity to available for sale on January 1, 1994, in connection with the
adoption of FAS 115.  The increasing interest rate environment during 1994
resulted in depressed fair values for available for sale fixed maturities, which
has decreased the initial $41.8 million increase in stockholders' equity to an
unrealized loss of $42.8 million at December 31, 1994.

At December 31, 1994, and 1993, the fixed maturity portfolio included $193.8
million and $263.3 million of below investment grade bonds (below "Baa"), which
represented 2.5% and 3.5% of the fixed maturity portfolio, respectively.  These
bonds had associated market values of $193.4 million and $279.1 million,
respectively.  Virtually all of the nonconvertible, below investment grade bonds
were purchased at investment grade, but were subsequently downgraded.  UNUM's
investment policy is to invest primarily in fixed maturities of investment grade
quality.  Selected purchases of convertible subordinated debentures, which UNUM
considers to be part of its investment strategy for equity securities, have
contributed to the amount of below investment grade bonds.  Fixed maturity
ratings are obtained from external rating agencies, and if not externally rated,
are rated by UNUM internally using similar methods.  Management does not expect
any risks or uncertainties associated with below investment grade bonds to have
a significant affect on UNUM's consolidated financial position or results of
operations.  The percentage of fixed maturities delinquent 60 days or more
compared to total fixed maturities was 0.25% at December 31, 1994, and 0.24% at
December 31, 1993.

During fourth quarter 1994, UNUM sold fixed maturities of five issuers
classified as held to maturity with an amortized cost of $49.8 million due to
evidence of significant unexpected deterioration of the issuers'
creditworthiness.  These sales resulted in a net realized loss of $3.0 million.

<PAGE>

MORTGAGES:

At December 31, 1994, and 1993, UNUM's mortgage loans were $1,216.3 million and
$1,432.2 million, respectively.  The mortgage loan portfolio, as a percentage of
total invested assets, has decreased to 11.7% as of December 31, 1994, from
14.1% as of December 31, 1993. It is anticipated that mortgages as a percentage
of total invested assets will decline further, but at a slower rate, as new
mortgage investments and refinances in selected markets will partially offset
prepayments and scheduled maturities.  Management establishes allowances for
mortgage loans based upon a review of individual loans and the overall loan
portfolio, considering the value of the underlying collateral.  UNUM uses a
comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each
mortgage loan and to target specific properties for inspection and reevaluation.


Overall, management believes that its mortgage loan portfolio is well
diversified geographically and among property types.  UNUM's incidence of new
problem mortgage loans declined in 1994 as overall economic activity improved
modestly, and many of the real estate markets in which UNUM has mortgage loans
stabilized.  Foreclosure activity and new reserve additions remained modest in
1994; however, management continues to expect additional delinquencies and
problem loans in the future.  Management believes the allowance provided on
mortgage loans as of December 31, 1994, is adequate to cover probable losses.

Restructured loans are defined by UNUM as loans whose terms have been modified
to interest rates less than market at the time of restructure and are currently
expected to perform pursuant to such modified terms.  UNUM modifies loans to
protect its investment and only when it is anticipated that the borrower will be
able to meet the modified terms.  As of December 31, 1994, restructured mortgage
loans totaled $73.6 million, as compared with $65.9 million at December 31,
1993.  Interest lost on restructured loans was not material in 1994, 1993 or
1992.

Problem loans are defined as mortgage loans that were delinquent 60 days or more
on a contract delinquency basis.  Mortgage loans in the amount of $22.3 million
and $26.1 million, both representing 1.8% of the mortgage loan portfolio, were
delinquent 60 days or more on a contract delinquency basis, and were accounted
for on a nonaccrual basis at December 31, 1994, and 1993, respectively.
Interest lost on problem loans was not material in 1994, 1993 or 1992.


<PAGE>

Potential problem loans are defined by UNUM as current and performing loans with
which management has some concerns about the ability of the borrower to comply
with present loan terms and whose book value exceeds the market value of the
underlying collateral.  Loans in this category amounted to $36.2 million at
December 31, 1994, versus $92.7 million at December 31, 1993.  Active asset
management contributed to the decline in this category during 1994.

Realized investment losses related to restructured and problem mortgage loans in
1994 amounted to $8.5 million, compared with $4.8 million and $26.5 million for
1993 and 1992, respectively.  Problem and potential problem mortgage loans as of
December 31, 1994, are not expected to have a significant impact on UNUM's
results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.

REAL ESTATE:

At December 31, 1994, investment real estate and real estate held for sale
amounted to $190.8 million and $31.0 million, respectively.  This compares with
$193.5 million of investment real estate and $24.7 million of real estate held
for sale at December 31, 1993.  UNUM has limited the growth of its real estate
exposure, as a percentage of invested assets, through an active sales program.
UNUM sold $25.4 million and $40.5 million of real estate at 103% and 105% of
carrying value during 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Real estate which meets certain investment criteria and is intended to be held
long-term is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Real estate that
has been acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of
foreclosure.  Real estate held for sale is included in other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and is valued net of an allowance which reduces the
carrying value to the lower of fair value less estimated costs to sell, or cost.
Occasionally, investment real estate is reclassified and revalued as real estate
held for sale when it no longer meets UNUM's investment criteria.  Additions to
allowances for probable losses related to real estate held for sale resulted in
realized investment losses of $0.8 million, $18.8 million and $7.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Given the current real estate environment, additional foreclosures are
anticipated, but at a reduced level from the early 1990s.  Current and
anticipated real estate acquired through foreclosure is not expected to have a
significant affect on UNUM's results of operations, liquidity, or capital
resources.


<PAGE>

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

UNUM's businesses produce positive cash flows, which are invested primarily in
intermediate, fixed maturity investments intended to reflect the nature of
anticipated cash obligations of insurance benefit payments and insurance
contract maturities and to optimize investment returns at appropriate risk
levels. To meet unexpected cash requirements and liquidity needs, UNUM maintains
part of its investment portfolio in fixed maturities classified as available for
sale, equity securities, cash and short-term investments.

From time to time, dividend payments, which may be subject to approval by
insurance regulatory authorities, are made from UNUM's affiliates and insurance
subsidiaries to UNUM Corporation.  These dividends, along with other funds, are
used to service the needs of UNUM Corporation including: debt service, common
stock dividends, stock repurchase, administrative costs and corporate
development.  Income determined using statutory accounting is one of the major
determinants of an insurance company's dividend capacity to its parent in the
following fiscal year.  Statutory accounting rules and practices, which differ
in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles, are mandated
by regulators in an insurance company's state of domicile.

In 1994, UNUM America's disability businesses were adversely affected by
unfavorable claims experience as discussed in the Employee Benefits and
Individual Disability segments.  As described in the Individual Disability
segment, UNUM America strengthened reserves for existing claims related to the
traditional non-cancellable individual disability products.  As a result, UNUM
America recognized a statutory after-tax charge of $69.6 million in third
quarter 1994.  These factors caused the 1994 statutory income of UNUM America to
be significantly reduced to $39.2 million, as compared with $165.2 million in
1993.

As a result of this reduction in UNUM America's statutory earnings, the amount
available under current law for payment of dividends to UNUM Corporation from
all U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries during 1995, without state insurance
regulatory approval, decreased to approximately $81.3 million, as compared with
$176.8 million for 1994.  UNUM Corporation also has the ability to draw a
dividend of approximately $30 million from its United Kingdom based affiliate,
UNUM Limited, subject to certain U.S. tax consequences.


<PAGE>

Effective December 13, 1994, management expanded UNUM Corporation's lines of
credit with a new committed revolving credit facility totaling $500 million,
expiring on October 1, 1999, which replaced previously existing facilities
totaling $300 million.  UNUM Corporation's commercial paper program is supported
by the revolving credit facility, and is available for general liquidity needs,
capital expansion, acquisitions and stock repurchase.  The committed revolving
credit facility contains certain covenants which, among other provisions,
require maintenance of certain levels of stockholders' equity and limits on
level of debt.

In September 1993, UNUM announced the filing of an omnibus shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which became effective on
October 8, 1993, relating to $450 million of securities (including debt
securities, preferred stock, common stock and other securities).  On October 8,
1993, UNUM filed a prospectus supplement to establish a $250 million medium-term
note program under the shelf registration.  The medium-term note program and the
unsold portion of the shelf registration carry ratings of "A1" (Medium Quality)
and "(P)A1" (Medium Quality), respectively, from Moody's Investors Service, and
"A+" (Strong) from Standard & Poor's Corporation.  The unsold portion of the
shelf registration relating to subordinated debt and preferred stock carries
ratings of "(P)A2" (Medium Quality) and "(P)"a1"" (Upper-Medium Quality),
respectively, from Moody's Investors Service.

At December 31, 1994, UNUM had short-term and long-term debt totaling $246.6
million and $182.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 1994, approximately
$280 million was available for additional financing under the existing revolving
credit facility and approximately $390 million of investment grade debt
instruments was available for issuance under the shelf registration.  On
February 28, 1995, UNUM borrowed $100 million under the revolving credit
facility, which was infused into UNUM America in exchange for surplus
debentures.  Repayment of principal and interest on the surplus debentures is
subject to state insurance regulatory approval.  Contingent upon market
conditions and corporate needs, management may refinance short-term notes
payable with longer term securities.

In September 1993, UNUM announced the resumption of a program to repurchase its
common stock pursuant to an existing Board of Directors' resolution.  On
February 11, 1994, UNUM's Board of Directors voted to expand UNUM's
authorization to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares, bringing the total
number of shares authorized for repurchase to 44.0 million shares. Since the
resumption of the stock repurchase program, UNUM has acquired 7.6 million shares
through December 31, 1994, in the open market at an aggregate cost of $375.8
million that was primarily funded through additional borrowings. This share
repurchase contributed to the decrease in the number of shares outstanding at
December 31, 1994, to 72.4 million, from 76.0 million at December 31, 1993.
Prior to the resumption of this repurchase program, UNUM had not acquired any
shares in the open market since 1990.  At December 31, 1994, approximately 2.7
million outstanding shares remained authorized for repurchase.


<PAGE>

During 1994 and 1993, withdrawals of contracts reported in the Other Operations
segment, including contract terminations, payments to participants and transfers
to other carriers, were approximately $130 million and $309 million,
respectively.  Withdrawals during 1994 and 1993 were at levels expected by
management and reflect the run-off nature of these closed blocks of businesses.
UNUM manages liquidity objectives by including certain conditions in pension
contracts which prohibit or restrict availability of funds.

UNUM was committed at December 31, 1994, to purchase fixed maturities and other
invested assets in the amount of $37.5 million.  Independent of the cash flows
of UNUM Corporation, management anticipates that the operating cash flows of the
subsidiaries of UNUM Corporation will be sufficient to meet benefit obligations,
planned investment commitments and operational needs of those companies.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

Inflation is one of the factors that has increased the need for insurance.  Many
policyholders who once had adequate insurance programs at lower coverage levels
have increased their disability insurance coverage to provide the same relative
financial benefits and protection.

Changing interest rates, which are traditionally linked to changes in inflation,
affect UNUM's level of discounted reserves. While rising interest rates are
beneficial when investing current cash flows, they can also reduce the fair
value of existing fixed rate long-term investments.  In addition, lower interest
rates can lead to early payoffs and refinancing of some of UNUM's fixed rate
investments.  Management generally invests in fixed rate instruments that are
structured to limit the exposure to such reinvestment risk.

RATINGS

A.M. Best Company ("Best's"), Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") and Standard
& Poor's Corporation ("S&P") are among the third parties that provide UNUM
independent assessments of its overall financial position.  Ratings from these
agencies for financial strength and claims-paying ability are available for the
United States domiciled insurance company subsidiaries rather than on a
consolidated basis, since the financial information used to develop the ratings
is based on statutory accounting practices in the United States.

UNUM's largest affiliate, UNUM Life Insurance Company of America ("UNUM
America"), had its Best's financial strength rating affirmed at "A++"
(Superior), the highest rating assigned by Best's, in May 1994.  Best's again
affirmed UNUM America's "A++" rating in November 1994.  In January 1995, S&P
completed its review of UNUM America and lowered its claims-paying ability
rating to "AA" (Excellent) from "AA+" (Excellent).  According to S&P, the
downgrade was a result of pressures on risk-adjusted capitalization and higher
financial leverage, due in part to lower profitability.  In March 1995, Moody's
completed its review of UNUM America and lowered its financial strength


<PAGE>

rating to "Aa2" (Excellent) from "Aa1" (Excellent) citing the outlook for UNUM's
group long term disability business as well as UNUM's increasing leverage and
moderately reduced financial flexibility.

First UNUM Life Insurance Company ("First UNUM") also had its financial strength
rating reaffirmed by Best's in May 1994, at "A+" (Superior).   In January 1995,
S&P lowered First UNUM's claims-paying ability rating to "AA" (Excellent) from
"AA+" (Excellent).  In March 1995, Moody's confirmed First UNUM's "Aa2"
(Excellent) financial strength rating.

Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company ("Colonial Life") had its Best's
financial strength rating affirmed as "A+" (Superior) in May 1994.  In March
1994, S&P assigned an "AA-" (Excellent) claims-paying ability rating to
Colonial.  Subsequently, in January 1995, S&P affirmed Colonial's "AA-"
(Excellent) rating.  In March 1995, Moody's lowered Colonial's financial
strength rating to "Aa3" (Excellent) from "Aa2" (Excellent).

Commercial Life Insurance Company had its Best's financial strength rating
upgraded to "A" (Excellent) in July 1994.

UNUM Corporation has the following debt ratings based on consolidated financial
information under generally accepted accounting principles.  In January 1995,
S&P lowered the senior debt rating of UNUM Corporation to "A+" (Strong) from
"AA" (Very Strong), and lowered the commercial paper rating to  "A-1" (Strong)
from "A-1+" (Extremely Strong).  In March 1995, Moody's lowered UNUM
Corporation's senior debt rating to "A1" (Medium Quality) from "Aa3" (High
Quality) and confirmed the commercial paper rating of "P-1" (Superior Ability).

INSURANCE REGULATION

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted a set of Risk-Based
Capital standards for the life and health insurance industry, which became
effective in 1993.  These Risk-Based Capital standards are one way to measure
the risk that insurance companies assume in the course of conducting insurance
and investment activities.

The Risk-Based Capital standards for life insurance companies are based on a
formula that establishes capital requirements relating to existing asset default
risk, insurance risk, interest rate (asset/liability mismatch) risk and business
risk.  A company's Total Adjusted Capital (statutory capital, surplus, and Asset
Valuation Reserve plus certain other adjustments) is compared to the Authorized
Control Level ("ACL") of Risk-Based Capital produced by the formula.  Subject to
certain trend tests to determine the change in the ACL ratio from year to year,
companies with Total Adjusted Capital above 200% of ACL are assumed to be
adequately capitalized.  Companies below 200% of ACL are identified as requiring
various levels of regulatory action ranging from increased information
requirements for companies between 150% and 200% of ACL, to mandatory control by
the domiciliary insurance department for companies below 70% of ACL.

<PAGE>

At December 31, 1994, the ACL ratios for UNUM America, First UNUM, Colonial Life
and Commercial Life were approximately 305%, 355%, 440% and 380%, respectively.
This compares with ACL ratios at December 31, 1993, of approximately 350%, 390%,
450% and 380%, respectively.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

UNUM periodically uses common derivative financial instruments such as options,
futures and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain risks associated with
future investments and certain payments denominated in foreign currencies,
primarily British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.  These
derivative financial instruments are used to protect UNUM from the effect of
market fluctuations in interest and exchange rates between the contract date and
the date on which the hedged transaction occurs.  UNUM does not intend to hold
derivative financial instruments for the purpose of trading.

At December 31, 1994, UNUM had no open derivative financial instruments.  At
December 31, 1993, UNUM held interest rate futures contracts with commitments to
purchase government securities with total par values of $207.0 million.  In
using these instruments, UNUM is subject to the off-balance-sheet risk that the
counterparties to the transactions will fail to completely perform as
contracted.  UNUM manages this risk by only entering into contracts with highly
rated institutions and listed exchanges.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial
Accounting Standard ("FAS") No. 114 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan," which defines the principles to measure and record a loan when it is
probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

In October 1994, the FASB issued FAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures," which amends FAS 114
to allow a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing, measuring and
displaying interest income on an impaired loan.  UNUM will adopt FAS 114 and FAS
118 effective January 1, 1995.  Adoption of FAS 114 and FAS 118 is not expected
to have a material effect on UNUM's results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of UNUM Corporation and
subsidiaries ("UNUM") have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted
accounting principles for stock life insurance companies.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UNUM Corporation
and subsidiaries.  Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

RECLASSIFICATION

Certain December 31, 1993, and 1992 amounts have been reclassified in 1994 for
comparative purposes.

INVESTMENTS

Investments are reported as follows:

-     Fixed maturities held to maturity (certain bonds and redeemable preferred
      stocks) - principally at amortized cost, less an allowance for probable
      losses.
-     Fixed maturities available for sale (certain bonds and redeemable
      preferred stocks) - commencing January 1, 1994, at fair value.  Prior to
      January 1, 1994, at lower of aggregate amortized cost less an allowance
      for probable losses, or fair value.  See Note 3 "Investments" for a
      discussion of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115.
-     Equity securities available for sale (common stocks and non-redeemable
      preferred stocks) - at fair value.
-     Mortgage loans - at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses.
-     Real estate - at cost less accumulated depreciation.
-     Policy loans - at unpaid principal balance.
-     Other long-term investments - at cost plus UNUM's equity in undistributed
      net earnings since acquisition.
-     Short-term investments - at cost.

Fixed maturities that UNUM has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are classified as held to maturity.

Certain fixed maturities and equity securities are classified as available for
sale as they may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant
prepayment risk, liquidity and capital needs, or other similar economic
factors. Related unrealized holding gains and losses, net of deferred taxes,
are reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.

UNUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

INVESTMENTS (Continued)

Real estate held for sale, which is included in other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, is valued at the lower of fair value less
estimated costs to sell, or cost.  UNUM has provided an allowance for probable
losses on real estate held for sale which reduces the carrying value of the
asset to fair value.

If a decline in fair value of an invested asset is considered to be other than
temporary, the investment is reduced to its net realizable value and the
reduction is accounted for as a realized investment loss.  Subsequent increases
and decreases in fair value, if not an other than temporary impairment, of
available for sale securities are reported in a separate component of
stockholders' equity, net of deferred taxes.

UNUM discontinues the accrual of investment income on invested assets when it
is determined that collectability is doubtful.

Realized investment gains and losses, which are determined on the basis of
specific identification and include adjustments for allowances for probable
losses, are reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Purchases and sales of short-term financial instruments are part of investing
activities and not necessarily a part of the cash management program.
Therefore, short-term financial instruments are classified as investments in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are included as investing activities in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Gains or losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are deferred and
included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities.  Gains or
losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated
transactions are also deferred and recognized in the carrying amount of the
underlying asset or liability when the hedged transaction occurs.

RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES

Group insurance premiums are recognized as income over the period to which the
premiums relate.  Individual disability premiums are recognized as income when
due.  Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums to result in
recognition of profits over the life of the contracts.  This association is
accomplished by recording a provision for future policy benefits and unpaid
claims and claim expenses, and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES (Continued):

For retirement and universal life products, premium and other policy fee
revenue consists of charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration,
and surrenders assessed during the period.  Charges related to services to be
performed in the future are deferred until earned.  The amounts received in
excess of premium and fees are recorded as deposits and included in other
policyholder funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Benefits and expenses
include benefit claims in excess of related account balances, interest credited
at various rates and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

The costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are related primarily to
the production of new business, have been deferred to the extent such costs are
deemed recoverable from future profits. Such costs include commissions, certain
costs of policy issue and underwriting, and certain variable field office
expenses.

For individual disability, group disability, and group life and health
business, the costs are amortized in proportion to expected future premiums.
For universal life and certain retirement products, the costs are amortized in
proportion to estimated gross profits from interest margins, mortality and
other elements of performance under the contracts.  Amortization is adjusted
periodically to reflect differences between actual experience and original
assumptions, with any resulting changes reflected in current operating
results. The amounts deferred and amortized were as follows:

RESERVES FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS

Reserves for future policy benefits are calculated by the net-level premium
method, and are based on UNUM's expected morbidity, mortality and interest
rate assumptions at the time a policy is issued.  These reserves represent the
portion of premiums received, accumulated with interest and held to provide
for claims that have not yet been incurred.  Reserves for group insurance
policies consist primarily of unearned premiums.

The interest rates used in the calculation of reserves for future policy
benefits at December 31, 1994, and 1993, principally ranged from:

Individual disability                   5.5% to 9.5%              7.0% to 9.5%
Individual life                         5.0% to 9.0%              5.0% to 9.0%
Individual accident and health          5.0% to 9.0%              6.0% to 11.8%
Individual and group annuities          5.0% to 9.0%              5.0% to 9.0%
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Certain reserve calculations are based on interest rates within these ranges
graded down over periods from 15 to 20 years.

RESERVES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES

Unpaid claims and claim expense reserves represent the amount estimated to
fund claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but
not reported.  Reserves for unpaid claims are estimated based on UNUM's
historical experience and other actuarial assumptions which consider the
effects of current developments, anticipated trends, risk management programs
and renewal actions.  Many factors affect actuarial calculations of claim
reserves, including but not limited to interest rates, and current and
anticipated incidence rates, recovery rates, and economic and societal
conditions.  Reserve estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed
and updated with any resulting adjustments to reserves reflected in current
operating results.  Given the complexity of the reserving process, the
ultimate liability may be more or less than such estimates indicate.

The interest rates used in the calculation of disability product reserves at
December 31, 1994, and 1993, were principally as follows:

The interest rate used to discount the disability reserves is a composite of
the yields on assets specifically matched with each block of business.

For other accident and health business, reserves are based on projections of
historical claims run-out patterns.

Activity in the liability for unpaid claims and claim expenses is summarized

</TABLE>

The increase in incurrals related to prior years was $436.0 million, $238.0
million, and $126.8 million (net of reinsurance), for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  These increases were primarily the result of interest accrued
on reserves, changes in reserve estimates and assumptions, and changes in
foreign exchange rates.  Due to the long-term claims payment pattern of some
of UNUM's businesses, certain reserves, particularly disability, are
discounted for interest.

Interest accrued on reserves increased prior years' incurrals by approximately
$267 million, $237 million and $225 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Approximately $154 million of the increase in prior years'
incurrals in 1994 was primarily related to changes in reserve estimates and
assumptions of morbidity, mortality and expense costs of the group long term
and individual disability reserves, which were affected by the third quarter
1994 reserve strengthening.  Changes in estimates of morbidity, mortality and
expense costs caused an increase in prior years' incurrals of approximately
$6 million in 1993 and a decrease of approximately $46 million in 1992.

RESERVES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES (Continued)

Foreign exchange translations, primarily related to the disability reserves of
UNUM's United Kingdom based affiliate, UNUM Limited, caused prior years'
incurrals to increase by approximately $15 million in 1994, and decrease by
approximately $5 million and $52 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")
No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts," which eliminated the practice by insurance
enterprises of reporting assets and liabilities relating to reinsured
contracts net of the effects of reinsurance.  Since UNUM did not restate its
financial statements upon adoption of FAS 113, reserve balances prior to
December 31, 1993, are shown net of reinsurance recoverables.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE

During 1994, UNUM increased reserves for existing claims by $83.3 million and
established a reserve for estimated future losses of $109.1 million.  These
increased reserves reflect management's current expectations of morbidity
trends for the existing individual disability business, as reported in the
Individual Disability segment.  This change in accounting estimate resulted in
an increase to benefits to policyholders in the Consolidated Statement of
Income of $192.4 million, and a decrease to net income of $125.1 million, or
$1.69 per share.

OTHER POLICYHOLDER FUNDS

Other policyholder funds are liabilities for investment-type contracts and
represent customer deposits plus interest credited to those deposits at
various rates.

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

Certain assets of UNUM's defined benefit plans, 401(k) contracts and tax
sheltered annuity contracts are in separate accounts that are pooled
investment funds of securities.  Investment income and realized gains and
losses on these accounts accrue directly to the contractholders.  Assets,
carried at market value, and liabilities of the separate accounts are shown
separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The assets of the separate
accounts are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out
of any other business of UNUM.

ACCOUNTING FOR PARTICIPATING INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE

Participating policies issued by the former Union Mutual Life Insurance
Company ("Union Mutual") prior to UNUM's conversion to a stock life insurance
company on November 14, 1986, will remain participating as long as they remain
in force.  A Participation Fund Account ("PFA") has been established for the
sole benefit of all of Union Mutual's individual participating life and
annuity policies and contracts.

ACCOUNTING FOR PARTICIPATING INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE (Continued)

The assets of the PFA are to provide for the benefit, dividend and certain
expense obligations of the participating individual life insurance policies
and annuity contracts. This line of business participates in the experience of
the PFA and its operations have been excluded from the Consolidated Statements
of Income.  The PFA represents approximately 2.5% and 3.0% of total assets and
3.0% and 3.5% of total liabilities at December 31, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and deferred
income taxes, which result from differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates
and laws.  Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated
earnings of UNUM's foreign subsidiaries.  These earnings would become subject
to U.S. tax if remitted to UNUM Corporation.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate earnings
per share was approximately 74,158,000, 78,779,000 and 78,542,000 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.  The assumed exercise of outstanding stock
options does not result in a material dilution of earnings per share.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair values are based on quoted market prices, when available.  In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques.  These valuation techniques
require management to develop a significant number of assumptions, including
discount rates and estimates of future cash flow.  Derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets or to
disclosures by other companies with similar financial instruments.  These fair
value disclosures do not purport to be the amount which could be realized in
immediate settlement of the financial instrument.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value
disclosures for financial instruments:

FIXED MATURITIES:  Fair values for fixed maturities are based on quoted market
prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services
or, in the case of private placements, are estimated by discounting expected
future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield, credit
quality and maturity of the investments.

EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE:  Fair values for equity securities
available for sale are based on quoted market prices and are reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at these values.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

MORTGAGE LOANS:  Fair values for mortgage loans are estimated based on
discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for
similar mortgage loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings and
maturities.  Mortgage loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for
purposes of the calculations.

POLICY LOANS:  Fair values for policy loans approximate the carrying amounts
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH AND ACCRUED INVESTMENT INCOME:  Fair values for
these instruments approximate the carrying amounts reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

INVESTMENT-TYPE INSURANCE CONTRACTS:  Fair values for liabilities under
investment-type insurance contracts with no defined maturities are the amounts
payable on demand after surrender charges at the balance sheet date.  Fair
values for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts with defined
maturities are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on
interest rates that would be offered currently for similar contracts with
maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.

The estimated fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts
(investment-type and other than investment-type) are taken into consideration
in UNUM's overall management of interest rate risk, which minimizes exposure
to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with
amounts due under insurance contracts.

INDIVIDUAL ANNUITIES AND SUPPLEMENTARY CONTRACTS NOT INVOLVING LIFE
CONTINGENCIES:  Fair values approximate the carrying amounts reported in other
policyholder funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTES PAYABLE:  Fair values of short-term borrowings approximate the carrying
amount.  Fair values of long-term notes are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses based on UNUM's current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  Fair values for off-balance-sheet
financial instruments are based on current settlement values.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan" which defines the principles to measure and record a
loan when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

In October 1994, the FASB issued FAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures," which amends FAS
114 to allow a creditor to use existing methods for recognizing, measuring and
displaying interest income on an impaired loan.  UNUM will adopt FAS 114 and
FAS 118 effective January 1, 1995.  Adoption of FAS 114 and FAS 118 is not
expected to have a material effect on UNUM's results of operations or
financial position.

NOTE 2.  COLONIAL MERGER

On December 3, 1992, UNUM and Colonial Companies, Inc. ("Colonial"), signed a
definitive merger agreement.  On March 26, 1993, Colonial Class A common stock
shareholders voted to approve the merger.  Under the agreement, UNUM exchanged
0.731 shares of its common stock for each share of Colonial Class A and
Class B common stock outstanding on March 26, 1993.  UNUM issued approximately
11.4 million shares of common stock from treasury in connection with the
merger.  In addition, outstanding options to acquire shares of Colonial
Class B common stock were converted into options to acquire shares of UNUM
common stock.  The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 1993, included a $9.6 million
charge, or $0.12 per share, for expenses incurred to effect the merger.

NOTE 3.  INVESTMENTS

Effective January 1, 1994, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
which specified the accounting and reporting for certain investments in equity
securities and for all investments in debt securities.  UNUM adopted the
provisions of FAS 115 for these investments held as of or acquired after
January 1, 1994, which are classified and accounted for as follows:

-   Fixed maturities that UNUM has the positive intent and ability to hold to
    maturity are classified as "held to maturity" and are reported at
    amortized cost, less an allowance for probable losses.
-   Fixed maturities and equity securities classified as "available for sale"
    are reported at fair value.  Related unrealized holding gains and losses,
    net of deferred taxes, are reported in a separate component of
    stockholders' equity.

Upon the adoption of FAS 115, UNUM increased unrealized gains on available for
sale securities included in stockholders' equity on January 1, 1994, by $41.8
million (net of deferred taxes of $22.5 million) to reflect the unrealized
holding gains on fixed maturities classified as available for sale which were
previously carried at amortized cost.  In accordance with FAS 115, prior year
consolidated financial statements and disclosures have not been restated to
reflect the change in accounting principle.  UNUM reclassified certain
fixed maturities from held to maturity to available for sale on January 1,
1994, in connection with the adoption of FAS 115.

The following tables summarize the components of investment income, realized
investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized investment gains (losses):

FIXED MATURITIES (Continued)

During fourth quarter 1994, UNUM sold fixed maturities of five issuers
classified as held to maturity with an amortized cost of $49.8 million
due to evidence of significant unexpected deterioration of the issuers'
creditworthiness.  These sales resulted in a net realized loss of $3.0 million.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1994, cumulative gross unrealized investment gains on equity
securities available for sale totaled $158.7 million and losses totaled
$(23.0) million.

MORTGAGE LOANS

Restructured mortgage loans at amortized cost amounted to $73.6 million and
$65.9 million at December 31, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Troubled debt
restructurings represent loans that are refinanced with terms more favorable
to the borrower.  Interest foregone on these loans was not material for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 or 1992.

OTHER

Real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt cumulatively amounts to $119.3
million at December 31, 1994.  Real estate held for sale amounted to $31.0
million at December 31, 1994, and $24.7 million at December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1994, bonds with an amortized cost of $16.1 million, real
estate with a depreciated cost of $4.7 million and no mortgage loans were
non-income producing for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994.  Interest
lost on these investments was not material in 1994, 1993 or 1992.

UNUM was committed at December 31, 1994, to purchase fixed maturities and
other invested assets in the amount of $37.5 million.

NOTE 5.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

UNUM periodically uses common derivative financial instruments such as options,
futures and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain risks associated with
future investments and certain payments denominated in foreign currencies,
primarily British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.  These
derivative financial instruments are used to protect UNUM from the effect of
market fluctuations in interest and exchange rates between the contract date
and the date on which the hedged transaction occurs.  UNUM does not intend
to hold derivative financial instruments for the purpose of trading.

At December 31, 1994, UNUM had no open derivative financial instruments.  At
December 31, 1993, UNUM held interest rate futures contracts with commitments
to purchase government securities with total par values of $207.0 million.  In
using these instruments, UNUM is subject to the off-balance-sheet risk that the
counterparties to the transactions will fail to completely perform as
contracted.  UNUM manages this risk by only entering into contracts with highly
rated institutions and listed exchanges.

NOTE 6.  REINSURANCE

UNUM, through its life insurance subsidiaries, is involved in both the cession
and assumption of reinsurance with other companies.  Risks are reinsured with
other companies to reduce UNUM's exposure to large losses and permit recovery
of a portion of direct losses.  UNUM remains liable to the insured for the
payment of policy benefits if the reinsurers cannot meet their obligations
under the reinsurance agreements.  Deferred policy acquisition costs,
premiums and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other companies.

Effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 113,
"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts," which eliminated the practice by insurance enterprises of reporting
assets and liabilities relating to reinsured contracts net of the effects of
reinsurance.  The standard required prepaid reinsurance premiums and
reinsurance receivables, for amounts to be recovered, to be reported as
assets.  It also prescribed conditions required for a contract with a
reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance and defined accounting standards
for short-duration and long-duration reinsurance contracts.  As permitted,
consolidated financial statements prior to adoption have not been restated.
The effect of the adoption on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was an increase
in other assets of $80.0 million and a corresponding increase in future policy
benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses.

For the years ended December 31, 1994, and 1993, recoveries recognized under
reinsurance agreements reduced benefits to policyholders by $53.3 million and
$28.9 million, respectively.

Reinsurance premiums ceded and assumed were $51.5 million and $136.2 million,
respectively, for 1992.

NOTE 7.  BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In the fourth quarter of 1994, UNUM recorded pretax charges totaling $14.4
million, or $0.13 per share, which were reflected as operating expenses in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.  Of this total, the Individual Disability
segment recorded $12.3 million related to the restructuring of the individual
disability business and resulting consolidation of home office operations in
UNUM America, which was comprised of $7.1 million for severance costs for 150
field and 150 home office employees and $5.2 million for exit costs of certain
leased facilities and equipment, expiring through 1998.  The remaining $2.1
million, recorded in the Employee Benefits segment, was for termination
benefits for approximately 100 employees related to the acceleration of
organizational changes within UNUM America.  All employee related costs are
expected to be paid by the end of 1995.

During 1992, UNUM released the restructuring reserve remaining for the costs of
withdrawal and reassignment of employees associated with the 401(k) business in
excess of amounts incurred, since actual costs were less than expected, which
resulted in a pretax gain of $5.3 million.  The gain associated with the
release of this restructuring reserve reduced operating expenses in the 1992
Consolidated Statement of Income.

PENSION PLANS

UNUM has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all domestic employees, excluding employees of Colonial Companies, Inc., and
Duncanson & Holt, Inc.  The plan provides benefits based on the employee's
years of service and compensation during the highest five consecutive years
out of the last ten years of employment.  UNUM funds the plan in accordance
with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended. Plan assets consist primarily of group annuity contracts and
include approximately 224,392 shares of UNUM Corporation common stock.

NOTE 8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)

PENSION PLANS (Continued)

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation
levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligation were 8.25% and 5.20%, respectively, at December 31, 1994, and 7.25%
and 4.70%, respectively, at December 31, 1993.  The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 9.0% in 1994 and 8.25% in 1993 and 1992.  Prior year
service costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over expected
employment periods for active employees.

UNUM also administers certain supplemental retirement plans for eligible
employees and officers and certain other pension plans.  The cost of these
plans was not significant for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS

UNUM has several retirement savings and profit sharing plans for substantially
all full-time and part-time employees who work 1,000 hours a year and have been
employed for at least one year.  Dependent upon which plan the employee
participates in, eligible employees may contribute primarily up to 10% of their
annual salary, and UNUM matches a portion of each employee's contribution up to
6% of the employee's bi-weekly compensation.  Participants may become 100%
vested immediately upon becoming eligible to participate, or incrementally over
a five year period.  In 1994, 1993 and 1992, expense for these plans amounted
to $8.4 million, $8.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

UNUM provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees and covered dependents.  Substantially all domestic employees of UNUM
may become eligible for these benefits if they meet minimum age and service
requirements, if they are eligible for retirement benefits and if they agree to
contribute a portion of the cost.  UNUM has the right to modify or terminate
these benefits.  The underlying plans are not currently funded.

Effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions," which changed the method for recognition of the cost of these
benefits from a cash basis to an accrual basis over the years in which the
employees render the related services.  UNUM elected to immediately recognize
the FAS 106 liability at January 1, 1993, of $48.8 million as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, which decreased net income by $32.1 million, or
$0.40 per share, during 1993.

Under UNUM's plans, the cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to
increase 10.00% and 10.75% for retirees less than 65 years old, and 7.50% and
8.25% for retirees 65 years and older for 1995.  These rates are assumed to
decrease incrementally to 5.50% and 6.25% by 2001, and remain at that level
thereafter.  The weighted average discount rates used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefits obligation were 8.00% and 8.25%, at
December 31, 1994, and 7.25% and 7.50%, at December 31, 1993.  The rates of
increase in future compensation levels used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefits obligation were 5.2% and 4.7%, at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

At December 31, 1994, a 1% increase in the trend rate for health care costs
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation by $13.4
million and postretirement benefits expense by $1.8 million.

NOTE 9.  OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS

LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN

The 1990 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("Incentive Plan") provides for
granting of restricted shares of UNUM Corporation common stock to key officers.
The Incentive Plan also provides for granting of options to officers,
non-employee directors of UNUM Corporation and key employees, to purchase UNUM
Corporation common stock over ten years at a price not less than 100% of the
fair market value on the date of grant.  The maximum number of shares reserved
for issuance under the Incentive Plan was 6,800,000 in 1994 and 1993, and
3,500,000 in 1992. At December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, 2,511,145 shares,
3,316,734 shares, and 1,006,684 shares, respectively, were available for grant
under the Incentive Plan.

The restriction period for each restricted stock award under the Incentive Plan
is in excess of three years, with the restrictions lapsing as a result of the
achievement of prescribed financial performance objectives during each three
year period, with the exception of 10,000 shares of restricted stock granted in
1994 on which restrictions will lapse on January 6, 1998, provided the grantee
remains continuously in the employ of UNUM.  Plan participants are entitled to
cash dividends and voting rights on their respective shares.  In 1994,
restrictions lapsed on 80,800 shares granted for the 1991 - 1993 performance
period.  All other restricted stock shares issued remained subject to
restrictions.

The market value of the restricted shares issued under the Incentive Plan has
been recorded as deferred compensation and is included as a reduction of
stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The 1987 Executive Stock Option Plan ("Option Plan") provided for granting to
officers and key employees options to purchase UNUM Corporation common stock
over ten years at a price not less than 100% of the fair market value on the
date of grant.  Options outstanding under the Option Plan are included in the
summary of stock options.

Beginning in 1991, certain officers were granted limited stock appreciation

optionee the right to receive payment upon a change in control as defined in
the plans equal to the higher of the excess of the highest price per share
paid in connection with such change in control or the fair market value per
share, over the option price per share.  As an underlying stock option is
exercised, the LSARs are automatically canceled.  At December 31, 1994, 1993

LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN (Continued)

In connection with the March 26, 1993, merger with Colonial Companies, Inc.
("Colonial"), outstanding options to acquire shares of Colonial Class B common
stock were converted into options to acquire shares of UNUM common stock, and
are included in the preceding summary of stock options.  Pursuant to the
merger, no further options will be granted under the Colonial stock option
plans.

THE 1998 GOALS STOCK OPTION PLAN

The 1998 Goals Stock Option Plan ("1998 Option Plan") was introduced in January
1995.  The 1998 Option Plan provides for granting to all eligible employees up
to 150 options to purchase UNUM Corporation common stock at a price not less
than 100% of the fair market value on the date of the grant.  The options will
vest to the employee in January 2004; however, if UNUM achieves its 1998 goals,
vesting will be accelerated to early 1999.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLANS

UNUM has several annual incentive plans for certain employees and executive
officers, which provide additional compensation based on achievement of
predetermined annual corporate and affiliate financial and non-financial
goals. In 1994, 1993 and 1992, expense for these plans was $7.5 million,
$27.9 million and $24.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 10.  INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, UNUM adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which changed the method for calculating and
reporting deferred income taxes in the financial statements from the deferred
method to the liability method.  The liability method of accounting for income
taxes requires that deferred tax liabilities or assets at the end of each
period be determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are
actually paid or recovered.  Under this method, income tax will increase or
decrease in the same period in which a change in tax rate is enacted.  The
cumulative effect of this accounting change amounted to a $20.0 million
increase in net income, or $0.25 per share, for the year ended December 31,
1993.

On August 10, 1993, legislation was enacted to increase the federal corporate
income tax rate of 34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993.  The tax rate
increase resulted in a charge to net income totaling $11.4 million, or $0.15
per share, which included $3.6 million, or $0.05 per share, related to 1993
pretax income, and a $7.8 million, or $0.10 per share, adjustment to the
deferred income tax liability.

NOTE 10.  INCOME TAXES (Continued)

Deferred income taxes relating to cumulative net unrealized gains on available
for sale securities were $27.1 million, $79.4 million and $57.4 million at
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  At December 31, 1994, $5.0
million of the $27.1 million deferred income taxes was reflected in retained
earnings, while the remaining $22.1 million was netted against the unrealized
gains component of stockholders' equity.

As of December 31, 1994, deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on
the accumulated earnings of UNUM's foreign subsidiaries.  These earnings would
become subject to U.S. tax if remitted to UNUM Corporation.

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 ("1984 Act"), half the excess of the tax
basis gain from operations of a life insurance company over its taxable
investment income was currently taxable. The other half was set aside in a
Policyholders Surplus Account, together with certain special life insurance
company deductions.  The cumulative amount in the Policyholders Surplus Account
as of December 31, 1983, was frozen by the 1984 Act and amounted to $31.8
million at December 31, 1994.  Any direct or indirect distributions from this
account would be taxed at current tax rates; however, no provision has been
made for related taxes.  If the amount set aside in this account were taxed at
the current rate at December 31, 1994, for all life insurance subsidiaries,
the tax would have amounted to $11.1 million.

UNUM's Consolidated Statements of Income for 1994, 1993 and 1992, included the
following amounts of foreign income and related income tax expense:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1994, UNUM Corporation had a $500 million committed revolving
credit facility which expires on October 1, 1999.  UNUM's commercial paper
program is supported by the revolving credit facility and is available for
general liquidity needs, capital expansion, acquisitions or stock repurchase.
The committed revolving credit facility contains certain covenants which, among
other provisions, require maintenance of certain levels of stockholders' equity
and limits on level of debt.  The commercial paper outstanding at December 31,
1994, and 1993, had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.34% and
3.41%, respectively.

Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are as follows:  1995-$0; 1996-$16.2
million; 1997-$48.2 million; 1998-$29.8 million; 1999-$21.4 million;
thereafter-$66.5 million.

On February 28, 1995, UNUM borrowed $100 million under the revolving credit
facility, which was infused into UNUM America in exchange for surplus
debentures.  Repayment of principal and interest on the surplus debentures is
subject to state insurance regulatory approval.

NOTE 12.  CAPITAL STOCK

In September 1993, UNUM announced the resumption of a program to repurchase its
common stock pursuant to an existing Board of Directors' resolution.  On
February 11, 1994, UNUM's Board of Directors voted to expand UNUM's
authorization to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares, bringing the
total number of shares authorized for repurchase to 44.0 million shares. Since
the resumption of the stock repurchase program, UNUM has acquired approximately
7.6 million shares of its common stock through December 31, 1994, in the open
market at an aggregate cost of $375.8 million.  No shares were acquired in the
open market during 1992 or 1991.  At December 31, 1994, approximately 2.7
million shares remained authorized for repurchase.

NOTE 12.  CAPITAL STOCK (Continued)

Under the Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and Executive Stock Option Plan and
the plans of Colonial Companies, Inc. (see Note 9 "Option and Incentive
Plans"), 329,579 shares, 687,825 shares, and 894,747 shares were issued in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 13.  PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On March 13, 1992, UNUM's Board of Directors ordered redemption of the 1988
Rights Agreement and adopted a new Shareholder Rights Plan.  Shareholders of
record on March 23, 1992, received $0.05 for every two shares of common stock
held, which was distributed April 2, 1992.  The total amount of the redemption
was $1.7 million.

As a result of the adoption of a new Shareholder Rights Plan, a dividend
distribution was declared of one Right for each share of outstanding Common
Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 1992.
Each Right under certain specific circumstances entitles the holder to purchase
one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
at a purchase price of $150.

The Rights become exercisable at a specified time after (1) a person or group
acquires 10% or more of UNUM's Common Stock or (2) a tender or exchange offer
for 10% or more of UNUM's Common Stock.

The Rights expire at the close of business on March 13, 2002, unless earlier
redeemed by the Company under certain circumstances at a price of $0.01 per
Right.

NOTE 14.  DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

UNUM is subject to various state insurance regulatory restrictions that limit
the maximum amount of dividends available from its United States domiciled
insurance subsidiaries without prior approval.  Under current law, during 1995
approximately $81.3 million will be available for payment of dividends to UNUM
Corporation without state insurance regulatory approval.  Dividends in excess
of this amount may only be paid with state insurance regulatory approval.  The
aggregate statutory capital and surplus of the United States domiciled
insurance subsidiaries of UNUM Corporation was approximately $840.1 million
and $953.9 million, at December 31, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  The
aggregate statutory net income of UNUM Corporation's United States domiciled
insurance subsidiaries was approximately $70.4 million, $216.0 million and
$154.1 million for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  State insurance
regulatory authorities prescribe statutory accounting practices that differ in
certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles.  The
significant differences relate to deferred acquisition costs, deferred income
taxes, non-admitted asset balances, required investment risk reserves and
reserve calculation assumptions.

UNUM Corporation also has the ability to draw a dividend of approximately $30
million from its United Kingdom based affiliate, UNUM Limited, subject to
certain U.S. tax consequences.

NOTE 15.  LITIGATION

In the normal course of its business operations, UNUM is involved in litigation
from time to time with claimants, beneficiaries and others, and a number of
lawsuits were pending at December 31, 1994.  In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from this litigation is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or the
consolidated operating results of UNUM.

NOTE 16.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

UNUM reports its operations principally in six business segments:  Employee
Benefits, Related Businesses, Colonial Companies, Individual Disability,
Retirement Security and Other Operations.

Investment income and net realized investment gains are allocated to the
segments based on designation of ownership of assets identified to the
segments. Operating expenses are allocated to the segments based on direct
association with a product whenever possible.  If, however, the expense cannot
be readily associated with a particular product, the costs are allocated based
on ratios of the relative time spent, extent of usage or varying volume of
work performed for each segment.

The Employee Benefits segment includes group long term disability, group life
and other employee benefits products, including short term disability,
accidental death and dismemberment and dental insurance.  The Related
Businesses segment includes UNUM Limited in the United Kingdom, Commercial
Life Insurance Company, and reinsurance operations including Duncanson & Holt,
Inc.  The Colonial Companies segment includes Colonial Companies, Inc. and
subsidiaries, which offer payroll-deducted, voluntary employee benefits to
employees at their worksites.  The Individual Disability segment includes
disability income products.  The Retirement Security segment includes tax
sheltered annuities, long term care insurance and lifestyle security protection
products.  The Other Operations segment includes individual life insurance
business of UNUM Life Insurance Company of America, group medical operations,
guaranteed investment contracts, deposit administration accounts, and 401(k)
plans, all of which are no longer actively marketed by UNUM.  Corporate
includes transactions which are generally non-insurance related and expenses
incurred to effect the March 26, 1993, merger of UNUM and Colonial.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
         FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

    On  August 2, 1993, the Registrant determined not to reappoint Ernst & Young
L.L.P. as the  Registrant's independent  auditors for  1993. Also  on August  2,
1993,  the  Registrant  engaged Coopers  &  Lybrand L.L.P.  as  the Registrant's
independent auditors. In  connection with  the audit  of the  fiscal year  ended
December 31, 1992, and for the interim period dating from January 1, 1993, until
August 2, 1993, there were no disagreements between Ernst & Young L.L.P. and the
Registrant  on  any  matter  of accounting  principles  or  practices, financial
statements disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to
the satisfaction of Ernst  & Young L.L.P., would  have resulted in reference  or
disclosure in Ernst & Young L.L.P.'s reports.

    Ernst  & Young L.L.P.'s report for the  fiscal year ended December 31, 1992,
contained no adverse opinion, no disclaimer  of opinion and no qualification  or
modification   of  opinion  as  to   uncertainty,  audit  scope,  or  accounting
principles.

    The change of independent auditors was recommended by the Audit Committee of
the Registrant's Board of Directors and approved by the Board of Directors.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Directors and Stockholders
UNUM Corporation

    We  have  audited the  consolidated financial  statements and  the financial
statement schedules of UNUM Corporation and subsidiaries listed in Item 14(a) of
this Form 10-K as of and for the  years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.  These
consolidated  financial  statements and  financial  statement schedules  are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on  these consolidated financial  statements and financial  statement
schedules based on our audits.

    We  conducted  our audits  in  accordance with  generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable  assurance about  whether the  consolidated financial  statements are
free of material  misstatement. An audit  includes examining, on  a test  basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts  and disclosures in  the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used  and
significant  estimates made  by management,  as well  as evaluating  the overall
consolidated financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the 1994 and 1993 consolidated financial statements referred
to  above present fairly,  in all material  respects, the consolidated financial
position of UNUM Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and  1993,
and  the consolidated results of  their operations and their  cash flows for the
two years in the  period ended December 31,  1994, in conformity with  generally
accepted  accounting principles. In addition, in  our opinion, the 1994 and 1993
financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation  to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.

    As discussed in Notes 3, 8 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements,
the Corporation changed its method of accounting for certain investments in debt
securities in 1994 and its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions, and accounting for income taxes in 1993.

(5)  Investment income and net  realized investment gains  are allocated to  the
     segments  based on  designation of  ownership of  assets identified  to the
     segments. Operating expenses are allocated to the segments based on  direct
     association  with  a product  whenever possible.  If, however,  the expense
     cannot be  readily associated  with  a particular  product, the  costs  are
     allocated  based on ratios of  the relative time spent,  extent of usage or
     varying volume of work performed for each segment.

                    COLONIAL LIFE & ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO.
                          ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN


OBJECTIVES
1)    Provide meaningful incentive geared to the achievement of specific
      Colonial and UNUM  business goals.

2)    Maintain a highly competitive total pay opportunity that will support
      the attraction and retention of outstanding performers for key positions.

3)    Encourage an environment of shared vision and collaboration between
      UNUM Corporation and Colonial, as well as promote teamwork within
      Colonial.


PLAN ADMINISTRATION
The Colonial Board of Directors (hereafter referred to as "The Board") is
responsible for the administration of the Plan.  The Board may elect to delegate
Plan responsibilities to a committee.

All decisions made by The Board regarding Plan design, participation,
interpretation and payouts are final.

ELIGIBILITY
All regular full-time and regular part-time employees who are not participating
in another incentive or commission program may be eligible if they meet the
following criteria:

      1)    Are in a position at salary grade 18 or above, and

      2)    Are employed on or before October 1 of the Plan
            Year and are still employed at the end of the Plan Year,
            except in cases of death, disability or retirement, which
            are discussed in the "Termination of Employment" section.
            The Plan Year is defined as January 1 to December 31.

Participation in the Plan is not automatic.  Individual participants will be
recommended by senior management and approved by The Board, generally based on
their ability to directly and significantly impact the continued success of
Colonial and UNUM.  The Board has the discretion to initiate or discontinue
participation of any individual at any time for any reason.

<PAGE>

COMPONENTS
The Plan is based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of both financial
and business goals of Colonial and UNUM Corporation.

For determining payouts, the components are weighted as follows:

      Colonial Performance                      60%

      UNUM Corporation Performance              40%


DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Performance measures are established for each Plan Year as follows:

COLONIAL COMPONENT:
In consultation with UNUM Corporation's CEO, Colonial's senior management will
make a recommendation to The Board on appropriate performance measures for the
Plan year.

ENTERPRISE COMPONENT:
Determination of UNUM Enterprise performance measures is the responsibility of
the UNUM Corporation Board of Directors, in consultation with the CEO.

DETERMINATION OF TARGET AWARDS
UNUM Corporation's CEO will make a recommendation to The Board on target payouts
for Colonial's senior officers.  Colonial's senior management, in consultation
with UNUM Corporation's CEO, will make recommendations to The Board on target
payouts for other plan participants.

PAYOUTS
Payouts are at the discretion of The Board.  The Board will accept the
determination of the UNUM Corporation Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof) as to the amount, if any, of payout for the Enterprise component of the
Plan.  Payouts will be determined by assessing both the achievement of the
financial goal(s) and progress against other business goals established at the
beginning of the Plan Year.  Colonial's senior management will review progress
for the Plan Year and make a recommendation to UNUM Corporation's CEO on payout
level, if any.  The Board may elect to modify or disallow payouts for any reason
at any time.

Senior management may elect to recommend an adjustment in payout for any
participant based on individual performance.

<PAGE>

Payouts will be made as soon as practical after year-end results are determined,
certified by Colonial's outside auditors, and approved by The Board.

Payouts will be a percentage of base salary earned between January 1 and
December 31 of the Plan Year.  For purposes of this Plan, base salary includes
base pay, shift pay and geographic differential pay.  Base salary excludes
overtime, all bonuses and awards, and any other compensation that is not salary
related.

In the event of transfers between affiliates, payouts will be based on earnings
received while at each Affiliate and will reflect the performance of the
respective organization with which the employee was associated.

Taxes will be withheld from payouts in accordance with tax regulations and
withholding allowances (IRS form W-4) as they exist on the day of the
distribution.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
In the event that an employee separates from the Company by reason of death,
disability or retirement during the Plan Year, the employee or the employee's
estate will be eligible for a payout, provided the employee was on active
employment status at the beginning of the Plan Year.  Any payout would be based
on base salary earnings while on active employment status during the Plan Year.
For purposes of this Plan, active employment status is defined as being actively
at work or on sick leave, short-term disability or approved leave of absence.

If an employee separates from the Company during the Plan Year for any reason
other than death, disability or retirement, any payout for that Plan Year is
forfeited, unless otherwise determined by The Board.

CHANGES IN PARTICIPATION/PAYOUT STATUS
If an employee has a job change or reclassification during the Plan Year that
would make the employee eligible for a different target payout level, the payout
level for that year will be based on the new level if the position change occurs
before July 1.  If such a change occurs after July 1 of the Plan Year, any
payout would be prorated for the time under each payout level.

Employees who become ineligible for the Annual Incentive Plan because of
position changes would become eligible for the Success Sharing Plan.  Any payout
for that Plan Year would be prorated for the time spent in each plan.

In cases of prorated payouts because of position changes, the new participation
status will take effect the first full month in the new position.

<PAGE>

PLAN AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS AND TERMINATION
The Board has the right to modify, amend, or terminate the Plan, with or without
notice.  The Board also has the right to discontinue (either temporarily or
permanently) the distribution of incentive awards.  Award payments, if any, are
not a vested right of any individual but subject to the determination of The
Board in its sole discretion.

                             PAYOUT GUIDELINES


COLONIAL COMPONENT                  60% OF PAYOUT
-------------------------------------------------

The Colonial component consists of two factors:  a) a specific financial goal,
and b) progress against other business goals.  BOTH FACTORS will be assessed in
determining any Plan payout.  Payout is at the full discretion of The Board.

The financial goals for 1994 are based on operating earnings, defined as after-
tax corporate earnings excluding realized gains and losses on investments.

For purposes of the Plan, the goals are as follows:

THRESHOLD:        a.    40.8 million operating earnings
                  b.    Reach business goals

TARGET:           a.    44.0 million operating earnings
                  b.    Exceed business goals

MAXIMUM:          NOT ESTABLISHED


ENTERPRISE COMPONENT                      40% OF PAYOUT
-------------------------------------------------------

The Enterprise component of the Plan consists of a qualitative assessment of
Corporate performance, which will be based upon an EVALUATION of BOTH the
financial performance (Net EPS, defined as UNUM Corporation's net income after
realized capital gains and losses divided by the average number of shares
outstanding) and strategic goals (progress toward 1998 Goals, Corporate
Marketing Strategy, Information Technology Strategy, development of Core
Competencies, and long term positioning of the business). The evaluation of
financial performance will consider not only the LEVEL of results but also HOW
the results were attained.  The Targeted Net EPS will be $4.60, and the
Performance range will be between a threshold of $4.25 and a maximum of $5.20.
In addition to this evaluation of financial results, final payout will consider
the overall performance of UNUM Corporation in key strategic goals.

Payout guidelines are as follows, expressed as a percentage of base salary
earned:

</TABLE>

A Plan participant's payout may be adjusted based on individual performance, at
the recommendation of senior management and approval of The Board.

The preceding should be considered as general guidelines.  Determination of
payouts rests solely with The Board at its full discretion.  The Board may
adjust payments upward or downward depending on Enterprise or Colonial
performance.

     offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage
     (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted
     from such base rate,

          (D)  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per
     annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market
     Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan, and

          (E)  the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting
Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation
for Money Market Quotes.

          (iii)  Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

          (A)  is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does
     not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii);

          (B)  contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;


                                       19
<PAGE>

          (C)  proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in
     the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

          (D)  arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

          (e)  NOTICE TO BORROWER.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in
accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends,
modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote
submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request.  Any
such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such
subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in
such former Money Market Quote.  The Agent's notice to the Borrower shall
specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which
offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related
Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money
Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered
and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money
Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted.

          (f)  ACCEPTANCE AND NOTICE BY BORROWER.  Not later than 10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the proposed
date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case,
such other time or date as the Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed
and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market
Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which
such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Agent of its
acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
subsection (e).  In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money
Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for
each Interest Period that are accepted.  The Borrower may accept any Money
Market Quote in whole or in part; PROVIDED that:

          (i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may
     not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market
     Quote Request,


                                       20
<PAGE>

         (ii)  the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be
     $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

        (iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending
     Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be,
     and

         (iv)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in
     subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements
     of this Agreement.

          (g)  ALLOCATION BY AGENT.  If offers are made by two or more Banks
with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case
may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of
which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal
amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall
be allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples
of $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate
principal amounts of such offers.  Determinations by the Agent of the amounts of
Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

          SECTION 2.04.  NOTICE TO BANKS; FUNDING OF LOANS.

          (a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of
such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by
the Borrower.

          (b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of
each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in
subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Agent at
its address referred to in Section 9.01.  Unless the Agent determines that any
applicable condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the Agent
will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at the
Agent's aforesaid address.

          (c)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on which the
Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan from such Bank, such
Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount


                                       21
<PAGE>

being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank
to the Agent as provided in subsection (b), or remitted by the Borrower to the
Agent as provided in Section 2.12, as the case may be.

          (d)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to
the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent
such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04 and the Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so
made such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at
(i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section
2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Bank
shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

          SECTION 2.05.  NOTES.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced
by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of such Bank's Loans.

          (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent, request
that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate Note in an amount
equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such Note
shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate
modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant
type.  Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be
deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may
require.

          (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section 3.01(b), the
Agent shall mail such Note to such Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date,
amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and prior
to any transfer of its Note shall endorse


                                       22
<PAGE>

on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to evidence the
foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding; PROVIDED
that the failure of any Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall
not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes.  Each
Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Note and
to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as
and when required.

          SECTION 2.06.  MATURITY OF LOANS.  Each Loan included in any Borrowing
shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07.  INTEREST RATES.  (a)  Each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
the last day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate
Loans for such day.

          (b)  Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted CD Rate;
PROVIDED that if any CD Loan or any portion thereof shall, as a result of clause
(2)(b) of the definition of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less
than 30 days, such portion shall bear interest during such Interest Period at
the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.  Such interest shall
be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such
Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first
day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any CD Loan shall bear
interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the Applicable Margin plus
the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the rate applicable to
Base Rate Loans for such day.

          The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate
per annum determined pursuant to the following formula:


                                       23
<PAGE>


                   [ CDBR       ]*
          ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                   [ 1.00 - DRP ]

          ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
          CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
           DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
            AR  =  Assessment Rate

     __________
     *    The amount in brackets being rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
          higher 1/100 of 1%


          The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period is the rate of
interest determined by the Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid
at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as practicable) on the
first day of such Interest Period by two or more New York certificate of deposit
dealers of recognized standing for the purchase at face value from each CD
Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount comparable to the
principal amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank to which such Interest
Period applies and having a maturity comparable to such Interest Period.

          "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement (including without limitation any
basic, supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in
respect of new non-personal time deposits in dollars in New York City having a
maturity comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount of $100,000
or more.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve Percentage.

          "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual assessment rate in
effect on such day which is payable by a member of the Bank Insurance Fund
classified as adequately capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within the meaning of 12
C.F.R. Section 327.3(e) (or any successor provision) to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (or any successor) for such Corporation's (or such
successor's) insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the


                                       24
<PAGE>

United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as
of the effective date of any change in the Assessment Rate.

          (c)  Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three
months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.

          The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing (i) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate by (ii) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage.

          The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period
means the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%)
of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered to
each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank market at
approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the
first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the
principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank to
which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to
such Interest Period.

          "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in
respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other
assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United
States residents).  The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar
Reserve Percentage.

          (d)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for



                                       25
<PAGE>

each day from and including the date payment thereof was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the
higher of (i) the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the Applicable Margin
plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher
1/100 of 1%) by dividing (x) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the
next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or,
if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business Days,
then for such other period of time not longer than six months as the Agent may
select) deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal to such overdue
payment due to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks are offered to such
Euro-Dollar Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable
period determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of Section
8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day).

          (e)  Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market LIBOR Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London
Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with
Section 2.07(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed
Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by the
Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.  Each Money Market
Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in
accordance with Section 2.03.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three
months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.  Any overdue
principal of or interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable
on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2%
plus the Base Rate for such day.

          (f)  The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the
Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its
determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.


                                       26
<PAGE>

          (g)  Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish
quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section.  If any Reference Bank
does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant
interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished by the
remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on
a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

          (h)  The "Applicable Margin" with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan or
CD Loan at any date is the applicable percentage amount set forth in the table
below based on the Utilization and Status on such day:

                         Level I   Level II   Level III  Level IV
                         Status    Status     Status     Status
                         -------   --------   ---------  --------

If Utilization is
equal to or less
than 50%:

Euro-Dollar Loans         0.2000%  0.2500%   0.2750%     0.2750%

CD Loans                  0.3250%  0.3750%   0.4000%     0.4000%

If Utilization is
greater than 50%:

Euro-Dollar Loans         0.2750%  0.3000%   0.3250%     0.3750%

CD Loans                  0.4000%  0.4250%   0.4500%     0.5000%


          SECTION 2.08.  FEES.

          (a)  FACILITY FEE.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at the rate of (i) 0.1000% per annum
for each day on which Level I Status shall exist, (ii) 0.1250% per annum for
each day on which Level II Status shall exist, (iii) 0.1500% per annum for each
day on which Level III Status shall exist and (iv) 0.2000% per annum for each
day on which Level IV Status shall exist.  Such facility fee shall accrue for
each day (i) from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of the Commitments in their
entirety), on the aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether used or unused)
and (ii) from and including the Termination Date (or earlier date of termination
of the Commitments in their entirety) to but excluding the date the Loans shall
be repaid in their


                                       27
<PAGE>

entirety, on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans.

          (b)  PAYMENTS.  Accrued fees under this Section shall be payable
quarterly on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 and upon the date
of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the
Loans shall be repaid in their entirety).

          SECTION 2.09.  OPTIONAL TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.  The
Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent,
(i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such
time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of the
Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
Loans.

          SECTION 2.10.  MANDATORY TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.  The Commitments
shall terminate on the Termination Date, and any Loans then outstanding
(together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

          SECTION 2.11.  OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.  (a)  The Borrower may (i) upon
at least one Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate
Borrowing (or any Money Market Borrowing bearing interest at the Base Rate
pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) or, subject to Section 2.13, any CD Borrowing and
(ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Agent, subject
to Section 2.13, prepay any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in whole at any time, or from
time to time in part in amounts aggregating $10,000,000 or any larger multiple
of $1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.  Each such optional
prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks
included in such Borrowing.

          (b)  Except as provided in clause (i) of subsection (a) above, the
Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Money
Market Loan prior to the maturity thereof.


          (c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section,
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.


                                       28
<PAGE>

          SECTION 2.12.  GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO PAYMENTS.  (a) The Borrower
shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees
hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Agent
at its address referred to in Section 9.01.  The Agent will promptly distribute
to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Agent for
the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on,
the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day
falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which
is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

          (b)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          SECTION 2.13.  FUNDING LOSSES.  If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Section 2.11 or
Article VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period
fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(d), or if the Borrower fails to borrow any Fixed
Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section
2.04(a), or if the Borrower fails to prepay after giving


                                       29
<PAGE>

notice thereof under Section 2.11, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within
15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an
existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without
limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such
payment or failure to borrow, PROVIDED that such Bank shall have delivered to
the Borrower a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense, which
certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14.  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.  Interest based on
the Prime Rate hereunder and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  All other
interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day).

          SECTION 2.15.  WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION.  At least five Domestic
Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either
case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the
Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes.  Each Bank which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such form

official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which
could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position

other failures referred to in this Section 4.07, could materially adversely

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of the Borrower to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

     is merged or formed by such consolidation or the Person which acquires
     substantially all the Borrower's assets as an entirety is a corporation
     organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any State

     lines of business or, in connection therewith, may abandon or otherwise
     dispose of any material rights, privileges and franchises, or its present

     other condition of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole;

          (e) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may, in any fiscal

     or other disposition, together with all such conveyances, sales, leases,
     transfers or other dispositions since the first day of such period of three
     consecutive fiscal quarters, will not, in the Borrower's Board of
     Directors' good faith judgment, have a material adverse effect on the
     business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
     Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii) after
     giving effect to such conveyance, sale, lease, transfer or other

     disposed of during such fiscal quarter and the immediately preceding three
     consecutive fiscal quarters shall not exceed 10% of Total Assets as at such
     first day except to the extent that such assets were first acquired by the

<PAGE>

          (f)  the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may sell, lease,
     transfer or otherwise dispose of real property (and personal property
     necessary to the use thereof) acquired by the Borrower or such Restricted
     Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to foreclosure proceedings or by

          (d)  Liens upon real and/or tangible personal property acquired after
     the date hereof (by purchase, construction or otherwise) by the Borrower or
     any Restricted Subsidiary, each of which Liens either (A) existed on such
     property before the time of its acquisition and was not created in
     anticipation thereof, or (B) was created solely for the purpose of securing
     Indebtedness representing, or incurred to finance, refinance or refund, the
     cost (including the cost of construction) of the respective property;
     PROVIDED that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any


                                       46
<PAGE>

     property of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary other than the
     respective property so acquired and improvements thereon and no such Lien
     shall secure any additional Indebtedness; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the
     principal amount of Indebtedness secured by any such Lien shall at no time
     exceed the cost of the respective property at the time it was acquired (by
     purchase, construction or otherwise);

          (e)  Liens created after the Effective Date upon real and/or personal
     property securing Indebtedness incurred after the Effective Date, PROVIDED

     exceed 7.5% of Total Stockholders' Equity; and

          (f)  any extension, renewal or replacement of the foregoing, PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that the Liens permitted hereunder shall not secure any additional
     Indebtedness (if applicable) or cover any additional property.

          SECTION 5.07.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.  The Borrower will not,
nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter

and assumptions of obligations of an Affiliate) other than transactions with
Affiliates (i) otherwise permitted by this Agreement or (ii) (x) entered into on
an arm's length basis, on terms no more favorable to such Affiliate than would

$1.00 of additional Funded Indebtedness under Section 5.09.

          SECTION 5.08.  MINIMUM TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.  The Borrower shall

thereto, the ratio of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Funded Indebtedness
to (ii) Total Capital will not exceed 0.3 to 1.

          SECTION 5.10.  RESTRICTED AND UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES.  The Borrower

                                       47
<PAGE>

prospectively as a Restricted Subsidiary or as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if,
after giving effect to such designation, no Default would exist and the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Funded Indebtedness under Section 5.09; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that no
Subsidiary designated by an asterisk on Schedule I hereof as a Restricted
Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; PROVIDED FURTHER
that, if any Unrestricted Subsidiary listed on Schedule I hereof is duly
designated pursuant to this Section 5.10 as a Restricted Subsidiary, it may not
at any time thereafter be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and PROVIDED
further that any designation under this Section 5.10 must remain unchanged over
the last day of at least two consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower.  A
certified copy of such resolution, together with a pro forma consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries as at a date not

appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and

business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if
it were not the Agent hereunder.

          SECTION 7.03.  ACTION BY AGENT.  The obligations of the Agent
hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any action
with respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI.

          SECTION 7.04.  CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS.  The Agent may consult with
legal counsel (who may be counsel for the


                                       51
<PAGE>

Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

          SECTION 7.05.  LIABILITY OF AGENT.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks or (ii) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain,
inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance
or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the
satisfaction of any condition specified in Article III, except receipt of items
required to be delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing

acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other
writing (which may be a bank wire, telex or similar writing) believed by it to
be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

          SECTION 7.06.  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each Bank shall, ratably in
accordance with its initial Commitment, indemnify the Agent, its affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action
taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

          SECTION 7.07.  CREDIT DECISION.  Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its


                                       52
<PAGE>

own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.08.  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower, and such notice shall be
effective on the date specified therein (unless otherwise stated therein)
whether or not a successor Agent is appointed and accepts such appointment as
provided below.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent with the consent of the Borrower.  If no such
successor Agent shall have been so appointed, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a
successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under
the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of
the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent.

          SECTION 7.09.  AGENT'S FEE.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Agent.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


          SECTION 8.01.  BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR
UNFAIR.  If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Fixed
Rate Borrowing:

          (a)  the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits in
     dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to the Reference
     Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

          (b)  in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of
     the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that the Adjusted
     CD Rate


                                       53
<PAGE>

     or the Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as
     determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
     such Banks of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
     be, for such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make CD
Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended.  Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date
of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been
given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate
Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a
Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market
LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall
bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such
day.

          SECTION 8.02.  ILLEGALITY.  If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its
Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon
until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to
make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the
Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different
Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving
such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not
lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans
to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately
prepay in full the


                                       54
<PAGE>

then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with
accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar
Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount
from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and
such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

          SECTION 8.03.  INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN.  (a)  If on or after
(x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make
Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case
of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

           (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) to any
     tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or
     its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change the basis of
     taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of the
     principal of or interest on its Fixed Rate Loans or any other amounts due
     under this Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation
     to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
     overall net income of such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by
     the jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive office or
     Applicable Lending Office is located); or

          (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
     without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors
     of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding (A) with respect to any CD
     Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Domestic Reserve
     Percentage and (B) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such
     requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage),
     special deposit, insurance assessment (excluding, with respect to any CD
     Loan, any such requirement reflected in an applicable Assessment Rate) or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Bank


                                       55
<PAGE>

     (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its
     Applicable Lending Office) or on the United States market for certificates
     of deposit or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its
     Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect
thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days
after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
such increased cost or reduction.

          (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have
achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed
by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand
by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent)
for such reduction.

          (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for,
or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of any Bank
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and, to the extent deemed



                                       56
<PAGE>

feasible by such Bank, setting forth the calculation thereof) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such
Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

          SECTION 8.04.  BASE RATE LOANS SUBSTITUTED FOR AFFECTED FIXED RATE
LOANS.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar
Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that
the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until
such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist:

          (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as CD Loans
     or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be made instead as Base
     Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
     contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks),
     and

          (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
     be, has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be
     applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base
     Rate Loans instead.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


          SECTION 9.01.  NOTICES.  All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire,
telecopier, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to
such party:  (x) in the case of the Borrower or the Agent, at its address or
telecopy number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of any
Bank, at its address or telecopy number set forth in its Administrative
Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, such other address or telecopy
number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the
Agent and the Borrower.  Each such notice, request or other communication shall
be effective (i) if given by telecopy, when such telecopy is transmitted to the
telecopy number specified in this Section and is received, (ii) if given by
mail, 72


                                       57
<PAGE>

hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class
postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means,
when delivered at the address specified in this Section; PROVIDED that notices
to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until
received.

          SECTION 9.02.  NO WAIVERS.  No failure or delay by the Agent or any
Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.03.  EXPENSES; DOCUMENTARY TAXES; INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent,
including fees and disbursements of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special counsel for
the Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this
Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any
Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent and each Bank, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and
collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting
therefrom.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any transfer taxes,
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any governmental authority by
reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Notes.

          (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank, their
respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and
employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection
with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not
such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any actual or proposed use of
proceeds of Loans hereunder; PROVIDED that no Indemnitee shall have the right to
be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.


                                       58
<PAGE>

          SECTION 9.04.  SHARING OF SET-OFFS.  Each Bank agrees that if it
shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due
with respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and
interest due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments
shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and
interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the
Banks pro rata; PROVIDED that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of
any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to
apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the
Borrower other than its indebtedness under the Notes.  The Borrower agrees, to
the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other
rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a
participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

          SECTION 9.05.  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.  Any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks
(and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent);
PROVIDED that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks
(and the Borrower and, if and to the extent provided above, the Agent), (i)
increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease
in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional
obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any
fees hereunder, except as provided below, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder or for any
reduction or termination of any Commitment or (iv) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the
number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take
any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.06.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a)  The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure


                                       59
<PAGE>

to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all
Banks, and no Bank may grant participating interests in its Commitment or any of
its Loans or assign all or any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the Notes in violation of subsections (b) and (c) below, taking
into account the applicability of the last sentence of such subsection (b).

          (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or
any or all of its Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the
Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance
of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank
may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall
retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED
that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to
any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of Section 9.05 without the consent of the Participant.  The
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its
participation agreement and subject to subsection (e) below, be entitled to the
benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating interest.  An
assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d)
below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of
a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

          (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all, of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee
shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto executed by
such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the subscribed
consent of the Borrower and the Agent; PROVIDED that if an Assignee is an
affiliate of such transferor Bank, no such consent shall be required; PROVIDED
FURTHER that such


                                       60
<PAGE>

assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect
of outstanding Money Market Loans; and PROVIDED FURTHER that such assignment
shall be in a principal amount not less than $10,000,000.  Upon execution and
delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank
of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and
such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in
such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from
its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower
shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued
to the Assignee.  In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank
shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in
the amount of $2,000.  If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date
on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section
2.15.

          (d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment
shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

          (e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights
shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.03 than such
Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by
reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or
at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not
exist.

          SECTION 9.07.  COLLATERAL.  Each of the Banks represents to the Agent
and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon any
"margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or
maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.08.  GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  This
Agreement and each Note shall be


                                       61
<PAGE>

governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York
State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.  The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

          SECTION 9.09.  COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION.  This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

          SECTION 9.10.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Agent and each Bank agree that
they will maintain the confidentiality of any material information provided
under, or in connection with, this Agreement by or on behalf of the Borrower
that has been identified by the Borrower as confidential or that the Agent or
such Bank knows, or has reason to know, is confidential (hereinafter
collectively called "Confidential Information"), subject to the Agent's and each
Bank's (a) obligation to disclose any such Confidential Information pursuant to
a request or order under applicable laws and regulations or pursuant to a
subpoena or other legal process, (b) right to disclose any such Confidential
Information to its bank examiners, auditors, counsel and other professional
advisors and to other Banks, (c) right to disclose any such Confidential
Information in connection with any litigation or dispute involving one or more
of the Banks or the Agent and the Borrower, PROVIDED that the Banks so involved
or the Agent, as the case may be, shall provide the Borrower with reasonable
notice of the disclosure of such Confidential Information solely to enable the
Borrower to attempt to obtain a court order limiting the disclosure thereof
outside of the scope of such litigation or dispute but only if such notice is
not prejudicial to such Banks or the Agent and (d) right to provide such
information to participants, prospective participants or prospective assignees
pursuant to Section 9.06 if such participant, prospective participant or
prospective assignee agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality of such
information on terms substantially similar to those of this Section 9.10


                                       62
<PAGE>

as if it were a "Bank" party hereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
information supplied to a Bank, participant, prospective participant or
prospective assignee under this Agreement shall cease to be Confidential
Information if it is or becomes known to such Person by other than unauthorized
disclosure, or if it becomes a matter of public knowledge.


                                       63

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.
