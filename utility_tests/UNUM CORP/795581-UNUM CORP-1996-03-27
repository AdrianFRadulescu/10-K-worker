ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
A. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
    UNUM Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized in 1985 as an insurance
holding  company.  UNUM Corporation  and subsidiaries  ("UNUM") are  the leading
providers of group long  term disability insurance ("group  LTD") in the  United
States  and  the United  Kingdom.  UNUM is  also  a major  provider  of employee
benefits, individual  disability insurance  and special  risk reinsurance.  UNUM
also  markets long term  care and retirement income  products. The operations of
the following subsidiaries account for substantially all of UNUM's  consolidated
assets  and revenues. UNUM Corporation is  based in Portland, Maine, and through
its affiliates  has operations  in North  America, the  United Kingdom  and  the
Pacific Rim.
 
    UNUM  conducts  its operations  in  the United  States  through a  number of
wholly-owned subsidiaries  including: UNUM  Life  Insurance Company  of  America
("UNUM  America"),  a Maine  life insurance  company licensed  in 49  states and
Canada, the leading  provider of group  disability insurance in  the nation  and
provider  of employee  benefits, long term  care and  retirement products; First
UNUM Life Insurance Company ("First UNUM"),  a New York life insurance  company;
Commercial  Life Insurance  Company, a  Wisconsin life  insurance company  and a
leader  in  special  risk  insurance  and  professional  association   insurance
marketing; Duncanson & Holt, Inc., a New York corporation and a leading accident
and  health  reinsurance  underwriting  manager;  Colonial  Companies,  Inc.,  a
Delaware holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Colonial Life & Accident
Insurance Company, is a leader  in payroll-deducted voluntary employee  benefits
offered  to employees at  their worksites; and UNUM  Holding Company, a Delaware
corporation. Through UNUM Holding Company, UNUM Corporation also owns UNUM Sales
Corporation, a  licensed  broker-dealer  incorporated in  Delaware,  and  Claims
Service  International,  Inc.,  a Delaware  corporation,  which  provides claims
administration services.
 
    UNUM Corporation also  holds all of  the outstanding capital  stock of  UNUM
European  Holding Company, which  is incorporated in  the United Kingdom. UNUM's
United Kingdom operations  are conducted by  UNUM Limited, which  is the  United
Kingdom's  leader in group disability insurance and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
UNUM European Holding Company, and Duncanson & Holt Europe Ltd., a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Duncanson & Holt, Inc.
 
    UNUM's  Japanese operations are conducted through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
UNUM Japan  Accident  Insurance  Company  Limited  ("UNUM  Japan"),  a  Japanese
non-life insurance company, which was established in 1994.
 
    On   December  3,  1992,  UNUM   and  Colonial  Companies,  Inc.  ("Colonial
Companies"), signed a definitive merger  agreement. On March 26, 1993,  Colonial
Companies  Class A common stock shareholders  voted to approve the merger. Under
the agreement, UNUM exchanged 0.731 shares of its common stock for each share of
Colonial Companies Class  A and Class  B common stock  outstanding on March  26,
1993.  UNUM  issued  approximately  11.4 million  shares  of  common  stock from
treasury in  connection with  the merger.  In addition,  outstanding options  to
acquire  shares of Colonial  Companies Class B common  stock were converted into
options to acquire shares of UNUM common stock. The merger was accounted for  as
a pooling of interests.
 
    On  January 24, 1996, UNUM America entered into an agreement for the sale of
its group tax-sheltered annuity  ("TSA") business to  The Lincoln National  Life
Insurance  Company ("Lincoln Life"), a part of Lincoln National Corporation, and
to a  new New  York insurance  subsidiary of  Lincoln Life.  The agreement  also
contemplates  that First UNUM  will enter into a  similar agreement with Lincoln
Life's New York insurance subsidiary. The  sale, which is subject to  regulatory
approvals,  involves approximately 1,700 group  contractholders and assets under
management of approximately $3 billion. The agreement initially contemplates the
reinsurance of these contracts under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. These
contracts  will  then  be  reinsured  pursuant  to  an  assumption   reinsurance
arrangement  upon consent  of the  TSA contractholders  and/or participants. The
purchase price (ceding commission)  at closing is  expected to be  approximately
$70  million. It is anticipated that it will take several months (perhaps six to
nine months) to  obtain the necessary  approvals and otherwise  close the  sale.
There is no guarantee that the sale will close.
 
    On February 7, 1996, UNUM announced plans to merge Commercial Life Insurance
Company  into UNUM  America to accelerate  growth of its  special risk business,
increase its  commitment  to  the  association group  business  and  to  improve
operating  and capital efficiencies.  The merger will  be effective December 31,
1996, subject to regulatory approvals.
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
    To more clearly  reflect UNUM's  management of  its businesses  and to  more
appropriately group its product portfolios, UNUM began reporting its operations,
effective  January 1,  1995, principally  in four  business segments: Disability
Insurance, Special Risk  Insurance, Colonial Products  and Retirement  Products.
Corporate  includes transactions  that are  generally non-insurance  related and
interest expense on corporate borrowings. For comparative purposes, prior period
information has been restated to reflect reporting in these segments.
 
    Refer to Item 7 and Item 8 (Note 16) for more information.
 
B.  DISABILITY INSURANCE SEGMENT
 
    The Disability  Insurance segment,  which  in 1995  accounted for  60.0%  of
UNUM's revenues and 56.8% of its income before income taxes, includes disability
products offered in North America, the United Kingdom and Japan including: group
LTD,  individual  disability,  group short  term  disability,  association group
disability, disability reinsurance and long term care insurance.
 
UNUM AMERICA AND FIRST UNUM:
 
    UNUM America  and First  UNUM market  their group  and individual  insurance
products,  as  well  as long  term  care  products, which  are  included  in the
Disability Insurance and Special Risk  Insurance segments, through a network  of
33  offices  in the  United  States and  Canada  that distribute  these products
through brokers. As of  December 31, 1995, these  branch offices were  organized
into  four regions  and were staffed  with approximately  720 management, sales,
service and administrative personnel.
 
GROUP LONG TERM DISABILITY
 
    UNUM America and First UNUM's group LTD product is the Disability  Insurance
segment's  principal product. UNUM America and  First UNUM target sales of group
LTD  to   executive,  administrative   and  management   personnel,  and   other
professionals.  Since 1976, UNUM  America and First UNUM  combined have been the
United States' leading provider of group LTD according to EMPLOYEE BENEFIT  PLAN
REVIEW, a recognized industry publication.
 
    Group  LTD provides employees with insurance  coverage for loss of income in
the event of inability to work due to sickness or injury. Most of these policies
begin providing benefits following 90-  or 180-day waiting periods and  continue
providing  benefits until the employee reaches age 65-70. Group LTD benefits are
paid monthly and generally  are limited to two-thirds  of the employee's  earned
income  up to a specified maximum benefit.  Premiums for group LTD insurance are
based upon  the expected  mortality, morbidity  and persistency  of the  insured
group,  as well as assumptions concerning operating expenses and future interest
rates.
 
INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY
 
    Individual disability  products  provide coverage  for  loss of  income  for
professionals,  corporate executives, business owners and administrative support
personnel in  the  event  of  disability. As  reported  in  the  Life  Insurance
Marketing  Research  Association's  1994 INDIVIDUAL  HEALTH  ISSUES  AND INFORCE
SURVEY for the United  States and Canada, the  most recent available data,  UNUM
America  and First UNUM combined were  the fourth largest provider of individual
disability income policies measured by premium inforce.
 
    UNUM announced  in November  1994 that  it would  discontinue sales  of  the
traditional,   fixed  price,   non-cancellable  individual   disability  product
("non-cancellable product") in the  United States upon  introduction of the  new
disability  product  in each  state.  During the  second  quarter of  1995, UNUM
introduced the  guaranteed  renewable Lifelong  Disability  Protection  product,
which   is  replacing  the  non-cancellable  product.  The  Lifelong  Disability
Protection product  provides  benefits  and transitional  support  for  moderate
disabilities,  while providing richer benefits  for severe disabilities. Various
options are  available that  permit  tailoring of  an  insurance policy  to  the
specific  client's needs. The most common options  include up to 60% base income
replacement coverage, an option  to purchase up to  40% further coverage in  the
event  of  catastrophic injury  or illness  involving  the loss  of two  or more
Activities of Daily Living, and  an automatic option to  convert to a long  term
care  policy at  retirement age.  At the  end of  1995, the  Lifelong Disability
Protection product had been approved in 42 states and the District of  Columbia.
Sales  of  the  non-cancellable product  are  being discontinued  in  each state
following the regulatory approval of the Lifelong Disability Protection product.
 
    Until the new products are approved,  UNUM will continue to sell  individual
disability  products on  a non-cancellable basis,  with a fixed  premium for the
duration of  the policy.  The basic  individual disability  policy provides  the
insured  with  a portion  of the  earned income  which  is lost  as a  result of
sickness or injury.  Monthly benefits  available range from  30% to  70% of  the
insured's  earned income  up to a  specified maximum benefit.  UNUM also markets
buy/sell and key  person coverage  and policies that  provide reimbursement  for
business overhead expenses incurred during a period of disability.
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
    Individual   disability  insurance  premium  rates  are  based  on  expected
mortality, morbidity and persistency, as  well as assumptions concerning  policy
related expenses, inflation and investment income.
 
GROUP SHORT TERM DISABILITY
 
    Group  short term disability insurance ("group STD") provides employees with
insurance coverage for loss of income in  the event of inability to work due  to
sickness  or injury. Most of these policies begin providing benefits immediately
for accidents, or following a one-week waiting period for sickness, and continue
providing benefits for up to  26 weeks. Group STD  benefits are paid weekly  and
generally  are limited to 60% of the  employee's earned income up to a specified
maximum benefit. As reported by EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLAN REVIEW, UNUM America  and
First  UNUM combined were one of the top  three providers of group STD for 1994,
based on premium and number of lives inforce.
 
LONG TERM CARE
 
    UNUM America  and First  UNUM market  long term  care ("LTC")  insurance  to
employer  groups, continuing  care retirement  communities and  individuals. The
group LTC product is offered on an employer or employee-paid basis, and employer
groups may offer  coverage to  retirees, spouses, parents  and grandparents,  in
addition to the employee.
 
UNUM LIMITED:
 
    UNUM Limited was the leading provider for 1994 of group LTD insurance in the
United Kingdom, as reported by Employers Re. International. UNUM Limited targets
group  LTD sales to management personnel, other professionals, and technical and
skilled artisans. These products are  marketed through a network of  independent
brokers.  UNUM  Limited's group  LTD products  provide employees  with insurance
coverage for loss of income in the event of inability to work due to sickness or
injury. UNUM  Limited  also  markets  individual  disability  insurance  through
brokers  and agents  to self-employed  individuals and  those not  covered under
group policies. Premiums for group  LTD and individual disability insurance  are
based  upon the  expected mortality,  morbidity and  persistency of  the insured
group, as well as assumptions concerning operating expenses and future  interest
rates.
 
    In May 1994, UNUM Limited assumed the management of the group risk portfolio
of Windsor Life Assurance Company Limited ("Windsor Life"), which included group
LTD  and  group life  products. Windsor  Life  was the  third largest  group LTD
provider  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  1993,  as  reported  by  Employers   Re.
International.
 
UNUM JAPAN:
 
    On  June  20,  1994,  the  Japanese  Ministry  of  Finance  granted  UNUM  a
provisional license that allowed UNUM to establish a non-life insurance company,
UNUM  Japan  Accident  Insurance  Company  Limited  ("UNUM  Japan"),  to  market
disability  and other  accident products in  Japan. UNUM  Japan has subsequently
received an official license.
 
    UNUM Japan  targets sales  of  group LTD  to executive,  administrative  and
management  personnel,  and  other professionals.  These  products  are marketed
through contracted independents and brokers.  Group LTD provides employees  with
insurance  coverage for loss of income in the  event of inability to work due to
sickness or injury. Most  of these policies  begin providing benefits  following
90-  or  365-day  waiting  periods and  continue  providing  benefits  until the
employee reaches age 65-70.  Group LTD benefits are  paid monthly and  generally
are  limited to 60%  of the employee's  earned income up  to a specified maximum
benefit. Premiums for group LTD insurance are based upon the expected mortality,
morbidity  and  persistency  of  the  insured  group,  as  well  as  assumptions
concerning operating expenses and future interest rates.
 
OTHER:
 
    Through  Commercial Life  Insurance Company  ("Commercial Life"),  UNUM is a
leader in  the  association group  marketplace,  offering disability  income  to
members  of professional  associations. Duncanson  & Holt  Services manages long
term disability reinsurance  through UNUM America  and a disability  reinsurance
syndicate.  Duncanson  &  Holt  Services  is  a  leading  manager  of  group LTD
reinsurance in the United States.
 
    Refer to Item 7 and Item 8 (Note 16) under the caption "Disability Insurance
Segment" for more information.
 
C.  SPECIAL RISK INSURANCE SEGMENT
 
    The Special Risk  Insurance segment in  1995 accounted for  18.2% of  UNUM's
revenues and 15.8% of its income before income taxes. The Special Risk Insurance
segment  includes group  life, special  risk accident  insurance, non-disability
reinsurance operations, reinsurance underwriting management operations and other
special risk insurance products.
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
    The Special  Risk  Insurance segment's  group  insurance products  are  sold
primarily  on a basis that permits annual repricing. This enables UNUM to adjust
the pricing  of  its  products  to  more  closely  match  the  underlying  claim
experience and interest rate environment.
 
    UNUM  America and  First UNUM's group  life insurance  products provide term
insurance to a broad  range of employees. As  reported by EMPLOYEE BENEFIT  PLAN
REVIEW  for 1994, the  most recent available  data, UNUM America  and First UNUM
combined were the  fifth largest writer  of group life  insurance in the  United
States,  based on number of contracts inforce.  UNUM America and First UNUM also
market other special risk insurance products, including group accidental death &
dismemberment insurance.
 
    UNUM America  and First  UNUM market  their group  and individual  insurance
products,  as  well  as long  term  care  products, which  are  included  in the
Disability Insurance and Special Risk  Insurance segments, through a network  of
33  offices  in the  United  States and  Canada  that distribute  these products
through brokers. As of  December 31, 1995, these  branch offices were  organized
into  four regions  and were staffed  with approximately  720 management, sales,
service and administrative personnel.
 
    Through Commercial Life, UNUM  is a leading provider  of group special  risk
accident  products,  including group  travel  and voluntary  accident insurance.
Commercial Life also provides group universal life, group term life and  payroll
deduction  programs for employees  through a network  of independent brokers and
specialty  agents.  Commercial  Life  is  a  leader  in  the  association  group
marketplace,   offering   business  overhead   expense,  accidental   death  and
dismemberment,  hospital  indemnity  and  term  life  insurance  to  members  of
professional associations.
 
    On  July 30, 1992, UNUM purchased Duncanson  & Holt, Inc. ("D&H"), a leading
accident  and  health  reinsurance   underwriting  manager.  As  a   reinsurance
underwriting  manager,  D&H is  authorized  to conduct  reinsurance  business on
behalf of the member companies participating in its reinsurance facilities.  D&H
provides  pool  management services  that  may include  marketing, underwriting,
administration, claims payment and actuarial services for client companies,  but
does  not bear any insurance risk. D&H  has offices throughout the United States
and in London, Toronto and Singapore.
 
    The   non-disability   reinsurance   operations   include   UNUM   America's
participation  in reinsurance facilities managed by Duncanson & Holt, facilities
managed by non-related companies  and direct reinsurance arrangements  primarily
for  accident and health, long term care  and special risks. As a member company
in reinsurance facilities, UNUM America assumes a share of the insurance risk of
the facility.
 
    During 1995, Duncanson & Holt Europe Ltd., an affiliate of D&H based in  the
United Kingdom, was authorized by Lloyd's of London to establish two new Lloyd's
Managing  Agents and  to acquire a  third existing Lloyd's  Managing Agent. Each
manages a  syndicate  that underwrites  primarily  personal accident  and  other
"non-marine" classes of business at Lloyd's of London.

Insurance Segment" for more information.
 
D. COLONIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
    The Colonial Products segment in 1995 accounted for 12.8% of UNUM's revenues
and 23.0%  of its  income before  income taxes.  The Colonial  Products  segment
includes Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company ("Colonial") and affiliates.
Colonial,  the principal subsidiary,  markets a broad  line of payroll-deducted,
voluntary benefits to employees at  their worksites, while focusing on  accident
and sickness, cancer and life products.
 
    Colonial's   accident  policies  generally   provide  benefit  payments  for
disability income, death, dismemberment or  major injury. Accident policies  are
designed  to  supplement  other  benefits  available  through  Social  Security,
workers' compensation, and other insurance  plans. Colonial offers a wide  range
of  life insurance products,  with universal life and  whole life accounting for
most of the  life insurance  sold. Colonial's  cancer policies  are designed  to
provide  payments for hospitalization  and scheduled medical  benefits, with the
amounts of  such  payments  established  by  the  policies.  All  of  Colonial's
insurance policies are issued on a nonparticipating basis.
 
    More  than 97%  of Colonial's premiums  for 1995 were  derived from policies
marketed to employees  at their  worksites, with premiums  in most  cases to  be
collected  through payroll deduction. Such policies  are issued on a "guaranteed
renewable" basis, which means that Colonial  cannot refuse to renew any  policy,
but it does reserve the right on a product-by-product basis to increase premiums
for  inforce policies.  This right to  change premiums  is or may  be subject to
various state insurance department rules, regulations, and approvals.
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
    Since 1985,  Colonial  has marketed  its  accident and  health  products  as
qualified fringe benefits that can be purchased with pretax dollars as part of a
flexible  benefits program pursuant to Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.
In 1995,  premiums  from  sales  to employees  participating  in  such  programs
accounted  for approximately 50% of total  premiums. A flexible benefits program
assists employers  in  managing their  benefits  and compensation  packages  and
provides  policyholders with the  ability to choose the  benefits that best meet
their needs. Although Congress might change  the tax laws to limit or  eliminate
fringe  benefits available on  a pretax basis  and such a  change could limit or
eliminate Colonial's ability  to continue  marketing its products  in this  way,
Colonial  believes its products  provide policyholders value,  which will remain
even if the tax advantages offered by flexible benefit programs are eliminated.
 
    Colonial markets its  products nationwide primarily  through a  5,400-member
independent  contractor sales  force. Approximately 1,300  home office employees
provide corporate administration, sales support, internal services and  systems,
claims processing, policyholder services and employer services.
 
    Colonial  Companies'  subsidiary,  BenefitAmerica,  Inc. ("BenefitAmerica"),
offers employers administrative  services for their  employee benefit  programs.
The  services  offered  by  BenefitAmerica  include  administration  of flexible
spending accounts, which are offered under an employer's flexible benefits  plan
pursuant  to  Section  125  of  the Internal  Revenue  Code,  as  well  as other
administrative services to those plans.  The services offered by  BenefitAmerica
complement the services and products offered to employers by Colonial.
 
    Refer  to Item 7 and  Item 8 (Note 16)  under the caption "Colonial Products
Segment" for more information.
 
E.  RETIREMENT PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
    The Retirement Products segment  accounted for 8.7%  of UNUM's revenues  and
11.9%  of  its income  before income  taxes  in 1995.  This segment  markets and
services tax-sheltered annuities ("TSA")  in UNUM America  and First UNUM.  This
segment   also  includes  guaranteed   investment  contracts  ("GICs"),  deposit
administration accounts ("DAs"), 401(k) plans, individual life and group medical
insurance, all of which are no longer actively marketed by UNUM.
 
    On September  11,  1995, UNUM  announced  plans  to withdraw  from  the  tax
sheltered  annuity business  to focus greater  attention on  core disability and
special risk  businesses. On  January 24,  1996, UNUM  America entered  into  an
agreement  for the sale of  its group TSA business  to The Lincoln National Life
Insurance Company ("Lincoln Life"), a part of Lincoln National Corporation,  and
to  a new  New York  insurance subsidiary  of Lincoln  Life. The  agreement also
contemplates that First UNUM  will enter into a  similar agreement with  Lincoln
Life's  New York insurance subsidiary. The  sale, which is subject to regulatory
approvals, involves approximately 1,700  group contractholders and assets  under
management of approximately $3 billion. The agreement initially contemplates the
reinsurance of these contracts under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. These
contracts   will  then  be  reinsured  pursuant  to  an  assumption  reinsurance
arrangement upon consent  of the  TSA contractholders  and/or participants.  The
purchase  price (ceding commission)  at closing is  expected to be approximately
$70 million. It is anticipated that it will take several months (perhaps six  to
nine  months) to  obtain the necessary  approvals and otherwise  close the sale.
There is no guarantee that the sale will close.
 
    TSA products  (Section 403(b)  plans under  the Internal  Revenue Code)  are
marketed  to  non-profit hospitals  and organizations.  These contracts  offer a
fixed fund  that  provides for  annual  renewable guarantees  of  principal  and
interest.  In  addition, some  TSA contracts  offer variable  annuity investment
alternatives.  These  investment  alternatives  are  mutual  funds  offered   as
subaccounts  in a UNUM separate account. The mutual funds, managed by nationally
recognized investment managers,  include a  variety of choices  such as  growth,
balanced  and stock  index funds. UNUM  also offers  recordkeeping and reporting
services to TSA contractholders.  UNUM America and First  UNUM market their  TSA
products  through a network of 13 offices in the United States, which distribute
these products as well as the group and individual insurance products offered by
the Disability Insurance and Special Risk Insurance segments, primarily  through
brokers.
 
    In  the fourth quarter  of 1991, UNUM  announced plans to  withdraw from the
401(k)  market  by  the  end  of  1992.  UNUM  has  transferred  401(k)  service
responsibilities  to  its formerly  wholly-owned subsidiary,  Preferred Benefits
Corporation, which was  sold in the  second quarter of  1992. UNUM  discontinued
active  marketing of GICs  and DAs primarily due  to the lack  of demand and the
level of investment  risk. UNUM  discontinued new  sales of  universal life  and
other  individual life policies  as of January  1, 1988. UNUM  began exiting the
group medical product line in 1987 with  the discontinuance of new sales on  the
traditional  group medical product. In  1990, management announced its intention
to exit the  group medical product  entirely. Beginning with  the February  1991
renewals,  policyholders  had the  option  of transferring  their  group medical
product to another insurer. UNUM services commitments to inforce  policyholders,
which include conversions of group life and group medical insurance.

Segment" for more information.

    Effective  January  1,  1995,  UNUM  adopted  FAS  114,  which  defined  the
principles to measure and record a loan when it is probable that a creditor will
be unable to collect all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of  the
loan  agreement. In general, impaired  loans as defined by  FAS 114 compare with
loans previously defined and disclosed as problem and potential problem loans.

G. RISK MANAGEMENT AND REINSURANCE
 
    Risk management,  which  includes  product  design,  pricing,  underwriting,
reserving  and benefits  management, involves  a determination  of the  type and
amount of  risk  that  an  insurer is  willing  to  accept,  administration  and
evaluation  of business  inforce, and control  of claims.  UNUM has underwriters
organized within business segments who evaluate policy applications on the basis
of information provided by the applicant and other sources.
 
    UNUM reinsures with other  companies portions of  the insurance policies  it
has  underwritten. Reinsurance allows UNUM to sell policies with higher benefits
than the entire risk that UNUM is willing to assume. UNUM remains liable to  the
insured  for the payment of policy benefits  if the reinsurers cannot meet their
obligations under the reinsurance agreements.
 
    Within the Disability  Insurance and Special  Risk Insurance segments,  UNUM
America  and  First  UNUM  have underwriters  for  group  disability, individual
disability, group life and long term care products. These underwriting functions
are aligned  geographically  with  UNUM  America and  First  UNUM's  four  sales
regions.  Quotes for prospective customers are based upon UNUM America and First
UNUM's  experience  with  profitability   and  persistency  of  the   respective
employer's  risk category.  The maximum  group LTD,  group STD,  and LTC monthly
benefit varies,  but the  usual  maximum monthly  amount available  is  $35,000,
$10,000,  and  $6,000  respectively.  For group  life  insurance  products, UNUM
retains up to $750,000 per individual life and reinsures the balance with  other
insurance carriers.
 
    In  1994, UNUM America and First  UNUM announced the discontinuance of sales
of its traditional fixed price, non-cancellable individual disability  insurance
product  in the  United States and,  during 1995, introduced  the new guaranteed
renewable individual disability product. As of the end of 1995, this new product
has  received  regulatory  approval  in  most  states.  UNUM  requires   medical
examinations,  financial data, and  other information to make  a decision on the
acceptability of the individual risk and to appropriately classify an  applicant
for individual disability insurance products. On new sales of the new guaranteed
renewable  product, UNUM retains up  to $8,000 plus 25%  of amounts in excess of
$8,000 basic  monthly  indemnity per  life  for personal  disability  coverages,
$20,000  plus 25% of amounts in excess of $20,000 per life for business overhead
expense coverages and $500,000 per life for buy/sell coverages.
 
    The financial  and medical  underwriting areas  of UNUM  Limited handle  the
underwriting  of  group  and  individual  disability  policies  and  group  life
policies. The maximum yearly benefit for  group LTD is 326,000 pounds  sterling.
UNUM
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
Limited  retains 75,000 pounds sterling of  this risk and reinsures the balance.
The maximum  yearly  initial  benefit for  individual  disability  insurance  is
125,000  pounds sterling and  amounts over 40,000 pounds  sterling per annum are
reinsured. On group life business, UNUM Limited retains 60% of the risk up to  a
maximum of 150,000 pounds sterling per individual life.
 
    UNUM  (except  for  Colonial  and Commercial  Life)  reinsures  the  risk of
individual life  insurance  contracts that  exceed  $425,000 on  any  one  life.
Colonial  limits its risk  for death and dismemberment  benefits to $100,000 per
life. Colonial  also  has reinsurance  on  its cancer  insurance  products  that
provides  coverage for claim payments in excess  of $50,000 in any one year, per
claimant, up to a lifetime maximum  of $1 million per claimant. Commercial  Life
reinsures  the risk  on its  accidental death  and dismemberment  contracts that
exceed $400,000 on  any one  life. Commercial Life  also reinsures  the risk  on
individual,  group and franchise life contracts  that exceed $250,000 on any one
life.
 
    In  addition  to  the  reinsurance  arrangements  above,  UNUM  (except  for
Colonial,   UNUM  Limited  and  Commercial   Life)  is  covered  by  catastrophe
reinsurance, which provides  additional protection against  aggregate losses  in
excess  of  $1 million  up  to a  maximum of  $100  million. This  protection is
activated whenever one event causes the disability and/or death of five or  more
people covered under UNUM's disability or life contracts. Colonial is covered by
catastrophe reinsurance for accidental deaths totaling more than $300,000 from a
single  disaster, up to a  limit of $5 million.  UNUM Limited's group disability
business is partially  covered by  catastrophe reinsurance of  3 million  pounds
sterling  for  losses  from one  event  involving more  than  twenty-five lives.
Commercial Life is covered by catastrophe reinsurance, which provides additional
protection against aggregate losses in excess of  $1 million up to a maximum  of
$54  million  for  losses involving  three  or  more covered  lives.  Also, UNUM
purchased excess-of-loss  reinsurance  totaling  $60 million  over  three  years
through  a  Lloyd's  of  London  syndicate  for  the  non-cancellable individual
disability business of UNUM America and First UNUM.
 
    Reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded for the year ended December 31, 1995,
were $241.5  million and  $66.2  million, respectively.  No current  or  planned
reinsurance  activity is expected to have a significant impact on the ability of
UNUM to underwrite additional insurance.
 
H. RESERVES
    The reserves  reported  in the  consolidated  financial statements  of  UNUM
Corporation  and subsidiaries  have been  computed in  accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These reserve balances generally differ
from those specified by the laws of the various states and those carried in  the
statutory  financial  statements.  The differences  between  GAAP  and statutory
reserves arise from the use of different mortality, morbidity, interest, expense
and lapse assumptions.
 
    Pursuant to insurance laws of the states of Maine, New York, South  Carolina
and Wisconsin, the United Kingdom and Japan, UNUM's insurance subsidiaries (UNUM
America,  First  UNUM, Colonial  Life, Commercial  Life,  UNUM Limited  and UNUM
Japan, respectively) set up statutory reserves, carried as liabilities, to  meet
obligations  on  their various  policies. These  statutory reserves  are amounts
which, together with premiums  to be received and  interest on such reserves  at
assumed  rates, are calculated to be sufficient  to meet the policy and contract
obligations of UNUM's insurance subsidiaries. Pursuant to federal insurance laws
of Canada,  UNUM  America  has  established  regulatory  reserves  to  meet  the
obligations of policies written in its Canadian branch.
 
    Statutory,  GAAP  and regulatory  reserves are  based upon  UNUM's insurance
subsidiaries' experience as adjusted to provide for possible adverse deviations.
These estimates are periodically reviewed and compared to actual experience. The
assumptions are revised when  it is determined  that future expected  experience
differs from the assumed estimates.
 
I.  EMPLOYEES
    At December 31, 1995, UNUM had approximately 6,900 full-time employees. UNUM
does not have collective bargaining agreements with employees.
 
J.  COMPETITION
    The  principal competitive factors affecting UNUM's business are reputation,
financial strength, quality of service, risk management expertise, distribution,
product design and price. There is competition among insurance companies for the
types of individual and group insurance and retirement products sold by UNUM. At
the end  of  1995, there  were  more than  1,800  legal reserve  life  insurance
companies  in the  United States  and Canada and  life assurance  offices in the
United Kingdom, which may offer insurance products similar to those marketed  by
UNUM. UNUM also competes with banks, investment advisors, mutual funds and other
financial  entities  to  provide  products  and  services.  All  areas  of group
insurance are  highly  competitive because  of  the large  number  of  insurance
companies and other entities offering these products.

K.  REGULATION
 
    UNUM's  insurance subsidiaries are subject  to regulation and supervision in
the jurisdictions  in  which they  do  business.  Although the  extent  of  such
regulation  varies, U.S. state, Canadian,  United Kingdom and Japanese insurance
laws  generally  establish  supervisory   agencies,  such  as  state   insurance
departments,   the  Office  of  the  Superintendent  of  Financial  Institutions
("OSFI"), The  Department of  Trade and  Industry ("DTI")  and the  Ministry  of
Finance  ("MOF"), respectively,  with broad administrative  powers. These powers
relate chiefly  to the  granting  and revocation  of  the licenses  to  transact
business,  and establishing  reserve requirements  and the  form and  content of
required financial statements. Such powers also include the licensing of  agents
in  the U.S.  and the  approval of policy  forms in  the U.S.  and Japan. UNUM's
insurance operations and subsidiaries must meet the standards and tests for  its
investments  promulgated by insurance  laws and regulations  of Maine, New York,
South Carolina, Wisconsin, Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan, as applicable.
 
    UNUM's United States domiciled insurance  subsidiaries are required to  file
quarterly  and annual statements with the various insurance departments in state
jurisdictions in which they do business. These statements comply with the  rules
of   the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  ("NAIC").  UNUM's
insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically  by examiners of the states  of
Maine,  New  York, South  Carolina  and Wisconsin  and  of other  states  (on an
"association" or "zone" basis) in which they are licensed to do business. UNUM's
insurance branch  operation  in  Canada is  periodically  examined  by  Canadian
insurance  regulatory authorities  and is required  to file  annual reports that
comply with the insurance laws of Canada and  with the rules of the OSFI of  the
Canadian  Federal government  and each of  the provinces.  UNUM's United Kingdom
subsidiary is required to  file financial statements annually  with the DTI,  in
accordance  with United  Kingdom law and  regulation. UNUM Japan  is required to
file financial statements  annually with  the MOF, in  accordance with  Japanese
laws and regulations.
 
    UNUM's  insurance subsidiaries  operate under insurance  laws, which require
that they establish and carry, as liabilities, actuarial reserves to meet  their
obligations  on  their  disability,  life,  accident  and  health  policies, and
annuities. These reserves are verified periodically by various regulators.
 
    UNUM's reinsurance underwriting manager, Duncanson & Holt, Inc., ("D&H")  is
a  licensed reinsurance intermediary in New York. It is subject to regulation in
New York and other states where it does business. Duncanson & Holt Underwriters,
Ltd., a subsidiary of  D&H, is a  corporate member of Lloyd's  of London and  is
subject to all rules applicable to such members.
 
    UNUM  Sales  Corporation, a  registered broker-dealer,  is regulated  by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It  is  the principal  underwriter  for variable  annuity  contracts
offered  by  UNUM  America  and  First UNUM.  Future  operations  of  UNUM Sales
Corporation may be  affected by the  completion of the  TSA sale, as  previously
discussed  in Item  1A and  Item 1E,  and implementation  of the  details of the
transaction.
 
    The laws of the State of  Maine require periodic registration and  reporting
by  insurance companies domiciled within its  jurisdiction, which control or are
controlled by other corporations or persons. This constitutes, by definition,  a
holding  company system. UNUM  America is domiciled  in Maine and  is subject to
these laws.  New York,  which is  the  domiciliary state  of First  UNUM;  South
Carolina,  which is the domiciliary state of Colonial Life; and Wisconsin, which
is the domiciliary state of Commercial Life, have similar laws. Accordingly, the
UNUM insurance  subsidiaries  are registered  as  members of  the  UNUM  holding
company  system in the states of Maine,  New York, South Carolina and Wisconsin.
The statutes of these states require periodic disclosure concerning the ultimate
controlling person and  intercorporate transactions within  the holding  company
system, some of which require prior approval.
 
    Effective   December  31,  1991,  UNUM  America  merged  with  two  of  UNUM
Corporation's  wholly-owned  Maine  life   insurance  subsidiaries,  UNUM   Life
Insurance Company ("UNUM Life") and UNUM Pension and Insurance Company ("UPIC"),
with UNUM America remaining as the surviving corporation. In connection with the
merger of UNUM Life and UPIC into UNUM America, UNUM Life ceased to maintain its
licensing  status in the State of New York effective December 31, 1991, with all
future New York business being transacted by  First UNUM. As a condition of  New
York  regulatory approval, UNUM America agreed to maintain a security deposit in
the State of New York equal to 102% of outstanding statutory liabilities to  New
York  policyholders, insureds and  claimants of UNUM  Life. The security deposit
consists of certain  cash and invested  assets. An initial  deposit was made  in
February  1992  and,  at December  31,  1995,  the required  deposit  was $845.3
million. UNUM America has the ability  to withdraw assets from this account  and
to  substitute  other assets  at  its discretion.  The  balance of  the security
deposit will  be  reviewed  and  adjusted  at  least  annually  based  upon  the
outstanding liabilities described above. In the event of the consummation of the
TSA  sale, as described in  Item 1A and 1E, the  balance of the security deposit
may be adjusted based on the outstanding liabilities of the TSA business.

L.  PARTICIPATION FUND ACCOUNT
 
    Participating policies  issued prior  to November  14, 1986,  by the  former
Union  Mutual Life Insurance Company  ("Union Mutual") will remain participating
as long as they remain in force.  A Participation Fund Account ("PFA") has  been
established   for  the  sole  benefit  of   all  of  Union  Mutual's  individual
participating life and annuity policies and contracts. At December 31, 1995, the
PFA had $364.2 million in assets, which  were held by UNUM America. UNUM  agreed
to  pay certain expenses associated  with the PFA and  at December 31, 1995, the
reserve for the present value of such expenses was $15.0 million.
 
    PFA assets, investment earnings and income from operations are not available
to UNUM America or UNUM during the operation or upon the termination of the PFA.
In the unlikely event that the assets of the PFA are not adequate to provide for
policyholder benefits (exclusive of dividends,  which are not guaranteed),  UNUM
America  would be required  to provide for  any shortfall, and  such amounts, if
any, would reduce earnings of UNUM America and UNUM.
 
    All  operating  data  of  the  individual  participating  life  and  annuity
contracts  has been excluded from the  Consolidated Statements of Income and all
other operating data included in this report unless otherwise noted. The  assets
and  liabilities  associated with  the  participating business  are  included in
UNUM's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
    UNUM owns home office property consisting of five office buildings and  four
service  buildings located throughout the Portland,  Maine, area. UNUM also owns
an office building  in the  United Kingdom,  which is  the home  office of  UNUM
Limited. The home office of the Colonial Companies is located in Columbia, South
Carolina,  and  is also  owned by  UNUM.  In addition,  UNUM leases,  on periods
principally from three to six years, office  and warehouse space for use by  its
home office, affiliates, and sales forces.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    In  the  normal  course of  its  business  operations, UNUM  is  involved in
litigation from time  to time with  claimants, beneficiaries and  others, and  a
number  of  lawsuits  were pending  at  December  31, 1995.  In  the  opinion of
management, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from this litigation is  not
expected  to  have  a  material adverse  effect  on  the  consolidated financial
position or the consolidated operating results of UNUM.
 
    On December 29, 1993, UNUM filed a suit in the United States District  Court
for  the District  of Maine, seeking  a federal  income tax refund.  The suit is
based on a claim for a deduction in certain prior tax years, for $652 million in
cash and  stock  distributed  to  policyholders  in  connection  with  the  1986
conversion  of Union Mutual Life Insurance  Company to a stock company. Although
UNUM believes  its claims  are meritorious,  the United  States is  aggressively
resisting  the claims and the ultimate recovery, if any, cannot be determined at
this time.
 
ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
    No matter was submitted to a  vote of shareholders, through solicitation  of
proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of 1995.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS
 
    The  principal markets in  which UNUM's common  stock is traded  are the New
York Stock Exchange  and the  Pacific Stock  Exchange. UNUM's  ticker symbol  is
"UNM."  As of  December 31,  1995, there were  24,153 shareholders  of record of
common stock.  Information  concerning restrictions  on  the ability  of  UNUM's
subsidiaries  to  transfer  funds to  UNUM  in  the form  of  cash  dividends is
described in Item 8 (Note 12).
 
    The market  price  (as quoted  by  the New  York  Stock Exchange)  and  cash
dividends  paid, per share of  UNUM's common stock, by  calendar quarter for the
past two years were as follows:

CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW
 
    In 1995, net income increased by $126.4 million to $281.1 million, or  $3.87
per  share, from $154.7 million, or $2.09 per share, in 1994. When the following
significant items,  as described  below, are  excluded: the  increased  realized
investment  gains  resulting  primarily  from  the  sale  of  the  common  stock
portfolio, the  increased  reserves  resulting  from  the  lowering  of  certain
disability  product reserve  discount rates, and  the increased  group long term
disability ("group LTD") reserves for incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims,
all of  which  took  place  in  1995;  and  the  individual  disability  reserve
strengthening recorded in 1994, income before income taxes slightly decreased in
1995.  The decrease was primarily attributable  to higher benefit ratios at UNUM
Limited and  in the  group LTD  and group  life businesses,  increased  interest
expense and lower interest spread margins on the tax sheltered annuity business.
Partially  offsetting  these items  were  increased investment  income,  a lower
benefit ratio  in  the individual  disability  line of  business  and  continued
expense  management.  The decrease  in income  before income  taxes in  1994 was
primarily due to unfavorable claims experience in the individual disability  and
group LTD businesses.
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS FOR 1995 AND 1994
 
    During  second quarter  1995, UNUM  sold virtually  all of  the common stock
portfolio of its United States  subsidiaries, primarily due to consideration  of
statutory  capital requirements associated with  investment in common stocks and
to increase future  investment income. The  sale of the  common stock  portfolio
contributed to significantly higher realized investment gains than in 1994. UNUM
reinvested the proceeds from the sale of the common stock portfolio primarily in
investment grade fixed income assets, which has decreased the required amount of
statutory  capital  for  regulatory purposes  and  increased  investment income.
Dependent on capital considerations  and market conditions,  UNUM may invest  in
equity securities in the future.
 
    Reserves  for certain disability  products are discounted  using an interest
rate which is a composite yield of assets matched with each product. As a result
of the sale of the common  stock portfolio, which had partially supported  these
disability  reserves, and the subsequent  reinvestment of the proceeds primarily
in investment grade fixed  income assets at yields  below the average  portfolio
yield,  certain reserve discount rates were  lowered during second quarter 1995.
The effect  of lowering  these discount  rates was  an increase  to the  reserve
liabilities  and benefits to policyholders  reported in the Disability Insurance
segment of $128.6  million and a  decrease in  net income of  $83.6 million,  or
$1.15 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1995. The discount rate used to
determine  the group  LTD reserves  was reduced  to 8.00%  at June  30, 1995, as
compared with 9.18% at December  31, 1994. At December  31, 1995, the group  LTD
discount  rate  was  7.94%. Management  expects  the reserve  discount  rate for
certain disability products will further  decline, since current cash flows  are
invested in high quality assets at current yields, which are below the composite
yield of the existing assets purchased in prior years. UNUM periodically adjusts
prices  on both existing and new business in an effort to mitigate the impact of
the current interest rate environment.
 
    During 1995, UNUM increased the group LTD reserves for IBNR claims by  $38.4
million,  which decreased net income  by $25.0 million, or  $0.34 per share, for
the year ended December 31, 1995.  IBNR reserves, which are established to  fund
anticipated case reserves for claims that have been incurred but not reported to
UNUM,  are actuarially established based on various factors, including incidence
levels  and  claims  severity.  The  increased  IBNR  reserves  were  based   on
management's  judgment that claims currently incurred  but not yet reported will
reflect increased levels of claims incidence and severity. It is not possible to
predict whether future incidence  levels or claims  severity will be  consistent
with UNUM's assumptions, or will improve or deteriorate.
 
    Throughout  1994, UNUM's individual disability business experienced a higher
incidence of new  claims and a  disproportionate number of  large claims,  which
management  attributed to  certain geographic  and occupational  segments of the
business, particularly physicians. During the third quarter of 1994,  management
concluded  that  the  deterioration of  claims  experience was  not  a temporary
fluctuation in certain segments of the business, but was indicative of  expected
claim  trends for the future. As a result, in third quarter 1994, UNUM increased
reserves for  existing claims  by $83.3  million and  strengthened reserves  for
estimated  future losses by  $109.1 million. These  increased reserves reflected
management's expectations of morbidity  trends for the existing  non-cancellable
individual  disability  business.  This  reserve  strengthening  resulted  in an
increase to benefits to policyholders in the Consolidated Statement of Income of
$192.4 million and  a decrease to  net income  of $125.1 million,  or $1.69  per
share,  for the  year ended  December 31,  1994. It  is not  possible to predict
whether morbidity trends will be consistent with UNUM's assumptions; however, as
of December 31, 1995, management  believes that the strengthened reserve  levels
continue to be adequate.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
    On  January 24, 1996, UNUM America entered into an agreement for the sale of
its group tax-sheltered annuity  ("TSA") business to  The Lincoln National  Life
Insurance  Company ("Lincoln Life"), a part of Lincoln National Corporation, and
to a  new New  York insurance  subsidiary of  Lincoln Life.  The agreement  also
contemplates  that First UNUM  will enter into a  similar agreement with Lincoln
Life's New York insurance subsidiary. The  sale, which is subject to  regulatory
approvals,  involves approximately 1,700 group  contractholders and assets under
management of approximately $3 billion. The agreement initially contemplates the
reinsurance of these contracts under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. These
contracts  will  then  be  reinsured  pursuant  to  an  assumption   reinsurance
arrangement  upon consent  of the  TSA contractholders  and/or participants. The
purchase price (ceding commission)  at closing is  expected to be  approximately
$70  million. It is anticipated that it will take several months (perhaps six to
nine months) to  obtain the necessary  approvals and otherwise  close the  sale.
There  is no guarantee that the sale will close. Including the expected purchase
price of approximately $70 million, management expects to generate approximately
$160 million of statutory  capital from this transaction.  Plans for the use  of
this capital may include repaying debt, investing in new and existing businesses
and stock repurchase.
 
    On  February  7, 1996,  UNUM announced  plans to  merge its  Commercial Life
Insurance Company  affiliate  into UNUM  America  to accelerate  growth  of  its
special risk business, increase its commitment to the association group business
and  to improve operating and capital efficiencies. The merger will be effective
December 31, 1996, subject to regulatory approvals. During 1996, UNUM expects to
incur costs of approximately  $7 million related to  the merger and  anticipates
annual  savings of a  similar amount following  the merger due  to reductions in
operating costs.
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
    Effective January  1,  1995,  UNUM  adopted  FAS  No.  114,  "Accounting  by
Creditors  for Impairment of a Loan," and  FAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a  Loan - Income Recognition  and Disclosures," which  defined
the  principles to measure and record a loan when it is probable that a creditor
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms  of
the  loan agreement. The adoption of FAS 114 and FAS 118 did not have a material
effect on UNUM's results of operations or financial position.
 
    Effective January 1, 1994, UNUM adopted FAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities," which specified the accounting  and
reporting  for certain investments in equity  securities and for all investments
in debt securities.  Upon the  adoption of  FAS 115,  UNUM increased  unrealized
gains  on  available for  sale securities  included  in stockholders'  equity on
January 1, 1994, by $41.8  million (net of deferred  taxes of $22.5 million)  to
reflect the unrealized holding gains on fixed maturities classified as available
for  sale that were previously carried at amortized cost. In accordance with FAS
115, prior  year consolidated  financial statements  have not  been restated  to
reflect  the change  in accounting  principle. The adoption  of FAS  115 did not
affect 1994 net income.
 
    Effective January 1, 1993,  UNUM adopted FAS 106,  which changed the  method
for  recognition of the cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions from
a cash basis to an  accrual basis over the years  in which employees render  the
related  services. UNUM elected to recognize the FAS 106 liability at January 1,
1993, of $48.8  million as a  cumulative effect of  an accounting change,  which
decreased net income by $32.1 million, or $0.40 per share, in 1993.
 
    Also  effective January  1, 1993,  UNUM adopted  FAS 109,  which changed the
method for  calculating and  reporting deferred  income taxes  in the  financial
statements  from the  deferred method  to the  liability method.  The cumulative
effect of this accounting change amounted to a $20.0 million increase, or  $0.25
per share, in 1993 net income.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
    Effective  tax rates,  which reflect income  tax expense as  a percentage of
pretax  income,  were  26.4%,  22.1%  and   32.2%  for  1995,  1994  and   1993,
respectively.  The increase in the effective tax rate for 1995 was primarily due
to increased pretax earnings, as compared with 1994. Reported income tax expense
was below  the federal  statutory  tax rate  of 35%  for  1995, 1994  and  1993,
primarily  due  to  tax  savings  from  investments  in  tax-exempt  securities.
Management anticipates the effective tax rate for 1996 will be higher than 1995,
primarily related to reduced levels  of tax-exempt income. Although  investments
in  tax-exempt  securities result  in increased  consolidated net  income, these
investments reduce UNUM's business segments' income before income taxes.
 
    On August  10,  1993,  legislation  was  enacted  to  increase  the  federal
corporate  income tax rate  of 34% to  35%, retroactive to  January 1, 1993. The
change in tax  rates resulted  in a  $7.8 million,  or $0.10  per share,  charge
related  to the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding the adjustment
to deferred income tax expense of $7.8 million for the enacted tax rate  change,
the 1993 effective tax rate would have been 30.5%.

    The  Disability  Insurance  segment  includes  disability  products  offered
through: UNUM  America, First  UNUM Life  Insurance Company  ("First UNUM")  and
Commercial  Life Insurance  Company ("Commercial  Life") in  North America; UNUM
Limited in the United Kingdom; and UNUM Japan Accident Insurance Company Limited
in Japan.  The products  included  in this  segment  are group  LTD,  individual
disability,  group  short  term  disability  ("group  STD"),  association  group
disability, disability reinsurance and long term care insurance.
 
SUMMARY
 
    The Disability Insurance segment  reported slightly decreased income  before
income  taxes  in 1995,  as compared  with  1994, when  the following  items, as
described below, are excluded: the increased realized investment gains resulting
primarily from the sale  of the common stock  portfolio, the increased  reserves
resulting  from  the lowering  of  certain disability  product  reserve discount
rates, the  increased group  LTD reserves  for IBNR  claims, and  the  increased
reserves for unpaid claims related to the association group disability business,
all  of  which  took  place  in  1995;  and  the  individual  disability reserve
strengthening and  the  related restructuring  charge,  recorded in  1994.  This
decrease  was primarily attributable  to a higher benefit  ratio at UNUM Limited
and   in   group   LTD,   and   the   inclusion   of   the   results   of   UNUM
 
                                       19
<PAGE>
Japan's  operations  in the  Disability Insurance  segment effective  January 1,
1995. Partially offsetting these decreases  were increased investment income,  a
lower benefit ratio in the individual disability business, and continued expense
management.
 
    During  1995, UNUM sold virtually  all of the common  stock portfolio of its
United States subsidiaries, primarily due to consideration of statutory  capital
requirements  associated with investment in common stocks and to increase future
investment income.  The  sale  of  the common  stock  portfolio  contributed  to
significantly  higher  realized  investment  gains in  1995  for  the Disability
Insurance segment. UNUM  reinvested the  proceeds from  the sale  of the  common
stock  portfolio primarily  in investment grade  fixed income  assets, which has
decreased the required amount of  statutory capital for regulatory purposes  and
increased  investment  income. Dependent  on  capital considerations  and market
conditions, UNUM may invest in equity securities in the future.
 
    Reserves for certain  disability products are  discounted using an  interest
rate  that is a composite yield of assets matched with each product. The sale of
the common stock portfolio, which partially supported these disability reserves,
and the subsequent reinvestment  of the proceeds  primarily in investment  grade
fixed  income assets with yields below  the average portfolio yield, resulted in
lower reserve discount rates. The result of lowering these discount rates was an
increase to  the reserve  liabilities and  benefits to  policyholders of  $128.6
million,  reported in  the second  quarter of  1995. The  discount rate  used to
determine the group  LTD reserves  was reduced  to 8.00%  at June  30, 1995,  as
compared  with 9.18% at December  31, 1994. At December  31, 1995, the group LTD
discount rate was 7.94%.
 
    Increased investment income in the Disability Insurance segment for 1995 was
primarily a result  of the reinvestment  of the  proceeds from the  sale of  the
common  stock portfolio into investment grade fixed income assets. This increase
in investment income was partially offset by the effects of lower discount rates
for certain disability  products. Management expects  the reserve discount  rate
for  certain disability products will further  decline, since current cash flows
are invested  in high  quality assets  at current  yields, which  are below  the
composite   yield  of  the  existing  assets  purchased  in  prior  years.  UNUM
periodically adjusts prices on  both existing and new  business in an effort  to
mitigate the impact of the current interest rate environment.
 
    During  1995, UNUM increased the group LTD reserves for IBNR claims by $38.4
million. IBNR reserves, which are established to fund anticipated case  reserves
for  claims that have  been incurred but  not reported to  UNUM, are actuarially
established based  on various  factors, including  incidence levels  and  claims
severity.  The increased IBNR reserves were  based on management's judgment that
claims currently incurred but not yet reported will reflect increased levels  of
claims  incidence and  severity. It  is not  possible to  predict whether future
incidence levels or claims severity will be consistent with UNUM's  assumptions,
or will improve or deteriorate.
 
    During the fourth quarter of 1995, UNUM increased reserves for unpaid claims
related  to the  association group disability  business by  $15.0 million, which
decreased net income by  $9.8 million, or  $0.14 per share,  for the year  ended
December 31, 1995. These increased reserves reflect management's expectations of
slower  than expected claim  recoveries. In 1995, the  association group line of
business has been  negatively affected by  unfavorable claims experience,  which
management  has attributed  to certain  geographical and  occupational segments,
particularly dentists and physicians. Management  is taking pricing actions  and
strengthening underwriting standards to address this claims experience.
 
    Throughout  1994, UNUM's individual disability business experienced a higher
incidence of new  claims and a  disproportionate number of  large claims,  which
management  attributed to  certain geographic  and occupational  segments of the
business, particularly physicians. During the third quarter of 1994,  management
concluded  that  the  deterioration of  claims  experience was  not  a temporary
fluctuation in certain segments of the business, but was indicative of  expected
claim  trends for the future. As a result, in third quarter 1994, UNUM increased
reserves for  existing claims  by $83.3  million and  strengthened reserves  for
estimated  future losses by  $109.1 million. These  increased reserves reflected
management's expectations of morbidity  trends for the existing  non-cancellable
individual  disability business. It is not possible to predict whether morbidity
trends will be consistent with UNUM's  assumptions; however, as of December  31,
1995,  management believes that  the strengthened reserve  levels continue to be
adequate.
 
    In the  fourth quarter  of 1994,  UNUM  recorded a  pretax charge  of  $14.4
million  related  to  the  decision  to  discontinue  the  individual disability
non-cancellable product and  the acceleration of  organizational changes  within
UNUM  America, which  increased operating expenses  and decreased  net income by
$9.4 million, or  $0.13 per share,  for the  year ended December  31, 1994.  The
charge consisted of $9.2 million for severance costs for approximately 150 field
and  250 home office employees and $5.2 million for exit costs of certain leased
facilities and equipment.
 
                                       20
<PAGE>
    Reserves  for  unpaid  claims  are  estimates  based  on  UNUM's  historical
experience  and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current
developments, anticipated trends, risk management programs and renewal  actions.
Many  factors affect actuarial calculations of claim reserves, including but not
limited to interest rates and current and anticipated incidence rates,  recovery
rates,  and economic and societal  conditions. Reserve estimates and assumptions
are periodically reviewed and updated with any resulting adjustments to reserves
reflected in current operating  results. Given the  complexity of the  reserving
process,  the  ultimate  liability  may  be more  or  less  than  such estimates
indicate.
 
    In 1995, 1994 and 1993, claim block acquisitions generated one-time  premium
in  the Disability  Insurance segment of  $63.8 million, $8.6  million and $58.3
million, respectively, for group LTD; $4.3 million and $15.0 million in 1995 and
1994, respectively,  for long  term care;  and $25.8  million in  1994 for  UNUM
Limited. Management intends to pursue additional claim block acquisitions in the
future.
 
    The  ratio of operating expenses  to premiums was 22.7%,  24.5% and 25.2% in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The decreases in 1995 and 1994 were primarily
attributable to continued efforts to manage expenses and increased premium  from
1995 claim block acquisitions, which do not have proportionally higher expenses.
Deferrals  of policy acquisition costs decreased  in 1995 primarily due to lower
levels  of  individual  disability  sales.  The  increase  in  deferred   policy
acquisition  costs in  1994 was  primarily attributable  to deferrals  of higher
marketing costs associated with increased sales and renewal activity.
 
    Excluding the individual  disability reserve strengthening  and the  related
restructuring  charge, income before income taxes decreased in 1994, as compared
with 1993. This decrease was primarily attributable to a higher benefit ratio in
individual disability and in  group LTD, partially  offset by continued  expense
management.
 
GROUP LONG TERM DISABILITY
 
    The  group LTD premium growth in  1995 and 1994 reflected annualized premium
from new sales, selected  price increases and acquisitions  of closed blocks  of
claims.  Group  LTD  sales decreased  in  1995, which  management  attributed to
significant price increases in certain segments of the business. Rate  increases
to  address unfavorable experience on selected  segments of the inforce business
also contributed  to the  decline in  persistency rates  for 1995  and 1994.  In
general,  case terminations from rate increases have occurred in less profitable
segments of the business.  Management expects to continue  to seek inforce  case
rate   increases,   as  appropriate,   given   claims  experience,   to  improve
profitability. However, such  rate actions  may increase  case terminations  and
decrease the persistency rate of the group LTD business.
 
    During  1995 and 1994, management  implemented and strengthened various risk
management programs to address the  unfavorable claims experience in group  LTD.
In  addition to the selected  price increases on new  and inforce business, more
stringent underwriting  practices,  and the  reduction  of benefit  options  for
certain  segments of the  business, management established  special claims units
for both its group LTD and individual disability businesses to address  specific
aspects   of  disability  claims,  including   complex  and  fraudulent  claims.
Additionally, management  implemented new  group  LTD contract  provisions  that
provide   risk  management  features  and  claimant  rehabilitation  incentives.
Management continually reviews the benefits  management process to identify  and
strengthen risk management policies and procedures.
 
    During  1995, group LTD's  benefit ratio increased  slightly after excluding
the effects of lowering the group LTD discount  rate as a result of the sale  of
the  common stock portfolio in the second  quarter of 1995 and of increasing the
group LTD reserves for IBNR claims. This increase was primarily attributable  to
increased  claims  severity.  However,  the effect  of  the  increase  in claims
severity was partially offset by continued improvements in claim incidence rates
and claim recoveries, which management attributes to risk management programs.
 
    Management continues to address the unfavorable claim trends in group LTD by
periodically adjusting prices on selected new and inforce business, implementing
more  stringent  underwriting  guidelines  and  strengthening  risk   management
programs.  Management believes these actions have strengthened UNUM's ability to
deal with these  claim trends  and the  current interest  rate environment.  The
level  of  earnings of  the  group LTD  product will  be  a function  of various
factors, including but  not limited  to, the effectiveness  of these  continuing
actions over time.
 
UNUM LIMITED
 
    During 1995, UNUM Limited's group long term disability business continued to
be adversely affected by unfavorable claims experience, which began to emerge in
late  1994. UNUM Limited has experienced a  higher incidence of new claims and a
disproportionate number of large  claims in 1995, as  compared with 1994,  which
management  has  attributed to  certain segments  of the  business, particularly
lawyers and accountants. To address  the current claims environment,  management
has  increased prices on those segments of  the business that have experienced a
higher incidence of new
 
                                       21
<PAGE>
claims, implemented more stringent underwriting standards and strengthened  risk
management  programs. The level of earnings for  UNUM Limited will be a function
of various factors,  including but not  limited to, the  effectiveness of  these
actions  over time. Due to the relative size of the U.K. block of business, UNUM
Limited's operating results can exhibit claims variability.
 
    During 1995, the  U.S. dollar  weakened slightly against  the British  pound
sterling,  increasing UNUM Limited's  earnings as reported  in U.S. dollars. The
weighted average exchange rate was approximately $1.58, $1.53 and $1.51 for  the
years  ended December 31,  1995, 1994 and  1993. At December  31, 1995, the spot
rate had decreased to $1.55.
 
INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY
 
    During 1995,  the growth  in  individual disability's  premium slowed  as  a
result  of  management's  decision  in  late  1994  to  discontinue  selling the
non-cancellable individual disability insurance product in the United States and
to transition to  the new  guaranteed renewable  Lifelong Disability  Protection
product,  which was introduced during  the second quarter of  1995. Sales of the
traditional, fixed  price,  non-cancellable individual  disability  product  are
being  discontinued  in  each state  following  regulatory approval  of  the new
product. As of the end  of 1995, the new product  has been approved for sale  in
most states.
 
    Throughout  1994, UNUM's individual disability business experienced a higher
incidence of new  claims and a  disproportionate number of  large claims,  which
management  attributed to  certain geographic  and occupational  segments of the
business, particularly  physicians.  Management  believes that  changes  in  and
consolidation  of the health care  delivery system in the  United States and the
increased prevalence  of emerging  and often  subjective types  of  disabilities
contributed  to increased benefit  costs. Unlike the  group long term disability
product, management has  limited ability  to manage the  claims risk  associated
with non-cancellable individual disability business, since UNUM is contractually
unable to reprice or cancel inforce policies that became unprofitable because of
changes  in claims  experience that  were unforeseen  when the  policy was sold.
During the third quarter of 1994, management concluded that the deterioration of
claims experience was  not a temporary  fluctuation in certain  segments of  the
business,  but was  indicative of  expected claim  trends for  the future.  As a
result, in third quarter  1994, UNUM increased reserves  for existing claims  by
$83.3  million and strengthened  reserves for estimated  future losses by $109.1
million.  These  increased  reserves  reflected  management's  expectations   of
morbidity   trends  for  the   existing  non-cancellable  individual  disability
business. It  is  not possible  to  predict  whether morbidity  trends  will  be
consistent with UNUM's assumptions; however, as of December 31, 1995, management
believes that the strengthened reserve levels continue to be adequate.
 
    The  individual  disability business  experienced a  lower benefit  ratio in
1995, as compared with 1994, after  excluding the effects of increased  reserves
resulting  from  lowering the  individual  disability reserve  discount  rate in
second quarter 1995 and  the reserve strengthening recorded  in 1994. The  lower
benefit  ratio  was  primarily  due  to lower  new  claims  incidence  rates for
physicians  in  1995;   however,  such  claims   incidence  rates  can   exhibit
variability.  During 1995, lower expenses, partially offset by reduced deferrals
of policy acquisition costs resulting from lower individual disability sales  in
1995,  also contributed  to the  improved results  of the  individual disability
business.
 
    During the fourth quarter of  1994, excess-of-loss reinsurance totaling  $60
million  over three years was purchased through a Lloyd's of London syndicate to
cover UNUM's exposure  to claims  exceeding levels assumed  in the  strengthened
reserves.  Management  continues  to  evaluate its  financial  options  for this
business, including reinsurance opportunities.
 
GROUP SHORT TERM DISABILITY
 
    Group STD's contribution to the Disability Insurance segment's income before
income taxes  increased significantly  in 1995  and 1994.  These increases  were
primarily  attributable to group STD's strong  premium growth and continued risk
and expense management. The record sales reported in 1995 reflected management's
continuing efforts  to cross-sell  the group  STD products  with the  group  LTD
business.

    The Special Risk Insurance segment includes group life products sold by UNUM
America  and First UNUM, special risk accident insurance sold by Commercial Life
and other  special  risk insurance  products.  The segment  also  includes  non-
disability  reinsurance  operations,  which  represent  UNUM's  participation in
various  reinsurance  pools,   and  the   reinsurance  underwriting   management
operations of Duncanson & Holt, Inc.
 
    Increased  sales  and  selected price  increases  on new  and  inforce cases
contributed to the group life premium growth of 13.7%. Rate increases to address
unfavorable experience on certain segments  of the inforce business  contributed
to  the decline in  group life persistency  rates for 1995  and 1994. Management
expects to continue  to seek  inforce case  rate increases,  as appropriate,  to
improve  profitability. Premium growth  in 1995 for  other special risk products
was primarily  attributable to  reinsurance operations,  which had  claim  block
acquisitions totaling $39.1 million and increased pool participation.
 
    The  decrease in income before income taxes for 1995, as compared with 1994,
was primarily attributable  to increased claims  in the group  life and  special
risk  accident insurance businesses,  combined with reduced  fee income from the
reinsurance  underwriting  management  operations.  Partially  offsetting  these
decreases  were continued  premium growth,  increased realized  investment gains
from the sale of the common  stock portfolio and favorable claims experience  in
certain  reinsurance pools. Due to the nature  of the risks underwritten and the
relative size of the blocks of businesses, several of the Special Risk Insurance
segment's products can exhibit claims variability.
 
    The Special Risk Insurance segment's income before income taxes increased in
1994, primarily due to  favorable claims experience in  the group life  business
and in special risk accident insurance, combined with premium growth and expense
management.  Partially offsetting these  increases were reduced  fee income from
the  reinsurance  underwriting  management  operations  and  unfavorable  claims
experience in certain reinsurance pools.

    The  Colonial Products segment  includes Colonial Life  & Accident Insurance
Company ("Colonial") and affiliates. Colonial, the principal subsidiary,  offers
payroll-deducted,  voluntary employee benefits to  employees at their worksites.
Accident and  sickness,  cancer and  life  insurance products  are  marketed  by
Colonial primarily through independent sales representatives.
 
    During  1995, Colonial  experienced improved  sales growth  as compared with
1994. These improved sales levels were attributed to increased productivity  and
the  offering of a  number of new  products. During 1995,  Colonial made further
investments to automate policy enrollment for new sales and to realign the sales
organization.  These  investments  reflect   management's  continued  focus   on
strategies   to  improve   sales  through   increasing  productivity,  enhancing
effectiveness, and differentiating Colonial  in the marketplace. Premium  growth
slowed  slightly again  in 1995, reflecting  the effects of  weaker sales growth
during 1994 and 1993; however, management believes that the record sales  levels
experienced during 1995, combined with the continuation of customer conservation
programs  and  investments being  made in  the sales  organization, will  have a
positive effect on future premium growth.
 
    Investment income increased during 1995, primarily because of increased cash
flows and additional income realized from the reinvestment of the proceeds  from
the  second quarter  1995 sale  of Colonial's  equity portfolio  into investment
grade fixed income assets. The sale of the equity portfolio also contributed  to
the  higher  level  of  realized  investment  gains  during  the  year. Realized
investment gains  for 1993  include gains  associated with  Colonial's sales  of
higher  yielding but  callable investments  to realign  its investment portfolio
with UNUM's investment philosophy.
 
    Colonial's benefit ratio improved again in  1995 to 49.7%, as compared  with
50.4% in 1994 and 51.4% in 1993. The lower benefit ratio was driven by continued
favorable  claims experience  and improved  incidence rates  across most product
lines. The  expense  ratio  remained virtually  unchanged  for  1995  reflecting
management's continued investment in the sales organization, offset by continued
efforts  to control  expenditures and  improved operating  effectiveness. During
1994, the  expense  ratio  increased  because  of  higher  than  expected  costs
associated  with sales  organization realignment and  litigation expenses, which
were partially offset by continued expense control efforts.
 
    Colonial's income before income taxes  increased in 1995, primarily  because
of increased investment income, higher realized investment gains and an improved
benefit  ratio. For 1994, income before income taxes decreased primarily because
of reduced realized investment gains and increased expenses, partially offset by
favorable claims experience.

    The Retirement Products segment  includes tax sheltered annuities  ("TSAs"),
which  are marketed by  UNUM America and  First UNUM, and  products which are no
longer actively  marketed by  UNUM,  including guaranteed  investment  contracts
("GICs"), deposit administration accounts ("DAs") and 401(k) plans.
 
    As  previously discussed in the  Consolidated Overview, UNUM America entered
into an agreement for the sale of its group TSA business to Lincoln Life, a part
of Lincoln National Corporation, and to  a new New York insurance subsidiary  of
Lincoln  Life. The agreement also contemplates that First UNUM will enter into a
similar agreement with Lincoln Life's  New York insurance subsidiary. The  group
TSA  business of  UNUM America  and First  UNUM accounted  for approximately $34
million of the Retirement Products segment's income before income taxes in 1995,
1994 and 1993.
 
    During  1995  and  1994,  investment   income  declined  primarily  due   to
investments   in  lower  yielding  tax-exempt   securities,  a  reduced  average
investment yield caused  by the  low interest  rate environment,  and a  reduced
invested  asset  base  under  management  for GICs,  DAs  and  401(k)  plans. To
facilitate the  expected sale  of the  TSA business  later in  1996,  management
expects  to  primarily  liquidate  fixed  maturities  and  accumulate  cash  and
short-term investments, which  will further reduce  investment yields earned  on
TSA assets during 1996.
 
    During 1994, UNUM implemented an investment strategy to increase investments
in tax-exempt securities. Although investments in tax-exempt securities resulted
in  increased consolidated net income,  these investments reduced the Retirement
Products segment's income before income taxes  by $7.6 million and $6.7  million
in 1995 and 1994, respectively. During 1995, primarily due to market conditions,
UNUM  ceased  the purchase  of tax-exempt  securities and  sold the  majority of
tax-exempt securities held by the TSA business.
 
    Since 1993, UNUM has offered the  holders of certain types of TSA  contracts
the  opportunity  to modify  their contracts.  The proposed  contract amendments
provide for UNUM to increase the  minimum guaranteed credited interest rates  in
return  for contractholders relinquishing the right to make lump-sum withdrawals
without an  associated fee.  As expected,  certain contract  holders elected  to
withdraw  their funds rather  than convert to  the modified contract provisions,
which has affected the overall growth of invested assets under management.
 
    During  1995,  interest  spread  margins  declined,  as  compared  with  the
unusually  favorable levels experienced during 1994  and 1993. As interest rates
declined in 1993, the rate and level of interest credited to TSA contractholders
declined as well. Despite a rising interest rate environment in 1994, the  level
of interest credited to TSA contractholders continued to
 
                                       25
<PAGE>
decline.  As a result, the TSA business experienced unusually favorable interest
spread margins during those years. Management expects the lower interest  spread
margins  in 1995 on  TSAs to continue,  which may reduce  future earnings of the
Retirement Products segment.
 
    The reduced asset base under management  for GICs, DAs and 401(k) plans  has
also  resulted in lower  revenues from investment income  and reduced amounts of
interest credited.  Management expects  continued decreases  in the  amounts  of
investment  income and  interest credited  as the  related GICs,  DAs and 401(k)
contracts mature  or terminate.  Management expects  future earnings  for  these
closed blocks of businesses to decline, reflecting their run-off nature.
 
    Income  before  income  taxes  increased in  1995,  as  compared  with 1994,
primarily due to  increased realized investment  gains from the  sale of  UNUM's
equity  portfolio during the  second quarter of 1995,  partially offset by lower
interest spread margins on TSAs. For 1994, the decrease in income before  income
taxes  was primarily attributable  to the declining income  levels of the closed
blocks of businesses.

</TABLE>
 
    Corporate includes transactions  that are  generally non-insurance  related.
The  increased loss  before income taxes  in 1995 was  primarily attributable to
increased interest expense on corporate borrowings, partially offset by  reduced
operating expenses. The increased loss before income taxes in 1994 was primarily
due  to increased interest  expense and increased  operating expenses related to
UNUM's investment in Japan.  Effective January 1, 1995,  the operations of  UNUM
Japan  are reported in the Disability Insurance segment. Costs related to UNUM's
investment in Japan prior to January 1, 1995, are reported as operating expenses
in Corporate.
 
BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
 
    Charges of $8.4 million  and $14.4 million were  recorded in 1995 and  1994,
respectively,  related to the acceleration of organizational changes within UNUM
America  and   the   decision   to   discontinue   the   individual   disability
non-cancellable  product. Partially offsetting the charge recorded in 1995 was a
$3.4  million  curtailment  gain,  related  to  workforce  reductions  in   UNUM
Corporation's  noncontributory defined benefit pension  plan. Of the total $22.8
million charge, UNUM paid $15.9 million during 1995, which represented severance
costs of $13.3 million for  373 of the 379  individuals included in the  charges
and  $2.6  million of  lease  costs. The  remaining  $6.9 million  includes $0.4
million of severance costs and $6.5 million  of lease costs, the total of  which
is  expected to be paid as follows: $3.4  million in 1996, $3.2 million in 1997,
and $0.3 million in 1998.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    UNUM's investment portfolio is concentrated in investment grade bonds.  UNUM
evaluates  total expected return after  consideration of all associated expenses
and losses,  within criteria  established for  each product  line. Product  line
investment  strategies are developed to complement business risks by meeting the
liquidity and solvency requirements of each product. UNUM purchases assets  with
maturities,  expected cash flows  and prepayment conditions  that are consistent
with these strategies. The nature and quality of the types of investments comply
with policies established by management,  which are more stringent overall  than
the  statutes  and  regulations imposed  by  the jurisdictions  in  which UNUM's
insurance subsidiaries are licensed.
 
    UNUM's investments are reported in the consolidated financial statements  at
net  realizable value or  net of any applicable  allowances for probable losses.
Allowances for mortgages and real estate held for sale are established based  on
a  review of specific assets  as well as the  overall portfolio, considering the
carrying value  of  the underlying  assets.  If a  decline  in market  value  is
considered  to be other  than temporary, the investment  is reduced to estimated
net realizable value  and the  reduction is  recorded as  a realized  investment
loss. UNUM discontinues the accrual of investment income on invested assets when
it  is determined that collectability is  doubtful. Management monitors the risk
associated with the invested asset  portfolio and regularly reviews and  adjusts
the allowance for probable losses.
 
    During  the second quarter  of 1995, UNUM  sold virtually all  of the common
stock  portfolio  of   its  United   States  subsidiaries,   primarily  due   to
consideration  of statutory  capital requirements associated  with investment in
common stocks and to increase future investment income. UNUM has reinvested  the
proceeds  from the  sale of the  common stock portfolio  primarily in investment
grade fixed  income  assets.  Dependent on  capital  considerations  and  market
conditions, UNUM may invest in equity securities in the future.
 
                                       26
<PAGE>
    At  December 31, 1995,  the composition of UNUM's  $11.7 billion of invested
assets was 78.1% fixed maturities, 10.0% mortgage loans, 1.9% real estate,  0.2%
equity  securities, and 9.8%  other invested assets.  To facilitate the expected
sale of  the  TSA  business  later in  1996,  management  expects  to  primarily
liquidate fixed maturities and accumulate cash and short-term investments.
 
    Gross  realized investment  gains were  $287.0 million,  $117.0 million, and
$85.2 million, and gross  realized investment losses  were $61.9 million,  $71.4
million,  and $35.8  million for  the years ended  December 31,  1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.
 
FIXED MATURITIES
 
    Effective January  1,  1994,  UNUM  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standard
("FAS")  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and Equity
Securities,"  which  specified   the  accounting  and   reporting  for   certain
investments  in equity  securities and for  all investments  in debt securities.
UNUM adopted the provisions for FAS  115 for these investments held or  acquired
after  January 1, 1994. Upon the adoption  of FAS 115, UNUM increased unrealized
gains on  available for  sale  securities included  in stockholders'  equity  on
January  1, 1994, by $41.8  million (net of deferred  taxes of $22.5 million) to
reflect the unrealized holding gains on fixed maturities classified as available
for sale which  were previously  carried at  amortized cost.  In addition,  UNUM
reclassified  certain fixed  maturities from held  to maturity  to available for
sale on January 1, 1994, in connection with the adoption of FAS 115.
 
    In November 1995, the  FASB issued "A Guide  to Implementation of  Statement
115  on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which
provided  a  one-time  opportunity  to  reassess  the  appropriateness  of   the
classifications  of securities  described in  FAS 115,  and to  reclassify fixed
maturities from the held to maturity category without calling into question  the
intent  to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. On December 31,
1995, UNUM reassessed  its fixed  maturity portfolio  and as  allowed under  the
implementation guidance, reclassified fixed maturities with an amortized cost of
$6,082.8  million and a related  net unrealized gain of  $393.0 million from the
held to  maturity  category  to  available for  sale.  In  connection  with  the
reclassification of the held to maturity fixed maturities to available for sale,
on  December 31,  1995, UNUM  adjusted its  unpaid claims  by $261.2  million to
reflect the changes that would have  been necessary if the unrealized gains  and
losses  related to  fixed maturities classified  as available for  sale had been
realized.
 
    At December 31, 1995, the  fixed maturity portfolio included $139.4  million
of  below investment  grade bonds  (below "Baa")  recorded at  fair value, which
represented 1.5%  of  the  fixed  maturity  portfolio,  and  had  an  associated
amortized  cost of $133.8 million.  At December 31, 1994,  the carrying value of
below investment grade bonds included in the fixed maturity portfolio was $193.8
million, which represented  2.5% of  the fixed  maturity portfolio,  and had  an
associated  market value of $193.4 million. Virtually all of the nonconvertible,
below investment  grade  bonds were  purchased  at investment  grade,  but  were
subsequently  downgraded.  UNUM's investment  policy is  to invest  primarily in
fixed maturities of investment grade quality. Selected purchases of  convertible
subordinated  debentures, which  UNUM considered  to be  part of  its investment
strategy for  equity  securities,  have  contributed  to  the  amount  of  below
investment grade bonds. Fixed maturity ratings are obtained from external rating
agencies,  and  if not  externally  rated, are  rated  by UNUM  internally using
similar  methods.  Management  does  not  expect  any  risks  or   uncertainties
associated  with below  investment grade bonds  to have a  significant affect on
UNUM's consolidated financial  position or  results of operations.  UNUM had  no
fixed maturities delinquent 60 days or more at December 31, 1995. The percentage
of  fixed  maturities  delinquent  60  days or  more,  compared  to  total fixed
maturities, was 0.25% at December 31, 1994.
 
    During 1995, UNUM sold fixed maturities of two issuers classified as held to
maturity with an amortized cost of $4.0 million, and realized a net loss of $1.2
million on the sales.  The bonds were sold  due to significant deterioration  of
the  issuers' creditworthiness, as evidenced by bankruptcy filings. During 1994,
UNUM sold fixed maturities of five  issuers classified as held to maturity  with
an  amortized cost of $49.8 million due to evidence of significant deterioration
of the issuers' creditworthiness. These sales resulted in a net realized loss of
$3.0 million.
 
MORTGAGES
 
    At December 31, 1995, and 1994, UNUM's mortgage loans were $1,163.4  million
and  $1,216.3  million,  respectively.  Management  establishes  allowances  for
mortgage loans based  upon a  review of individual  loans and  the overall  loan
portfolio,  considering  the value  of the  underlying  collateral. UNUM  uses a
comprehensive rating system to evaluate the  investment and credit risk of  each
mortgage loan and to target specific properties for inspection and reevaluation.
The  percentage  of mortgage  loans delinquent  60  days or  more on  a contract
delinquency  basis  was  0.2%  and  1.8%   at  December  31,  1995,  and   1994,
respectively.
 
                                       27
<PAGE>
    Management  believes that  its mortgage  loan portfolio  is well diversified
geographically and  among  property  types.  UNUM's  incidence  of  new  problem
mortgage  loans has continued  to decline in 1995,  as overall economic activity
improved modestly,  and  many of  the  real estate  markets  in which  UNUM  has
mortgage  loans  stabilized. Management  expects  a modest  level  of additional
delinquencies and problem loans in the future. Management believes the allowance
provided on  mortgage  loans as  of  December 31,  1995,  is adequate  to  cover
probable losses.
 
    Effective  January  1,  1995,  UNUM  adopted  Financial  Accounting Standard
("FAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and FAS No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and
Disclosures," which defined the principles to measure and record a loan when  it
is  probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The adoption of FAS 114 and  FAS
118  did not have a material affect on UNUM's results of operations or financial
position.
 
    In general,  impaired  loans  as  defined by  FAS  114  compare  with  loans
previously defined and disclosed as problem and potential problem loans. Problem
loans  were defined as loans that were delinquent  60 days or more on a contract
delinquency  basis.  Potential  problem  loans  were  defined  as  current   and
performing  loans with which  management had some concerns  about the ability of
the borrower to comply with present loan terms and whose book value exceeded the
market value of the underlying collateral. At December 31, 1995, impaired  loans
totaled  $50.1 million, as compared with  $58.5 million of problem and potential
problem loans at December  31, 1994. Included in  the $50.1 million of  impaired
loans  was $38.4  million of  loans which had  a related  allowance for probable
losses of  $7.1  million,  and $11.7  million  of  loans which  had  no  related
allowance  for probable  losses. Interest  lost on  impaired loans  in 1995, and
problem and potential problem loans in 1994 and 1993, was not material.
 
    Mortgage loans that were restructured prior to the adoption of FAS 114,  are
defined  by UNUM as loans whose terms  have been modified to interest rates less
than market at  the time of  restructure and are  currently expected to  perform
pursuant  to such modified terms. UNUM  modifies loans to protect its investment
and only when  it is  anticipated that  the borrower will  be able  to meet  the
modified  terms. As  of December 31,  1995, restructured  mortgage loans totaled
$59.9 million, as  compared with $73.6  million at December  31, 1994.  Interest
lost on restructured loans was not material in 1995, 1994 or 1993.
 
    Realized  investment  losses  related  to impaired  mortgage  loans  in 1995
amounted to $9.2 million,  compared with realized  investment losses related  to
restructured  and problem  mortgage loans of  $8.5 million and  $4.8 million for
1994 and 1993, respectively.  Impaired mortgage loans as  of December 31,  1995,
are  not expected to have a significant  impact on UNUM's results of operations,
liquidity, or capital resources.
 
REAL ESTATE
 
    At December  31, 1995,  investment real  estate amounted  to $222.2  million
compared  with $190.8  million at December  31, 1994.  UNUM purchases investment
real estate  in  selected markets  when  certain investment  criteria  are  met.
Investment  real estate is intended to be  held long-term and is carried at cost
less  accumulated  depreciation.   Occasionally,  investment   real  estate   is
reclassified  and revalued as real estate held  for sale when it no longer meets
UNUM's investment criteria.
 
    At December 31, 1995,  real estate held for  sale amounted to $35.5  million
compared  with $31.0 million at December  31, 1994. Real estate acquired through
foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure. Real estate held
for sale is included in other assets  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and  is
valued net of an allowance which reduces the carrying value to the lower of fair
value  less estimated  costs to  sell, or cost.  Additions to  the allowance for
probable losses  related to  real  estate held  for  sale resulted  in  realized
investment  losses of $6.3 million, $0.8 million and $18.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Additions to the allowance
represent charges to net realized investment gains less recoveries.
 
    Given the  current  real  estate environment,  additional  foreclosures  are
anticipated,  but  at  a  reduced  level  from  the  early  1990s.  Current  and
anticipated real estate acquired through foreclosure  is not expected to have  a
significant  affect  on  UNUM's  results of  operations,  liquidity,  or capital
resources.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
    UNUM's businesses produce positive cash flows, which are invested  primarily
in  intermediate, fixed maturity  investments intended to  reflect the nature of
anticipated  cash  obligations  of  insurance  benefit  payments  and  insurance
contract  maturities  and to  optimize  investment returns  at  appropriate risk
levels. Unexpected cash requirements and liquidity needs
 
                                       28
<PAGE>
can be met through UNUM's investment portfolio of fixed maturities classified as
available for  sale,  equity securities,  cash  and short-term  investments.  To
facilitate  the  expected sale  of the  TSA business  later in  1996, management
expects  to  primarily  liquidate  fixed  maturities  and  accumulate  cash  and
short-term investments.
 
    From  time to time, dividend  payments, which may be  subject to approval by
insurance regulatory authorities, are made from UNUM's affiliates and  insurance
subsidiaries  to UNUM Corporation. These dividends,  along with other funds, are
used to service the  needs of UNUM Corporation  including: debt service,  common
stock   dividends,   stock  repurchase,   administrative  costs   and  corporate
development. Income determined using  statutory accounting is  one of the  major
determinants  of an insurance  company's dividend capacity to  its parent in the
following fiscal year. Statutory accounting rules and practices, which differ in
certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles, are mandated  by
regulators in an insurance company's state of domicile.
 
    In 1995, UNUM America's statutory net income increased to $226.4 million, as
compared  with $39.2  million in  1994, which  was primarily  due to significant
improvements in the  income of  certain disability  products, and  significantly
higher  realized investment gains  as a result  of the sale  of the common stock
portfolio. As  described  in the  Disability  Insurance segment,  in  1994  UNUM
America  strengthened reserves  for existing  claims related  to the traditional
non-cancellable individual disability  products, which resulted  in a  statutory
after-tax  charge of $69.6  million in third quarter  1994. This charge combined
with unfavorable claims experience in certain disability businesses  contributed
to the decline in UNUM America's statutory income in 1994.
 
    As  a result of the  increase in UNUM America's  statutory earnings in 1995,
the amount available under current law  for payment of dividends during 1996  to
UNUM  Corporation from all  U.S. domiciled insurance  subsidiaries without state
insurance regulatory  approval,  increased  to approximately  $135  million,  as
compared  with approximately $81 million for 1995. UNUM Corporation also has the
ability to draw a dividend of approximately $19 million from its United Kingdom-
based affiliate, UNUM Limited, subject to certain U.S. tax consequences.
 
    Cash flow requirements are  also supported by  a committed revolving  credit
facility   totaling  $500   million,  which   expires  October   1,  1999.  UNUM
Corporation's commercial  paper program  is supported  by the  revolving  credit
facility,  and  is available  for  general liquidity  needs,  capital expansion,
acquisitions and  stock  repurchase.  The committed  revolving  credit  facility
contains certain covenants which, among other provisions, require maintenance of
certain levels of stockholders' equity and limits on level of debt.
 
    In  September 1993, UNUM filed an  omnibus shelf registration statement with
the Securities  and Exchange  Commission which  became effective  on October  8,
1993,  relating  to  $450  million  of  securities  (including  debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock  and other securities). On  October 8, 1993,  UNUM
filed  a  prospectus supplement  to establish  a  $250 million  medium-term note
("MTN") program under the shelf registration. On May 11, 1995, UNUM  Corporation
issued  $172.5 million of 8.80% Monthly  Income Debt Securities ("MIDS") (Junior
Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Debentures,   Series  A)  under  the   shelf
registration, which mature in 2025.
 
    At December 31, 1995, UNUM had short-term and long-term debt totaling $126.5
million  and $457.3 million,  respectively. At December  31, 1995, approximately
$417 million was available for additional financing under the existing revolving
credit  facility  and  approximately  $96  million  of  investment  grade   debt
instruments were available for issuance under the shelf registration. Contingent
upon  market conditions and corporate needs, management may refinance short-term
notes payable with longer term securities.
 
    At December  31, 1995,  approximately  2.7 million  shares of  common  stock
remained  authorized for stock repurchase. During 1995, UNUM did not acquire any
shares in the open  market. During 1994 and  1993, UNUM repurchased 3.9  million
and  3.7 million shares, respectively, in the open market. The aggregate cost of
the  1994  and  1993  repurchases   was  $183.3  million  and  $192.5   million,
respectively, which was primarily funded through additional borrowings.
 
    During  1995, 1994  and 1993,  withdrawals of  401(k), GIC  and DA contracts
reported in the  Retirement Products segment,  including contract  terminations,
payments to participants and transfers to other carriers, were approximately $46
million,  $130 million and $309  million, respectively. Withdrawals during 1995,
1994 and 1993,  were at levels  expected by management  and reflect the  run-off
nature  of these closed blocks of  businesses. UNUM manages liquidity objectives
by including certain conditions in pension contracts which prohibit or  restrict
availability of funds.
 
    UNUM  was committed at  December 31, 1995, to  purchase fixed maturities and
other invested assets in  the amount of $91.2  million. Independent of the  cash
flows  of UNUM Corporation, management anticipates that the operating cash flows
of the  subsidiaries of  UNUM Corporation  will be  sufficient to  meet  benefit
obligations,  planned  investment  commitments and  operational  needs  of those
companies.

RATINGS
 
    Standard &  Poor's  Corporation  ("Standard &  Poor's"),  Moody's  Investors
Service  ("Moody's") and  A.M. Best  Company ("A.M.  Best") are  among the third
parties that  provide  UNUM independent  assessments  of its  overall  financial
position.  Ratings from these agencies for  financial strength and claims paying
ability are  available  for the  individual  United States  domiciled  insurance
company  subsidiaries rather than  on a consolidated  basis, since the financial
information used  to  develop  the  ratings is  based  on  statutory  accounting
practices  in the United States. Debt ratings  for UNUM Corporation are based on
consolidated  financial   information   under  generally   accepted   accounting
principles.

    At  March 8, 1996, the  unsold portion of the  shelf registration related to
preferred stock  carried  a  rating of  "(P)"a1""  (Upper-Medium  Quality)  from
Moody's Investors Service.
 
INSURANCE REGULATION
 
    The Risk-Based Capital standards for life insurance companies, as prescribed
by  the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners, are based on a formula
that establishes capital requirements relating  to existing asset default  risk,
insurance risk, interest rate (asset/liability mismatch) risk and business risk.
A  company's  Total  Adjusted  Capital  (statutory  capital,  surplus  and Asset
Valuation Reserve plus certain other adjustments) is compared to the  Authorized
Control  Level ("ACL") of Risk-Based Capital produced by the formula. Subject to
certain trend tests to determine the change in the ACL ratio from year to  year,
companies  with  Total Adjusted  Capital above  200%  of ACL  are assumed  to be
adequately capitalized. Companies below 200% of ACL are identified as  requiring
various   levels  of  regulatory  action   ranging  from  increased  information
requirements for companies between 150% and 200% of ACL, to mandatory control by
the domiciliary insurance department for companies below 70% of ACL.
 
    At December 31, 1995, the ACL ratios for UNUM America, First UNUM,  Colonial
Life  and Commercial  Life were  382%, 382%,  436% and  329%, respectively. This
compares with ACL ratios  at December 31,  1994, of 307%,  357%, 442% and  378%,
respectively.
 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
    UNUM  periodically  uses  common derivative  financial  instruments  such as
options,  futures  and  forward  exchange  contracts  to  hedge  certain   risks
associated  with future investments and  certain payments denominated in foreign
currencies, primarily British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese  yen.
These  derivative financial instruments are used to protect UNUM from the effect
of market fluctuations in interest and exchange rates between the contract  date
and the
 
                                       30
<PAGE>
date on which the hedged transaction occurs. In using these instruments, UNUM is
subject   to  the  off-balance-sheet   risk  that  the   counterparties  of  the
transactions will fail to  completely perform as  contracted. UNUM manages  this
risk  by only entering into contracts  with highly rated institutions and listed
exchanges. UNUM does not intend to hold derivative financial instruments for the
purpose of trading. At December 31, 1995  and 1994, UNUM had no open  derivative
financial instruments.
 
LITIGATION
 
    In  the  normal  course of  its  business  operations, UNUM  is  involved in
litigation from time  to time with  claimants, beneficiaries and  others, and  a
number  of  lawsuits  were pending  at  December  31, 1995.  In  the  opinion of
management, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from this litigation is  not
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or the
consolidated operating results of UNUM.
 
    On  December 29, 1993, UNUM filed a suit in the United States District Court
for the District  of Maine, seeking  a federal  income tax refund.  The suit  is
based on a claim for a deduction in certain prior tax years, for $652 million in
cash  and  stock  distributed  to  policyholders  in  connection  with  the 1986
conversion of Union Mutual Life Insurance  Company to a stock company.  Although
UNUM  believes its  claims are  meritorious, the  United States  is aggressively
resisting the claims and the ultimate recovery, if any, cannot be determined  at
this time.
 
EFFECT OF INFLATION
 
    Inflation  is one of the factors that  has increased the need for insurance.
Many policyholders who once  had adequate insurance  programs at lower  coverage
levels  have increased their  disability insurance coverage  to provide the same
relative financial benefits and protection.
 
    Changing interest  rates,  which  are traditionally  linked  to  changes  in
inflation,  affect UNUM's  level of  discounted reserves.  While rising interest
rates are beneficial when investing current cash flows, they can also reduce the
fair value  of existing  fixed rate  long-term investments.  In addition,  lower
interest rates can lead to early payoffs and refinancing of some of UNUM's fixed
rate  investments. Management generally  invests in fixed  rate instruments that
are structured to limit the exposure to such reinvestment risk.
 
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In March 1995, the FASB issued  FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the  Impairment
of  Long-Lived  Assets  and for  Long-Lived  Assets  to be  Disposed  Of," which
establishes accounting  standards  for  the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets,
certain  identifiable intangibles,  and goodwill related  to those  assets to be
held and used and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  to
be  disposed of. UNUM will adopt FAS 121 effective January 1, 1996. The adoption
of FAS  121 is  not expected  to have  a material  effect on  UNUM's results  of
operations or financial position.
 
    In  October 1995, the  FASB issued FAS No.  123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which establishes  financial accounting  and reporting  standards
for  stock-based employee  compensation plans. FAS  123 defines a  new method of
accounting for  employee  stock compensation  plans  using a  fair  value  based
method,  under which compensation cost is  measured and recognized in results of
operations. Alternatively, FAS  123 allows  an entity to  retain the  accounting
method  for employee stock compensation plans  defined under APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." If an entity retains the  accounting
defined  under APB 25, certain pro forma  disclosures of net income and earnings
per share must be made as if the  fair value based method defined under FAS  123
had  been applied. UNUM is required to  adopt FAS 123 effective January 1, 1996.
UNUM has determined that it will retain the accounting methodology prescribed by
APB 25 and will disclose the pro forma effects of such stock-based  compensation
as required in 1996.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Directors and Stockholders
UNUM Corporation
 
    We  have audited the  consolidated financial statements  of UNUM Corporation
and subsidiaries as listed  in Item 8 and  the financial statement schedules  as
listed  in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement  schedules are the  responsibility of the  Corporation's
management.  Our responsibility is  to express an  opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
 
    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance  about whether  the consolidated  financial statements  are
free  of material  misstatement. An audit  includes examining, on  a test basis,
evidence supporting the  amounts and disclosures  in the consolidated  financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates  made by  management, as  well as  evaluating the  overall
consolidated  financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
UNUM  Corporation and  subsidiaries as  of December 31,  1995 and  1994, and the
consolidated results of their  operations and their cash  flows for each of  the
three  years in the period ended December  31, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting  principles.  In addition,  in  our opinion,  the  financial
statement  schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information required to be included therein.
 
    As discussed in Notes 2, 7, and 9 to the consolidated financial  statements,
the Corporation changed its method of accounting for certain investments in debt
securities  in 1994  and its  method of  accounting for  postretirement benefits
other than pensions, and accounting for income taxes in 1993.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
    The  accompanying consolidated financial statements  of UNUM Corporation and
subsidiaries ("UNUM")  have been  prepared on  the basis  of generally  accepted
accounting  principles. The  preparation of  financial statements  in conformity
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts  of  assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  and liabilities at the date  of
the  financial  statements and  the reported  amounts  of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
    The  consolidated  financial  statements   include  the  accounts  of   UNUM
Corporation and subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.
 
RECLASSIFICATION
 
    Certain 1994 and 1993 amounts have been reclassified in 1995 for comparative
purposes.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
    Investments are reported as follows:
 
    - Fixed   maturities  available  for  sale  (certain  bonds  and  redeemable
      preferred stocks) -- at fair value.
 
    - Fixed maturities held to maturity (certain bonds and redeemable  preferred
      stocks) -- principally at amortized cost.
 
    - Equity  securities available  for sale  (common stocks  and non-redeemable
      preferred stocks) -- at fair value.
 
    - Mortgage loans -- at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses.
 
    - Real estate -- at cost less accumulated depreciation.
 
    - Policy loans -- at unpaid principal balance.
 
    - Other long-term investments -- at cost plus UNUM's equity in undistributed
      net earnings since acquisition.
 
    - Short-term investments  --  are  considered available  for  sale  and  are
      carried at cost which approximates fair value.
 
    Fixed  maturities and equity securities are classified as available for sale
as they  may  be  sold in  response  to  changes in  interest  rates,  resultant
prepayment risk, liquidity and capital needs, or other similar economic factors.
Unrealized  gains and losses  related to securities  classified as available for
sale are  excluded from  net income  and  reported in  a separate  component  of
stockholders'  equity, net of applicable  deferred taxes and related adjustments
to unpaid  claims. The  unrealized  gains and  losses  are determined  based  on
estimated  market values at the  balance sheet date and  are not necessarily the
amounts which would be realized upon sale of the securities or representative of
future market values.  Changing interest  rates affect the  level of  unrealized
gains  and losses related to securities  classified as available for sale. While
rising interest rates are beneficial when investing current cash flows, they can
also reduce the  fair value  of existing  fixed rate  long-term investments.  In
addition, lower interest rates can lead to early payoffs and refinancing of some
of  UNUM's fixed  rate investments. Management  generally invests  in fixed rate
instruments that are structured to limit the exposure to such reinvestment risk.
 
    Fixed maturities that UNUM  has the positive intent  and ability to hold  to
maturity are classified as held to maturity.
 
    Realized  investment gains and losses, which  are determined on the basis of
specific identification  and include  adjustments  for allowances  for  probable
losses, are reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 
    If  a decline in fair  value of an invested asset  is considered to be other
than temporary, the investment  is reduced to its  net realizable value and  the
reduction is accounted for as a realized investment loss.
 
    UNUM  discontinues the accrual of investment  income on invested assets when
it is determined  that collectability  is doubtful.  UNUM recognizes  investment
income on impaired loans when the income is received.

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    Real  estate  held  for sale,  which  is  included in  other  assets  in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, is valued at the lower of fair value less estimated
costs to sell, or cost.  UNUM has provided an  allowance for probable losses  on
real  estate held for sale that reduces the  carrying value of the asset to fair
value.
 
    Purchases  and  sales  of  short-term  financial  instruments  are  part  of
investing  activities and not necessarily a part of the cash management program.
Therefore, short-term financial instruments are classified as investments in the
Consolidated Balance  Sheets and  are included  as investing  activities in  the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
    Gains or losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are deferred and
included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities. Gains or losses
related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are
also  deferred and recognized in the carrying  amount of the underlying asset or
liability when the hedged transaction occurs.
 
RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES
 
    Group insurance premiums are recognized as  income over the period to  which
the  premiums relate.  Individual disability  premiums are  recognized as income
when due. Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums to result in
recognition of  profits over  the life  of the  contracts. This  association  is
accomplished  by recording  a provision  for future  policy benefits  and unpaid
claims and claim expenses, and by amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs.
 
    For retirement and  universal life  products, premium and  other policy  fee
revenue  consist of charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration and
surrenders assessed  during  the  period.  Charges related  to  services  to  be
performed  in  the future  are deferred  until earned.  The amounts  received in
excess of  premium and  fees are  recorded  as deposits  and included  in  other
policyholder  funds in  the Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  Benefits and expenses
include benefit claims in excess of related account balances, interest  credited
at various rates and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
 
DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS
 
    The  costs of  acquiring new  business that vary  with and  that are related
primarily to the  production of new  business have been  deferred to the  extent
such  costs  are  deemed recoverable  from  future profits.  Such  costs include
commissions, certain  costs  of  policy  issue  and  underwriting,  and  certain
variable field office expenses.
 
    For  individual  disability, group  disability,  and group  life  and health
business, the costs are amortized in proportion to expected future premiums. For
universal life  and certain  retirement  products, the  costs are  amortized  in
proportion to estimated gross profits from interest margins, mortality and other
elements   of  performance   under  the  contracts.   Amortization  is  adjusted
periodically to  reflect  differences  between actual  experience  and  original
assumptions,  with any resulting changes reflected in current operating results.
The amounts deferred and amortized were as follows:

RESERVES FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS
 
    Reserves for future policy benefits are calculated by the net-level  premium
method,  and are based on UNUM's expected morbidity, mortality and interest rate
assumptions at the time a policy is issued. These reserves represent the portion
of premiums received, accumulated with interest  and held to provide for  claims
that  have  not  yet been  incurred.  The reserve  assumptions  are periodically
reviewed and compared to actual experience  and are revised if it is  determined
that  future  expected experience  is  different from  the  reserve assumptions.
Reserves for group insurance policies consist primarily of unearned premiums.

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    The interest rates  used in the  calculation of reserves  for future  policy
benefits at December 31, 1995, and 1994, principally ranged from:
 
<TABLE>
<S>                                                                              <C>

Individual accident and health.................................................   5.0% to 9.0%
Individual and group annuities.................................................   5.0% to 9.0%
</TABLE>
 
    Certain reserve calculations are based on interest rates within these ranges
graded down over periods from 15 to 20 years.
 
RESERVES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES
 
    Unpaid  claims and claim expense reserves  represent the amount estimated to
fund claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but  not
reported.  Reserves for unpaid  claims are estimated  based on UNUM's historical
experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of  current
developments,  anticipated trends, risk management programs and renewal actions.
Many factors affect actuarial calculations of claim reserves, including but  not
limited  to interest rates and current and anticipated incidence rates, recovery
rates, and economic and societal  conditions. Reserve estimates and  assumptions
are periodically reviewed and updated with any resulting adjustments to reserves
reflected  in current operating  results. Given the  complexity of the reserving
process, the  ultimate  liability  may  be more  or  less  than  such  estimates
indicate.
 
    The  interest rates used in the calculation of disability claims reserves at
December 31, 1995, and 1994, were principally as follows:

Group long term disability (North America)...............................................        7.94%               9.18%
Group long term disability (United Kingdom)..............................................        9.67%               9.94%
Individual disability....................................................................    6.75% to 9.67%      6.75% to 9.94%
</TABLE>
 
    The interest rate used to discount the disability reserves is a composite of
the  yields  on  assets  specifically  matched  with  each  block  of  business.
Management  expects the  reserve discount  rate for  certain disability products
will further decline,  since current  cash flows  are invested  in high  quality
assets  at current yields, which  are below the composite  yield of the existing
assets purchased  in  prior years.  UNUM  periodically adjusts  prices  on  both
existing  and new business  in an effort  to mitigate the  impact of the current
interest rate environment.
 
    For other accident and health business, reserves are based on projections of
historical claims run-out patterns.

    The increase in incurrals related to prior years was $507.0 million,  $436.0
million,  and  $238.0 million  (net of  reinsurance), for  1995, 1994  and 1993,
respectively. These increases were primarily  the result of interest accrued  on
reserves,  changes  in  reserve  estimates and  assumptions  of  interest rates,
morbidity, mortality and expense costs,  and changes in foreign exchange  rates,
primarily  related  to the  disability reserves  of UNUM's  United Kingdom-based
affiliate, UNUM Limited. Due to the long-term claims payment pattern of some  of
UNUM's businesses, certain reserves, particularly disability, are discounted for
interest.  Changes in reserve estimates and  assumptions were primarily a result
of increased reserves from lower discount rates for certain disability  products
following  the sale of  the common stock  portfolio in 1995,  and adjustments to
strengthen certain disability reserves in 1995 and 1994.
 
    The components of the increase in unpaid claims and claims expenses incurred
and related to prior years were as follows:

    In  connection  with  the  transfer  of  all  fixed  maturities   previously
classified  as held  to maturity  to available  for sale,  explained in  Note 2,
unpaid claims  were adjusted  by $261.2  million on  December 31,  1995.  Unpaid
claims  are adjusted to  reflect changes that  would have been  necessary if the
unrealized gains and losses related to fixed maturities classified as  available
for  sale  had  been  realized.  Where  applicable,  UNUM  has  reflected  those
adjustments in the liability balances with corresponding credits or charges, net
of related  deferred taxes,  reported  as a  component  of unrealized  gains  on
available for sale securities in stockholders' equity.

statements  upon adoption  of FAS  113, reserve  balances prior  to December 31,
1993, are shown net of reinsurance recoverables.
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
 
    During 1995, UNUM sold  virtually all of the  common stock portfolio of  its
United  States  subsidiaries.  The sale  of  the common  stock  portfolio, which
partially supported certain  disability reserves,  and the  reinvestment of  the
proceeds  primarily in investment grade fixed  income assets at yields below the
average portfolio yield, resulted  in lower reserve  discount rates for  certain
disability products reported in the Disability Insurance segment. This change in
accounting  estimate to lower certain discount  rates resulted in an increase of
$128.6 million to  benefits to  policyholders in the  Consolidated Statement  of
Income, and a decrease to net income of $83.6 million, or $1.15 per share.
 
    During  1995, UNUM  increased the  group long  term disability  reserves for
incurred but  not  reported  ("IBNR")  claims, as  reported  in  the  Disability
Insurance  segment.  The  increased  IBNR reserves  were  based  on management's
judgment that  claims  currently incurred  but  not yet  reported  will  reflect
increased  levels of  claims incidence and  severity. This  change in accounting
estimate  resulted  in  an  increase   to  benefits  to  policyholders  in   the
Consolidated  Statement of Income of $38.4 million, and a decrease to net income
of $25.0 million, or $0.34 per share.
 
    During 1995,  UNUM  increased reserves  for  unpaid claims  related  to  the
association  group disability business by  $15.0 million to reflect management's
expectations of slower than expected claim recoveries. This change in accounting
estimate, which was reflected in the Disability Insurance segment, decreased net
income by $9.8 million, or $0.14 per share.
 
    During 1994, UNUM increased  reserves for existing  claims by $83.3  million
and  strengthened reserves for estimated future  losses by $109.1 million. These
increased reserves reflected management's  expectations of morbidity trends  for
the   non-cancellable  individual  disability  business,   as  reported  in  the
Disability Insurance Segment. This change in accounting estimate resulted in  an
increase to benefits to policyholders in the Consolidated Statement of Income of
$192.4  million, and a  decrease to net  income of $125.1  million, or $1.69 per
share.
 
OTHER POLICYHOLDER FUNDS
 
    Other policyholder funds are  liabilities for investment-type contracts  and
represent  customer deposits plus interest credited to those deposits at various
rates.
 
LIABILITIES FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
 
    Liabilities for restructuring activities are recorded when management, prior
to the balance sheet date, commits to  execute an exit plan that will result  in
the  incurral of costs that have no  future economic benefit, or approves a plan
of termination and communicates sufficient detail of the plan to employees.
 
SEPARATE ACCOUNTS
 
    Certain assets of  UNUM's defined  benefit plans and  tax sheltered  annuity
contracts  are  in  separate  accounts  that  are  pooled  investment  funds  of
securities. Investment income and  realized gains and  losses on these  accounts
accrue  directly to  the contractholders. Assets,  carried at  market value, and
liabilities of the separate  accounts are shown  separately in the  Consolidated
Balance  Sheets. The assets of the  separate accounts are legally segregated and
are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of UNUM.
 
ACCOUNTING FOR PARTICIPATING INDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE
 
    Participating policies  issued by  the former  Union Mutual  Life  Insurance
Company  ("Union Mutual") prior  to UNUM's conversion to  a stock life insurance
company on November 14, 1986, will  remain participating as long as they  remain
in  force. A  Participation Fund  Account ("PFA")  was established  for the sole
benefit of  all of  Union  Mutual's individual  participating life  and  annuity
policies and contracts.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    The  assets of the PFA are to  provide for the benefit, dividend and certain
expense obligations of the participating individual life insurance policies  and
annuity  contracts. This line of business  participates in the experience of the
PFA and its operations  have been excluded from  the Consolidated Statements  of
Income. The PFA represented approximately 2.5% and 2.5% of total assets and 2.8%
and 3.0% of total liabilities at December 31, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
    The  provision  for  income  taxes includes  amounts  currently  payable and
deferred income taxes, which result from differences between financial reporting
and tax bases  of assets  and liabilities, and  are measured  using enacted  tax
rates and laws. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated
earnings   of  UNUM's  foreign  subsidiaries.   These  earnings  could  generate
additional U.S. tax if remitted to UNUM Corporation.
 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
    Foreign subsidiaries' balance sheet and income statement accounts  expressed
in local functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using ending and
quarterly  average  exchange  rates,  respectively.  The  resulting  translation
adjustments are reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
    The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate earnings
per share was approximately 72,677,000, 74,158,000 and 78,779,000 in 1995,  1994
and  1993, respectively. The assumed exercise  of outstanding stock options does
not result in a material dilution of earnings per share.
 
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In March  1995, the  Financial Accounting  Standards Board  ("FASB")  issued
Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived   Assets  and  for  Long-Lived  Assets  to  be  Disposed  Of,"  which
establishes accounting  standards  for  the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets,
certain  identifiable intangibles,  and goodwill related  to those  assets to be
held and used and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  to
be  disposed of. UNUM will adopt FAS 121 effective January 1, 1996. The adoption
of FAS  121 is  not expected  to have  a material  effect on  UNUM's results  of
operations or financial position.
 
    In  October 1995, the  FASB issued FAS No.  123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which establishes  financial accounting  and reporting  standards
for  stock-based employee  compensation plans. FAS  123 defines a  new method of
accounting for  employee  stock compensation  plans  using a  fair  value  based
method,  under which compensation cost is  measured and recognized in results of
operations. Alternatively, FAS  123 allows  an entity to  retain the  accounting
method for employee stock compensation plans defined under Accounting Principles
Board  ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." If an
entity  retains  the  accounting  defined  under  APB  25,  certain  pro   forma
disclosures  of net income  and earnings per share  must be made  as if the fair
value based method defined under FAS 123  had been applied. UNUM is required  to
adopt FAS 123 effective January 1, 1996. UNUM has determined that it will retain
the  accounting methodology prescribed in APB 25 and will disclose the pro forma
effects of such stock-based compensation as required in 1996.
 
NOTE 2.  INVESTMENTS
    Effective January 1,  1994, UNUM  adopted FAS 115,  "Accounting for  Certain
Investments  in Debt and Equity Securities,"  which specified the accounting and
reporting for certain investments in  equity securities and for all  investments
in debt securities. UNUM adopted the provisions of FAS 115 for these investments
held  or acquired  after January  1, 1994.  Upon the  adoption of  FAS 115, UNUM
increased  unrealized  gains  on  available  for  sale  securities  included  in
stockholders' equity on January 1, 1994, by $41.8 million (net of deferred taxes
of  $22.5 million) to  reflect the unrealized holding  gains on fixed maturities
classified as available for sale that were previously carried at amortized cost.
In addition, UNUM reclassified certain fixed maturities from held to maturity to
available for sale on January  1, 1994, in connection  with the adoption of  FAS
115.
 
    In  November 1995, the  FASB issued "A Guide  to Implementation of Statement
115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"  which
provided   a  one-time  opportunity  to  reassess  the  appropriateness  of  the
 
                                       42

NOTE 2.  INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)
classifications of  securities described  in FAS  115, and  to reclassify  fixed
maturities  from the held to maturity category without calling into question the
intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. On December  31,
1995,  UNUM reassessed  its fixed  maturity portfolio  and as  allowed under the
implementation guidance, reclassified fixed maturities with an amortized cost of
$6,082.8 million and a  related net unrealized gain  of $393.0 million from  the
held  to  maturity  category  to  available for  sale.  In  connection  with the
reclassification of the held to maturity fixed maturities to available for sale,
on December  31, 1995,  UNUM adjusted  its unpaid  claims by  $261.2 million  to
reflect  the changes that would have been  necessary if the unrealized gains and
losses related to  fixed maturities classified  as available for  sale had  been
realized.
 
    The  following  tables summarize  the components  of investment  income, net
realized investment gains and changes in unrealized investment gains (losses):

MORTGAGE LOANS
 
    Effective January  1,  1995,  UNUM  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standard
("FAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and FAS No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and
Disclosures,"  which defined  the principles to  measure and  record an impaired
loan. When it is  probable that UNUM  will be unable to  collect all amounts  of
principal  and  interest  due  according  to the  contractual  terms  of  a loan
agreement, the  loan  is  deemed impaired.  Once  a  loan is  determined  to  be
impaired,  an allowance  for probable losses  is established  for the difference
between the carrying amount of the  loan and its estimated value. The  estimated
value  is  based on  either  the present  value  of expected  future  cash flows
discounted using  the  loan's effective  interest  rate, the  loan's  observable
market  price or the fair  value of the collateral. The  adoption of FAS 114 and
FAS 118  did not  have a  material effect  on UNUM's  results of  operations  or
financial position.
 
    At  December 31, 1995, the recorded investment in impaired loans amounted to
$50.1 million. Included in  the $50.1 million was  $38.4 million of loans  which
had  a related allowance for probable losses  of $7.1 million, and $11.7 million
of loans which had no related allowance for probable losses. Mortgage loans that
were restructured prior to the adoption of FAS 114 amounted to $59.9 million and
$73.6 million  at  December 31,  1995,  and 1994,  respectively.  Troubled  debt
restructurings  represent loans that are refinanced with terms more favorable to
the borrower. Interest foregone  on these loans was  not material for the  years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 or 1993.
 
OTHER
 
    Real  estate acquired in satisfaction of debt cumulatively amounts to $107.6
million at  December 31,  1995. Real  estate  held for  sale amounted  to  $35.5
million at December 31, 1995, and $31.0 million at December 31, 1994.
 
    Mortgages  with  an  amortized cost  of  $1.9  million, real  estate  with a
depreciated cost of $4.7 million and no bonds were non-income producing for  the
twelve  months ended December  31, 1995. Interest lost  on these investments was
not material in 1995, 1994 or 1993.
 
    UNUM was committed at  December 31, 1995, to  purchase fixed maturities  and
other invested assets in the amount of $91.2 million.

    Subsequent to January 1, 1994, adjustments for other than temporary declines
in value of  all fixed maturities  are recorded  as a direct  adjustment to  the
securities' carrying value.
 
NOTE 4.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    UNUM  periodically  uses  common derivative  financial  instruments  such as
options,  futures  and  forward  exchange  contracts  to  hedge  certain   risks
associated  with future investments and  certain payments denominated in foreign
currencies, primarily British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese  yen.
These  derivative financial instruments are used to protect UNUM from the effect
of market fluctuations in interest and exchange rates between the contract  date
and the date on which the hedged transaction occurs. In using these instruments,
UNUM  is subject  to the off-balance-sheet  risk that the  counterparties to the
transactions will fail to  completely perform as  contracted. UNUM manages  this
risk  by only entering into contracts  with highly rated institutions and listed
exchanges. UNUM does not intend to hold derivative financial instruments for the
purpose of trading. At December 31, 1995, and 1994, UNUM had no open  derivative
financial instruments.

NOTE 5.  REINSURANCE
    UNUM,  through  its life  insurance subsidiaries,  is  involved in  both the
cession and assumption of reinsurance with other companies. Risks are  reinsured
with  other  companies to  reduce  UNUM's exposure  to  large losses  and permit
recovery of a portion of direct losses.  UNUM remains liable to the insured  for
the  payment of policy benefits if  the reinsurers cannot meet their obligations
under the reinsurance  agreements. Deferred policy  acquisition costs,  premiums
and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other companies.
 
    The effect of reinsurance on premiums earned and written for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:

    For  the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, recoveries recognized
under reinsurance agreements reduced benefits to policyholders by $58.9 million,
$53.3 million, and $28.9 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 6.  BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
    Charges of $8.4 million  and $14.4 million were  recorded in 1995 and  1994,
respectively,  related to the acceleration of organizational changes within UNUM
Life Insurance Company of America and the decision to discontinue the individual
disability non-cancellable product. Partially offsetting the charge recorded  in
1995  was a  $3.4 million curtailment  gain, related to  workforce reductions in
UNUM Corporation's noncontributory defined benefit pension plan.

NOTE 7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
 
PENSION PLANS
 
    UNUM   has  a   noncontributory  defined   benefit  pension   plan  covering
substantially all domestic employees, excluding employees of Colonial Companies,
Inc., and Duncanson & Holt, Inc., who are covered under separate plans. The plan
provides benefits  based on  the employee's  years of  service and  compensation
during  the  highest  five  consecutive  years out  of  the  last  ten  years of
employment. UNUM  funds the  plan in  accordance with  the requirements  of  the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Plan assets consist
primarily  of  group  annuity  contracts  and  include  224,392  shares  of UNUM
Corporation common stock.

1995,  and 8.25%  and 5.20%,  respectively, at  December 31,  1994. The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9.0% in 1995 and 1994, and 8.25%  in
1993. Prior year service costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
expected employment periods for active employees.
 
    In  December 1995,  the Board of  Directors of UNUM  Corporation approved an
amendment to the pension plan that included a new benefit formula.
 
    UNUM also  administers certain  supplemental retirement  plans for  eligible
employees  and officers and certain other pension plans. The cost of these plans
was not significant for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

NOTE 7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)
RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS
 
    UNUM  has  several   retirement  savings  and   profit  sharing  plans   for
substantially  all full-time and part-time employees who work 1,000 hours a year
and have been  employed for at  least one  year. Dependent upon  which plan  the
employee  participates in, eligible employees may contribute primarily up to 10%
of their  annual base  salary, and  UNUM matches  a portion  of each  employee's
contribution up to 6% of the employee's bi-weekly compensation. Participants may
become  100%  vested  immediately  upon  becoming  eligible  to  participate, or
incrementally over a five year period. In 1995, 1994 and 1993, expense for these
plans amounted to $8.4 million, $8.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively.
 
    UNUM intends to introduce  single pension and  retirement savings plans  for
all domestic employees effective January 1, 1997.
 
POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS
 
    UNUM  provides certain health  care and life  insurance benefits for retired
employees and covered dependents. Substantially  all domestic employees of  UNUM
may  become eligible  for these  benefits if they  meet minimum  age and service
requirements, if they are eligible for retirement benefits and if they agree  to
contribute  a portion  of the cost.  UNUM has  the right to  modify or terminate
these benefits. The underlying plans are not currently funded.
 
    Effective January  1,  1993,  UNUM  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standard
("FAS")  No. 106, "Employers' Accounting  for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions," which  changed  the method  for  recognition  of the  cost  of  these
benefits  from a  cash basis  to an accrual  basis over  the years  in which the
employees render the related services. UNUM elected to immediately recognize the
FAS 106 liability at January 1, 1993, of $48.8 million as a cumulative effect of
an accounting change, which decreased net income by $32.1 million, or $0.40  per
share, during 1993.
 
    Postretirement benefits expense included the following components:

postretirement benefits obligation were  7.25% at December  31, 1995, and  8.00%
and  8.25%, at December 31,  1994. The rates of  increase in future compensation
levels used in  determining the accumulated  postretirement benefits  obligation
were 4.7% and 5.2%, at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
    At  December 31, 1995, a 1% increase in the trend rate for health care costs
would increase  the  accumulated  postretirement benefits  obligation  by  $17.3
million and postretirement benefits expense by $2.7 million.
 
NOTE 8.  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVE PLANS
 
LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN
 
    The  1990  Long-Term Stock  Incentive Plan  ("Incentive Plan")  provides for
granting of restricted shares of UNUM Corporation common stock to key  officers.
The  Incentive  Plan also  provides for  granting of  options to  officers, non-
employee directors  of UNUM  Corporation  and key  employees, to  purchase  UNUM
Corporation  common stock over  ten years at a  price not less  than 100% of the
fair market value on the  date of grant. The  maximum number of shares  reserved
for  issuance under the Incentive Plan was  6,800,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993. At
December 31,  1995,  1994 and  1993,  1,680,235 shares,  2,511,145  shares,  and
3,316,734  shares, respectively,  were available  for grant  under the Incentive
Plan.
 
    The restriction period for each  restricted stock award under the  Incentive
Plan  is in excess of three years, with  the restrictions lapsing as a result of
the achievement of prescribed financial performance objectives during each three
year period, with  the exception  of 20,200 shares  granted in  1995 and  10,000
shares  granted  in 1994,  on  which restrictions  will  lapse upon  the grantee
remaining in  the  employ  of  UNUM  for  a  prescribed  period  of  time.  Plan
participants  are  entitled  to  cash  dividends  and  voting  rights  on  their
respective shares. All other restricted stock shares issued remained subject  to
restrictions.
 
    The  market value of  the restricted shares issued  under the Incentive Plan
has been recorded  as deferred compensation  and is included  as a reduction  of
stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    The  1987 Executive Stock Option Plan  ("Option Plan") provided for granting
to officers and key employees options to purchase UNUM Corporation common  stock
over  ten years at a  price not less than  100% of the fair  market value on the
date of grant.  Options outstanding under  the Option Plan  are included in  the
summary of stock options.
 
    Between   1991  and  1994,  certain  officers  were  granted  limited  stock
appreciation rights ("LSARs")  in tandem with  their outstanding options.  LSARs
afford  the optionee the  right to receive  payment upon a  change in control as
defined in the plans equal to the higher of the excess of the highest price  per
share  paid in connection with  such change in control  or the fair market value
per share, over the  option price per  share. As an  underlying stock option  is
exercised,  the LSARs are automatically canceled. At December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, there were 480,825  LSARs, 590,275 LSARs,  and 556,500 LSARs  outstanding,
respectively.
 
THE 1998 GOALS STOCK OPTION PLAN
 
    The  1998 Goals  Stock Option  Plan ("1998  Option Plan")  was introduced in
January 1995.  The  1998 Option  Plan  provides  for granting  to  all  eligible
employees up to 150 options to purchase UNUM Corporation common stock at a price
not  less than  100% of  the fair  market value  on the  date of  the grant. The
options will vest  to the employee  in nine years  from the date  of the  grant;
however,  if UNUM achieves its 1998 goals,  vesting will be accelerated to early
1999. During 1995,  1,105,350 shares were  granted under the  1998 Option  Plan.
Options  outstanding under the 1998  Option Plan are included  in the summary of
stock options.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLANS
 
    UNUM  has several annual incentive plans for certain employees and executive
officers,  that  provide  additional   compensation  based  on  achievement   of
predetermined  annual corporate and affiliate financial and non-financial goals.
In 1995, 1994 and 1993, expense for these plans was $19.9 million, $7.5  million
and $27.9 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 9.  INCOME TAXES
    Effective  January 1, 1993,  UNUM adopted Financial  Accounting Standard No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which changed the method for calculating and
reporting deferred income taxes  in the financial  statements from the  deferred
method  to the liability method. The liability method requires that deferred tax
liabilities or assets at the end of each period be determined using the tax rate
expected to be in effect when taxes  are actually paid or recovered. Under  this
method,  income tax  will increase  or decrease  in the  same period  in which a
change in tax rate is enacted.  The cumulative effect of this accounting  change
amounted  to a $20.0 million increase in net income, or $0.25 per share, for the
year ended December 31, 1993.

    On  August  10,  1993,  legislation  was  enacted  to  increase  the federal
corporate income tax rate of 34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993. The tax
rate increase resulted  in a  charge to net  income totaling  $11.4 million,  or
$0.15  per share, which  included $3.6 million,  or $0.05 per  share, related to
1993 pretax income, and a  $7.8 million, or $0.10  per share, adjustment to  the
deferred income tax liability.

NOTE 9.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)
    A valuation allowance is  established when it is  more likely than not  that
deferred tax assets will not be realized. UNUM established a valuation allowance
of  $6.0 million in 1995 to reflect  the estimated amount of deferred tax assets
which may  not be  realized related  to certain  reported foreign  subsidiaries'
losses.
 
    As  of December 31, 1995, deferred U.S.  income taxes have not been provided
on the accumulated earnings of UNUM's foreign subsidiaries. These earnings could
generate additional U.S. tax if remitted to UNUM Corporation.
 
    Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 ("1984 Act"), half the excess of the tax
basis gain  from  operations  of  a life  insurance  company  over  its  taxable
investment  income was  currently taxable.  The other  half was  set aside  in a
Policyholders Surplus  Account, together  with  certain special  life  insurance
company  deductions. The cumulative amount  in the Policyholders Surplus Account
as of  December 31,  1983, was  frozen by  the 1984  Act and  amounted to  $31.8
million  at December  31, 1995. Any  direct or indirect  distributions from this
account would be taxed at current tax rates; however, no provision has been made
for related taxes. If  the amount set  aside in this account  were taxed at  the
current  rate at December 31, 1995, for all life insurance subsidiaries, the tax
would have amounted to $11.1 million.
 
    UNUM's Consolidated Statements of Income  for 1995, 1994 and 1993,  included
the following amounts of foreign income and related income tax expense:

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 10.  NOTES PAYABLE (CONTINUED)
    At December  31,  1995,  UNUM  Corporation  had  a  $500  million  committed
revolving  credit facility  that expires on  October 1,  1999. UNUM's commercial
paper program is supported by the revolving credit facility and is available for
general liquidity needs,  capital expansion, acquisitions  or stock  repurchase.
The  committed revolving credit facility contains certain covenants which, among
other provisions, require maintenance of certain levels of stockholders'  equity
and  limits on  debt levels.  The commercial  paper outstanding  at December 31,
1995, and  1994,  had a  weighted  average interest  rate  of 5.88%  and  6.34%,
respectively.
 
    Aggregate  maturities of notes payable  are as follows: 1996-$126.5 million;
1997-$48.5  million;   1998-$68.0  million;   1999-$21.5  million;   2000-$60.0;
thereafter-$259.3 million.
 
NOTE 11.  CAPITAL STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
    At  December  31, 1995,  approximately 2.7  million  shares of  common stock
remained authorized for stock repurchase. During 1995, UNUM did not acquire  any
shares  in the open market.  During 1994 and 1993,  UNUM repurchased 3.9 million
and 3.7 million shares, respectively, in the open market. The aggregate cost  of
the   1994  and  1993  repurchases  was   $183.3  million  and  $192.5  million,
respectively, which was primarily funded through additional borrowings.
 
    Under the Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and Executive Stock Option Plan and
the plans of Colonial Companies, Inc. (see Note 8 "Stock Based Compensation  and
Incentive  Plans"),  612,138 shares,  329,579  shares, and  687,825  shares were
issued in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
    UNUM adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan on March  13, 1992. Under the  Plan,
each  Right,  under  certain  specific  circumstances,  entitles  the  holder to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock at a purchase price of $150. The Rights become exercisable at a  specified
time after (1) a person or group acquires 10% or more of UNUM Corporation common
stock  or (2)  a tender or  exchange offer for  10% or more  of UNUM Corporation
common stock. The  Rights expire at  the close  of business on  March 13,  2002,
unless earlier redeemed by the Company under certain circumstances at a price of
$0.01 per Right.
 
NOTE 12.  DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS
    UNUM  is  subject to  various state  insurance regulatory  restrictions that
limit the maximum amount of dividends available from its United States domiciled
insurance subsidiaries without  prior approval. Under  current law, during  1996
approximately  $135 million will  be available for payment  of dividends to UNUM
Corporation without state insurance regulatory approval. Dividends in excess  of
this  amount  may only  be paid  with state  insurance regulatory  approval. The
aggregate statutory capital and surplus of the United States domiciled insurance
subsidiaries of  UNUM  Corporation was  approximately  $1,149 million  and  $840
million,  at December 31, 1995, and  1994, respectively. The aggregate statutory
net income of UNUM Corporation's United States domiciled insurance  subsidiaries
was  approximately $290 million, $70 million and $216 million for 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively. State insurance  regulatory authorities prescribe  statutory
accounting  practices that  differ in  certain respects  from generally accepted
accounting  principles.   The  significant   differences  relate   to   deferred
acquisition  costs, deferred income taxes, non-admitted asset balances, required
investment risk reserves and reserve calculation assumptions.
 
    UNUM Corporation also has  the ability to draw  a dividend of  approximately
$19  million from its  United Kingdom based affiliate,  UNUM Limited, subject to
certain U.S. tax consequences.
 
NOTE 13.  LITIGATION
    In the  normal  course of  its  business  operations, UNUM  is  involved  in
litigation  from time  to time with  claimants, beneficiaries and  others, and a
number of  lawsuits  were  pending at  December  31,  1995. In  the  opinion  of
management,  the ultimate liability, if any, arising from this litigation is not
expected to  have  a  material  adverse effect  on  the  consolidated  financial
position or the consolidated operating results of UNUM.
 
    On  December 29, 1993, UNUM filed a suit in the United States District Court
for the District  of Maine, seeking  a federal  income tax refund.  The suit  is
based on a claim for a deduction in certain prior tax years, for $652 million in
cash

and stock distributed to policyholders in connection with the 1986 conversion of
Union  Mutual Life Insurance Company to  a stock company. Although UNUM believes
its claims  are meritorious,  the United  States is  aggressively resisting  the
claims and the ultimate recovery, if any, cannot be determined at this time.
 
NOTE 14.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT
    On  January 24, 1996, UNUM America entered into an agreement for the sale of
its group tax-sheltered annuity  ("TSA") business to  The Lincoln National  Life
Insurance  Company ("Lincoln Life"), a part of Lincoln National Corporation, and
to a  new New  York insurance  subsidiary of  Lincoln Life.  The agreement  also
contemplates  that First UNUM  will enter into a  similar agreement with Lincoln
Life's New York insurance subsidiary. The  sale, which is subject to  regulatory
approvals,  involves approximately 1,700 group  contractholders and assets under
management of approximately $3 billion. The agreement initially contemplates the
reinsurance of these contracts under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. These
contracts  will  then  be  reinsured  pursuant  to  an  assumption   reinsurance
arrangement  upon consent  of the  TSA contractholders  and/or participants. The
purchase price (ceding commission)  at closing is  expected to be  approximately
$70  million. It is anticipated that it will take several months (perhaps six to
nine months) to  obtain the necessary  approvals and otherwise  close the  sale.
There is no guarantee that the sale will close.
 
    Historical  results  of the  TSA  business included  in  UNUM's Consolidated
Statements of Income were as follows:

NOTE 15.  FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    Fair values are  based on  quoted market  prices, when  available. In  cases
where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using  present value or  other valuation techniques.  These valuation techniques
require management to  develop a  significant number  of assumptions,  including
discount  rates and estimates of future  cash flow. Derived fair value estimates
cannot be substantiated by comparison  to independent markets or to  disclosures
by  other  companies  with  similar  financial  instruments.  These  fair  value
disclosures do not purport to be the amount that could be realized in  immediate
settlement of the financial instrument.

    The following methods  and assumptions  were used in  estimating fair  value
disclosures for financial instruments:
 
    FIXED  MATURITIES:   Fair values  for fixed  maturities are  based on quoted
market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available,  fair
values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services or,
in  the case of private placements, are estimated by discounting expected future
cash flows using a current market  rate applicable to the yield, credit  quality
and maturity of the investments.
 
    EQUITY  SECURITIES AVAILABLE  FOR SALE:   Fair values  for equity securities
available for sale are  based on quoted  market prices and  are reported in  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at these values.
 
    MORTGAGE  LOANS:   Fair  values for  mortgage loans  are estimated  based on
discounted cash flow analyses using  interest rates currently being offered  for
similar  mortgage loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities.
Mortgage loans with similar characteristics  are aggregated for purposes of  the
calculations.
 
    POLICY   LOANS,   SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS,   CASH  AND   ACCRUED  INVESTMENT
INCOME:   Fair values  for these  instruments approximate  the carrying  amounts
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    INVESTMENT-TYPE  INSURANCE  CONTRACTS:   Fair  values for  liabilities under
investment-type insurance contracts with defined maturities are estimated  using
discounted  cash flow calculations based on interest rates that would be offered
currently for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those  remaining
for   the   contracts  being   valued.   Fair  values   for   liabilities  under
investment-type insurance contracts with no  defined maturities are the  amounts
payable on demand after surrender charges at the balance sheet date.
 
    The  estimated  fair values  of  liabilities under  all  insurance contracts
(investment-type and other than investment-type) are taken into consideration in
UNUM's overall management  of interest  rate risk, which  minimizes exposure  to
changing  interest  rates through  the  matching of  investment  maturities with
amounts due under insurance contracts.

NOTE 15.  FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
    INDIVIDUAL  ANNUITIES  AND  SUPPLEMENTARY   CONTRACTS  NOT  INVOLVING   LIFE
CONTINGENCIES:   Fair values approximate the  carrying amounts reported in other
policyholder funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    NOTES PAYABLE:    Fair  values  of  short-term  borrowings  approximate  the
carrying  amount. Fair values of long-term  notes are estimated using discounted
cash flow  analyses based  on  UNUM's current  incremental borrowing  rates  for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.
 
NOTE 16.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
    UNUM's  markets  for  its  insurance,  special  risk  and  retirement income
products are the United States, its principal market, Canada, the United Kingdom
and the Pacific  Rim. Through its  affiliates, UNUM is  the leading provider  of
group  long  term disability  insurance, its  principal  product, in  the United
States and the United  Kingdom. Products are  marketed through sales  personnel,
independent contractors and brokers, and specialty agents. UNUM targets sales of
its  disability products to executive,  administrative and management personnel,
and other professionals such as doctors, attorneys, accountants and engineers.
 
    To more clearly  reflect UNUM's  management of  its businesses  and to  more
appropriately group its product portfolios, UNUM began reporting its operations,
effective  January 1,  1995, principally  in four  business segments: Disability
Insurance, Special Risk  Insurance, Colonial Products  and Retirement  Products.
For  comparative purposes, prior period information has been restated to reflect
reporting in these segments.
 
    The Disability  Insurance segment  includes disability  products offered  in
North  America,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Japan  including:  group  long  term
disability, individual  disability,  group short  term  disability,  association
group  disability,  disability reinsurance  and  long term  care  insurance. The
Special Risk  Insurance  segment  includes group  life,  special  risk  accident
insurance,   non-disability  reinsurance  operations,  reinsurance  underwriting
management operations and  other special risk  insurance products. The  Colonial
Products segment includes Colonial Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries, which offer
payroll-deducted,  voluntary employee  benefits including  personal accident and
sickness, cancer and life  insurance products to  employees at their  worksites.
The  Retirements Products segment includes  tax sheltered annuities and products
which are no longer  actively marketed by  UNUM including guaranteed  investment
contracts,  deposit administration accounts and 401(k) plans. Corporate includes
transactions that are generally non-insurance related.
 
    Investment income and  net realized  investment gains are  allocated to  the
segments based on designation of ownership of assets identified to the segments.
Operating  expenses are  allocated to the  segments based  on direct association
with a product  whenever possible. If,  however, the expense  cannot be  readily
associated with a particular product, the costs are allocated based on ratios of
the relative time spent, extent of usage or varying volume of work performed for
each segment.

                     UNUM LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA
                         1996 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

I. OBJECTIVE

To provide a method whereby a select group of highly compensated employees may
receive compensation in a manner most meaningful to them.

II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Under a non qualified deferred compensation plan, the Employee and the Company
may agree to allow the deferral of receipt of current compensation. Under
current regulations, the amounts deferred are not subject to income tax until
received. Total salary including amounts being deferred are, however, subject to
applicable social Security taxes in the year of the deferral.

Amounts deferred become part of the general assets of the Company and are
credited with interest monthly at a rate equal to the UNUM Life Insurance
Company of America Fixed Income Portfolio Rate. The accounts kept for each
participant are for record keeping purposes only and are not backed by any funds
or guarantees. Should the company experience financial difficulties, a
participant's status is that of an unsecured creditor.

III. EMPLOYEE ELIGIBILITY

- -    All officers with a minimum annual base salary of $100,000*

- -    Sales employees whose annual salary (excluding bonus) or draw is equivalent
     each year to a minimum annual salary of $100,000*

*Base annual salary will be indexed annually to the Super Highly compensated
employee definition used in the Internal Revenue Code.

IV. AGREEMENT

A written agreement between the Employee and the Company shall be executed at
the time of the initial election to defer compensation. The agreement specifies
in detail:

- -    the amount and type of the deferral

- -    the method of interest calculation

- -    the time and manner of payment

For subsequent years in which the Employee qualifies for participation in the
Plan, elections for deferrals may be made in writing by the Employee and agreed
to by the Company.
<PAGE>

V. ADMINISTRATION

ELECTIONS:

In December of each year, eligible employees may elect to defer amounts from the
next calendar year's salary. This deferral amount will be based on the base
annual salary as of 1/1 of the year in which the compensation would otherwise be
paid. Eligible field employees may elect to defer production compensation to be
earned in the next calendar year and paid in that year or the following year.

On January 1 of the appropriate calendar year, the elections will be put into
effect.
- -Biweekly pay is adjusted to reflect amounts from salary or draw that are being
deferred
- -Results Sharing Plan and production bonus amounts are adjusted according to
elections

Deferral elections are effective for one calendar year only. If no subsequent
deferral is elected, the participant's biweekly pay will be adjusted after 12/31
of the deferral year to reflect full annual salary.

Deferral elections will be suspended for 12 months immediately following any
hardship withdrawal the Employee receives from the Company's 401(k) plan (the
Retirement Savings Plan). This restriction applies only to deferrals and not to
payments from the non qualified deferred compensation plan that are scheduled to
occur during those same 12 months.

SALARY RELATED BENEFITS:

TOTAL SALARY
- -    Flex Comp., Long Term Disability and Results Sharing Plan are based on
     total salary (i.e. includes deferred amounts).

REDUCED SALARY
- -    Pension benefits and 401(k) Plan contributions are based on reduced salary
     (i.e. total salary minus deferred amounts). The calculation of Final
     Average Earnings in the Pension Plan uses the highest consecutive five
     years of earnings out of the last ten. Pensionable earnings that are
     deferred during that five year period are not included in the calculation
     and thus may reduce the participant's pension benefit. Amounts of
     previously deferred compensation which the participant receives during this
     five year period will be included in final average earnings only to the
     extent that such payments do not exceed amounts deferred from compensation
     during this same period.

RECORDS:

Personnel Accounting maintains all records concerning the plan. They will
furnish each participant with a summary of "account" activity annually.

             ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES


The following provides a summary of the significant changes to the Annual
Incentive Plan for 1996, which have been approved by the UNUM Life Insurance
Company of America Board of Directors.


- -    A change in the incentive target payout percentages for our senior
     management group;

- -    For Enterprise Staff employees, a change in the weightings of the
     performance components from 60% based on Enterprise results and 40% based
     on Division results to 70% based on Enterprise results and 30% based on
     Division results.

- -    For Enterprise Line employees, a change in the weightings of the
     performance components from 40% based on Enterprise results and 60% based
     on Division results to 30% based on Enterprise results and 70% based on
     Division results

- -    For Enterprise Staff and Enterprise Line employees, the ability for the
     Business Unit/Divisional performance component to pay out independent of
     Enterprise results.

- -    For UNUM America employees, the weighting on the Business Unit/Division
     performance component has been eliminated, so now the payout is based only
     on Enterprise and UNUM America results.

A listing of the incentive target payout percentage targets and performance
component weightings for all eligible employees follows.  The revised incentive
targets for the senior management group appear in bands A through G.

                                UNUM CORPORATION
                        1987 EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN


1.   PURPOSE.
     This plan shall be known as the UNUM 1987 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan").
     The purpose of the Plan shall be to promote the profitability of UNUM
     CORPORATION and its subsidiaries (the "Company") by providing certain key
     employees with incentives to contribute to the success of the Company and
     by enabling the Company to attract, retain, and reward the best available
     personnel for positions of substantial responsibility.  The terms
     "subsidiary" and "subsidiaries" as used herein shall mean corporations, a
     majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock of which is owned by the
     Company directly or indirectly.  For purposes of the Plan, an Incentive
     Stock Option shall have the meaning set forth in Section 422A of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (the "Code"); a Nonqualified
     Stock Option shall mean any stock option for shares other than an Incentive
     Stock Option.

2.   ADMINISTRATION.
     The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the
     "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").

     Each member of the Committee shall be a person who is not eligible, and has
     not at any time within one year prior to his or her appointment to the
     Committee been eligible, for selection as a person to whom stock may be
     allocated or to whom stock options or stock appreciation rights may be
     granted pursuant to the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall
     be authorized to interpret the Plan and may from time to time adopt, amend,
     or rescind such rules and regulations for carrying out the Plan as it may
     deem appropriate.  Decisions of the Committee on all matters relating to
     the Plan shall be in the Committee's sole discretion and shall be
     conclusive and binding on all parties, including the Company, the
     shareholders, and the Participants.  The validity, construction, and effect
     of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be
     determined in accordance with the laws of Delaware and applicable Federal
     law.

3.   SHARES AVAILABLE FOR THE PLAN.
     Subject to adjustments as provided in Section 6, an aggregate of 2,500,000
     shares of common stock of $.10 par value of UNUM Corporation ("Shares") may
     be issued pursuant to the Plan.  Such Shares may represent either
     previously unissued shares or treasury shares.  If any option granted under
     the Plan shall expire or terminate unexercised or for any reason become
     unexercisable as to any shares, such unpurchased shares shall thereafter be
     available for further grants under the Plan unless the related Stock
     Appreciation Rights are exercised.
<PAGE>

4.   PARTICIPATION.
     (a)  Participation in this Plan shall be limited to those key employees of
          the Company selected at the sole discretion of the Committee.  Nothing
          in the Plan or in any option or right granted thereunder shall confer
          any right on an employee to continue in the employ of the Company or
          shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate
          employment at any time.

     (b)  Directors who are also employees and officers of the Company shall be
          eligible to receive options and rights under the Plan.  Members of the
          Board of Directors who are not also employees of the Company and all
          members of the Committee shall be ineligible to receive either options
          or rights under the Plan.

     (c)  Options and rights may be granted to such persons and for such
          respective number of shares as the Committee, in its absolute
          discretion, shall determine (such individuals to whom options and
          rights are granted are being herein called "Optionees").  A grant of
          an option or right in any one year to an eligible employee shall
          neither guarantee nor preclude a grant to such employee in subsequent
          years.

5.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS.
     The Committee may from time to time select key employees to whom stock
     options shall be granted as Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of
     Section 422A of the Code or as Nonqualified Stock Options or any
     combination thereof as the Committee shall decide.  The options granted
     shall take such form as the Committee shall determine, subject to the
     following terms and conditions.

     (a)  PRICE.  The purchase price per share deliverable upon the exercise of
          each option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of
          the shares on the date the option is granted.  Fair Market Value shall
          be the average price of the high and low sale prices of the shares on
          the New York Stock Exchange composite tape or such other recognized
          market source as determined by the Committee from time to time on the
          date the option is granted, or, if there is no sale on such date, then
          such average price on the last previous day on which a sale is
          reported.  In the case of the grant of any Incentive Stock Option to
          an employee who, at the time of the grant, owns more than 10% of the
          total combined voting power of all classes of stock of UNUM
          Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, such price per share shall not
          be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date
          the option is granted.

     (b)  PAYMENT.  Options may be exercised only upon payment of the purchase
          price thereof in full.  With respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option,
          such payment shall be made in cash or, at the discretion of the
          Committee, in shares, which shall have a value at least equal to the
          aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased, or a
          combination of cash and shares.


                                        2
<PAGE>

          The value of shares so tendered shall be established in accordance
          with methods determined by the Committee.  With respect to an
          Incentive Stock Option, payment of the exercise price shall be made in
          cash.  The Optionee shall be entitled to elect to pay all or a portion
          of the exercise price for options granted under this Plan and any
          withholding taxes in connection with such exercise by having the
          shares of Common Stock to be issued by UNUM Corporation pursuant to
          such exercise sold by a broker-dealer under circumstances meeting the
          requirements of 12 C.F.R. Section 220.

     (c)  TERMS OF OPTIONS.  The term during which options may be exercised
          shall be determined by the Committee.  Except as otherwise provided in
          this Section 5(c), in no event shall an option be exercisable in whole
          or in part less than one year, or more than ten years from the date it
          is granted, provided further that, in the case of the grant of an
          Incentive Stock Option to an employee who at the time of the grant,
          owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes
          of stock of UNUM Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, in no event
          shall such option be exercisable more than five years from the date of
          the grant.  All rights to purchase shares pursuant to an option shall,
          unless sooner terminated, expire at the date designated by the
          Committee.

          The Committee shall determine the date on which each option shall
          become exercisable and may provide that an option shall become
          exercisable in installments.  The shares comprising each installment
          may be purchased in whole or in part at any time after such
          installment becomes exercisable, except that the exercise of an
          Incentive Stock Option shall be further restricted as set forth
          herein.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the
          time at which any option may be exercised in whole or in part.  In the
          case of the death, disability or retirement of an optionee, the
          Committee may exercise such discretion to accelerate the time at which
          any option may be exercised to a date less than one year from the date
          of grant, provided however, that in no event may a Stock Appreciation
          Right become exercisable less than six months from the date of grant.
          The option agreement evidencing an option granted under the Plan may
          contain such provisions limiting the acceleration of the exercise of
          options as the Committee deems appropriate to ensure that the penalty
          provisions of Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor thereto in
          effect at the time of such acceleration, will not apply to any stock
          or cash received by the holder from the Company.

          Unless otherwise provided herein, an Optionee may exercise an option
          only if he or she is, and has continuously been since the date the
          option was granted, an employee of the Company.

          Prior to the exercise of the option and delivery of the stock
          represented thereby, the Optionee shall have no rights to any
          dividends nor be entitled to any voting rights on any stock
          represented by outstanding options.


                                        3
<PAGE>

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and
          notwithstanding any contrary waiting period or installment period in
          any option agreement or in the Plan, each outstanding option granted
          under the Plan shall become exercisable in full for the aggregate
          number of shares covered thereby in the event of a Change in Control
          (as hereinafter defined).

          For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have
          occurred upon the first to occur of the following events:

            (i)     any "person," as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
                    14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
                    (the "Exchange Act") (other than the Company or any
                    corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the
                    stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
                    proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company), is
                    or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3
                    under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of
                    securities of the Company representing more than 40% of the
                    number of the Company's then outstanding securities;

           (ii)     during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who
                    at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and
                    any new director (other than a director designated by a
                    person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to
                    effect a transaction described in Subsection 5(c)(i), (iii)
                    or (iv) of this Section 5(c)) whose election by the Board or
                    nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was
                    approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
                    directors then still in office who either were directors at
                    the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination
                    for election was previously so approved, cease for any
                    reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;

          (iii)     the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or
                    consolidation of the Company with any other corporation,
                    other than a merger or consolidation which would result in
                    the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately
                    prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining
                    outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of
                    the surviving entity) more than 60% of the number of
                    outstanding securities of the Company or such surviving
                    entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
                    consolidation; or

           (iv)     the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete
                    liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
                    disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of
                    the Company's assets.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     (d)  LIMITATIONS ON GRANTS.  The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as
          of the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the shares of
          stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable
          for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year may not
          exceed $100,000.

     (e)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Except as provided below, if an Optionee
          ceases to be an employee other than by reason of death, retirement or
          disability, any then outstanding options may be exercised any time
          before their expiration date or within three months after the date of
          termination, whichever is earlier, but only to the extent that such
          options were exercisable when employment ceased, absent a
          determination by the Committee to the contrary; provided, however,
          that if a Participant is terminated for cause the Committee may
          determine that no option may be exercised at any time after the
          termination date.

          If an Optionee's employment terminates because of death or disability,
          all then outstanding options previously granted to the Optionee will
          become exercisable.  In the case of death of the Optionee, such
          options may be exercised at any time before their expiration date or
          within three years after the date of termination, whichever is
          earlier.  In the case of permanent disability, such options may be
          exercised at any time before their expiration date.

          If an Optionee's employment terminates because of retirement prior to
          January 1, 1995, any then outstanding options may be exercised any
          time before their expiration or within three years after the date of
          termination, whichever is earlier, but only to the extent that such
          options were exercisable when employment ceased, absent a
          determination by the Committee  to the contrary. If an Optionee's
          employment terminates because of retirement on or after January 1,
          1995, any then outstanding options may be exercised any time before
          their expiration or within five years after the date of termination,
          whichever is earlier, but only to the extent that such options were
          exercisable when employment ceased, absent a determination by the
          Committee  to the contrary.

     (f)  TRANSFERABILITY.  No option or right shall be transferable by an
          employee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
          distribution, and during the lifetime of the employee to whom an
          option or right is granted it may be exercised only by him or his
          guardian or legal representative, but Incentive Stock Options may be
          exercised by such guardian or legal representative only if permitted
          by Section 422A and related sections of the Code and any regulations
          promulgated thereunder.

     (g)  LISTING AND REGISTRATION.  Each option shall be subject to the
          requirement that if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its
          discretion, the listing, registration, or qualification of the shares
          subject to such option


                                        5
<PAGE>

          upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the
          consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary
          or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of
          such option or the issue or purchase or Shares thereunder, no such
          option may be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing,
          registration, qualification, consent, or approval shall have been
          effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the
          Committee.

     (h)  OPTION AGREEMENT.  Each employee to whom an option may be granted
          shall enter into an agreement with the Company, which shall contain
          such provisions, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be
          established by the Committee.

     (i)  WITHHOLDING.  The Company shall have the right to require a payment
          from an optionee to cover any applicable withholding or other
          employment taxes due upon the exercise of an option.

     (j)  STOCK OPTIONS.  In no event shall any stock option granted after
          May 15, 1989 be exercisable through payment of the exercise price in
          cash during the period of one year following a hardship distribution
          under the UNUM Employees Retirement Savings Plan and Trust, as defined
          therein.

6.   ADJUSTMENTS.
     In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock
     dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, distribution of
     assets, or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of the
     Company, the Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems appropriate
     in the number and kind of shares authorized by the Plan, in the number and
     kind of shares covered by the options granted, and in the purchase price of
     outstanding options.  In the event of any merger, consolidation or other
     reorganization in which the Company is not the surviving or continuing
     corporation, all options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted hereunder
     and outstanding on the date of such event shall be assumed by the surviving
     or continuing corporation with appropriate adjustment as to the number and
     kind of shares and purchase price of the shares.

7.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
     The Committee shall have the authority to grant Stock Appreciation Rights
     in connection with the grant of options under this Plan to any Optionee.
     The exercise of an option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of its
     corresponding right, and the exercise of a right shall cause an immediate
     forfeiture of its corresponding option.  Stock Appreciation Rights shall be
     subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may specify.  A
     Stock Appreciation Right granted in relation to an Incentive Stock Option
     shall expire at the same time as the related option expires and shall be
     transferable only when the related option is transferable, and under the
     same conditions.

8.   EXERCISE OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.
     (a)  Stock Appreciation Rights granted in connection with Incentive Stock
          Options and, unless otherwise provided by the Committee, all other
          Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan shall be exercisable
          only to the extent the related option is exercisable and only in
          accordance with the instrument evidencing such right.  No Stock
          Appreciation Right may be exercised unless the Fair Market Value of a
          share on the date of exercise exceeds the purchase price per share
          under the option to which the Stock Appreciation Right corresponds.

     (b)  Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Optionee shall be
          entitled to a distribution in an amount equal to the difference
          between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise as
          determined by the Committee, less the purchase price per Share under
          the option to which the Stock Appreciation Right corresponds.  The
          Committee, in its sole discretion, shall decide whether such
          distribution shall be in cash or in Shares.  In the event distribution
          is made in Shares, any fractional shares due shall be disregarded.

     (c)  The Company shall have the right to require a payment from an employee
          to cover any applicable withholding or other employment taxes due upon
          the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right.

     (d)  The provisions of this subsection shall apply to Optionees who are or
          who hereafter may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934.  No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercised
          for cash in complete or partial settlement of such right unless such
          exercise shall occur during the period beginning on the third business
          day following the date of release for publication by the Company of
          quarterly and annual summary statements of sales and earnings and
          ending on the twelfth business day following such date.  No Stock
          Appreciation Right or related option may be exercised for cash in
          complete or partial settlement of such right during the first six
          months of its term, except in the event the death or disability of the
          holder occurs prior to the expiration of such six month period.

8A.  An Optionee who is required under Section 5(i) or 8(c) of this Plan to make
     any payment to the Company to cover withholding or other employment taxes
     may elect to satisfy such obligation by tendering to the Company the number
     of Shares to the Company's common stock whose Fair Market Value equals the
     amount required to be withheld.

9.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
     (a)  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Limited Rights in
          connection with the grant of options under this Plan to any Optionee,
          and such rights may be granted either at or after the time of the
          grant of such option.


                                        7
<PAGE>

          Limited Rights or any applicable portion thereof granted with respect
          to a given option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon
          the termination of the related option.  Upon the exercise of an
          option, the related Limited Right shall cease to be exercisable to the
          extent of the Shares with respect to which such option is exercised.

          A Limited Right related to an option may be exercised by an Optionee,
          in accordance with this Section 9, by surrendering the applicable
          portion of the related option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the
          Optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the
          manner prescribed in this Section 9.

     (b)  Limited Rights shall only be exercisable during the 30 day period
          following a Change in Control and only to the extent that the options
          to which they relate shall be exercisable in accordance with the
          provisions of the Plan; provided, however, that no Limited Right shall
          be exercisable during the first six months of the term of the Limited
          Right (except that this additional limitation shall not apply in the
          event of death or disability of the Optionee prior to the expiration
          of the six-month period).

     (c)  Upon the exercise of a Limited Right related to an option, an Optionee
          shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal in value to the
          excess of the higher of (i) the highest price per share paid in
          connection with the Change in Control or (ii) the highest fair market
          value per share as reported in the Wall Street Journal at any time
          during the 60 day period preceding the Change in Control of one share
          over the option price per share specified in the related option, such
          excess to be multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which
          the Limited Right shall have been exercised.

     (d)  Limited Rights shall be subject to such other terms and conditions,
          not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as shall be
          determined from time to time by the Committee.  This Section 9 shall
          be interpreted in accordance and consistent with the principles set
          forth in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

10.  TERMINATION AND MODIFICATION OF THE PLAN.
     The Board of Directors, without further approval of the shareholders, may
     modify or terminate this Plan and from time to time may suspend, and if
     suspended, may reinstate any or all of the provisions of this Plan except
     that no modification or termination of this Plan may, without the consent
     of the Optionee, alter or impair any option previously granted under this
     Plan and that no modification shall become effective without prior approval
     of the shareholders which would (a) increase (except as provided in Section
     6) the maximum number of shares for which options may be granted under the
     Plan; (b) reduce the option price which may be established under the Plan;
     (c) extend the maximum option term under the Plan beyond ten years, or (d)
     change the Plan's eligibility requirements.  The Chief Executive Officer
     shall be authorized to make minor or


                                        8
<PAGE>

     administrative modifications to the Plan as well as modification to the
     Plan which may be dictated by requirements of federal or state statutes
     applicable to the Company or authorized or made desirable by such statutes.
     No modification or termination of the Plan shall, without the Optionee's
     consent, alter or impair any of their rights or obligations under any
     option or right theretofore granted to him or her under the Plan.  Unless
     previously terminated, the Plan shall terminate on December 31, 1996.

11.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
     The effective date of the Plan shall be January 1, 1987.

SECTION 6.  STOCK OPTIONS.

(a)  GRANT.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have
     sole and complete authority to determine the Employees to whom Options
     shall be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each Option, the
     Option Price, as defined below, therefor and the conditions and limitations

                                        3
<PAGE>

(c)  EXERCISE.

     (1)  Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such
          terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
          specify in the applicable Award or thereafter; provided, however, that
          in no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercisable after the
          expiration of ten years from the date of grant.  The Committee may
          impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options,
          including without limitation, any relating to the application of
          federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or
          advisable.

     (2)  No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option
          until payment in full of the Option Price therefor is received by the
          Corporation.  Such payment may be made in cash, or its equivalent, or,
          subject to such rules and guidelines as the Committee may establish,
          by exchanging shares of Common Stock owned by the optionee (which are
          not the subject of any pledge or other security interest), or by a
          combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all
          cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Common
          Stock so tendered to the Corporation, valued as of the date of such
          tender, is at least equal to such Option Price.

(d)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

     (1)  Except as provided below, if a Participant ceases to be an Employee
          other than by reason of death, retirement or disability, any then
          outstanding Options may be exercised any time before their expiration
          date or within three months after the date of termination, whichever
          is earlier, but only to the extent that such Options were exercisable
          when employment ceased, absent a determination by the Committee to the
          contrary; provided, however, that a Participant is terminated for
          cause the Committee may determine that no Option may be exercised at
          any time after the termination date.

     (2)  If a Participant's employment terminates because of death or
          disability, all then outstanding Options previously granted to the
          Participant will become exercisable.  In the case of death of the
          Participant, such Options may be exercised at any time before their
          expiration date or within three years after the date of termination,
          whichever is earlier.  In the case of permanent disability, such
          Options may be exercised at any time before their expiration date.

     (3)  If a Participant's employment terminates because of retirement prior
          to January 1, 1995, any then outstanding Options may be exercised any
          time before their expiration date or within three years after the date
          of termination, whichever is earlier, but only to the extent that such
          Options were exercisable when employment ceased absent a determination
          by the Committee to the contrary. If a Participant's employment
          terminates because of retirement on or after January 1,


                                        4
<PAGE>

          1995, any then outstanding Options may be exercised any time before
          their expiration date or within five years after the date of
          termination, whichever is earlier, but only to the extent that such
          Options were exercisable when employment ceased absent a determination
          by the Committee to the contrary.


SECTION 7.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

(a)  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Stock Appreciation Rights
     in tandem with the grant of an Option or freestanding and unrelated to an
     Option.  Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with an Option may be
     granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Option.

     Stock Appreciation Rights or any applicable portion thereof granted in
     tandem with a given Option shall only be exercisable to the extent that the
     related Option is exercisable and shall terminate and no longer be
     exercisable upon the expiration or cancellation of the related Option.

     The exercise of an Option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any
     Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with that Option, and the
     exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right shall cause an immediate
     forfeiture of its related Option.  Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be
     exercisable after the expiration of ten years from date of grant.  A Stock
     Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be exercised by an
     optionee, in accordance with this Section 7, by surrendering the applicable
     portion of the related Option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the
     optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner
     prescribed in this Section 7.

(b)  A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive from
     the Corporation an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a
     share of Common Stock on the date of the exercise of the Stock Appreciation
     Right over the grant price thereof, provided that the Committee may for
     administrative convenience determine that, for any Stock Appreciation Right
     which is not related to an Incentive Stock Option and can only be exercised
     during limited periods of time in order to satisfy the conditions of
     certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exercise of
     any such Stock Appreciation Right for cash during such limited period shall
     be deemed to occur for all purposes hereunder on the day during such
     limited period on which the Fair Market Value of the Stock is the highest.
     Any such determination by the Committee may be changed by the Committee
     from time to time and may govern the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
     granted prior to such determination as well as Stock Appreciation Rights
     thereafter granted.  The Committee shall determine whether Stock
     Appreciation Rights shall be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
     combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.


                                        5

SECTION 8.  LIMITED RIGHTS.

(a)  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Limited Rights in tandem
     with the grant of an Option or freestanding and unrelated to an Option.
     Limited Rights granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at or
     after the time of the grant of such Option.

     Limited Rights or any applicable portion thereof granted in tandem with a
     given Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the
     expiration or cancellation of the related Option.  The exercise of an
     Option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any Limited Right granted
     in tandem with that Option, and the exercise of such Limited Right shall
     cause an immediate forfeiture of its related Option.

     A Limited Right granted in tandem with an Option may be exercised by an
     optionee, in accordance with this Section 8, by surrendering the applicable
     portion of the related Option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the
     optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner
     prescribed in this Section 8.

(b)  Limited Rights shall only be exercisable during the 30 day period following
     a Change in Control as defined in Section 11 and shall not be exercisable
     after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant.

(c)  Upon the exercise of a Limited Right, an optionee shall be entitled to
     receive from the Corporation an amount in cash equal in value to the excess
     of (i) the higher of (A) the highest price per share paid in connection
     with the Change in Control or (B) the highest Fair Market Value per share
     as reported in the Wall Street Journal at any time during the 60 day period
     preceding the Change in Control over (ii) in the case of a Limited Right
     granted in tandem with an Option, the Option Price per share specified in
     the related Option and in the case of all other Limited Rights, the price
     per share established in the grant of the Limited Right, such excess to be
     multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the Limited Right
     shall have been exercised; provided, however, that upon the exercise of a
     Limited Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock Option, the amount
     set forth in clause (i) shall not exceed the Fair Market Value of a share
     on the date of exercise of the Limited Right.

(d)  Limited Rights shall be subject to such other terms and conditions, not
     inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined from
     time to time by the Committee.  This Section 8 shall be interpreted in
     accordance and consistent with the principles set forth in Rule 16b-3 of
     the Exchange Act.


                                        6
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.  RESTRICTED STOCK.

(a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and
     complete authority to determine the Employees to whom shares of Restricted
     Stock shall be granted, the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be
     granted to each Participant, the duration of the Restricted Period during
     which, and the conditions under which, the Restricted Stock may be
     forfeited to the Corporation, and the other terms and conditions of such
     Awards.  The Committee may determine that the Restricted Period applicable
     to a particular grant may vary depending upon the attainment of particular
     conditions, such as corporate earnings, share price or other targets set by
     the Committee.

(b)  Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged
     or otherwise encumbered, except as herein provided, during the Restricted
     Period.  Certificates issued in respect of shares of Restricted Stock shall
     be registered in the name of the Participant and deposited by such
     Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the
     Corporation.  At the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Corporation
     shall deliver such certificates to the Participant or the Participant's
     legal representative.

(c)  If a Participant's employment terminates by reasons of disability or death,
     any Restricted Stock held by such Participant shall thereafter vest and any
     restriction lapse, to the extent such Restricted Stock would have become
     vested and no longer subject to such restrictions within one year from the
     time of termination had the Participant continued to fulfill all of the
     conditions of the Restricted Stock during such period (or on such
     accelerated basis as the Committee may determine at or after grant).
     Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant's employment
     terminates for any reasons other than permanent disability or death, any
     Restricted Stock which is unvested or subject to restriction shall
     thereupon be forfeited.


SECTION 10.  NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR OPTIONS.

Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 10 shall only apply to a non-employee member of the
Board.  The other provisions of the Plan shall apply to grants of Options under
this Section 10 to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section.

(a)  This Section 10 shall be administered by the Board.

(b)  Each non-employee member of the Board shall receive Non-Qualified Stock
     Options in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.


                                        7
<PAGE>

(c)  (i)    Recipients of Options under this Section 10 shall enter into a stock
            option agreement with the Corporation, which agreement shall set
            forth, among other things, the exercise price of the Option, the
            term of the Option and provisions regarding exercisability of the
            Option granted thereunder.

     (ii)   On the Effective Date (as defined below) each non-employee member of
            the Board of the Corporation shall receive Options to purchase 2,000
            shares of Common Stock.  Beginning in 1991, on the date after each
            annual stockholders meeting of the Corporation each continuing non-
            employee member of the Board shall be granted an Option to purchase
            1,000 shares of Common Stock and, beginning in 1990, each newly
            elected non-employee director shall be granted an Option to purchase
            2,000 shares of Common Stock.  The Option Price per share of Common
            Stock purchasable under such Options shall be equal to the Fair
            Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.  Such Option
            shall remain exercisable until the earlier of ten years from the
            date of grant or the termination of any post-directorship
            consultancy agreement with the Corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
            if such consultancy agreement terminates by reason of death or
            disability any then outstanding Options may be exercised (x) at any
            time before their expiration date or (y), if such termination is by
            reason of death, within three years of the date of death, whichever
            is earlier.  Such Options shall be exercisable one year from the
            date of grant by payment in full in cash or in shares of Common
            Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the Option Price or in a
            combination of cash and such shares.

(d)  The Board may not amend, alter, or discontinue this Section 10 without the
     approval of the stockholders of the Corporation.


SECTION 11.  CHANGE OF CONTROL.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and notwithstanding
any contrary waiting period or installment period in any agreement relating to
an Award or in the Plan, each outstanding Option, Stock Appreciation Right and
Limited Right granted under the Plan shall become exercisable in full for the
aggregate number of shares covered thereby, and any restriction or deferral
limitation applicable to any Restricted Stock shall lapse and such shares and
Awards shall be deemed fully vested, in the event of a Change in Control (as
hereinafter defined).

For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
upon the first to occur of the following events:

     (i)    any "person," as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
            the Exchange Act (other than the Corporation or any corporation
            owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the
            Corporation in substantially the same proportions as their ownership
            of stock of the Corporation), is or becomes the "beneficial


                                        8

            owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly
            or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing more
            than 40% of the number of the Corporation's then outstanding
            securities;

     (ii)   during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the
            beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director
            (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into
            an agreement with the Corporation to effect a transaction described
            in Subsection 11(i), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 11) whose
            election by the Board or nomination for election by the
            Corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-
            thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were
            directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or
            nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any
            reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;

     (iii)  the stockholders of the Corporation approve a merger or
            consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation, other
            than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting
            securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto
            continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or being
            converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than
            60% of the number of outstanding securities of the Corporation or
            such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
            consolidation; or

     (iv)   the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete
            liquidation of the Corporation or an agreement for the sale or
            disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of the
            Corporation's assets.


SECTION 12.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

(a)  WITHHOLDING.  The Employer shall have the right to deduct from all amounts
     paid to a Participant in cash (whether under this Plan or otherwise) any
     taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under this Plan.
     In the case of payments of Awards in the form of Common Stock, at the
     Committee's discretion the Participant may be required to pay to the
     Employer the amount of any taxes required to be withheld with respect to
     such Common Stock, or, in lieu thereof, to the extent permitted by
     applicable federal and state securities laws, the Employer shall have the
     right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the opportunity to elect
     to tender) the number of shares of Common Stock whose Fair Market Value
     equals the amount required to be withheld.  The Optionee shall be entitled
     to elect to pay all or a portion of the exercise price for options granted
     under this Plan and any withholding taxes in connection with such exercise
     by having the shares of Common Stock to be issued by UNUM Corporation
     pursuant to such exercise sold by a broker-dealer under circumstances
     meeting the requirements of 12 C.F.R. Section 220.


                                        9
<PAGE>

(b)  NONTRANSFERABILITY.  No Award shall be assignable or transferable, and no
     right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien,
     obligation or liability of the Participant, except by will or the laws of
     descent and distribution.

(c)  NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  No person shall have any claim or right to be
     granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as
     giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the
     Employer.  Further, the Employer expressly reserves the right at any time
     to dismiss a Participant free from any liability, or any claim under the
     Plan, except as provided herein or in any agreement entered into with
     respect to an Award.

(d)  NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER.  Subject to the provisions of the applicable
     Award, no Participant or transferee of an Option shall have any rights as a
     stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed
     under the Plan until he or she has become the holder thereof.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted
     Stock hereunder, the applicable Award shall specify if and to what extent
     the Participant shall not be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in
     respect of such Restricted Stock.

(e)  CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLAN.  The validity, construction, interpretation,
     administration and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and
     rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with
     the laws of the State of Delaware.

(f)  EFFECTIVE DATE.  Subject to the approval of the stockholders of the
     Corporation, the Plan shall be effective on February 9, 1990 (the
     "Effective Date").  No Options or Awards may be granted under the Plan
     after February 9, 2000.

(g)  AMENDMENT OF PLAN.  The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or
     any portion thereof at any time, provided that no amendment shall be made
     without stockholder approval if such approval is necessary to comply with
     any tax or regulatory requirement, including for these purposes any
     approval requirement which is a prerequisite for exemptive relief under
     Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary contained herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner
     as may be necessary so as to have the Plan conform with local rules and
     regulations.  The Chief Executive Officer shall be authorized to make minor
     or administrative modifications to the Plan as well as modification to the
     Plan which may be dictated by requirements of federal or state statutes
     applicable to the Corporation or authorized or made desirable by such
     statutes.  No modification or termination of the Plan shall, without the
     optionee's consent, alter or impair any of his or her rights or obligations
     under any Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Limited Right theretofore
     granted to him or her under the Plan.

(h)  AMENDMENT OF AWARD.  The Committee may amend, modify or terminate any
     outstanding Award with the Participant's consent at any time prior to
     payment or exercise in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the
     Plan, including without


                                       10
<PAGE>

     limitation, (i) to change the date or dates as of which (A) an Option,
     Stock Appreciation Right or Limited Right becomes exercisable; (B)
     Restricted Stock becomes nonforfeitable; or (ii) to cancel and reissue an
     Award under such different terms and conditions as it determines
     appropriate.

(i)  HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS.  In no event shall any Option granted under this
     Plan be exercisable through payment of the Option Price in cash during the
     period of one year following a hardship distribution under the UNUM
     Employees Retirement Savings Plan and Trust, as defined therein.

(j)  ADJUSTMENTS AND ASSUMPTION.  In the event of a reorganization,
     recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares,
     merger, consolidation, distribution of assets, or any other change in the
     corporate structure or shares of the Corporation, the Committee shall make
     such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the number and kind of shares
     authorized by the Plan, in the number and kind of shares covered by the
     Awards granted, and in the purchase price of outstanding Options.  In the
     event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization in which the
     Corporation is not the surviving or continuing corporation, all Awards
     granted hereunder and outstanding on the date of such event shall be
     assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation with appropriate
     adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and purchase price of the
     shares.

(k)  In addition to the purposes set forth in Section 1, the Committee may grant
     Awards to eligible Participants in order to compensate such Participants to
     surrender existing rights to receive benefits from the Employer under this
     or any other benefit plan or arrangement.

that (i) an Option, or Stock Appreciation Right, or Limited Right expires,
terminates, or is canceled, surrendered or exchanged unexercised as to any

SECTION 6.  STOCK OPTIONS.

(a)  GRANT.  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Options to such

     defined below, therefor
<PAGE>


                                       -5-


     and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the
     Option.  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock
     Options, or to grant Non-Qualified Stock Options, or to grant both types of
     Options.  In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions
     of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be
     prescribed by Section 422 of the Code and any regulations implementing
     Section 422.

(b)  OPTION PRICE.  The Committee shall establish the exercise price of the
     Option (the "Option Price") at the time each Option is granted, which
     Option Price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the
     Common Stock on the date of grant.

(c)  EXERCISE.

     (1)  Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such
          terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
          specify in the applicable Award or thereafter; provided, however, that
          in no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercisable after the
          expiration of ten years from the date of grant.  The Committee may
          impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options,
          including without limitation, any relating to the application of
          federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or
          advisable.

     (2)  No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option
          until payment in full of the Option Price therefor is received by the
          Corporation.  Such payment may be made in cash, or its equivalent, or,
          subject to such rules and guidelines as the Committee may establish,
          by exchanging shares of Common Stock owned by the optionee (which are
          not the subject of any pledge or other security interest), or by a
          combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all
          cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Common
          Stock so tendered to the Corporation, valued as of the date of such
          tender, is at least equal to such Option Price.

(d)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

     (1)  If a Participant ceases to be an Employee other than by reason of
          death, retirement or permanent disability, any then outstanding
          Options may be exercised at any time before their expiration date or
          within three months after the date of termination, whichever is
          earlier, but only (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) to
          the extent that such Options were exercisable when employment ceased,
          and to the extent not so exercisable, the Option shall terminate on
          the date employment ceases; provided,
<PAGE>

                                       -6-


          however, that if a Participant is terminated for cause the Committee
          may determine that no Option may be exercised at any time after the
          termination date.

     (2)  If a Participant's employment terminates because of death or permanent
          disability, all then outstanding Options previously granted to the
          Participant will become exercisable.  In the case of death of the
          Participant, such Options may be exercised at any time before their
          expiration date or within three years after the date of termination,
          whichever is earlier.  In the case of permanent disability, such
          Options may be exercised at any time before their expiration date.

     (3)  If a Participant's employment terminates because of retirement, any
          then outstanding Options may be exercised at any time before their
          expiration date or within five years after the date of termination,
          whichever is earlier, but only (unless otherwise determined by the
          Committee) to the extent that such Options were exercisable when
          employment ceased, and to the extent not so exercisable, the Option
          shall terminate on the date employment ceases.


SECTION 7.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

(a)  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Stock Appreciation Rights
     in tandem with the grant of an Option or freestanding and unrelated to an
     Option.  Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with an Option may be
     granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Option.

     Stock Appreciation Rights or any applicable portion thereof granted in
     tandem with a given Option shall only be exercisable to the extent that the
     related Option is exercisable and shall terminate and no longer be
     exercisable upon the expiration, termination, or cancellation of the
     related Option.

     The exercise of an Option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any
     Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with that Option, and the
     exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right shall cause an immediate
     forfeiture of its related Option.  Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be
     exercisable after the expiration of ten years from date of grant.  A Stock
     Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be exercised by an
     optionee, in accordance with this Section 7, by surrendering the applicable
     portion of the related Option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the
     optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner
     prescribed in this Section 7.
<PAGE>

                                       -7-


(b)  A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive from
     the Corporation an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a
     share of Common Stock on the date of the exercise of the Stock Appreciation
     Right over the grant price thereof, provided that the Committee may for
     administrative convenience determine that, for any Stock Appreciation Right
     which is not related to an Incentive Stock Option and can only be exercised
     during limited periods of time in order to satisfy the conditions of
     certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exercise of
     any such Stock Appreciation Right for cash during such limited period shall
     be deemed to occur for all purposes hereunder on the day during such
     limited period on which the Fair Market Value of the Stock is the highest.
     Any such determination by the Committee may be changed by the Committee
     from time to time and may govern the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
     granted prior to such determination as well as Stock Appreciation Rights
     thereafter granted.  The Committee shall determine whether Stock
     Appreciation Rights shall be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or a
     combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

SECTION 8.  LIMITED RIGHTS.

(a)  The Committee shall have the authority to grant Limited Rights in tandem
     with the grant of an Option or freestanding and unrelated to an Option.
     Limited Rights granted in tandem with an Option may be granted either at or
     after the time of the grant of such Option.

     Limited Rights or any applicable portion thereof granted in tandem with a
     given Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the
     expiration, termination or cancellation of the related Option.  The
     exercise of an Option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any
     Limited Right granted in tandem with that Option, and the exercise of such
     Limited Right shall cause an immediate forfeiture of its related Option.

     A Limited Right granted in tandem with an Option may be exercised by an
     optionee, in accordance with this Section 8, by surrendering the applicable
     portion of the related Option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the
     optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner
     prescribed in this Section 8.

(b)  Limited Rights shall only be exercisable during the 30 day period following
     a Change in Control as defined in Section 11 and shall not be exercisable
     after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant.

(c)  Upon the exercise of a Limited Right, an optionee shall be entitled to
     receive from the Corporation an amount in cash equal in value to the excess
     of (i) the higher of
<PAGE>

                                       -8-


     (A) the highest price per share paid in connection with the Change in
     Control or (B) the highest Fair Market Value per share as reported in the
     Wall Street Journal at any time during the 60 day period preceding the
     Change in Control over (ii) in the case of a Limited Right granted in
     tandem with an Option, the Option Price per share specified in the related
     Option and in the case of all other Limited Rights, the price per share
     established in the grant of the Limited Right (which shall not be less than
     the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant),
     such excess to be multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which
     the Limited Right shall have been exercised; provided, however, that upon
     the exercise of a Limited Right granted in tandem with an Incentive Stock
     Option, the amount set forth in clause (i) shall not exceed the Fair Market
     Value of a share on the date of exercise of the Limited Right.

(d)  Limited Rights shall be subject to such other terms and conditions, not
     inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined from
     time to time by the Committee.  This Section 8 shall be interpreted in
     accordance and consistent with the principles set forth in Rule 16b-3 of
     the Exchange Act.


SECTION 9.  RESTRICTED STOCK.

(a)  GRANT.  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant shares of Restricted
     Stock to such eligible Participants as it may select.  The Committee shall
     determine the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be granted to each
     Participant, whether or not the Restricted Stock Award is designed to
     satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations
     thereunder, the duration of the Restriction Period ( if any) during which,
     and the conditions under which, the Restricted Stock may be forfeited to
     the Corporation, and the other terms and conditions of such Awards.  The
     Committee may condition the vesting of shares of Restricted Stock on
     Performance Measures to be attained by the Corporation and/or the
     Participant over a stated Performance Period.

(b)  ASSIGNABILITY.  Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned,
     transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except as herein provided,
     during the Restriction Period.

(c)  DIVIDENDS.  The Committee shall determine whether dividends payable on
     shares of Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Participant during the
     Restriction Period or held in a suspense account for payment (with or
     without interest) to the Participant only in the event of the vesting of
     the underlying shares of Restricted Stock.

(d)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Subject to Section 11 of this Plan, all of the
     provisions governing the satisfaction of Performance Measures and the
     termination of the Restriction Period relating to a Restricted Stock Award,
     or any cancellation or forfeiture of shares of Restricted Stock upon
     termination of employment of the Participant, whether by reason of death,
     permanent disability, retirement, or otherwise, shall be set forth in the
     Agreement relating to such Restricted Stock Award, or in guidelines
     established by the Committee and made applicable to such Restricted Stock
     Award.

SECTION 10.  PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

(a)  GRANT.  The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Performance Share
     Awards to such eligible Participants as it may select.  The Committee shall
     determine the number of Performance Shares to be granted to each
     Participant, whether or not the Performance Share Award is designed to
     satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations
     thereunder, the Performance Measures and Performance Period applicable to
     each grant, and any other terms and conditions relating to each grant, not
     inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem
     advisable.

(b)  SETTLEMENT.  The Agreement relating to a Performance Share Award (i) shall
     specify whether such award may be settled in shares of Common Stock
     (including shares of Restricted Stock) or cash or a combination thereof;
     and (ii) may specify whether the holder thereof shall be entitled to
     receive, on a current or deferred basis, dividend equivalents, and if
     determined by the Committee, interest on any deferred dividend equivalents
     with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award.
     Prior to the settlement of a Performance Share Award in shares of Common
     Stock, including Restricted Stock, the holders of such award shall have no
     rights as a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to the shares of
     Common Stock subject to such Award.

(c)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  Subject to Section 11 of this Plan, all of the
     terms relating the satisfaction of Performance Measures and the termination
     of the Performance Period relating to a Performance Share Award, or any
     cancellation or forfeiture of such Performance Share Award upon a
     termination of employment, whether by reason of death, disability,

<PAGE>

                                      -10-


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and notwithstanding
any contrary waiting period or installment period in any agreement relating to
an Award or in the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter
defined), (i) each outstanding Option, Stock Appreciation Right and Limited
Right granted under the Plan shall become exercisable in full for the aggregate
number of shares covered thereby; (ii) any Performance Measure relating to any
Restricted Stock or Performance Share Award (including any Restricted Stock
already granted or to be granted in satisfaction of a Performance Share Award)
shall be deemed to be satisfied at the maximum level; and (iii) any Restriction
Period and/or Performance Period relating to any Restricted Stock or Performance
Share Award (including any Restricted Stock already granted or to be granted in
satisfaction of a Performance Share Award) shall lapse (and any other conditions
pertaining to the vesting of any such Award shall be waived) and such shares and
Awards shall be deemed fully vested.

For purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
upon the first to occur of the following events:

     (i)    any "person," as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
            the Exchange Act (other than the Corporation, a trustee or other
            fiduciary holding Voting Securities under an employee benefit plan
            of the Corporation, or any corporation owned, directly or
            indirectly, by the stockholders of the Corporation in substantially
            the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the
            Corporation), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
            Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of
            securities of the Corporation representing more than 40% of the
            number of the Corporation's then outstanding Voting Securities,
            excluding any "person" who becomes such a beneficial owner in
            connection with an Excluded Transaction described in clause (iii)
            below;

      (ii)  the following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a
            majority of the directors then serving:  individuals who on January
            1, 1996, constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a
            director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an
            actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to
            a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the
            Corporation) whose appointment or election by the Board or
            nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders was
            approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors
            then still in office who either were directors on January 1, 1996 or
            whose appointment or election or nomination for election was
            previously so approved;

     (iii)  there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Corporation
            (or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
            Corporation) with any other
<PAGE>

                                      -11-


            corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result
            in the Voting Securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately
            prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining
            outstanding or being converted into voting securities of the
            surviving entity or any parent thereof) more than 60% of the
            combined voting power of the Voting Securities of the Corporation
            (or the voting securities of such surviving entity or any parent
            thereof) outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation
            (an Excluded Transaction"); or

     (iv)   the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete
            liquidation of the Corporation or there is consummated an agreement
            for the sale or disposition by the Corporation of all or
            substantially all of the Corporation's assets.


SECTION 12.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

(a)  WITHHOLDING.  The Employer shall have the right to deduct from all amounts
     paid to a Participant in cash (whether under this Plan or otherwise) any
     taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under this Plan.
     In the case of payments of Awards in the form of Common Stock, at the
     Committee's discretion the Participant may be required to pay to the
     Employer the amount of any taxes required to be withheld with respect to
     such Common Stock, or, in lieu thereof, to the extent permitted by
     applicable federal and state securities laws, the Employer shall have the
     right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the opportunity to elect
     to tender) the number of shares of Common Stock whose Fair Market Value
     equals the amount required to be withheld.   The Optionee shall be entitled
     to elect to pay all or a portion of the exercise price for options granted
     under this Plan and any withholding taxes in connection with such exercise
     by having the shares of Common Stock to be issued by the Corporation
     pursuant to such exercise sold by a broker-dealer under circumstances
     meeting the requirements of 12 C.F.R. Section 220.

(b)  NONTRANSFERABILITY.  Unless so provided in the Agreement with respect to
     such Award, no Award shall be assignable or transferable, and no right or
     interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, obligation or
     liability of the Participant, except by will or the laws of descent and
     distribution.

(c)  NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  No person shall have any claim or right to be
     granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as
     giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the
     Employer.  Further, the Employer expressly reserves the right at any time
     to dismiss a Participant free from any
<PAGE>

                                      -12-


     liability, or any claim under the Plan, except as provided herein or in any
     agreement entered into with respect to an Award.

(d)  NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER.  Subject to the provisions of the applicable
     Award, no Participant or transferee of an Option shall have any rights as a
     stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed
     under the Plan until he or she has become the holder thereof.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted
     Stock hereunder, the applicable Award shall specify if and to what extent
     the Participant shall not be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in
     respect of such Restricted Stock.

(e)  CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLAN.  The validity, construction, interpretation,
     administration and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and
     rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with
     the laws of the State of Delaware.

(f)  EFFECTIVE DATE.  Subject to the approval of the stockholders of the
     Corporation, the Plan shall be effective on March 8, 1996 (the "Effective
     Date").  No Options or Awards may be granted under the Plan after March 7,
     2006.

(g)  AMENDMENT OF PLAN.  The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or
     any portion thereof at any time.  The Chief Executive Officer shall be
     authorized to make minor or administrative modifications to the Plan as
     well as modifications to the Plan which may be dictated by requirements of
     federal or state statutes applicable to the Corporation or authorized or
     made desirable by such statutes.  No modification or termination of the
     Plan shall, without the optionee's consent, alter or impair any of his or
     her rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted to him or her
     under the Plan.

(h)  AMENDMENT OF AWARD.  The Committee may amend, modify or terminate any
     outstanding Award with the Participant's consent at any time prior to
     payment or exercise in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the
     Plan, including without limitation, (i) to change the date or dates as of
     which (A) an Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Limited Right becomes
     exercisable, or (B)  shares of Restricted Stock or Performance Share Awards
     become nonforfeitable; or (ii) to cancel and reissue an Award under such
     different terms and conditions as it determines appropriate.

(i)  HARDSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS.  In no event shall any Option granted under this
     Plan be exercisable through payment of the Option Price in cash during the
     period of one year following a hardship distribution under the UNUM
     Employees Retirement Savings Plan and Trust, as defined therein.

                                      -13-


(j)  ADJUSTMENTS AND ASSUMPTION.  In the event of a reorganization,
     recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares,
     merger, consolidation, distribution of assets, or any other change in the
     corporate structure or shares of the Corporation, the Committee shall make
     such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the number and kind of shares
     authorized by the Plan, in the number and kind of shares or Performance
     Shares covered by the Awards granted, in the maximum number of Options,
     Restricted Stock and Performance Shares which may be granted to any
     individual Participant in a single calendar year, and in the purchase price
     of outstanding Options.  In the event of any merger, consolidation or other
     reorganization in which the Corporation is not the surviving or continuing
     corporation, unless otherwise provided for in the documents governing such
     merger, consolidation or other reorganization, all Awards granted hereunder
     and outstanding on the date of such event shall be assumed by the surviving
     or continuing corporation with appropriate adjustment as to the number and
     kind of shares and purchase price of the shares.

          THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, made and entered into as of the 30th day of
July, 1992, by and among UNUM CORPORATION, a corporation incorporated and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware ("UNUM"), DUNCANSON & HOLT,
INC., a corporation incorporated and existing under the laws of the State of New
York ("Employer"), and Thomas G. Brown, an individual residing in the State of

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and as a condition to the
Closing thereunder, Employee is to be employed by Employer upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth and, by virtue of such employment, Employee
will render services and make other contributions of a valuable and unique
nature to Employer; and

          WHEREAS, Employee's prior position of responsibility with Employer has

disclose (otherwise than as permitted by this Employment Agreement) any of the
trade secrets, confidential information and proprietary business methods of
Employer and UNUM which Employee has acquired and will acquire in his position
of responsibility with Employer, or if Employee were to solicit Pool
Participants or customers of Employer or UNUM Pool Participants in competition

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
contained herein, the mutual receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

          1.   DUTIES OF EMPLOYEE.  Employer hereby employs Employee as the
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer.  Employee will
perform the duties of such offices and such other duties for Employer as
directed from time to time by the Board of Directors of Employer (the "Board"),
including, without limitation, participation in the evaluation of Employer's
services and in the planning and evaluation of future products and services and
market opportunities.  The precise duties of Employee may be extended or
curtailed by the Board; provided, that:  (a)  such duties as changed shall be
commensurate with the position recited above in which Employee serves under this
Agreement and for senior vice presidents of UNUM Life Insurance Company of
America and  (b)  Employee shall have no obligation or duty to relocate his
place of employment outside the greater New York metropolitan area.  UNUM agrees
to vote to elect Employee to serve on the Board during the term of this
Agreement.

          2.   PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES.  Employee hereby accepts such employment
and agrees with Employer that:  (a)  he will undertake and perform the stated
duties in accordance with the supervision and direction of the Board and subject
to the performance standards mutually agreed upon by Employee and the Board at
the beginning of each year;  (b)  he will diligently and faithfully devote all
of his business time, attention, knowledge, experience and skills and his best
efforts to the performance of all such duties and to the business activities of
Employer and, if requested, UNUM, and  (c)  he will not engage in any other
occupation, employment or business activity, whether or not for gain, profit or
other pecuniary advantage, without the express written consent of the Board;
provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed to prevent
Employee from investing his assets in any enterprise in such form or manner as
does not violate any other provision of this Agreement and will not require the
rendering of any substantial services by Employee.

          Employee agrees that this Employment Agreement supersedes all prior
employment agreements, arrangements or understandings with Employer, all of
which are hereby terminated, and Employee hereby releases any and all claims,
causes of actions, rights or privileges of any kind or nature whatsoever under
or arising out of all such agreements, arrangements or understandings.  Employee
represents and warrants to Employer that he is free to accept employment with
Employer as contemplated herein and that he has no prior or other obligations or
commitments of any kind to anyone which would in any way conflict, hinder or
interfere with his acceptance of, or the full performance of, his obligations
hereunder.

          Employee agrees to serve as a Director of Employer when elected.

          3.   COMPENSATION.  

               (a)  BASE SALARY.  In consideration of the covenants of 
Employee hereunder, during the term of this Agreement, Employee shall be paid

                                        2
<PAGE>

twenty-six (26) regular pay periods ("Base Salary").  After March 31, 1994,
Employee's Base Salary may be increased (but not decreased) by the Board based
upon Employee's annual salary review in accordance with UNUM's general policies.

               (b)  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  As additional compensation during the
term of this Agreement, Employee will receive the employee benefits which
Employer provides for its officers generally.  In addition, Employee shall have
the use of a company car and driver reasonably satisfactory to Employee, and the
choice of travel and accommodation arrangements for business travel.

               (c)  BONUS COMPENSATION.  In addition to the foregoing, Employee
shall be entitled to participate in the following in accordance with the
respective terms thereof:  (i)  Employer's Underwriting Management Incentive
Plan,  (ii)  Employer's Pool/Retrocession Participation Incentive Plan, and
(iii)  a specially designed annual incentive plan (AIP) having the principal
features outlined on Schedule 1 attached hereto.  Employee shall also receive
for the term hereof 2% of annual profit commissions earned by Employer in each
fiscal year (based on the audited annual financial statements for such year used
for purposes of awards made under the Underwriting Management Incentive Plan),
and shall be eligible for UNUM's senior management long-term incentive plans,
including the stock option and restricted stock plans at the next grant date.

               (d)  COMPENSATION FOR EMPLOYEE COVENANTS.  As additional

payable hereunder shall be subject to withholding for appropriate items,
including Federal, State and local income taxes, FICA, FUTA, voluntary
contribution and other payroll deductions.  All salary, bonuses and other
compensation payable hereunder and deductible by Employer and all non-
competition payments made to Employee by Employer shall be reported as ordinary
income for Federal income tax purposes.

               (f)  JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.  UNUM and Employer shall be
jointly and severally liable for amounts to be paid Employee under this
Agreement.

          4.   TERM OF AGREEMENT; TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect until the fifth anniversary of the date hereof unless
terminated earlier as follows:

               (a)  BREACH BY EMPLOYER; TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE.  Employee
may, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Employer, terminate this
Agreement in the event Employer materially breaches or defaults under any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement (and such breach or default, if reasonable
conducive to being cured, is not

<PAGE>

cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of breach from Employee).
Employer may at any time terminate Employee without cause.

               (b)  EMPLOYEE'S REMEDIES.  Upon termination of this Agreement by
Employee or Employer pursuant to Subsection 4(a):  (i)  Employee's obligations
under Section 1 and 2 shall cease;  (ii)  Employer's obligation to provide to
Employee the compensation set forth in Section 3(a) shall continue through the
fifth anniversary of the date hereof as if Employee continued as an employee
hereunder and no such termination occurred;  (iii)  Employer's obligation to
provide to Employee the compensation set forth in Section 3(c) shall cease;
(iv)  Employer shall pay Employee $750,000 at the end of each year for the
remaining term of this Agreement, except that, in the year in which any such
termination occurs, such payment shall be reduced by any bonus compensation
already paid under Section 3(c) for that year;  (v)  Employee shall continue to
receive the employee benefits referred to in Section 3(b) to the extent
permitted under the terms and conditions of the applicable plans; and  (iv)
Employer shall continue to pay Employee the payments set forth in Section 3(d),

               (c)  BREACH BY EMPLOYEE; VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EMPLOYEE.
Employer or UNUM may, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Employee,
terminate this Agreement in whole or in part in the event Employee:  (i)
knowingly and materially breaches or defaults under any of the material
representations, warranties, terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) to which Employee
is a party (and such breach or default, if reasonably conducive to being cured,
is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of breach from
Employer);  (ii)  knowingly and materially breaches or defaults under any of the
representations, warranties, terms or conditions of this Agreement (and such
breach or default, if reasonably conductive to being cured, is not cured within
thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of breach from Employer) including,
without limitation, the material failure of Employee to perform the duties and
obligations under Section 1 of this Agreement in accordance with the performance
standards described in Section 2 hereof (determined after giving due
consideration to historical performance of Employee);  (iii)  violates the
reasonable directions of the Board (and such violation, if reasonably conducive
to being cured, is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of
the violation from Employer);  (iv)  is convicted of a felony under Federal,
State or local laws; or  (v)  conducts himself in a manner which materially
harms or causes material injury to the reputation or goodwill of Employer or
UNUM or both.  Employee may voluntarily terminate his employment under this
Agreement at any time.

               (d)  EMPLOYER'S REMEDIES.  Upon termination of  this Agreement by
Employer for Employee's breach pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) of Subsection
4(c), Employer's obligations to provide to Employee the compensation and other
benefits set forth in Section 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall cease immediately
upon such termination; provided, that:  (i)  Employer may continue to make the
payments set forth in Section 3(d)


                                        4
<PAGE>

above at Employer's option for any period of time, and, in such event, Employee
shall remain obligated to perform the covenants under Section 5(c) for the
length of such period plus two years; and  (ii)  in the event Employer elects
not to continue such payments, Employee shall remain bound to perform the
covenants under Section 5(c) for a period of two years following termination.
In the event Employee voluntarily terminates his employment, the same conditions
as stated above shall apply; except that, in the event Employee voluntarily
terminates his employment prior to the second anniversary of this Agreement,
Employer's obligation to make payments under Section 3(d) shall immediately
cease and Employer may stop making such payments (in which event Employee shall
continue to remain obligated under Section 5(c) for two years) or Employer may
continue to make payments set forth in Section 3(d) above at Employer's option
for any period of time and, in such event Employee shall remain obligated under
Section 5(c) for the length of such period plus two years; and, in the event
Employee voluntarily terminates his employment on a date after the second
anniversary of this Agreement, Employee shall continue to receive payments under
Section 3(d) for the balance of the term of this Agreement, and shall continue
to be bound by his obligations under Section 5(c) through the fifth anniversary
of this Agreement plus two years.

               (e)  DEATH OF EMPLOYEE.  This Agreement shall terminate
immediately upon the death of Employee.  If this Agreement is terminated because
Employee dies, Employee's estate will continue to receive the compensation set
forth in Section 3(a) of this Agreement until the final day of the month in
which his death occurs, and Section 3(c) and 3(b) of this Agreement, to the
extent provided under the terms and conditions of the applicable plans.

               (f)  SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS.  It is expressly understood and
agreed that termination of this Agreement in whole or in part shall not deprive
the parties hereto of any rights nor release them of any obligations which under
the terms and provisions of this Agreement are to survive such termination,
including, by way of example and not limitation, the rights and obligations of
Employee set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement.

          5.   COVENANTS OF EMPLOYEE.  In consideration of the covenants of
Employer set forth herein, particularly, the compensation terms as set forth in
Section 3, Employee hereby covenants, represents and warrants that:

               (a)  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  He has read carefully all of the terms and
provisions of this Section 5, given careful consideration to the restrictions
imposed upon him hereby and agrees that the same are reasonable with respect to
the subject matter thereof and are necessary for the reasonable and proper
protection of the confidential information, legitimate business interests and
goodwill of Employer and UNUM.  He acknowledges that Employer and UNUM have
agreed to enter into this Agreement, in part, in reliance on the
representations, agreements, and covenants of Employee to abide by and be bound
by such terms and provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement.  All references to
UNUM or Employer, as the case may be, in this Agreement shall mean and


                                        5
<PAGE>

include each direct and indirect subsidiary thereof (other than Employer and its
direct or indirect subsidiaries in the case of a reference to UNUM).

               (b)  DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                    (i)  Employee acknowledges that the nature of the business
of Employer and UNUM is such that information, data, "know-how," plans, studies,
procedures and processes of the kinds described in this Section 5(b)
("Confidential Information") are sufficiently secret to derive economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known to other persons who can
obtain economic value from disclosure or use thereof, and are therefore of a
confidential and proprietary nature, and that each of the categories set forth
in Section 5(b) (ii) and 5(b) (iii), separately as well as collectively, contain
in whole or in part information considered by UNUM and Employer to be trade
secrets.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that, subject to the exceptions set forth
below, he shall not for the period specified, directly or indirectly, reveal,
divulge, publish or otherwise make known to any other person, firm, association,
corporation, partnership or other legal entity (a "Third Party") and shall not
use or permit any Third Party within his control, authority or under his
supervision to use any Confidential Information, whether of a technical or
commercial nature:  (A)  unless specifically authorized to do so in writing by
the Board with respect to Employer or by duly authorized action of an executive
officer of UNUM with respect to UNUM,  (B)  unless the specific item of
Confidential Information becomes generally available to the public without
violation of this Agreement or any other confidentiality agreement among
Employee, Employer or UNUM or any other confidentiality agreement to which
Employee is a party,  (C)  unless such disclosure is compelled by law, in which
event Employee agrees to give UNUM immediate written notice of any disclosure to
be made pursuant to this Subsection (C), and Employee shall, at Employer's
expense, cooperate fully with Employer to obtain protective orders, confidential
treatment or other such protective action as may be available to preserve the
confidentiality of the information required to be disclosed, or (D)  unless and
to the extent that disclosure of any such Confidential Information is (I)
necessary and appropriate in connection with the submission of bids by Employer
in the ordinary course of business or (II)  required pursuant to Employer's
marketing efforts directed at specific clients or prospective clients, offers to
allow inspection of its systems or services to potential clients or licensees of
Employer or the provisions of services to existing clients in the ordinary
course of business.

                    (ii)  Employee agrees that he shall be obligated under
Section 5(b) (i) for the term of this Agreement with Company plus three (3)
years with respect to any of the following types of information:  pricing,
underwriting, actuarial analyses, claims criteria, operating procedures,
techniques, systems and methods employed by Employer or any Pool, general
information relating to past, present and prospective participants in the
reinsurance pools and reinsurers of such pools of the Employer and its
subsidiaries ("Pool Participants"), ceding insurance company clients of Employer
and its subsidiaries or, customers or treaty holders of Employer or UNUM,
general information concerning employees of Employer and UNUM, other commercial
"know-how" relating to the


                                        6
<PAGE>

business of Employer and UNUM, record keeping techniques, current expansion
plans, general overviews of contemplated products or services and generally,
without limiting the foregoing, any information not available to the public
generally and pertaining to the business or financial operations of Employer and
UNUM, as now or hereafter conducted.

                    (iii)  Employee agrees that the Board, with respect to
Employer, or duly authorized executive officer of UNUM, with respect to UNUM,
shall have the right, in the reasonable exercise of its or his discretion, to
designate information or data as Confidential Information.

                    (iv)  Employee further agrees not to copy, reproduce,
record, make facsimiles, duplicate in any fashion, abstract, summarize, remove,
use, keep or otherwise improperly deal in or with any papers, records, reports,
books, manuals, electronic media or written or recorded information of any kind,
or any other property of any kind owned or used in Employer's or UNUM's
business, transferred to Employer or UNUM or hereafter owned or used by Employer
or UNUM, except as required in furtherance of the business of Employer or UNUM
or as may be expressly permitted in writing by the Board with respect to
Employer or by duly authorized action of an executive officer of UNUM with
respect to UNUM.  Employee shall surrender all such materials to Employer or
UNUM immediately upon the request of  Employer or UNUM.

               (c)  COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.  Employee agrees that, unless
otherwise authorized in writing by the Board with respect to Employer, or by
duly authorized action of an executive officer of UNUM with respect to UNUM, he
will not, during the term of this Agreement plus two (2) years from the date of
the termination thereof (regardless of the reason for such termination):

                    (i)  engage, either directly or indirectly, as an officer,
director, employee, agent, consultant, shareholder, owner, partner or principal,
or in any other capacity, in a business venture (the "Venture") which competes
directly or indirectly with UNUM or Employer in the business described below in
Subsection 5(e) within the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia,
Japan, and any other country in which Employer or UNUM then conducts such
business or has made material preparations to conduct such business;

                    (ii)  in any manner solicit, induce or attempt to induce, or
assist others to solicit, induce or attempt to induce, any Pool Participant,
customer, client, purchaser, supplier, employee, agent, representative or other
person associated with the Company at such time or, in the case of any Pool
Participant or customer, in the prior year, to terminate its, his or her
association with UNUM or Employer, or in any other manner, directly or
indirectly, interfere with any relationship between UNUM or Employer and any
such person; or

                    (iii)  hire or attempt to hire, either directly or
indirectly, any individual employed by UNUM or Employer during their employment
or for a period of


                                        7

six (6) months (or, in the case of members of the Executive Committee of
Employer at the date hereof, one year) following said employee's cessation of
such employment.

               (d)  Nothing in this Section 5 shall prohibit Employee from being
a passive owner in the aggregate of not more than five per cent (5%) of the
outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded,
provided that Employee does not actively participate in any capacity or in any
manner in the business or affairs of such corporation.

               (e)  The business subject to this Section 5 shall be the business
of Employer as conducted by Employer during the term of this Agreement and any
business of UNUM of a substantially similar nature or related to the business of
the Employer and shall include, but not be limited to the following activities.

                    (i)  The underwriting, offering, marketing and/or selling of
reinsurance products and services; and the management of reinsurance and
retrocession pools, including without limitation pools operating in the accident

subsection, "accident and health reinsurance" includes but is not limited to the
following types of reinsurance:  special risk, disability, medical and long term
care;

                    (ii)  any activities for which Employer provides or has
provided services to UNUM; and

                    (iii)  any activities with respect to which Employee
possesses Confidential Information obtained from UNUM.

          This Section 5 shall apply with respect to the business as conducted
by Employer with any Pool Participant, any customer of UNUM, Employer, or any
Pool or any other entity or persons with which Employee has done business on
behalf of Employer or UNUM.

               (f)  INVENTIONS, DISCOVERIES, IDEAS.

                    Employee agrees to promptly disclose in writing to Employer
(and to no one else) all improvements, discoveries, ideas, developments,
designs, techniques, methods and inventions (hereinafter referred to as
"Inventions") made or conceived alone or in conjunction with others while in the
employment of Employer, if resulting from or related to such employment (whether
or not copyrightable or patentable, whether or not made or conceived at the
request of Employer during or out of usual hours of work or in or about the
premises of Employer or elsewhere, and whether made or conceived prior or
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement).  Any and all such Inventions
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Employer and are hereby assigned to
Employer, its successors and assigns, including any and all copyright or patent
rights


                                        8

inherent therein.  At the request of Employer and at Employer's cost, Employee
will assist Employer, or any person or persons from time to time designated by
Employer, in preparing and prosecuting applications for letters patent of the
United States and such foreign countries as Employer may select or for copyright
protection in Employer's name or to take such other action as is deemed
necessary to vest, perfect, or maintain in Employer all right, title and
interest in and to such Inventions, or to defend the same, in the United States
or in such other country or countries as may be designated by Employer.  In
connection therewith, Employee agrees to execute such applications, statements
or other documents, furnish such information and data and take all such other
action (including, but not limited to, the giving of testimony) as Employer may
from time to time reasonably request at Employer's sole expense.

               (g)  REMEDIES FOR BREACH.

                    (i)  Employee agrees and acknowledges that money damages may
not be an adequate remedy for his breach of any of the provisions of Subsection
(b), (c), or (f) of this Section 5; therefore, in the event of the breach by
Employee of any of the provisions of Subsection (b), (c) or (f) of this Section,
Employer or UNUM, or either of them, in addition and supplementary to other
rights and remedies existing in their favor, may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction at law or equity, for specific performance or injunctive relief or
both or other equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of
the provisions hereof.

                    (ii)  If, at the time of enforcement of this Agreement, a
court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the
maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area.  Whenever possible, each
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law.

               6.   NO LIMITATION OR WAIVER OF RIGHTS.  Each right, power or
privilege of any party hereto specified or referred to in this Agreement is in
addition to, and not a limitation of, any other rights, powers and privileges
that such party may otherwise have or acquire by operation of law, by contract
or otherwise.  No course of dealing on the part of, nor any omission or delay
by, such party with respect to the exercise of any right, power or privilege
shall operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege, and such party
may exercise each such right, power or privilege either independently or
concurrently with the others, as often and in such order as such party desires.

               7.   OTHER AGREEMENTS.  The parties hereto understand and agree
that this Agreement is conditioned upon the Closing under the Purchase
Agreement, and that if the closing under the Purchase Agreement shall not occur,

provisions or conditions of this Agreement or of any of the rights, powers or
privileges of a party hereto shall be effective or binding unless in writing and

               9.   INVALIDITY OF TERMS.  it is mutually understood and agreed
that, except for Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement, all agreements and
covenants contained herein are severable and that, in the event or to the extent
any of them, with the exception of said Sections 1 and 2, shall be held to be
invalid in whole or in part by any competent court, this Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such invalid agreements or covenants, or portions thereof,
were not contained herein.

subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns.
Employee may not assign, pledge or encumber in any way all or any part of his
interest under this Agreement without the prior written consent of  Employer.
This Agreement shall not be assignable by Employer other than to UNUM or a UNUM
affiliate without Employee's prior written consent.  If Employee gives such
consent, the assignee shall assume all Employer's obligations hereunder, but
such assignment shall not relieve UNUM of any of its obligations under Section
3(f).

               11.  APPLICABLE LAW.  This Agreement shall be construed in all
respect in accordance with and shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York (without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof).

                                   SCHEDULE 1
                                       TO
                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

          Employee shall be eligible to participate in UNUM's Annual Incentive
Plan (AIP) program according to the terms thereof, subject to the following
specific terms and modifications:

          1.   Awards to Employee under the AIP will depend on the achievement
               by UNUM Corporation of specified, targeted financial results as
               measured by Net Earnings Per Share, and on the criteria set forth
               in Paragraph 4 below.  The term "Net Earnings Per Share" is
               defined, for any fiscal year of UNUM, as the income of UNUM
               Corporation for such fiscal year (as shown on UNUM's audited
               financial statements at the end of such fiscal year), after
               taking into account realized capital gains and losses, divided by
               the average number of issued and outstanding shares of UNUM
               Corporation as of the end of such fiscal year.

          2.   The financial targets, for purposes of determining awards to
               Employee under AIP, will be set annually by the UNUM Board, and
               will include:

               (a)  a "Minimum Threshold" for Net Earnings Per Share, below
                    which no award will be made to Employee under the AIP;

               (b)  a "Target threshold" for Net Earnings Per Share, the
                    achievement of which will permit the Board to award Employee
                    20% of Employee's actual base salary earnings for the plan
                    year under the AIP;

               (c)  a "Maximum Threshold" for Net Earnings Per Share, the
                    achievement of which will permit the Board to award Employee
                    up to 40% of Employee's actual base salary earnings for the
                    plan year under the AIP.

               For 1992, these financial targets are as follows:

               Threshold      Net Earnings Per Share
               ---------      ----------------------


               Minimum             $3.00
               Target              $3.32
               Maximum             $3.70


                                       13
<PAGE>

          3.   The amount awarded in any year may range from 0 to 40% of
               Employee's actual base salary earnings, depending on the above
               criteria and those set forth in Paragraph 4 below.  Employee's
               maximum award under the AIP in any year shall be 40% of actual
               base salary earnings.

          4.   The amount of any award to Employee under the AIP shall be
               determined by, in addition to the achievement of the financial
               targets set forth above, a qualitative assessment of the
               performance of both UNUM and Employee over the relevant fiscal
               year.  For 1992, this assessment will include consideration of
               Employee's support of vision and values, affirmative action
               efforts, corporate marketing strategy, teamwork and
               collaboration.

          5.   All awards under the AIP are subject to UNUM Board approval.

          6.   Employee must be actively working for Employer at the time any
               award is made under the AIP.

          Starting in 1996 you will participate in the Annual Incentive Plan
          that may apply to executives at your level.

     2.   ANNUAL RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT:  1990 LONG TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
          During each annual cycle (typically March of each year) you will
          participate in this program.  For the March 1995 cycle only, AS PART
          OF YOUR HIRING AGREEMENT, YOU WILL BE AWARDED A RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT
          VALUED AT $250,000 which will result in a minimum grant of 7,000
          shares of restricted stock.  This grant will be vested on a time lapse
          (rather than performance) basis with restrictions lapsing in March of
          1998.  Starting in 1996 you will participate in the restricted stock
          program (or any successor plan) that may apply to executives at your
          level.

          Currently the restricted stock program is a (3) year performance plan,
          with restrictions  lapsing contingent upon attainment of established
          ROE targets for the three year period.  For example:  the grant which
          will occur in 1995 for other executives will vest in 1998, contingent
          upon the attainment of an average annual ROE target for the three year
          period of 1995-1997.  The target is approved by the Board of Directors
          immediately prior to the grant.  You should also be aware that the
          shares are issued in your name and you will receive all dividends
          during the vesting period.

C.   LONG TERM INCENTIVE: UNUM CORPORATION EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN
     During each annual cycle,(March of each year) you will be awarded stock
     options (actual number is contingent upon stock price at the time and a
     Black Scholes evaluation).  YOUR FIRST GRANT UNDER THIS PLAN WILL AT LEAST
     15,000 SHARES  These options currently have a life of ten years, and vest
     after one year, subject to the terms of the plan.  In future years you will
     participate in this plan as other executives at your level.

D.   SEVERANCE:
     Absent a change of control of UNUM Corporation, if you terminate from UNUM
     for any reason other than resignation or cause during your first five years
     of employment, you will receive a severance payment equivalent to two years
     base salary, and UNUM's standard executive out placement support.  After
     five years, if you terminate for any reason other than resignation or
     cause, you will receive the standard severance package in effect at the
     time.  Restricted stock in your name and stock options, as well as other
     employee benefits, will be governed by the terms of the applicable plan or
     program.

E.   CHANGE IN CONTROL:
     In the event of a change of control of UNUM Corporation, if within two
     years thereafter your employment is terminated without cause or if you
     leave for "good reason", you would receive a severance payment equal to
     three years salary plus incentive, plus a lump sum payment equal to the
     present value of three years extra credit under your retirement plan.  In
     addition you would continue to be provided for three years with life,
     disability, and accident & health benefits, except to the extent that
     equivalent benefits are provided by a subsequent employer.  In addition,
     all unvested stock options and restricted stock in your name will
     immediately vest.

F.   PENSION:
     For the first ten years of employment with UNUM, you will receive two years
     credit for each year of employment.  A portion of this benefit will be
     covered under a non-qualified plan.  Please be aware, however, that in
     order to have any vested benefit, you must be employed at UNUM for five
     years.

G.   FINANCIAL PLANNING:
     You will be provided the services of a Financial Counselor (currently the
     Colony Group) or reimbursement to procure the services of a Counselor of
     your choosing ($5,300 for 1995, and $3,500/year thereafter, plus
     $2,500/year reimbursement for related items (will preparation, tax returns,
     etc.).

Preliminary Purchase Price, Purchaser and/or Newco, as applicable, shall
transfer to Seller cash in the amount of such difference, together with interest
thereon computed at an Annual Rate as specified above from and including the
Closing Date to but not including the date of such transfer.  Amounts required
to be transferred from Purchaser and Newco to Seller or from Seller to Purchaser
and Newco pursuant to this Section shall be netted against one another so that
only a single net transfer shall be required.  Any transfer of cash or Cash
Equivalents required under this Section 2.04 shall be made within ten Business
Days of the date of the delivery of the Final Balance Sheet and calculation of
Final Customer Asset Value to Purchaser.  The Final Purchase Price may be

licensor thereof to consent to the assignment thereof or as to which Purchaser
or Newco, as the case may be, fails to enter into a license agreement with the
licensor thereof, in either case as a result of (A) Purchaser's or Newco's, as
the case may be, failure to cooperate with Seller in obtaining from any such
licensor the right for Purchaser or Newco, as the case may be, to operate such
software or (B) Purchaser's or Newco's, as the case may be, default under any
agreement or other dispute with any such licensor, and (ii) clause (z) of the
preceding sentence with respect to any Licensed Generally Used Software as to
which Purchaser or Newco, as the case may be, fails to enter into a license
agreement with the licensor thereof as a result of (A) Purchaser's or Newco's,
as the case may be, failure to cooperate with Seller in obtaining from any such
licensor the right for Purchaser or Newco, as the case may


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

be, to operate such software or (B) Purchaser's or Newco's, as the case may be,
default under any agreement or other dispute with any such licensor.

          Section 3.07.  BROKERAGE AND FINANCIAL ADVISERS.  No broker, finder or
financial adviser has acted directly or indirectly as such for, or is entitled
to any compensation from, Seller in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except Morgan Stanley & Co., whose fees for
services rendered in connection with such transactions will be paid by Seller.

          Section 3.08.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Except as previously disclosed
to Purchaser and except with respect to those violations, if any, that will be
cured by Seller prior to, or by the act of, Closing or which individually or in
the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business (i)
neither Seller nor the Seller Separate Account is in violation of any federal,
state, local or foreign law, ordinance or regulation or any other requirement of
any governmental or regulatory body, court or arbitrator applicable to the
Business nor has Seller received any written notice that any such violation is
being alleged and (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
connection with Seller's pending triennial examination, Seller has not received
any notice, nor is aware of the intention to send any notice, from any state
regulatory authority alleging any violation of any such law, ordinance or
regulation or directing Seller to take any remedial action with respect to such
law, ordinance or regulation, in either case relating to the Business.

lists (i) all jurisdictions in which Seller is licensed to issue the Insurance
Contracts and (ii) the lines of business in connection with the Business which
Seller is authorized to transact in each such


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction.  Seller has been duly authorized by the relevant state insurance
regulatory authorities to issue the Insurance Contracts that it is currently
writing, and was duly authorized to issue the Insurance Contracts that it is not
currently writing at the time such Insurance Contracts were issued, in the
respective states in which it conducts the Business.  Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.09, Seller has all other Permits necessary to conduct the Business in
the manner and in the areas in which the Business is presently being conducted
and all such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to have such a Permit would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business.
          Section 3.10.  ANNUITY BUSINESS.  (a)  The group annuity contracts
included in the Insurance Contracts in effect on the date hereof are listed on
Schedule 1.01(C) hereto.  All Insurance Contracts as now in force are in all
respects, to the extent required under applicable law, on forms approved by
applicable insurance regulatory authorities or which have been filed and not
objected to by such authorities within the period provided for objection, and
such forms comply in all material respects with the insurance statutes,
regulations and rules applicable thereto, except where the failure to have such
approval or non-objection or the failure to so comply would not individually or
in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.  To Seller's
knowledge, at the time Seller paid commissions to any broker within the past 36
months in connection with the sale of Insurance Contracts, each such broker was
duly licensed as an insurance broker (for the type of business sold by such
broker) in the particular jurisdiction in which such broker sold such business
for Seller, and no such broker violated (or with or without notice or lapse of
time or both would have violated) any federal, state, local or foreign law,
ordinance or regulation or any other requirement of any governmental or
regulatory


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

body, court or arbitrator applicable to the Business, except where the failure
to be so licensed or any such violation would not individually or in the
aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.  Except as previously
disclosed to Purchaser, (i) neither the manner in which Seller compensates any
association or broker involved in the sale or servicing of Insurance Contracts
that is not registered as a broker-dealer or insurance agent nor, to Seller's
knowledge, the conduct of any such association or broker, renders such
association or broker a broker-dealer or insurance agent under any applicable
federal or state law and (ii) the manner in which Seller compensates each
association or broker involved in the sale or servicing of Insurance Contracts
is in compliance with all applicable federal or state laws.  Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.10(A) hereto, (i) as of the date hereof, no holder of a group
annuity contract which constitutes an Insurance Contract has indicated in
writing to Seller an intention to cancel or terminate such Insurance Contract
and (ii) no association or similar Person involved in the servicing of an
Insurance Contract has indicated in writing to Seller an intention to cease such
services or to cancel or terminate its agreement or other arrangement with
Seller.

          (b)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(B) hereto, to Seller's
knowledge, no entity that is a party to an Insurance Contract is undergoing, or
has undergone in the past 12 months, an audit by the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to its compliance with section 403(b) of the Code, and Seller is
not aware of any such proposed audit.

disclosure shall not affect or limit in any way Purchaser's or Newco's rights to
indemnification under Article X hereof):

30, 1995 and March 31, 1995, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto.

          Section 4.11.  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.  Except as listed
on Schedule 4.11 hereto or except as expressly contemplated or required by this
Agreement, since December 31, 1994, there has not been (i) any change in the
business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations,
properties, prospects or assets of Purchaser or (ii) in the ability of Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or in any Ancillary
Agreement, in either case that has had or is likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Purchaser and/or any of its material Affiliates or (after giving
effect to the Closing) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business, in either
case other than events or conditions relating to the life insurance industry
generally.

          Section 4.12.  RELATIONS WITH INVESTMENT COMPANIES.  Purchaser does
not have, and has not previously had, any adverse relationship with any
investment company in which any Seller Separate Account assets are invested, or
with any investment adviser thereof, or any Affiliate of either of the
foregoing, which would reduce in any significant respect the likelihood of
Purchaser entering into a new participation agreement with such Person on
substantially the same terms as the currently existing agreement between such
Person and Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
has a good relationship with FMR Corp. and its Subsidiaries.

with industry


                                      -67-

by Purchaser (such individuals, along with any replacement employees for any
such individuals whose employment terminates prior to the Closing Date and any
other individuals listed on Schedule 3.19(A) hereto who are identified prior to
the Closing Date in writing to Seller by Purchaser as lacking the work
authorization and identification required by the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, being referred to herein as the "Band 1 Employees").  The identity
of the Band 1 Employees shall be determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion
consistent with any applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no retirement
consultant or account representative employees of Seller shall be selected by
Purchaser to be a Band 1 Employee.  Purchaser shall indicate in writing, at the
time it delivers such list to Seller, which of the Band 1 Employees Purchaser
believes should be retained by Seller until the Closing Date, and Seller shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to retain such individuals, through the
Closing Date, in the positions which such individuals hold as of the date
hereof.  Seller shall bear full responsibility for either continuing the
employment of or providing severance payments to all Band 1 Employees in
accordance with its standard practices, and Purchaser shall have no obligations
with respect thereto.

          (b)  Schedule 5.19(B) hereto sets forth the names of those individuals
with respect to whom Purchaser has offered employment contracts, such contracts
to be effective as of the Closing Date.  Each such individual who accepts such
offer and enters into such an employment


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

contract shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Contract Employee."  From and
after the commencement of the employment of a Contract Employee by Purchaser,
Purchaser shall bear full responsibility for any severance payments payable in
connection with the termination of the employment of any Contract Employee in
accordance with the terms of such Contract Employee's contract, and Seller shall
have no obligations with respect thereto.  Purchaser agrees to not, prior to the
Closing, offer employment contracts to any additional persons listed on Schedule
3.19(A), other than stay bonuses or similar arrangements.

          (c)  (i)  Purchaser shall offer employment as of the Closing Date to
all individuals listed on Schedule 3.19(A) hereto who are neither Band 1
Employees nor Contract Employees (such individuals, along with individuals hired
by Seller in accordance with Section 5.19(h) as replacement employees for any
such individuals whose employment terminates prior to the Closing Date, being
referred to herein as the "Band 2 Employees") at their respective geographic
locations of employment as of the date hereof in positions substantially similar
to the respective positions held by such Band 2 Employees as of the date hereof
(or, as to replacement employees, the positions held by the respective Band 2
Employees whom they have replaced), with salaries at least at the level set
forth on Schedule 3.19(A) (which shall be modified as soon as possible to
provide data related to compensation payable for 1996, which compensation shall
be determined consistent with Seller's salary policies with respect to its
businesses other than the Business); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to
individuals listed on Schedule 3.19(A) hereto who are neither Band 1 Employees
nor Contract Employees but who are, as of the Closing Date, either (x) receiving
benefits under Seller's short-term disability plan or (y) absent from work in
connection with an approved leave of absence, Purchaser's offer of employment to
such


                                      -69-
<PAGE>

individuals shall be for employment commencing on the first Business Day
following the last day for which such short-term disability benefits are payable
or such approved leave of absence, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Section 5.19, and except as provided in
subsection (c)(ii)(A) and in the following sentence, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to require Purchaser to retain any particular Band 2 Employee
for any period of time following the Closing Date or to entitle any such Band 2
Employee to any status other than that of an at will employee of Purchaser.
Purchaser shall employ the majority of such Band 2 Employees who are located in
the greater Portland home office for at least 12 months after the Closing Date
and all the employees who are located in field offices for at least six months
after the Closing Date.

               (ii) (A)  TERMINATION UPON JOB ELIMINATION.  In the event the
employment of any Band 2 Employee is terminated by Purchaser because of the
elimination of the employee's employment position prior to the date which is 20
months after the Closing Date, the provisions of this subsection (c)(ii)(A)
shall apply:

               Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such termination and
Seller shall provide such Band 2 Employee with the opportunity to have Seller
place such Band 2 Employee in Seller's then-current re-employment program for a
maximum period of eight weeks with the same priority consideration for available
openings such Band 2 Employee would enjoy were he or she still an employee of
Seller.  As used in this subsection (c)(ii)(A), job elimination shall include a
termination of employment due to an employee's refusal to accept a reassignment
to a new job site in excess of fifty (50) miles from the employee's job site
immediately preceding the termination.  In the event that the job of a Band 2
Employee who is absent from work on


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

account of extended temporary disability (greater than two weeks but less than
12 months) is eliminated and such Band 2 Employee thereafter returns to work
within 12 months of the commencement of such period of extended temporary
disability and within 18 months of the Closing Date, such Band 2 Employee will
be provided with a similar employment position to the one that was eliminated
or, in the absence of such position, treated as having been subjected to a job
elimination in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (c)(ii)(A);
provided that the employee's performance met job expectations immediately
preceding such absence.  To the extent that such Band 2 Employee who is
terminated in the circumstances described in this subsection (c)(ii)(A) is not
re-employed by Seller and such Band 2 Employee's employment is terminated under
circumstances in which such Band 2 Employee becomes eligible for severance
payments under the severance payment plan of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay
severance and provide for continuation of benefit plan coverage to such Band 2
Employee determined as follows:  Purchaser shall pay severance to such Band 2
Employee in an amount equal to the salary-based severance payments to which such
Band 2 Employee would have been entitled were he or she an employee of Seller on
the date of termination of employment (taking into account all of such Band 2
Employee's service with both Seller and Purchaser through such date of
termination of employment with Purchaser) under Seller's severance payment plans
as in effect on the Closing Date had his or her employment terminated for job
elimination (applying Seller's plan's standard) as of such date of termination
of employment with Purchaser; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such payments shall be
payable only in the form of bi-weekly payments for up to 12 or 24 weeks,
whichever is applicable to such Band 2 Employee, and any payments due thereafter
paid in the form of a single lump sum.  On the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide


                                      -71-
<PAGE>

Purchaser with a schedule which sets forth each Band 2 Employee's service with
Seller, as the same is calculated by Seller for the purposes of determining
severance payments.  Purchaser shall provide for continuation of benefit plan
coverage to such Band 2 Employees following their termination of employment for
the period during which they receive bi-weekly severance payments for up to a
maximum period of, except as otherwise specified, 12 or 24 weeks, as applicable,
with respect to the following benefit plans:  (1) Purchaser's Defined Benefit
Plan (for recognition of up to 501 hours of service) and Purchaser's SERPs; (2)
the Lincoln National Corporation Employees' Group Life Insurance, Accidental
Death, Disability, Loss of Sight Insurance and Family Life Insurance Plan; (3)
the Lincoln National Corporation Group health, dental, vision and/or hearing
Plan for Employees in which such employees would have been entitled to
participate had they not been terminated; (4) the Lincoln National Corporation
Employees' Health Care Expense Account Plan (pursuant to the Lincoln National
Corporation Customized Security Plan) (except that if a re-enrollment occurs
during the period that severance is being paid, such terminated Band 2 Employee
may not re-enroll for coverage under Purchaser's Health Care Expense Account
Plan); and (5) the Lincoln National Corporation Employees' Dependent Care
Expense Account Plan (pursuant to the Lincoln National Corporation Customized
Security Plan).  In the case of a termination of employment of a Band 2 Employee
because of the elimination of the employment position of such Band 2 Employee,
Purchaser shall not effect such termination of employment prior to providing
eight weeks' advance notice to such Band 2 Employee and Seller of such
termination of employment.

                         (B)  TERMINATION OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE AND OTHER THAN
FOR JOB ELIMINATION.  In the event the employment of any Band 2 Employee is
terminated by Purchaser,

other than for cause and other than because of the elimination of such Band 2
Employee's employment position, for example, because of unsatisfactory
performance of employment duties, prior to the date which is 18 months after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall have no obligation to provide advance notice to
Seller of such termination and Seller shall have no obligation to place such
Band 2 Employee in any re-employment program of Seller.  In the event that the
job of a Band 2 Employee who is absent from work on account of extended
temporary disability (greater than two weeks but less than 12 months) is
eliminated and such Band 2 Employee's job performance immediately preceding such
absence was unsatisfactory and such Band 2 Employee thereafter returns to work
within 12 months of the commencement of such period of extended temporary
disability and within 18 months of the Closing Date, such Band 2 Employee will
be provided with a similar employment position to the one that was eliminated
or, in the discretion of Purchaser, treated as having been terminated in
accordance with the provisions of this subsection (c)(ii)(B).  To the extent
such Band 2 Employee is not otherwise employed by Seller and such Band 2
Employee's employment was terminated under circumstances in which such Band 2
Employee becomes eligible for severance payments under the severance payment
plan of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay severance to such Band 2 Employee
determined as follows:  Purchaser shall pay severance to such Band 2 Employee
who is terminated under the circumstances described in this subsection
(c)(ii)(B) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the severance payments to
which such Band 2 Employee would have been entitled were he or she an employee
of Seller on the date of termination of employment (taking into account all of
such Band 2 Employee's service with both Seller and Purchaser through such date
of termination of employment with Purchaser) under Seller's salary-based
severance payment plan as in effect


                                      -73-
<PAGE>

on the Closing Date had his or her employment terminated for performance reasons
(applying Seller's plan's standard) as of such date.

                         (C)  TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  In the event the
employment of any Band 2 Employee is terminated by Purchaser for cause at any
time, Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide any severance or benefit plan
coverage continuation to such Band 2 Employee and Purchaser shall have no
obligation to notify Seller of such termination and Seller shall have no
obligation to place such Band 2 Employee in any re-employment program of Seller.

                         (D)  REIMBURSEMENT OF PURCHASER.  Not later than 24
months after the Closing Date, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser in an amount
equal to one-half of the total severance payments paid or payable by Purchaser
in accordance with subsections (c)(ii)(A) and (B) above with respect to Band 2
Employees who were given notice of termination prior to the date which is 18
months after the Closing Date and whose termination date occurs (x) within 20
months of the Closing if in accordance with subsection (c)(ii)(A) and (y) within
18 months of Closing if in accordance with subsection (c)(ii)(B), in each case
only to the extent that such severance payments are attributable to years of
service with Seller and/or one of its Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, to
the extent the sum of (1) the aggregate amount of the severance payment
obligations made by Purchaser to Band 2 Employees pursuant to this subsection
(c)(ii) that are attributable to years of service with Seller and/or one of its
Affiliates and (2) the aggregate amount of the severance payment obligations
made by Purchaser or Newco to Band 2 Employees (as defined in the First UNUM
Agreement) pursuant to the corresponding provision of the First UNUM Agreement
that are attributable to years of service with Seller and/or one of its
Affiliates exceeds $1 million, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser or Newco, as
appropriate,


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

in an amount equal to 100% of the amount of all severance payments due in excess
thereof to the Band 2 Employees.

               (iii)     Prior to the date which is 18 months from the Closing
Date, Seller shall not rehire any Band 2 Employees, except for Band 2 Employees
whose employment is first terminated, or who have been given notice of such
termination, by Purchaser.

               (iv) Purchaser shall pay a Retention Bonus on the date which is
12 months from the Closing Date to each Band 2 Employee who is an employee of
Purchaser on such date and, with respect to each Band 2 Employee whose
employment is terminated as a result of job elimination prior to such date,
Purchaser shall pay a Retention Bonus on the date of termination of employment
of each such employee.  No Retention Bonus shall be paid to any Band 2 Employee
whose employment with Purchaser terminates as a result of a resignation or
performance failure or for cause.  Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any
Retention Bonus payments and any additional Tax liabilities of Purchaser
relating to such payments.

          (d)  Purchaser acknowledges that, up to and including the Closing
Date, all employees of Seller have an exclusive duty of loyalty to Seller and,
both prior to and subsequent to the Closing Date, a continuing non-disclosure
obligation as to information regarding Seller that does not relate specifically
to the Business.

          (e)  As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to the retirement
consultant and retirement account representative employees of Seller who become
Band 2 Employees employment at offices provided by Purchaser other than the
facilities of Seller, and shall pay all costs associated with the relocation of
such Band 2 Employees.

          (f)  Not later than the date which is 70 days after the date hereof,
Purchaser shall notify Seller as to the amount of space to be included in the
lease referred to in Section 1 of Schedule 1 to the Transition Services
Agreement, which amount of space shall not exceed 40,000 square feet of office
space, and the nature and extent of the related services to be provided under
the Transition Services Agreement.

          (g)  Not later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
have moved, at Seller's expense, the operations of the Business to a physical
plant in a location and having a design consistent with Section 3 of the
Transition Services Agreement.

          (h)  In the event that any Band 2 Employee's employment terminates
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
acting in consultation with Purchaser, to replace such Band 2 Employee in order
to maintain current staffing levels with respect to the Business.  Unless
otherwise agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, any individual hired by Seller in
accordance with this Section 5.19(h) shall be deemed a Band 2 Employee for the
purpose of this Agreement.

          (i)  Prior to the Closing, Seller will continue to monitor and
evaluate the work performance of the Band 2 Employees in the ordinary course of
its business operations.

          (j)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall finalize the design of a joint incentive
program related to the 1996 performance of the Business, and shall communicate
such program to employees of the Business.  The cost of such program shall be
borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

          Section 5.20.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  (a)  Subject to the further
provisions of this Section 5.20, and except as provided in Section 5.19,
Purchaser agrees to provide benefits under


                                      -76-
<PAGE>

the employee benefit plans, programs, and arrangements of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, without regard to the coverage of any such plan, program, or
arrangement by ERISA or any provision of the Code, to each Band 2 Employee who
accepts employment with Purchaser ("Benefits Affected Employee") on the same
terms and conditions as such benefits are provided to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser.  Purchaser shall credit the service of each Benefits
Affected Employee with Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting, and accrual of or entitlement to benefits under all
plans, programs, and arrangements listed on Schedule 5.20 ("Purchaser's Plans")
to the same extent as if such service had been performed for Purchaser, in the
amount of such service stated in a schedule to be delivered by Seller to
Purchaser as soon as practicable after the Closing Date pursuant to subsection
(d)(ii)(B) (the "Benefits Information Schedule"), except to the extent that the
crediting of any such service might, in the opinion of counsel to Purchaser,
jeopardize the tax qualification of Purchaser's Plans or the tax-favored status
of Purchaser's Plans; and PROVIDED FURTHER that Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall waive or cause to be waived, except to the extent that such waiver is
precluded by applicable law, any waiting period, probationary period, pre-
existing condition exclusion, evidence of insurability requirement, or similar
condition with respect to initial participation under any plan, program, or
arrangement established, maintained, or contributed to by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to provide health, life insurance, or disability benefits with
respect to each Benefits Affected Employee.

          (b)  Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.20, and except
as provided in Section 5.19, Seller, and not Purchaser, shall be responsible and
shall assume any and all liability for (i) all compensation, benefits, and
perquisites of any kind due any Benefits Affected


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

Employee on account of employment by Seller before the Closing Date, or the
termination of employment by Seller, including, but not limited to, continuation
of health care coverage pursuant to  COBRA; and (ii) all notices, payments,
fines, taxes or assessments due to any governmental authority pursuant to any
applicable foreign, federal, state or local law, common law, statute, rule or
regulation with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees of
the Business by Seller, including, but not limited to, the WARN Act and the
Maine Severance Pay Law and any rules or regulations that have been issued in
connection with any of the foregoing.

     Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.20, and except as
provided in Section 5.19, Purchaser, and not Seller, shall be responsible and
shall assume any and all liability for (i) all compensation, benefits, and
perquisites of any kind due any Benefits Affected Employee on account of
employment by Purchaser on and after the Closing Date, or the termination of
employment by Purchaser, including, but not limited to, continuation of health
care coverage pursuant to COBRA; (ii) any decision by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to employ or not to employ any employee listed on Schedule 3.19(A);
and (iii) all notices, payments, fines, taxes or assessments due to any
governmental authority pursuant to any applicable foreign, federal, state or
local law, common law, statute, rule or regulation with respect to the
employment, discharge or layoff of Benefits Affected Employees by Purchaser,
including, but not limited to, the WARN Act and the Maine Severance Pay Law and
any rules or regulations that have been issued in connection with any of the
foregoing.

          (c)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) to the contrary:


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

               (i)  Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be eligible to
participate in and receive coverage under medical and dental plans established
by Purchaser from and after the Closing Date until December 31, 1996, which
shall provide continuation of substantially the same medical and dental
coverages and level of benefits (including dependent and domestic partner
coverages and benefits) as such Benefits Affected Employee received under the
UNUM Employees Life, Dental and Medical Plan ("Seller's Employee Welfare Plan")
immediately prior to the Closing Date (including continuation of copayments,
deductibles, lifetime maximums and pre-existing condition exclusions as then in
effect); PROVIDED that a Benefits Affected Employee's participation and coverage
under such plans shall terminate in accordance with the terms thereof if such
Benefits Affected Employee terminates employment with Purchaser and all of its
Affiliates before December 31, 1996.  The rate of pre-tax salary reduction
contributions for such coverage during 1996 with respect to each Benefits
Affected Employee shall not exceed the rate of pre-tax salary reduction
contributions for coverage with respect to the Benefits Affected Employee under
Seller's Employee Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the
balance of the costs of such coverage shall be paid entirely by Purchaser.  Each
Benefits Affected Employee who immediately prior to the Closing Date was
receiving a credit from Seller for having elected not to participate in the
medical or dental portion of Seller's Employee Welfare Plan shall continue to
receive such credit from Purchaser on and after the Closing Date through the end
of 1996, or the date of such Benefits Affected Employee's termination of
employment with Purchaser and all of its Affiliates, if earlier.  As of January
1, 1997, each Benefits Affected Employee who is employed by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates on such date shall be eligible to commence participation in and
receive coverage under the Lincoln National


                                      -79-
<PAGE>

Corporation Group Health, Dental, Vision and Hearing Plan for Employees, in
accordance with Section 5.20(a), except that on and after the Closing Date
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required to waive or cause to be
waived the exclusion of any pre-existing condition that may be excluded from
coverage under Seller's Employee Welfare Plan on such date, for so long as such
condition would be excluded from coverage under Seller's Employee Welfare Plan
if the Benefits Affected Employee continued to participate in and receive
coverage thereunder.

               (ii) Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be eligible to
commence participation in and receive coverage under the Lincoln National
Corporation Employees' Group Life Insurance, Accidental Death, Disability, Loss
of Sight Insurance and Family Life Insurance Plan as of the Closing Date;
PROVIDED that no such Benefits Affected Employee shall be eligible to receive
coverage under such plans with respect to any dependent prior to January 1,
1997.

               (iii)     Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be permitted to
elect to receive benefits under the Lincoln National Corporation Employees'
Health Care Expense Account Plan (pursuant to the Lincoln National Corporation
Customized Security Plan) as of the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each
such Benefits Affected Employee may only make an election with respect to
benefits under such plan that has the effect of continuing the election in
effect for such Benefits Affected Employee under the medical reimbursement
account portion of Seller's Employee Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date.  Seller shall permit each Benefits Affected Employee who is a
"qualified beneficiary," as defined in section 4980B of the Code, to elect
continuation of coverage under the medical reimbursement account portion of
Seller's Employee Welfare Plan, without regard to any election made by such
Benefits Affected


                                      -80-
<PAGE>

Employee to receive benefits under Lincoln National Corporation Employees'
Health Care Expense Account Plan.

               (iv) Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be permitted to elect
to receive benefits under the Lincoln National Corporation Employees' Dependent
Care Expense Account Plan (pursuant to the Lincoln National Corporation
Customized Security Plan) as of the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each
such Benefits Affected Employee may only make an election with respect to
benefits under such plan that has the effect of continuing the election in
effect for such Benefits Affected Employee under the dependent care account
portion of Seller's Employee Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Seller shall provide dependent care assistance benefits to each Benefits
Affected Employee who is participating in the dependent care account portion of
Seller's Employee Welfare Plan immediately before the Closing Date with respect
to qualifying expenses incurred on or before December 31, 1996.

               (v)  (A)  Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be eligible to
participate in the Lincoln National Corporation Group Health and Dental Plan for
Retirees (Retiree Employee Coverage) and Group Life Plans ("Purchaser's Retiree
Welfare Plans") on the same terms and conditions as such benefits are provided
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
Benefits Affected Employee who either (i) is customarily employed on a part-time
basis immediately before the Closing Date or (ii) has attained age 45 before the
Closing Date shall be required to have completed only 5 years of service in
addition to the otherwise applicable requirement that the employee shall have
attained the age of 55; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any such Benefits Affected
Employee who has both attained age 55 and completed 5 years of service as of the
Closing Date and who elects, as of the Closing Date, to


                                      -81-
<PAGE>

participate in the retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits portion
of Seller's Employee Welfare Plan shall not be eligible to participate in
Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans.  Seller shall bear the cost of the
adjustments required under this subsection (c)(v)(A), as such cost is determined
under Section 5.20(f).

                    (B)  Seller shall take into account service with Purchaser
and its Affiliates for the purposes of determining eligibility for retiree
medical, dental, and life insurance benefits and the rate of retiree
contributions under Seller's Employee Welfare Plan of any Benefits Affected
Employee who is re-employed by Seller within 20 months after the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall bear the cost of the adjustments required under this subsection
(c)(v)(B), as such cost is determined under Section 5.20(f).

          (d)  (i)  Each Benefits Affected Employee who is eligible to
participate in the UNUM Employees Retirement Savings Plan and Trust ("Seller's
401(k) Plan") immediately before the Closing Date shall be eligible to
participate in the Lincoln National Corporation Employees' Savings and Profit
Sharing Plan ("Purchaser's 401(k) Plan") as of the Closing Date.  As set forth
in Section 5.20(a), the service of each such Benefits Affected Employee with
Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall be credited for all
purposes under Purchaser's 401(k) Plan to the same extent as if such service had
been performed for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in the amount of such
service stated in the Benefits Information Schedule; PROVIDED that all such
service performed at and after age 18 shall be so credited, and no such Benefits
Affected Employee shall be required to attain any age greater than 18 for
purposes of eligibility.  Any Benefits Affected Employee shall be permitted to
roll over outstanding plan loans that are not in default under Seller's 401(k)
Plan, and to maintain an account balance of $3,500 or less


                                      -82-
<PAGE>

under Seller's 401(k) Plan until the earlier of (1) the date on which such
Benefits Affected Employee terminates employment with Purchaser and all of its
Affiliates and is not thereupon re-employed by Seller or any of its affiliates
and (2) the date that is 20 months after the Closing Date, except to the extent
that the maintenance of such account balances might, in the opinion of counsel
to Seller, jeopardize the tax qualification of Seller's 401(k) Plan.

               (ii) (A)  Each Benefits Affected Employee who remains employed 
by Purchaser or its Affiliates on January 1, 1997 (or whose employment with 
Purchaser and all its Affiliates was involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or 
any of its Affiliates before such date), and is a participant in the UNUM 
Employees Pension Plan and Trust ("Seller's Defined Benefit Plan") and, where 
applicable, the UNUM Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan ("Seller's SERP") 
immediately before the Closing Date shall continue to accrue benefits under 
such plans (as the same may be amended from time to time) until the earlier 
of (1) the date on which such Benefits Affected Employee terminates 
employment with the Purchaser and all of its Affiliates and (2) the date that 
is 20 months after the Closing Date.  The service of each Benefits Affected 
Employee by the Purchaser and its Affiliates during such period shall be 
credited under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan and Seller's SERP to the same 
extent as if such service had been performed for Seller or any of its 
Affiliates, and the compensation paid to each such Benefits Affected Employee 
by Purchaser and its Affiliates during such period shall be taken into 
account to the same extent as if such compensation had been paid by Seller or 
any of its Affiliates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such service and compensation 
shall not be required to be taken into account to the extent that such action 
might, in the opinion of counsel to Seller, jeopardize the tax qualification 
of Seller's Defined Benefit Plan.  As soon as practicable after the earlier 
of (1) the


                                      -83-
<PAGE>

date on which a Benefits Affected Employee terminates employment with the 
Purchaser and all of its Affiliates and (2) the date that is 20 months after 
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a record of such 
employee's actual service and compensation with respect to the 20-month 
period.  Purchaser shall bear the cost of the adjustments required under this 
subsection (d)(ii)(A), as such cost is determined under Section 5.20(f).

                    (B)  Each Benefits Affected Employee shall be eligible to
participate in the Lincoln National Corporation Employees' Retirement Plan
("Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan") and, if applicable, the Lincoln National
Corporation Employees' Supplemental Pension Benefit Plan and the Lincoln
National Corporation Employees' Excess Compensation Pension Benefit Plan
("Purchaser's SERPs") in accordance with the applicable provisions of such plans
as amended from time to time.  Each Benefits Affected Employee described in the
preceding subsection (d)(ii)(A) whose employment with Purchaser and all of its
Affiliates has not been terminated on the date that is 20 months after the
Closing Date shall be credited for all purposes under Purchaser's Defined
Benefit Plan and, if eligible, Purchaser's SERPs, with the service of such
Benefits Affected Employee (1) with Seller and its Affiliates up to the Closing
Date to the same extent as if such service had been performed for Purchaser and
(2) with Purchaser during such 20-month period to the extent that such service
was not credited to such Benefits Affected Employee for periods prior to
commencement of participation in Purchaser's plans; PROVIDED that all such
service performed at and after age 18 shall be so credited, and no such Benefits
Affected Employee shall be required to attain any age greater than 18 for
purposes of eligibility to participate in Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and
Purchaser's SERPs.


                                      -84-

     As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser the Benefits Information Schedule which shall set forth, with respect
to each Benefits Affected Employee, the employee's name; date of birth; date of
hire; vesting service as of the Closing Date; credited service as of the Closing
Date; sex; basic compensation for calendar years 1986 through 1995, determined
as the sum of base pay and field compensation; basic plus incentive compensation
for calendar years 1986 through 1995; estimated basic compensation for 1996,
determined as the sum of the annualized rate of base pay as of the Closing Date
and 1996 field incentives (determined as the average of actual 1994 and 1995
field incentives); estimated basic plus incentive compensation for 1996
(determined as the sum of estimated basic compensation for 1996 plus the actual
year to date incentive payments as of said date); projected 1997 basic
compensation (the projection for 1997 shall be based on the Benefits Affected
Employee's estimated basic compensation for 1996, increased by one year on the
basis of the Seller's graded rates); projected 1997 basic plus incentive
compensation (the projection for 1997 shall be based on the Benefits Affected
Employee's projected 1997 basic compensation plus the Benefits Affected
Employee's target incentive compensation for 1996); number of hours worked by
the Benefits Affected Employee for Seller during 1996; and shall specify the
amount of each such employee's normal retirement benefit (age 65 accrued
benefit) under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan and Seller's SERP commencing at age
65 and payable in the form of a single life annuity, and such employee's
credited service under Seller's plans, all determined as of the date that is 20
months after the Closing Date.  For purposes of determining such normal
retirement benefit under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan and Seller's SERP, Seller
shall assume that the Social


                                      -85-
<PAGE>

Security Taxable Wage Base shall increase by 4.25% for 1997 and by 3.5% per
annum from 1998 until the calendar year in which an employee attains age 65.

     Purchaser shall be permitted to reduce (but not below zero) the aggregate
of the accrued benefits under Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and Purchaser's
SERPs of each Benefits Affected Employee who commences participation thereunder
by the amount of such Benefits Affected Employee's benefits specified on the
schedule described below in this subsection (d)(ii)(B).  Seller shall bear the
cost (net of the offset described in the preceding sentence whether or not
imposed by Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and Purchaser's SERPs) of the
adjustments required under this subsection (d)(ii)(B), as such cost is
determined under Section 5.20(f).

     No later than the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date, and for
purposes only of calculating pension benefits under Purchaser's Defined Benefit
Plan and Purchaser's SERPs, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a schedule
containing the actual data in place of the estimated data set forth on the
Benefits Information Schedule.

          (e)  On and after the Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall
timely amend their respective employee benefit plans, programs, and
arrangements, and shall undertake all actions necessary or desirable to
implement such amendments, to the extent that such amendments and other actions
are reasonably necessary to carry out any of the terms and provisions of this
Section 5.20.

          (f)  (i)  Seller and Purchaser agree to adjust the Final Purchase
Price as of the date that is 20 months after the Closing Date, for the purpose
of settling the obligations of Purchaser to Seller and of Seller to Purchaser
under subsections (c)(v) and (d)(ii) above.  These


                                      -86-
<PAGE>

obligations shall be determined as set forth in the following Tables 5.20(F)(1)
and 5.20(F)(2) and the notes thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, to the extent any
service of a Benefits Affected Employee with Seller is not credited under one or
more of Purchaser's Plans because (pursuant to Section 5.20(a)), in the opinion
of counsel to Purchaser, such service credit might jeopardize the tax-qualified
or tax-favored status of such plan, such service shall not be taken into account
for purposes of the Final Purchase Price adjustment hereunder; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that, to the extent any service of a Benefits Affected Employee with
Purchaser is not credited under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan or Seller's
Employee Welfare Plan because (pursuant to Section 5.20(d)(ii)), in the opinion
of counsel to Seller, such service credit might jeopardize the tax-qualified
status of such plan, such service shall not be taken into account for purposes
of the Final Purchase Price adjustment hereunder.

          NOTE 1:  Purchaser shall be obligated to make a payment to Seller in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Purchaser shall calculate for each
Benefits Affected Employee the pro rata service cost, as described herein, for
accrued pension benefits under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan and Seller's SERP
for each Benefits Affected Employee (A) who was employed by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates as of January 1, 1997, and whose employment with Purchaser and
all its Affiliates was terminated before the date that is 20 months after the
Closing Date or (B) whose employment with Purchaser and all its Affiliates was
involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on or before
December 31, 1996, for the period from the


                                      -88-
<PAGE>

Closing Date to the date of the termination of the employee's employment with
the Purchaser and all its Affiliates.  In making this calculation, Purchaser
shall use the following assumptions:  (1) Demographic assumptions used by
Purchaser (as published in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation report for
Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan); (2) Interest rate (discount rate):  7.5%;
(3) Salary Scale:  5%; (4) Social Security Wage Base Increase:  4.5%; (5) Census
data as set forth on the Benefits Information Schedule; (6) Provisions of
Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and Purchaser's SERPs as in effect on the
Closing Date; (7) Benefit starting date for vested terminated employees:  Age 64
1/2.

          Purchaser shall calculate the difference between the projected benefit
obligations (using the methodology established by Financial Accounting Standard
No. 87 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FAS 87")) as of
January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1997 (adjusted for interest to January 1, 1998),
respectively, for each such employee, to determine the 12-month service costs.
Purchaser shall then determine the final service costs for each such employee by
prorating the 12-month service costs to reflect the number of years and months
(determined on the basis that 15 or more days equals one month) of employment
for each such employee from the Closing Date to the date of termination of the
employee's employment with the Purchaser and all its Affiliates.  (Example:  In
the case of an employee employed by Purchaser from a closing date of July 1,
1996, through September 30, 1997, the 12-month service cost would be multiplied
by 1.25 to reflect one year and three months of employment.)

          NOTE 2:  Purchaser shall be obligated to make a payment to Seller in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Seller shall calculate for each Benefits
Affected Employee the pro rata service cost, as described herein, for accrued
pension benefits under Seller's Defined Benefit

<PAGE>

Plan and Seller's SERP as in effect on January 1, 1997, for each Benefits
Affected Employee who is employed by Purchaser on the date that is 20 months
after the Closing Date.  In making this calculation, Seller shall use the
following assumptions:  (1) Demographic assumptions used by Seller (as published
in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation report for Seller's Defined Benefit
Plan); (2) Interest rate (discount rate):  7.5%; (3) Average Salary Scale
(Seller's graded rates):  4.7%; (4) Social Security Wage Base Increase: 4.25%;
(5) Census data as set forth on the Benefits Information Schedule;
(6) Provisions of Seller's Defined Benefit Plan and Seller's SERP as in effect
on January 1, 1997; (7) Benefit starting date for vested terminated employees:
Age 55.

          Seller shall calculate the difference between the projected benefit
obligations (using the methodology established by FAS 87) as of January 1, 1998,
and January 1, 1997 (adjusted for interest to January 1, 1998), respectively,
for each such employee, to determine the 12-month service cost.  Purchaser shall
then determine the final service costs by multiplying the 12-month service cost
by 1.67.

          NOTE 3:  Seller shall be obligated to make a payment to Purchaser in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Purchaser shall calculate for each
Benefits Affected Employee "projected benefit obligations" (using methodology
established by FAS 87) for Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and Purchaser's
SERPs less the scheduled pension benefits under Seller's Defined Benefit Plan
and Seller's SERP, as set forth in the Benefits Information Schedule, as of the
date that is 20 months after the Closing Date, for each Benefits Affected
Employee who remains employed by Purchaser on the date that is 20 months after
the Closing Date.  In making this calculation, Purchaser shall use the following
assumptions:  (1) Demographic assumptions


                                      -90-
<PAGE>

used by Purchaser (as published in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation
report for Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan); (2) Interest rate (discount rate):

(5) Census data as set forth on the Benefits Information Schedule;
(6) Provisions of Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan and Purchaser's SERPs as in
effect on the date that is 20 months after the Closing Date; (7) Benefit

          NOTE 4:  Purchaser shall be obligated to make a payment to Seller in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Seller shall calculate for each Benefits
Affected Employee the pro rata service cost, as described herein, for accrued
retiree welfare benefits under Seller's


                                      -92-
<PAGE>

Employee Welfare Plan, for each Benefits Affected Employee who accepts
employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date and
who terminates employment with Purchaser and all its Affiliates before the date
that is 20 months after the Closing Date, for the period from the Closing Date
to the date of termination of the employee's employment with Purchaser and all
its Affiliates.  In making this calculation, Seller shall use the following
assumptions:  (1) Demographic and health care trend assumptions used by Seller
(as published in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation report of retiree
welfare benefits under Seller's Employee Welfare Plan), except that the
retirement rate assumption established by the January 1, 1995, actuarial
valuation report of Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans shall be used;
(2) Interest rate (discount rate):  7.5%; (3) Average Salary Scale (Seller's
graded rates):  4.7%; (4) Retiree welfare benefit provisions under Seller's
Employee Welfare Plan as in effect on the Closing Date; (5) Census data as set
forth on the Benefits Information Schedule; (6) Attribution of the expected
post-retirement benefit obligation will be between the date of hire and the
expected retirement age as determined using the applicable assumptions under
Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan.

          Seller shall calculate the difference between the accumulated post-
retirement benefit obligations (using the methodology established by Financial
Accounting Standard No. 106 ("FAS 106"), except as provided in item (6) of the
preceding paragraph concerning use of attribution of the expected post-
retirement benefit obligation) as of January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1997
(adjusted for interest to January 1, 1998), respectively, for each such
employee, to determine the 12-month service costs.  Seller shall then determine
the final service costs for each such employee by prorating the 12-month service
costs to reflect the number of years and months


                                      -93-
<PAGE>

(determined on the basis that 15 or more days equals one month) of employment
for each such employee from the Closing Date to the date of termination of the
employee's employment with the Purchaser and all its Affiliates.  (Example: In
the case of an employee employed by Purchaser from a closing date of July 1,
1996, through September 30, 1997, the 12-month service cost would be multiplied
by 1.25 to reflect one year and three months of employment.)

          NOTE 5:  Seller shall be obligated to make a payment to Purchaser in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Purchaser shall calculate for each
Benefits Affected Employee the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
(using the methodology established by FAS 106) for Purchaser's Retiree Welfare
Plan, as of the Closing Date, for each Benefits Affected Employee who (A) either
(1) after becoming employed by Purchaser, attains age 55 and completes 5 or more
years of service during the 20-month period following the Closing Date or
(2) had attained age 55 and completed 5 years of service before the Closing
Date, (B) terminates employment with Purchaser and all its Affiliates before the
date that is 20 months after the Closing Date, and (C) does not irrevocably
decline coverage under Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans, for the period from
the Closing Date to the date of the termination of the employee's employment
with Purchaser and all its Affiliates.  If an individual irrevocably declines
one coverage, then the foregoing calculation shall apply to any other coverage
not irrevocably declined (E.G., an irrevocable declination of medical coverage
would nevertheless require a calculation for life and dental coverage).  Such
amount shall be projected for interest to the date that is 20 months after the
Closing Date.  In making this calculation, Purchaser shall make the following
assumptions:  (1) Demographic and health care trend assumptions used by
Purchaser (as published in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation report for
Purchaser's Retiree Welfare


                                      -94-

Plans); (2) Interest rate (discount rate):  7.5%; (3) Salary Scale:  5%; (4)
Provisions of Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans as in effect on the Closing
Date; (5) Census data as set forth on the Benefits Information Schedule;
(6) Attribution of the expected benefit obligation will be between the date of
hire and the eligibility date for full benefits under Purchaser's Retiree
Welfare Plans.

          NOTE 6:  Seller shall be obligated to make a payment to Purchaser in
an amount to be determined as follows:  Purchaser shall calculate for each
Benefits Affected Employee the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
(using the methodology described herein) for retiree welfare benefits accrued
under Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans as in effect as of the Closing Date, for
each Benefits Affected Employee who remains employed by Purchaser or its
Affiliates on the date that is 20 months after the Closing Date.  Such amount
shall be projected for interest to the date that is 20 months after the Closing
Date.  In making this calculation, Purchaser shall use the following
assumptions:  (1) Demographic and health care trend assumptions used by
Purchaser (as published in the January 1, 1995, actuarial valuation report of
Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans); (2) Interest rate (discount rate):  7.5%;
(3) Salary Scale:  5%; (4) Provisions of Purchaser's Retiree Welfare Plans as in
effect on the Closing Date; (5) Census data as set forth on the Benefits
Information Schedule; (6) Use of the methodology established by FAS 106 for
employees who either (A) after being employed by the Purchaser attain the age of
55 and complete 5 or more years of service during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is 20 months after the Closing Date or
(B) had attained the age of 55 and completed 5 years of service before the
Closing Date and for all other employees attribution of the expected post-
retirement benefit obligation between the date of hire


                                      - 95-
<PAGE>

and the expected retirement age as determined using the applicable assumptions
under Purchaser's Defined Benefit Plan.

               (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly prepare, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, a schedule which shall set forth, with
respect to each Benefits Affected Employee, the employee's name; Social Security
Number; 12-month service cost in accordance with Note 1 to Table 5.20(F)(1) and
Note 4 to Table 5.20(F)(2); 167% of the 12-month service cost in accordance with
Note 2 to Table 5.20(F)(1); projected benefit obligation in accordance with Note
3 to Table 5.20(F)(1); and accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation in
accordance with Notes 5 and 6 to Table 5.20(F)(2).  Such schedule shall be used
to determine the net adjustment to the Final Purchase Price with respect to the
items set forth therein.  The net adjustment to the Final Purchase Price
calculated under such schedule is assumed to be paid 20 months after the Closing
Date.  This net adjustment to the Final Purchase Price shall be projected for
interest at 7.5% per year from 20 months after the Closing Date to the actual
settlement date.

          (g)  Seller shall retain responsibility for and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and other
liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of all workers'
compensation claims of Affected Employees for injuries, as defined under the
applicable Workers' Compensation Act, sustained on or before the Closing Date,
regardless of when the claim is actually made.  Purchaser shall have
responsibility for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against
any and all claims, losses, damages and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) and other liabilities and obligations relating to or
arising out of all workers' compensation claims of Affected Employees (or


                                      -96-

replacement employees of Seller who become employed by Purchaser) for injuries,
as defined under the applicable Workers' Compensation Act, sustained after the
Closing Date.

          Section 5.21.  ALLOCATION OF FINAL PURCHASE PRICE.  Seller and
Purchaser agree for all Tax purposes to report the purchase of the Business as
an assumption reinsurance transaction.

          Within 120 days after Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall agree upon
the valuation of the assets purchased and shall complete a Form 8594 for
submission to the IRS with their 1996 federal income tax returns.

          The methodology for the allocation of the final purchase price to the
intangibles for federal tax purposes is the following:

          Section 5.22.  NEWCO.  Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to acquire or organize Newco (commercially reasonable for these purposes
to be interpreted in light of the regulatory requirements customarily imposed by
the New York Insurance Department) and to cause each warranty and representation
contained in this Agreement with respect to Newco to be true and correct no
later than September 30, 1996.  Purchaser shall also use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Newco, no later than September 30, 1996, to become an
accredited reinsurer in the State of Maine and in other states where becoming an
accredited reinsurer is required in order for Seller to receive statutory
statement credit for the reinsurance under the Newco Indemnity Reinsurance
Agreement.  Purchaser shall similarly use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain for Newco ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
and A.M. Best & Co., which shall be no lower than those assigned to Purchaser.
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in
obtaining accredited reinsurer status as provided in this Section 5.22.

that provide for payment of commissions on substantially the same terms as their
current arrangements with UNUM Sales Corporation with respect to the Insurance
Contracts and any contracts sold pursuant to the Coinsurance and Assumption
Agreement; and (b) obtain the necessary approvals and make the necessary filings
and appointments so that the registered representatives and selling agreement
partners listed on Schedule 5.23 hereto can lawfully receive from Purchaser
commissions on the Insurance

Contracts and any contracts sold pursuant to the Coinsurance and Assumption
Agreement.  Purchaser agrees to assume the costs incurred as a result of the
negotiation of the agreements and regulatory filings, registrations and
appointments referred to above.  Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance
to Purchaser in effectuating an orderly transition from UNUM Sales Corporation
to Purchaser, and each of the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts
to effectuate such transition by the Closing Date.

          Section 5.24.  OTHER AGREEMENTS.  Seller and Purchaser shall,
following the date hereof, work in good faith to complete the First UNUM

Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement.

          Section 5.26.  COMPUTER SYSTEMS.  Seller shall, prior to the Closing,
take, at the expense of Seller, actions to ensure that Seller's computer systems
are capable of inputing, processing and outputing information relating to
(i) the Insurance Contracts to enable the Insurance Contracts to be administered
in the name of Seller, Newco or Purchaser (as applicable depending upon whether
such Insurance Contracts have been novated to Purchaser pursuant to the
Purchaser Assumption Reinsurance Agreement or Newco pursuant to the Newco
Assumption Reinsurance Agreement), as contemplated by the Administrative
Services Agreement, and to permit Purchaser to prepare the reports contemplated

<PAGE>

Licensed Generally Used Software and the licensors of the Licensed Principally
Used Software the right for Purchaser to operate the Licensed Generally Used
Software and the Licensed Principally Used Software, which license, in the case
of the Licensed Generally Used Software, will grant Purchaser the right to use
such software solely in connection with the conduct of the Combined Business.
Seller shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with obtaining
such right from the licensors of the Licensed Generally Used Software and the
Licensed Principally Used Software.  Purchaser shall be entitled to participate
fully in any negotiation with any such licensors, but shall bear its own costs
in connection with such participation.  With respect to the Licensed Generally
Used Software and the Licensed Principally Used Software, Purchaser shall assume
responsibility for complying with the terms and conditions of the licenses
governing such software, including responsibility for the payment of the costs
and expenses, or its pro rata share of the costs and expenses, as applicable, of
all ongoing contractual responsibilities, including without limitation
licensing, upgrade and maintenance fees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall
not be responsible for the payment of any annual licensing fees payable with
respect to the Shared Cost Period.  Seller shall pay all licensing fees payable
with respect to the Shared Cost Period in connection with the Licensed Generally
Used Software and the Licensed Principally Used Software.

individual under a salary


                                      -101-
<PAGE>

deferral agreement exceed or appear to exceed the applicable maximum annual
dollar limit under section 402(g) of the Code in any calendar year;

          (b)  notifying each Participant (and, where appropriate, their
employers or former employers) of the minimum required distribution rules under
applicable provisions of sections 401(a)(9) and 403(b)(10) of the Code in the
year such Participant reaches age 70 and each year thereafter, and for
calculating such minimum required distributions;

          (c)  promptly and properly allocating forfeitures to Participant
accounts where forfeitures are not applied to reduce future employer
contributions;

          (d)  verifying (prior to any distribution or contract loan) signatures
authorizing distributions or contract loans from any Transferred Contract
exceeding $50,000; and

          (e)  verifying Participant changes of address by correspondence
directed to the old as well as the new address.

          Section 5.29.  CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE.  In the event that Newco is not
successful, on or prior to December 1, 1997, in obtaining accredited reinsurance
status in all states where such status is required for Seller to obtain
statutory statement credit for the reinsurance under the Newco Indemnity
Reinsurance Agreement, as contemplated by Section 5.22 hereof, Seller and
Purchaser shall endeavor in good faith to revise the applicable Ancillary
Agreements and/or to enter into new agreements in order to provide Seller with
such statutory statement credit.  Such arrangements may include, without
limitation, (a) the issuance of a letter of credit for the benefit of Seller
which complies with applicable law for credit for reinsurance or (b) a cession
to Purchaser instead of Newco of the reinsurance contemplated under the Newco
Indemnity Reinsurance Agreement, with a retrocession of such business by
Purchaser to Newco.  The


                                      -102-
<PAGE>

parties contemplate that Seller would bear the costs of establishing any letters
of credit as referenced above, provided that Purchaser would bear the
incremental costs of establishing a letter of credit to the extent that the
amount of such letter of credit should exceed $100 million.

          Section 5.30.  CUSTODIAN ACCOUNT.  In the event that the New York
Insurance Department rejects a proposal submitted to the New York Insurance
Department by the parties calling for the establishment by Newco of a custodian
arrangement for the benefit of holders of Insurance Contracts issued in New York
and for the release of assets held pursuant to the Seller Custodian Agreement
with a fair market value equal to the portion of the General Account Reserves
that pertains to those Insurance Contracts that are subject to the provisions of
the Seller Custodian Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
formulate a revised proposal for submission to the New York Insurance Department
with the objective of securing the release of such assets.  Notwithstanding this
Section 5.30, in no event shall Purchaser or Newco be required to (i) fund any
custodian account in an amount exceeding 100% of the General Account Reserves
pertaining to the relevant Insurance Contracts minus the aggregate amount of
contract loans under such Insurance Contracts or (ii) bear any costs that are
significantly in excess of those that Purchaser or Newco would have borne had
the relevant assets been maintained under the Newco Trust Agreement.

                               FURTHER AGREEMENTS

          Section 8.01.  SELLER'S NON-COMPETE.  (a)  Seller agrees that, except
as set forth in Section 8.01(d) hereof, following the Closing Date until the
second anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period") Seller shall
not, and Seller agrees that none of its Affiliates shall, in the United States,
without the consent of Purchaser:

                 (i)     solicit any holder of an Insurance Contract for the
purpose of (A) obtaining applications for new group annuity contracts which
constitute the Business or (B) inducing or attempting to induce any such Person

                                      -113-
<PAGE>

                (ii)     establish a sales force for the purpose of soliciting
applications for new contracts to be issued by Seller or by any such Affiliate
which would be included in the Business if issued by Purchaser or Newco or an
Affiliate of Purchaser or Newco; or

               (iii)     disclose or reveal to any Person other than Purchaser
or Newco any trade secret or other confidential information relating solely to

regulatory order, statute or otherwise) to disclose or reveal such information,
provided that Seller shall only disclose such information to the extent required
to satisfy such legal requirement.

          (b)  Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that any damage caused to
Purchaser and Newco by reason of the breach by Seller or by any of Seller's
Affiliates or any of their respective successors in interest of this Section
8.01 could not be adequately compensated for in monetary damages alone;
therefore, each party agrees that, in addition to any other remedies, at law or
otherwise, Purchaser and Newco shall be entitled to specific performance of this
Section 8.01 or an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction
restraining and enjoining any violation of this Section 8.01.

          (c)  It is the intent and desire of the parties to this Agreement that
the provisions of this Section 8.01 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable law.  Accordingly, if any particular portion of
this Section 8.01 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this
Section 8.01 shall be amended to delete therefrom the portion thus adjudicated
to be invalid and unenforceable under such law.

          (d)  The provisions of Sections 8.01(a)(i) and (ii) hereof shall apply
to Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company only with respect to the
solicitation of group contractholders of


                                      -114-
<PAGE>

agrees that the provisions of this Section 8.01 shall not prevent Colonial Life
& Accident Insurance Company from soliciting any insurance contracts or policies
on its behalf or on behalf of any other insurer from Persons other than such
group contractholders.

amount of such excess; (ii) any Asserted Liability arising out of any breach of
or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
Section 3.10(c) hereof or any breach, nonfulfillment or default in the
performance of any of the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in
Section 5.28(a), (b) or (c) hereof, if the sum of Losses in connection therewith
and Losses (as defined in the First UNUM Agreement) in connection with


                                      -116-
<PAGE>

any Asserted Liability arising out of any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of First UNUM, or any breach, nonfulfillment or
default by First UNUM contained in the corresponding provisions of the First
UNUM Agreement exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate, in which case all such Losses
shall be indemnified (there being no indemnification hereunder for Losses based
on any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in Section 3.10(c) hereof or any breach, nonfulfillment or default in
the performance of any of the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in
Section 5.28(a), (b) or (c) hereof except for Losses resulting from an Asserted
Liability); (iii) any Extra Contractual Obligations; (iv) all liabilities or
obligations arising out of or related to the Assigned and Assumed Contracts
based on acts of Seller occurring prior to the Closing Date other than those
liabilities or obligations reflected on the Final Balance Sheet and (v) any
breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.25(d) hereof.  Solely for the purposes of this Section 10.01(a), the
question whether any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.10(c) or
3.25(d) hereof has been breached shall be made without regard to matters
previously disclosed to Purchaser, so that no such disclosure made prior to the
date hereof, and no update to any such disclosure made on or prior to the
Closing Date, shall be taken into account in determining whether any such breach
has occurred.

          As used in this Article X, Loss and/or Losses shall mean claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), interest, taxes and penalties.

          (b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X, Purchaser
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller (and its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns) from and
against all Losses, based upon:  (i)(A) any breach


                                      -117-
<PAGE>

of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in
Article IV hereof or in any Ancillary Agreement; or (B) any breach,
nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any of the covenants and
agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any of the covenants or
agreements of Purchaser or Newco contained in any Ancillary Agreement or in any
certificate or document delivered by Purchaser or Newco pursuant to any of the
provisions of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
to the extent that the sum of Losses in connection with clauses (b)(i)(A) and
(b)(i)(B) of this Section 10.01 and Losses (as defined in the First UNUM
Agreement) in connection with the corresponding provisions of the First UNUM
Agreement exceeds $1 million in the aggregate, and then only in the amount of
such excess; and (ii) the Insurance Liabilities and any claim (other than an
Extra Contractual Obligation) of any Person other than Seller or its Affiliates
with respect to or arising out of any Insurance Liability.

          (c)  The aggregate amount for which Purchaser shall be liable under
Section 10.01(b) shall be $35 million less any amounts paid under the
corresponding provision of the First UNUM Agreement.  The aggregate amount for
which Seller shall be liable under Sections 10.01(a)(i), (iii) and (iv) shall be
$35 million less any amounts paid under the corresponding provisions of the
First UNUM Agreement.  The aggregate amount for which Seller shall be liable
under Section 10.01(a)(ii) shall be (i) $210 million with respect to Claims
Notices received by Seller from Purchaser during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 1997, (ii) $140 million with respect to
Claims Notices received by Seller from Purchaser during the period commencing on
January 1, 1998 and ending on December 31, 1998, and (iii) $70 million with
respect to Claims Notices received by Seller from


                                      -118-
<PAGE>

Purchaser during the period commencing on January 1, 1999 and ending on December
31 of the sixth year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date falls
less, in each case, any amount paid under the corresponding provision of the
First UNUM Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate amount for which
Seller shall be liable under Section 10.01(a)(ii) during any period described in
this Section 10.01(c) shall be reduced by any amounts paid or payable by Seller
with respect to Claims Notices received by Seller during any prior period
pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(ii) and amounts paid or payable under the
corresponding provision of the First UNUM Agreement; and, PROVIDED FURTHER, that
in no event shall the liability of Seller with respect to Section 10.01(a)(ii)
exceed $210 million less any amount paid under the corresponding provision of
the First UNUM Agreement.

          Section 10.02.  CLAIMS NOTICE.  Any claim for indemnification that
Newco wishes to assert hereunder shall be asserted by Purchaser on behalf of
Newco.  In the event that either Purchaser, Newco or Seller wishes to assert a
claim for indemnification hereunder, such party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party") shall deliver written notice (a "Claims Notice") to the
other party (the "Indemnifying Party") no later than ten (10) Business Days
after such claim becomes known to the Indemnified Party, specifying the facts
constituting the basis for, and the amount (if known) of, the claim asserted.
Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with respect to a claim in a timely manner as
specified in the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a waiver of the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection
with such claim, but the amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party
is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified
Party's Losses would have been less had such Claims Notice been timely
delivered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,


                                      -119-
<PAGE>

notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to deliver a Claims Notice with
respect to a claim within twenty (20) Business Days of the Indemnified Party's
receipt of written notice of such claim shall be deemed a waiver of the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection
with such claim.

          Section 10.03.  RIGHT TO CONTEST CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES.  (a)
Subject to Section 10.04 hereof, if an Indemnified Party asserts a claim for
indemnification hereunder because of a claim or demand made, or an action,
proceeding or investigation instituted, by any Person not a party to this
Agreement (a "Third Party Claimant") that may result in a Loss with respect to
which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.01 hereof without regard to the dollar limitations set forth in
Section 10.01 (an "Asserted Liability"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party a Claims Notice with respect thereto, which Claims Notice
shall, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.02 hereof, be delivered
no later than ten (10) Business Days after such Asserted Liability is actually
known to the Indemnified Party.  Failure to deliver a Claims Notice with respect
to an Asserted Liability in a timely manner as specified in the preceding
sentence shall not be deemed a waiver of the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification for Losses in connection with such Asserted Liability, but the
amount of reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Party's Losses would
have been less had such Claims Notice been timely delivered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to deliver a Claims Notice with
respect to an Asserted Liability within twenty (20) Business Days of the
Indemnified Party's receipt of written notice of such Asserted


                                      -120-
<PAGE>

Liability shall be deemed to be a waiver of the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection with such Asserted Liability.

          (b)  Subject to Section 10.04 hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to investigate,
contest, defend or settle any Asserted Liability that may result in a Loss with
respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 10.01 hereof; provided, that the Indemnified Party may, at its option
and at its own expense, participate in the investigation, contesting, defense or
settlement of any such Asserted Liability through representatives and counsel of
its own choosing; and, provided further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not
settle any Asserted Liability unless (i) such settlement is on exclusively
monetary terms or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have consented to the terms
of such settlement, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.  The
failure of the Indemnifying Party to provide the above-mentioned written notice
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claims
Notice with respect to an Asserted Liability shall be deemed an election not to
defend the same.  Unless and until the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the
Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option
and at the Indemnifying Party's expense, to do so in such manner as it deems
appropriate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle or
compromise any Asserted Liability for which it seeks indemnification hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) during the thirty (30) day period referred to above.

          (c)  The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but
not to control) the defense of any Asserted Liability which it has elected, or
is deemed to have elected, not to


                                      -121-
<PAGE>

defend, or as to which it does not have the right to defend under
Section 10.03(b) or 10.04(a), with its own counsel and at its own expense.  If
the Indemnifying Party seeks to question (i) the manner in which the Indemnified
Party defended an Asserted Liability with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party elected, or is deemed to have elected, not to defend or (ii) the amount or
nature of any settlement entered into by the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did not
defend or settle such Asserted Liability in a reasonably prudent manner.

          (d)  Except as provided in the first sentence of Section 10.03(b), and
subject to the provisions of Section 10.04 hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall
bear all costs of defending any Asserted Liability and shall indemnify and hold
the Indemnified Party harmless against and from all costs, fees and expenses
incurred in connection with defending such Asserted Liability.

          (e)  Purchaser and Seller shall, and Purchaser shall cause Newco to,
make mutually available to each other all non-privileged relevant information in
their possession relating to any Asserted Liability and shall cooperate with
each other in the defense thereof.

          Section 10.04.  SECTION 10.01(a)(ii) INDEMNIFICATION.  Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in Section 10.03 and except as provided in subsection
(a)(iii) of this Section 10.04, the provisions of this Section 10.04 shall
govern the procedures by which Purchaser and/or Newco shall seek indemnification
under Section 10.01(a)(ii) with respect to Employer Claims and IRS Claims.

          (a) (i)  In the event that any Contractholder asserts a claim against
Purchaser and/or Newco or indicates to Purchaser and/or Newco that it believes
that the IRS may assert a Tax


                                      -122-
<PAGE>

liability against such Contractholder (or against one or more participants or
holders of certificates under the relevant Transferred Contract) (an "Employer
Claim"), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written notice with respect thereto
no later than ten (10) Business Days after such Employer Claim is actually known
to (A) Purchaser, in the case of an Employer Claim against Purchaser, (B) Newco,
in the case of an Employer Claim against Newco, or (C) the first of Purchaser
and Newco to have such actual knowledge, in the case of an Employer Claim
against both Purchaser and Newco, specifying the facts constituting the basis
for, and the amount, if known, of such Employer Claim.  Failure to deliver such
written notice with respect to an Employer Claim in a timely manner as specified
in the preceding sentence shall not be deemed a waiver of Purchaser's and/or
Newco's right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection with such
Employer Claim, but the amount of reimbursement to which Purchaser and/or Newco
is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which Purchaser's and/or
Newco's Losses would have been less had such written notice been timely
delivered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure
to deliver such written notice with respect to an Employer Claim within twenty
(20) Business Days of (x) Purchaser's receipt, in the case of an Employer Claim
against Purchaser, (y) Newco's receipt, in the case of an Employer Claim against
Newco, or (z) the first of Purchaser's receipt or Newco's receipt, in the case
of an Employer Claim against both Purchaser and Newco, of written notice of such
Employer Claim shall be deemed a waiver of Purchaser's or Newco's, as
applicable, right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection with
such Employer Claim.  Seller shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the investigation of any Employer Claim, with its own counsel and at
its own expense.  Purchaser or Newco, as applicable, shall have the right, but


                                      -123-
<PAGE>

not the obligation, to investigate and to settle on, with respect to Seller,
exclusively monetary terms, any such Employer Claim without the consent of
Seller, either by making the settlement payment to the relevant Contractholder,
participant or holders of certificates or by making such payment directly to the
IRS.  In the event that Losses incurred by Purchaser and/or Newco in connection
with the settlement of any such Employer Claim do not exceed $250,000, Purchaser
shall provide written notice (the "Settlement Notice") to Seller within ten (10)
Business Days of the making of such payment by Purchaser or Newco, which
Settlement Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the amount of Losses
incurred by Purchaser and/or Newco in connection with the settlement of such
Employer Claim and the portion thereof for which Purchaser and/or Newco seeks
indemnification.  Seller shall either pay in full the amount for which Purchaser
and/or Newco seeks indemnification or request arbitration in accordance with
Section 10.04(a)(ii).  If Seller neither pays in full the amount for which
Purchaser and/or Newco seeks indemnification nor requests arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.04(a)(ii) within thirty (30) days
of the date on which Seller received such Settlement Notice, Purchaser shall be
entitled to request arbitration in accordance with Section 10.04(a)(ii).  In the
event that Losses in connection with any settlement of an Employer Claim exceed
$250,000, or in the event that any such Losses, when added to other Losses as to
which Purchaser or Newco has entered into settlements in accordance with this
Section 10.04(a)(i) or the corresponding provision of the First UNUM Agreement
during the same calendar year, would exceed $2,500,000 in the aggregate, neither
Purchaser nor Newco shall be entitled to seek indemnification under, and such
Losses shall not count towards the $500,000 threshold set forth in, Section
10.01(a)(ii).


                                      -124-
<PAGE>

           (ii)  (A)     In the event that an arbitration proceeding is
commenced in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(i) of this Section
10.04, the party requesting the arbitration shall have the right to arbitrate,
pursuant to the procedures specified below, with regard to (i) whether the
relevant Losses were based upon any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.10(c) hereof or
the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in Section 5.28(a), (b) or (c)
hereof, (ii) the reasonableness of the amount of the settlement entered into by
Purchaser and/or Newco and (iii) the reasonableness of any proposed allocation
of settlement between Purchaser and/or Newco on the one hand and Seller on the
other hand.  In any such arbitration proceeding, Purchaser shall have the burden
to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the matters set forth in clauses (i)
and (iii) of the preceding sentence.  In the event that the arbitrators rule in
favor of Purchaser as to such matters, Seller shall have the burden to prove by
a preponderance of the evidence that Purchaser and/or Newco did not settle such
Employer Claim in a reasonable manner.  In the event that the arbitrators rule
in favor of Seller on the issue of the reasonableness of the settlement, they
shall be entitled to determine a lesser amount to be indemnified by Seller.

                    (B)  In the event that Seller wishes to exercise its right
to seek arbitration with respect to an Employer Claim that has been settled, it
shall deliver a written notice of exercise to Purchaser within thirty (30) days
of the date on which Seller received the Settlement Notice with respect to such
settlement.  In the event that Seller neither requests arbitration in accordance
with the foregoing sentence nor pays in full the amount for which Purchaser
and/or Newco seeks indemnification within thirty (30) days of the date on which
Seller received the applicable Settlement Notice and Purchaser wishes to
exercise its right to seek arbitration,


                                      -125-
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall deliver a written notice of exercise to Seller within ten (10)
Business Days of the expiration of such 30-day period.  The arbitration panel
shall consist of three attorneys widely recognized as having expertise in
matters relating to ERISA and section 403(b) of the Code; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that there shall be excluded from the arbitration panel the following
individuals:  (x) any attorney who worked on this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (y) any
attorney employed by or partner of the firm with which any attorney described in
clause (x) is affiliated as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date; and
(z) any attorney employed by or partner of any firm advising either party with
respect to any matter at the time of such arbitration.  Seller shall appoint one
such arbitrator and Purchaser shall appoint the second arbitrator.  Such
arbitrators shall then select the third arbitrator before arbitration commences.
Should either Seller or Purchaser decline to appoint an arbitrator, or should
the two arbitrators be unable to agree upon the choice of a third, such
arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association.  The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York,
as soon as possible after the arbitrators are appointed.  Each party will have
the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses.  Discovery
shall be limited to the production of written documents and the taking of
depositions, in each case as found by the arbitrators to be directly relevant
to, and reasonably necessary to the resolution of, the issues in the
arbitration, and such other discovery as the arbitrators may order.  Decisions
of the arbitrators shall be by majority vote.  Each party shall bear its own
costs and those of its counsel in connection with any such arbitration, but the
costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators, shall be shared
equally by the parties.  Judgment upon any award of the arbitrators may be
entered in a Federal court of competent


                                      -126-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction located in the City, County and State of New York.  Any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or Newco in connection with the
enforcement of any such decision shall be reimbursed by Seller (but shall not be
included in determining the limitations on Seller's liability under Section
10.01(c)).

               (iii)     In the event that neither Purchaser nor Newco settles
an Employer Claim under Section 10.04(a)(i), Purchaser shall be entitled to
deliver a Claims Notice to Seller with respect to such Employer Claim at any
time provided that neither Purchaser nor Newco has made any pleading or other
filing in any court or other tribunal with respect to such Employer Claim and
that Seller receives such Claims Notice at least twenty (20) days prior to the
date upon which any such filing is due in response to a complaint or other
filing made by the IRS or the relevant Contractholder.  In the event that
Purchaser delivers a Claims Notice to Seller with respect to such an Employer
Claim, the provisions of Section 10.03 shall apply to such Employer Claim;
provided, that the requirement that Claims Notices with respect to Asserted
Liabilities be delivered within ten (10) Business Days after the Asserted
Liability is actually known to the Indemnified Party shall not be applicable.

          (b) (i)  In the event that the IRS asserts a claim against Purchaser
and/or Newco or indicates to Purchaser and/or Newco that it may assert a Tax
liability against one or more Contractholders (an "IRS Claim"), Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller written notice with respect thereto no later than ten (10)
Business Days after such IRS Claim is actually known to (A) Purchaser, in the
case of an IRS Claim against Purchaser, (B) Newco, in the case of an IRS Claim
against Newco, or (C) the first of Purchaser and Newco to have such actual
knowledge, in the case of an IRS Claim against both Purchaser and Newco,
specifying the basis for and the


                                      -127-
<PAGE>

amount, if known, of such IRS Claim, and Purchaser and/or Newco, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall jointly investigate, contest, defend
or settle such IRS Claim.  In any such joint defense, Purchaser and/or Newco, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate in good faith.  In
the event that Purchaser and/or Newco, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, agree to a settlement with the IRS and to an allocation of the settlement
between Purchaser and/or Newco, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
the amount of (A) Seller's allocable share (as determined by Purchaser and/or
Newco, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand) of the settlement and of
the legal fees and other expenses incurred by Purchaser and/or Newco in
connection with the IRS Claim and (B) the legal fees and other expenses incurred
by Seller in connection with the IRS Claim shall be paid by Seller.  In the
event that a settlement offer is made by the IRS and either Purchaser and/or
Newco, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, wishes to accept the
offer, the other party shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the
settlement.  If Seller rejects the offer but Purchaser or Newco, as applicable,
nonetheless agrees to the settlement, or if Seller wishes to accept the offer
but Purchaser or Newco, as applicable, does not agree to the settlement, the
procedures set forth in Section 10.04(b)(ii) shall apply.

               (ii) (A)  In the event that the amount of Losses sought by
Purchaser and/or Newco in connection with a settlement offer rejected by Seller
in connection with an IRS Claim is $1,000,000 or less, Purchaser shall have the
right to arbitrate the reasonableness of Seller's rejection of such offer.  The
arbitrators shall be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 10.04(a)(ii)(B) except as specifically provided in this
Section 10.04(b)(ii)(A).  The arbitrators shall determine (i) whether and the
extent to which the IRS Claim was based


                                      -128-
<PAGE>

upon any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in Section 3.10(c) hereof or the covenants and agreements of Seller
contained in Section 5.28(a), (b) or (c) hereof, (ii) the reasonableness of the
amount of the settlement offer in light of their determination as to the
question set forth in clause (i) of this sentence and (iii) the reasonableness
of any proposed allocation of settlement between Purchaser and/or Newco, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand.  In any such arbitration proceeding,
Purchaser shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the
matters set forth in clauses (i) and (iii) of the preceding sentence.  In the
event that the arbitrators rule in favor of Purchaser as to such matters, Seller
shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its
rejection of the settlement offer was reasonable.  In the event that the
arbitrators rule that Seller's rejection of the settlement was unreasonable,
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and/or Newco for Seller's allocable share of
Losses based upon the IRS Claim (allocated based on Seller's liability, on the
one hand, and Purchaser's and/or Newco's liability, on the other hand, with
respect to such IRS Claim), and for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser
in connection with the arbitration.  In the event that the arbitrators rule that
Seller's rejection of the settlement was reasonable, the arbitrators shall be
entitled to determine a lesser amount to be indemnified by Seller.  Judgment
upon any award of the arbitrators may be entered in a Federal court of competent
jurisdiction located in the City, County and State of New York.  Any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with the enforcement of any
such decision shall be reimbursed by Seller (but shall not be included in
determining the limitations on Seller's liability under Section 10.01(c)).

<PAGE>

               (B)  In the event that the amount of Losses sought by Purchaser
and/or Newco in connection with a settlement offer rejected by Seller in
connection with an IRS Claim is greater than $1,000,000, Purchaser or Newco, as
applicable, shall have the right to bring an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction to seek resolution of the matters set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
of Section 10.04(b)(ii)(A).  In the event that the court rules that Seller's
rejection of the settlement was unreasonable, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser
and/or Newco for Seller's allocable share of Losses based upon the IRS Claim
(allocated based on Seller's liability, on the one hand, and Purchaser's and/or
Newco's liability, on the other hand, with respect to such IRS Claim), and for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or Newco, as applicable, in
connection with the litigation (which shall not be included in determining the
limitations on Seller's liability under Section 10.01(c)).  In the event that
the court rules that Seller's rejection of the settlement was reasonable, the
court shall be entitled to determine a lesser amount to be indemnified by
Seller.

          (C)  In the event that the amount of Losses allocable to Seller in
connection with a settlement offer rejected by Purchaser and/or Newco in
connection with an IRS Claim is $1,000,000 or less, Seller shall have the right
to arbitrate the reasonableness of Purchaser's and/or Newco's rejection of such
offer.  The arbitrators shall be selected in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 10.04(a)(ii)(B) except as specifically provided in this
Section 10.04(b)(ii)(C).  The arbitrators shall determine the reasonableness of
the amount of the settlement offer.  Purchaser shall have the burden to prove,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that its and/or Newco's rejection of the
settlement offer was reasonable.  In the event that the arbitrators rule that
Purchaser's and/or Newco's rejection of the settlement was unreasonable,


                                      -130-
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller
in connection with the arbitration and Seller's aggregate indemnification
obligation under Section 10.01(a)(ii), if any, arising from such IRS Claim and
from any subsequent IRS Claim or Employer Claim relating to the issue or issues
that (x) were the subject of the IRS Claim in question and (y) would have been
resolved by the relevant settlement offer (regardless of whether such IRS Claim
or Employer Claim arises out of the identical Insurance Contract or Insurance
Contracts) shall be limited, in the aggregate, to the portion of such IRS Claim
in question that is allocable to Seller (as determined by the arbitrators and
specified in written findings of the arbitrators).  Judgment upon any award of
the arbitrators may be entered in a Federal court of competent jurisdiction
located in the City, County and State of New York.  Any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with the enforcement of any such decision shall
be reimbursed by Purchaser (but shall not be included in determining the
limitations on Purchaser's liability under Section 10.01(c)).

               (D)  In the event that the amount of Losses allocable to Seller
in connection with a settlement offer rejected by Purchaser and/or Newco in
connection with an IRS Claim is greater than $1,000,000, Seller shall have the
right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to seek
resolution of the reasonableness of the amount of the settlement offer.  In the
event that the court rules that Purchaser's and/or Newco's rejection of the
settlement was unreasonable, Seller's aggregate indemnification obligation under
Section 10.01(a)(ii), if any, arising from such IRS Claim and from any
subsequent IRS Claim or Employer Claim relating to the issue or issues that (x)
were the subject of the IRS Claim in question and (y) would have been resolved
by the relevant settlement offer (regardless of


                                     -131-
<PAGE>

whether such IRS Claim or Employer Claim arises out of the identical Insurance
Contract or Insurance Contracts) shall be limited, in the aggregate, to the
portion of such IRS Claim in question that is allocable to Seller (as determined
by the court).  In addition, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Seller in connection with the litigation (which shall not
be included in determining the limitations on Purchaser's liability under
Section 10.01(c)).

          (c)  The parties intend that in determining whether a settlement or a
settlement offer pursuant to this Section 10.04 was reasonable, arbitrators or a
court, as applicable, shall consider the factors typically considered by
insurers in settling claims of policyholders and contractholders including, but
not be limited to, (i) whether Purchaser and/or Newco acted in good faith in
settling an Employer Claim, or a portion of an IRS Claim allocable to Seller (in
the event of a settlement by Purchaser and/or Newco) and (ii) the likely results
of litigation had the Employer Claim, or a portion of an IRS Claim allocable to
Seller, been litigated to a final judgment before a court of competent
jurisdiction (in the event of a settlement by Purchaser and/or Newco or a
settlement offer rejected by Seller or Purchaser and/or Newco), (iii) the
potential costs of litigation, (iv) the potential for additional claims to
develop in the course of litigation or continued settlement negotiations, (v)
adverse publicity that would result from litigation and (vi) the potential for
the establishment of adverse legal precedent in a court proceeding, in each
case, as such may be applicable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in determining any such
reasonableness, the arbitrators shall consider the future business interests of
Purchaser and/or Newco with respect to the Contractholders only to the extent
that such business interests are included within the factors specifically
referred to above in clauses (i) through (vi); and,


                                      -132-
<PAGE>

PROVIDED FURTHER, that, with respect to an IRS Claim, the arbitrators shall
consider solely the factors specifically referred to above in clauses (i)
through (vi) and whether the settlement of Seller's allocable portion of the IRS
Claim would have been reasonable had such allocable portion been the sole
subject of the IRS Claim.

          (d)  Unless and until Purchaser or Seller shall have commenced an
arbitration or judicial proceeding against the other party pursuant to the
provisions hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall, and Purchaser shall cause Newco
to, make mutually available to each other all non-privileged relevant
information in their possession relating to any Employer Claim or IRS Claim and
shall cooperate with each other in the investigation or defense thereof.

          Section 10.05.  INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.  Subject to a party's right
to defend pursuant to Section 10.03 or Section 10.04 hereof, an Indemnifying
Party hereunder shall make a required indemnification payment with respect to a
Loss promptly after a Claims Notice is received.  All such payments shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts
as the Indemnified Party shall designate to the Indemnifying Party in writing.

                          TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

          Section 11.01.  TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

          (a)  by Seller in writing, if Purchaser shall (i) fail to perform in
any material respect its agreements contained herein or in the First UNUM
Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
breach any of its representations, warranties,


                                      -133-
<PAGE>

covenants or agreements contained herein, which breach would, individually or in
the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (after giving effect to the
Closing) the ability of Purchaser and Newco to conduct the Business, which
failure or breach is not cured within ten (10) days after Seller has notified
Purchaser of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.01(a);

          (b)  by Purchaser in writing, if Seller shall (i) fail to perform in
any material respect its agreements contained herein or in the First UNUM
Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
breach any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein, which breach would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Business or materially and adversely affect the ability of
Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, which failure or
breach is not cured within ten (10) days after Purchaser has notified Seller of
its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(b);

          (c)  by Seller or Purchaser in writing, if there shall be any order,
writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental or regulatory agency
binding on Purchaser and/or Seller, which prohibits or restrains Purchaser
and/or Seller from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby; PROVIDED,
that Purchaser and/or Seller, as the case may be, shall have used its best
efforts to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted and the same
shall not have been lifted by December 15, 1996;

          (d)  by either of Seller or Purchaser in writing, if the Closing has
not occurred on or prior to December 15, 1996 unless the absence of such
occurrence shall be due to the failure


                                      -134-
<PAGE>

of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to materially perform each of
its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior
to the Closing Date;

          (e)  at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by mutual written
consent of Seller and Purchaser; and

          (f)  by Seller in writing if, at any time prior to the Closing Date,
(i) the ratings of Purchaser shall become lower than the ratings specified in
Section 7.08 hereof or (ii) Purchaser shall be placed on credit watch with an
indication of a reduction in rating to a rating lower than the ratings so
specified and Purchaser is not removed from credit watch within fourteen (14)
days after being so placed on credit watch.

          Section 11.02.  BREAK-UP FEE.  (a)  In the event that Seller or
Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01(a) or (b)
hereof or otherwise fail to close this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, other than a failure to close this Agreement in accordance with Section
11.01(c), (d) or (e), in addition to any other remedy available to the non-
breaching party at law or equity, the breaching party shall pay to the non-
breaching party, within ten (10) Business Days of such termination, the sum of
$2 million, as well as all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the non-
breaching party in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

          (b)  In the event that Seller shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.01(f) hereof, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, within ten (10)
Business Days of such termination, the sum of $2 million, as well as all out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with the negotiation
and preparation of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

<PAGE>

          (c)  The parties recognize that this Section 11.02 shall not apply if
this Agreement fails to close solely due to the failure of Purchaser to satisfy
by December 15, 1996 the condition to close set forth in Section 7.09 hereof,
provided that Purchaser shall not have failed to perform its covenants contained
in Section 5.22 hereof.

          (d) The parties recognize that this Section 11.02 shall not apply if
this Agreement fails to close solely due to the failure of Seller to satisfy the
condition to close set forth in Section 6.12 hereof.

transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this
