such references include both the corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which
are wholly owned, unless otherwise indicated. Unico was incorporated under the
laws of Nevada in 1969. Unico American Corporation is an insurance holding
company which provides property, casualty, health and life insurance and related
premium financing through its wholly owned subsidiaries.

                            GENERAL AGENCY OPERATIONS

The Company's general agency subsidiaries are as follows:

Unifax Insurance Systems, Inc. ("Unifax") primarily sells and services business
package insurance policies. In addition, it also sells and services commercial
liability, commercial property, commercial automobile and workers' compensation
insurance policies. Its commercial automobile and workers' compensation policies
are sold in California for non-affiliated insurers. All other policies are sold
and serviced by Unifax in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Nevada for
Crusader Insurance Company ("Crusader"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Unico.

Bedford Insurance Services, Inc. ("Bedford") sells and services daily automobile
rental policies in most states for a non-affiliated insurer.

National Coverage Corporation ("NCC") renews and services existing commercial
automobile and auto physical damage policies in California on a discontinued
program for a non-affiliated insurer.

As general agents, these subsidiaries market, rate, underwrite, inspect and
issue policies, bill and collect insurance premiums, and maintain accounting and
statistical data. Unifax is the exclusive general agent for Crusader. Unifax,
Bedford and NCC are non-exclusive general agents for non-affiliated insurance
companies. The Company's marketing is conducted through advertising to
independent insurance agents and brokers. For its services, the general agent
receives a commission (based on the premium written) from the insurance company,
and in some cases, a service fee from the customer. These subsidiaries all hold
licenses issued by the California Department of Insurance and other states where
applicable.

                       INSURANCE CLAIM ADJUSTING OPERATION

                       INSURANCE PREMIUM FINANCE OPERATION

American Acceptance Corporation ("AAC") is a licensed insurance premium finance
company which provides insurance purchasers with the ability to pay their
insurance premiums on an installment basis. The premium finance company pays the
insurance premium to the insurance company in return for a premium finance note
from the insured. These notes are paid off by the insured in nine monthly
installments and are secured by the unearned premiums held by the insurance
company. The premium finance company also finances commercial auto policies
produced by Unifax for a non-affiliated insurance company.

                      HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS

The Company's subsidiaries: National Insurance Brokers, Inc. ("NIB") and
American Insurance Brokers, Inc. ("AIB"), market medical, dental, life, and
accidental death and dismemberment insurance through non-affiliated insurance
companies for individuals and groups. The services provided consist of
marketing, billing and collection, accounting, and customer service. For its
services, these subsidiaries receive a commission from the insurance company.
Most of the business is produced through independent insurance agents and
brokers who receive a commission from NIB or AIB. NIB and AIB hold licenses
issued by the California Department of Insurance. All business is currently
written in the State of California.

                              ASSOCIATION OPERATION

The Company's subsidiary Insurance Club, Inc., DBA The American Association For
Quality Health Care ("AAQHC"), is a membership association which provides
various consumer benefits to its members, including participation in group
health care and life insurance policies which AAQHC negotiates for the
Association. For these services, AAQHC receives membership and fee income from
its members.

                           INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATION

GENERAL

The insurance company operations are conducted through Crusader, which as of
March 31, 1996, is licensed as an admitted insurance carrier in the states of
California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Crusader is a multiple line
property and casualty insurance company which began transacting business on
January 1, 1985. As of March 31, 1996, it was primarily writing business package
policies in all the states in which it is licensed. Crusader also writes
commercial property and commercial liability policies in those states. Its
business is sold through Unifax Insurance Systems, Inc., its sister corporation.
Unifax has substantial experience with these classes of business. Crusader is
licensed in all property and casualty and disability lines by the California
Department of Insurance.

REINSURANCE

A reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurance company transfers ("cedes") a
portion of its exposure on business written by it to a reinsurer which assumes
that risk for a premium ("ceded premium"). Reinsurance does not legally
discharge the company from primary liability under its policies; and if the
reinsurer fails to meet the obligations, the company must nonetheless pay its
policy obligations. Crusader has reinsurance agreements with National
Reinsurance Corporation, a California admitted reinsurance company, which helps
protect it against liabilities in excess of certain retentions, including major
or catastrophic losses which may occur from any one or more of the property
and/or casualty risks which Crusader insures. Crusader also has additional
catastrophe reinsurance from various California admitted reinsurance companies.

                                        3

<PAGE>

The aggregate amount of insurance premiums ceded to the reinsurers for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1996, and March 31, 1995, was $6,077,403 and
$9,258,535 respectively.

Crusader's retention is currently $150,000 per risk subject to a maximum dollar
amount and to catastrophe and clash covers. The catastrophe and clash covers
(subject to a maximum occurrence and annual aggregate amount) help protect the
company from one loss occurrence affecting multiple policies. The premium ceded
to the reinsurers for the catastrophe and clash covers and for all exposures
over $500,000 is a fixed percentage of the premium charged by Crusader. On
exposures up to $500,000, the reinsurer charges a provisional rate which is
subject to adjustment and is based on the amount of losses ceded, limited by a
maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer. On most of the premium
that Crusader cedes to the reinsurer, the reinsurer pays a commission to
Crusader which includes a reimbursement of the cost of acquiring the portion of
the premium which is ceded. Crusader does not currently assume any reinsurance
from other insurance companies. The company intends to continue obtaining
reinsurance although the availability and cost may vary from time to time. The
unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurer are recorded as an asset on the balance
sheet.

UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

Crusader maintains reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect
to both reported and unreported losses. Crusader establishes reserves for
reported losses based on historical experience, upon case-by-case evaluation of
facts surrounding each known loss, and the related policy provisions. The amount
of reserves for unreported losses is estimated by analysis of historical and
statistical information. Historical data includes 11.25 years that Crusader has
been in operation and the data from its general agent developed with other
insurance companies prior to 1985. Since the ultimate liability of Crusader may
be greater or less than estimated reserves, all reserves are constantly
monitored and adjusted. Reserves for loss adjustment expenses are estimated to
cover the direct costs associated with specific claims as well as an estimate of
administrative costs.

The process of establishing loss reserves involves significant judgmental
factors. The following table shows the development of the unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses for fiscal years 1986 through 1996. The top line of the
table shows the estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses
recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This
liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses
for losses arising in the current and prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date, including the estimated losses that had been incurred but not
reported to the company. The table shows the reestimated amount of the
previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each
succeeding year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information
becomes known.

The table reflects deficiencies in Crusader's loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves from 1986 through 1987 and redundancies thereafter. In January 1988,
the company began a file-by-file revaluation of all open claims and a
revaluation of the estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims
("IBNR") to insure that its reserves were adequate. Reserves on casualty claims
were reestimated on a combination of both the estimated liability and the
potential exposure. In addition, minimum reserves on bodily injury claims were
substantially increased. The minimum reserves are the reserves set up after
coverage is confirmed on a reported claim but before the information is received
to adequately estimate the loss. The minimum reserves are based on the average
of all bodily injury claims incurred. Furthermore, procedures were instituted to
ensure that loss adjustment expense reserves were adequate. This revaluation of
fiscal 1985 through fiscal 1987 open claims was completed in September 1988 and
resulted in significant adjustments to the loss and loss adjustment reserves.

The redundancies in reserves from fiscal 1988 to the present are due to
Crusader's loss reserving practices used in determining its IBNR. Although
redundancies have been reported since fiscal 1988, there is no assurance that
they will continue and the company believes a change in the way it computes IBNR
is not warranted. Crusader is a relatively small insurance company with just
over 10 years of its own statistical experience. The company is constantly
changing its product mix and exposures, including the types of businesses
insured within its business package program as well as its lines of


                                        4

business. In addition, it is regularly expanding its territories both inside 
and outside of California and is growing in premium volume. Considering the 
uncertainties from this changing environment as well as its limited internal 
data and history, the company recognizes the difficulties in developing its 
own unique IBNR statistics and, therefore, it incorporates industry standards 
and averages into its estimates. When Crusader establishes its IBNR reserves, 
although conservative, it is still well below industry average and the 
company believes that it is properly stated. When subsequent development 
justifies changes in IBNR, the company acts accordingly.

When evaluating the information in the following table, it should be noted that
each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts of prior periods and,
therefore, the cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate
change in the estimates over all prior years. Conditions and trends that have
affected development of liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the
future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future
deficiencies or redundancies based on this table.

NET PREMIUM WRITTEN TO POLICYHOLDERS' SURPLUS RATIO

The following table shows, for the periods indicated, Crusader's statutory
ratios of net premiums written to statutory policyholders' surplus. Since each
property and casualty insurance company has different capital needs, an
"acceptable" ratio of net premium written to policyholders' surplus for one
company may be inapplicable to another company. While there is no statutory
requirement applicable to the Company which establishes a permissible net
premium to surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners provide that such ratio should generally be no greater
than 3 to 1.

REGULATION

The insurance company operation is subject to regulation by the California
Department of Insurance ("the insurance department") and also by the department
of insurance of other states in which the company is licensed. The insurance
department has broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers. These
powers relate primarily to the standards of solvency which must be met and
maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature and
limitation of insurers' investments; the prior approval of rates, rules and
forms; the issuance of securities by insurers; periodic examinations of the
affairs of insurers; the annual and other reports required to be filed on the
financial condition and results of operations of such insurers or for other
purposes; and the establishment of reserves required to be maintained for
unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. The regulations and supervision by
the insurance department are designed principally for the benefit of
policyholders and not for the insurance company shareholders. The last
examination of Crusader by the insurance department covered the three years
ending December 31, 1994, and was completed in November of 1995.

In December 1993, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
adopted a Risk-Based Capital ("RBC") Model Law for property and casualty
companies. The RBC Model Law is intended to provide standards for calculating a
variable regulatory capital requirement related to a company's current
operations and its risk exposures (asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk
and off-balance sheet risk). These standards are intended to serve as a
diagnostic solvency tool for regulators that establishes uniform capital levels
and specific authority levels for regulatory intervention when an insurer falls
below minimum capital levels. The RBC Model Law specifies four distinct action
levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority
over a domestic insurer if its RBC is equal to or less than 200% of its computed
authorized control level RBC.

A company's RBC is required to be disclosed in its statutory annual statement.
The RBC is not intended to be used as a rating or ranking tool nor is it to be
used in premium rate making or approval. The company calculated its RBC
requirement as of December 31, 1995 for its 1995, statutory annual statement and
reported that its total adjusted surplus to policyholders was 482% of its
authorized control level RBC.

CALIFORNIA INSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION

In 1969, the California Insurance Guarantee Association ("CIGA") was created
pursuant to California law to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent
insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such
insurers' assets. Crusader is subject to assessment by CIGA for its pro-rata
share of such claims (based on premiums written in the particular line in the
year preceding the

                                        8

<PAGE>

assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in California). Such
assessments are based upon estimates of losses incurred in liquidating an
insolvent insurer. In a particular year, Crusader cannot be assessed an amount
greater than 1% of its premiums written in the preceding year. California
Insurance Code Sections 1063.5 and 1063.14 allow Crusader to recoup assessments
by surcharging policyholders. Crusader was assessed $209,186 by CIGA for the
1995 calendar year, of which it recouped all but $18,431. This unrecouped
portion was charged to other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of
operations. No assessment was made by CIGA for the 1996 calendar year.

HOLDING COMPANY ACT

The Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance department
pursuant to the provisions of the California Insurance Holding Company System
Regulatory Act (the "Holding Company Act"). Pursuant to the Holding Company Act,
the insurance department may examine the affairs of Crusader at any time.
Certain transactions defined to be of an "extraordinary" type may not be
effected without the prior approval of the insurance department. Such
transactions include, but are not limited to, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans
and extensions of credit, and investments made within the immediate preceding 12
months involving in the net aggregate, more than the lesser of 5% of Crusader's
admitted assets or policyholders' surplus, as of the preceding December 31st. An
extraordinary transaction also includes a dividend which, together with other
dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the
greater of 10% of the insurance company's policyholders' surplus as of the
preceding December 31st or the insurance company's net income for the preceding
calendar year. An insurance company is also required to notify the insurance
department of any dividend after declaration, but prior to payment. The Company
is in compliance with the Holding Company Act.

RATING

Crusader has been rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company since its initial
rating in 1990.

                                   INVESTMENTS

The investments of the Company are made by the Company's Chief Financial Officer
under the supervision of an investment committee appointed by the Company's
Board of Directors. The Company's investment guidelines are to maintain the
Company's cash and invested assets in high-grade investments. The Company's
fixed maturity obligations have maturities no greater than eight years and
consist of U.S. treasury securities, high-grade industrial and municipal
obligations, and certificates of deposit. In addition, all investments in
municipal obligations are pre-refunded municipals which are secured by U.S.
treasury securities. The Company's investment in equity securities consists of
common shares in two regional telephone companies. The balance of the Company's
investments are invested in high-grade short-term instruments consisting of bank
money market accounts, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. These
investments are either FDIC insured or are in an institution with a Moody's
rating of P1 and/or Standard & Poor's rating of A1. All of the Company's
investments are readily marketable and could be liquidated without any material
financial impact.

                                   COMPETITION

GENERAL

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis
of price and service and is highly cyclical, characterized by periods of high
premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of
severe price competition and excess capacity.

The profitability of insurers is affected by many factors including rate
competition, the frequency of claims and their average cost, natural disasters,
state regulations, interest rates, crime rates, general business conditions, and
court decisions redefining and expanding the extent of coverage and granting
higher compensation awards. One of the challenging and unique features of the
property and casualty business is the fact that, since premiums are collected
before losses are paid, its products must be priced before its costs are known.

INSURANCE COMPANY AND GENERAL AGENCY OPERATIONS (PROPERTY & CASUALTY)

The Company's property and casualty insurance business continues to be very
competitive. There are many substantial competitors who have larger resources,
operate in more states, insure coverages in more lines and in higher limits than
the Company. The principal method of competition among these competitors is
price. While the Company attempts to meet this competition with competitive
prices, its emphasis is on service, promotion and distribution.

INSURANCE CLAIM ADJUSTING OPERATION

The insurance claim adjusting operation generates all its business from "in-
house production" for non-affiliated insurance companies; thus, competition is
not a major factor as long as U.S. Risk produces a quality product at a fair
price. Its growth is dependent on the growth of the general agency operations
which produce the business. As of January 1, 1994, Crusader began processing its
own claims. This claim processing function had previously been provided by its
sister company, U.S. Risk.

INSURANCE PREMIUM FINANCING OPERATION

The insurance premium financing operation is currently financing Crusader
policies and commercial automobile policies written through Unifax for a non-
affiliated insurer. Although competition is intense in the premium finance
business, the competitive pricing, the quality of its service, and the ease and
convenience of financing with AAC has made its growth and profitability
possible. Its continued growth is dependent on the growth of Crusader and
Unifax.

HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Competition in the health and life insurance business is also intense.
Approximately 84% of the Company's present health and life business is from the
CIGNA HealthCare medical & dental plan programs. This percentage is up from
approximately 80% in the prior year. The company is continuing its efforts to
diversify and offer a wider variety of products to its customers and believes
that this effort will make it more competitive and should increase future
revenues.

                                    EMPLOYEES

On June 14, 1996, the Company employed 139 persons at its facility located in
Woodland Hills, California. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements
and believes its relations with its employees are excellent.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company presently occupies a 46,000 square foot building located at 23251
Mulholland Drive, Woodland Hills, California, under a master lease expiring
March 31, 2007. The lease provides for an annual gross rental of $1,025,952.
Erwin Cheldin, the Company's president, chairman and principal stockholder, is
the owner of the building. On February 22, 1995, the Company signed an extension
to the lease with no increase in rent to March 31, 2007. The terms of the lease
at inception and at the time the lease extension was signed were at least as
favorable to the Company as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

The Company utilizes for its own operations 100% of the space it leases.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company, by virtue of the nature of the business conducted by it, becomes
involved in numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either
plaintiff or defendant. The Company is required to resort to legal proceedings
from time-to-time in order to enforce collection of premiums and other
commissions or fees for the services rendered to customers or to their agents.
These routine items of litigation do not materially affect the Company and are
handled on a routine basis by the Company through its general counsel.

Likewise, the Company is sometimes named as a cross-defendant in litigation
which is principally directed against that insurer who has issued a policy of
insurance directly or indirectly through the Company. Incidental actions are
sometimes brought by customers or other agents which relate to disputes
concerning the issuance or non-issuance of individual policies. These items are
also handled on a routine basis by the Company's general counsel and they do not
materially affect the operations of the Company.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

None.

As of March 31, 1996, the approximate number of shareholders of record of the
Company's common stock was 700. A substantial number of shares of the Company's
stock is held in street name; and, therefore, the actual number of holders of
the Company's common stock exceeds 700.

On June 24, 1991, the Company declared its first cash dividend on its common
stock and has declared dividends annually thereafter. The Company's intention is
to declare annual cash dividends subject to continued profitability and cash
requirements. On May 17, 1996, the Company declared its latest annual cash
dividend of $0.07 per common share payable on August 14, 1996, to shareholders
of record on July 31, 1996.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION


                        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:

Due to the nature of the Company's business (insurance and insurance services)
and whereas Company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of
profits into property or equipment, the cash flow generated from operations
usually results in improved liquidity for the Company.

Crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of
unearned premium reserves, reserves for loss payments, and its capital and
surplus. Crusader's loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most
significant cash flow requirement of the Company. These payments are continually
monitored and projected to ensure that the Company has the liquidity to cover
these payments without the need to liquidate its investments. Cash and
investments (excluding unrealized gains) at March 31, 1996 were $72,700,991
compared to $64,262,794 in the prior year, a 13% increase. Crusader's cash and
investments amounted to $69,332,581 or 95% of the Company's total.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," the Company
is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one
of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading securities.
In the quarter ended March 31, 1995 the company reclassified all of its
securities from held-to-maturity to the available-for-sale category. Although
all of the Company's investments are classified as available-for-sale, the
Company's investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding
high-quality investments.

As of March 31, 1996, the Company had invested $68,085,376 (at amortized cost)
or 94% of its investments in fixed maturity obligations. The balance of the
Company's investments were in equity securities consisting of common shares in
two regional telephone companies and high-quality, short-term investments which
included bank money market accounts, certificates of deposit and commercial
paper. The Company's investments in fixed maturity obligations included
$38,126,835 (56%) of tax-exempt, pre-refunded state and municipal bonds,
$18,191,847 (27%) of U.S. treasury securities, and $11,766,694 (17%) in high-
quality industrial bonds and certificates of deposit. This compares to fixed
maturity obligations in the prior fiscal year of $60,707,261 that included
$41,758,522 (69%) of tax-exempt, pre-refunded state and municipal bonds,
$4,884,350 (8%) of U.S. treasury notes, and $14,064,389 (23%) in high-quality
industrial bonds and certificates of deposit. The tax-exempt interest income
earned (net of bond premium/discount amortization) during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1996, was $1,738,799 compared to $1,898,772 in the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1995.

                                       13
<PAGE>

The Company's investment policy limits investments in any one company to no more
than $1,000,000. This limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par
value and U.S. Government or U.S. Government guaranteed issues. All of the
Company's investments are high grade investment quality.

The Company's premium finance subsidiary, American Acceptance Corporation, has a
bank credit line of $6,000,000 with a variable rate of interest based on
fluctuations in the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). This credit line is
only used to provide American Acceptance Corporation with funds to finance
insurance premiums.

The maximum and average bank note payable and weighted average interest rate are
as follows:

                                        Year Ended     Year Ended
                                         March 31,      March 31,
                                           1996           1995
                                        ----------     ----------

     Maximum bank note payable          $3,975,001     $4,467,001
     Average bank note payable          $3,388,334     $4,229,418
     Weighted average interest rate            7.7%           7.2%

Although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings,
the Company believes that its cash and short-term investments at year end, net
of trust restriction of $2,465,923, statutory deposits of $725,000, and dividend
restriction between Crusader and Unico (as discussed under "Insurance Company
Operation - Holding Company Act") plus the cash to be generated from operations,
should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements (excluding AAC's credit
line discussed above) during the next twelve months without the necessity of
borrowing funds.

On June 15, 1995, the Company repaid from its cash flow the remaining $500,000
of its related party debt. This debt was incurred by Unico in June of 1992 to
increase Crusader's surplus following the Los Angeles riot.

Crusader's statutory capital and surplus as of March 31, 1996, was $22,721,183,
an increase of $3,135,344 from the surplus balance at March 31, 1995, of
$19,585,839. 


There are no material commitments for capital expenditures as of
the date of this report.

                              RESULTS OF OPERATION:

GENERAL

The Company had net income after taxes of $5,947,481 for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1996, compared to $3,792,179 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995,
and net income of $3,521,787 for fiscal year ended March 31, 1994. Total revenue
for the year ended March 31, 1996, was $42,468,474 compared to $39,444,223 and
$32,979,913 for the years ended March 31, 1995, and 1994 respectively.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, income before taxes increased by
$3,450,614 (70%) and net income increased by $2,155,302 (57%) compared to the
prior fiscal year. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase
of $2,175,220 in the pre-tax underwriting profit (net earned premium less loss
and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs) from Crusader, an
increase in investment income of $545,783 (16%) (excluding realized gains), a
decrease in other operating expenses of $451,145 (12%), and an increase in gross
commissions and fees of $192,311 (3%). 


For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, income before taxes decreased by 
$90,495 (2%) while net income increased by $270,392 (8%) compared to the 
prior fiscal year. Although total investment income increased by $66,943 
(2%), tax-exempt investment income increased by $798,586 (73%) which resulted 
in a tax benefit of approximately $231,000. The increase in net income was 
due primarily to this tax benefit.

The effect of inflation on the net income of the Company during the year ended
March 31, 1996, was not significant.

The Company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below:

</TABLE>



Gross written premium decreased by $1,408,192 (4%) in the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1996, compared to an increase of $1,761,249 (5%) for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1995. The decrease in written premium was primarily attributable
to Crusader's decision to intentionally reduce its Other Liability line in an
effort to improve the utilization of its surplus. Other Liability gross written
premium for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, was $289,364, a $4,679,191
(94%) decrease from the prior fiscal year. The decrease in Other Liability
written premium was offset by growth of $3,304,242 (10%) in Crusader's
Commercial Package business. The Commercial Package premium for the fiscal year
March 31, 1996 totaled $36,960,933 compared to written premium of $33,656,691 in
the prior fiscal year. The Commercial Package line is Crusader's primary line of
business and represents approximately 98% of its total premiums written. The
increase in gross written premiums in the Commercial Package line was primarily
due to increases in premiums in states outside of California. Gross premiums
written in Washington, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada increased $2,318,626 (46%) to
$7,341,329 while gross written premiums in California increased $977,207 (3%) to
$29,619,604. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1995, the increase in gross
written premium was primarily the result of an increase of $5,993,669 (22%) in
the company's Commercial Package business to $33,656,691. This increase was
offset by a $3,831,980 (44%) decrease in the company's Other Liability line of
business. The company began its deliberate reduction of Other Liability premium
in fiscal year 1995.

Crusader's net earned premium was $31,477,427, an increase of $2,269,137 (8%)
when compared to net earned premium in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1995.
The increase in net earned premium was primarily the result of a decrease in
earned ceded premium in the current fiscal year. The percentage of earned
premium ceded to premium earned for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, was
16%. This compares to 24% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, and 28% for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994. The decrease in the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1996, compared to March 31, 1995, was primarily attributable to a
reduction in Crusader's Other Liability line of business which cedes a higher
percentage of premium than its other lines, and to an increase in loss retention
from $100,000 to $150,000 on April 1, 1995. The decrease in fiscal year ended
March 31, 1995 compared to March 31, 1994 was primarily attributable to the
reduction in Crusader's Other Liability line of business.

The combined ratio is the sum of (1) the ratio of losses and loss adjustment
expenses incurred (including a provision for incurred but not reported losses)

competition, the company's ability to introduce new profitable products, and its
ability to expand geographically. Crusader is currently licensed as an admitted
insurance company in the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington and is approved as a non-admitted surplus lines writer in several
other states. Crusader is currently writing in all the states in which it is
licensed.

DAILY AUTOMOBILE RENTAL INSURANCE PROGRAM

The daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by Bedford. Bedford
receives a commission and a claim administration fee from a non-affiliated
insurance company based on premium written. Commission and fee income from the
daily automobile rental insurance program are as follows:

                                           Fiscal Year Ended March 31,

       administration fee            $871,841       $756,162       $695,330

Revenues during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, increased 15% from the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1995. Revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1995, increased 9% from the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994.

Although the daily automobile rental insurance program experienced an increase
in commission and fee income in the current and prior fiscal years, price
competition remains intense in this market. To avoid underwriting losses for the
non-affiliated insurance company which Bedford represents, it continues to
produce business only at rates which it believes to be adequate. The company
cannot determine how long this "soft market" condition will continue.

COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PROGRAM

NCC renews and services existing commercial automobile and personal automobile
physical damage policies in California for a non-affiliated insurer. NCC
receives a commission and claim administration fee from a non-affiliated
insurance company based on premium written; however, NCC plans to discontinue
these programs. Unifax produces commercial auto policies in California for a
non-affiliated insurer and receives a commission from them based on premium
written. Unifax and NCC also receive a service fee from the policyholder.

the prior fiscal year while revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995,
increased $17,699 (7%) from the prior fiscal year.

Unifax commission and fee income on this program was $166,189 in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1996, compared to $233,267 in the fiscal year ended March 31,
1995, and $205,937 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994. NCC commission and
fee income was $17,330 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, compared to
$23,849 in the year ending March 31, 1995, and $34,139 in the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1994. By increasing its marketing effort, Unifax intends to increase
revenues on this program.

HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE PROGRAM

Commission income from the health and life insurance sales of NIB and AIB are as
follows:

                                                 Fiscal Year Ended March 31,
                                               1996         1995         1994
                                               ----         ----         ----

     Commission income                     $2,539,802   $2,467,003   $2,697,681

NIB and AIB market health and life insurance through non-affiliated insurance
companies for individuals and groups. Approximately 84% of the health and life
commission income in the current fiscal year is from the CIGNA HealthCare
medical and dental plan programs compared to approximately 79% in the prior
fiscal year. Revenue for the year ended March 31, 1996, increased by 3% from the
prior fiscal year compared to a decrease in revenues of 9% for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1995 compared to March 31, 1994.

The increase in revenues in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, was primarily
due to an increase in sales of policies covering individual and family members
resulting from rate reductions in March 1995 and July 1995 which made the
products more competitive. The increase in sales is also due to aggressive
marketing of quality products to customers along with outstanding customer
service. Because of the intense competition among carriers for small groups (as
discussed below), many carriers have begun an incentive program to increase
business. These incentives are based on business written and retained for a
minimum of one year. The incentive program for the company began in October
1994. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, $31,575 was earned on this
incentive program. Future incentive, if any, cannot yet be determined.

The decrease in the health and life revenues in the fiscal year ended March 31,
1995, was due to changes in the commission structure resulting from intense rate
competition and the effects of the recession in California. Regulations on
California health care medical providers to small businesses of 5 to 50
employees became effective on July 1, 1993 (AB 1672). In July, 1995, small
businesses with as few as 3 employees became covered by these regulations. These
regulations among other things created an alliance of health insurance companies
called the Health Insurance Plan of California ("HIPC"). There are currently 22
insurance companies in the alliance, and this number is expected to increase.
The premiums charged by the companies in the alliance were approved by the State
of California and are very competitive. To meet this competition, insurance
companies marketing programs outside of HIPC are forced to lower their rates and
costs. Insurance carriers are paying lower commissions to keep their rates low
and competitive. The health insurance market for small business has become a
level playing


                                       17
<PAGE>


field because the rates charged by any California health insurance carrier are
the same rates charged by all their administrators and general agents.
Therefore, the health insurance rates charged by the company are the same rates
charged by its competitors. The impact of these regulations on the company was
and will continue to be, lower revenues from reduced sales on its small business
group programs.

Individual medical programs are not covered by AB 1672 and all of the company's
major insurance carriers have now provided the company with individual medical
insurance programs. The company is now marketing these individual programs and
anticipates growth in this area. The company is also continuing its efforts to
provide more choices to its customers by offering a wide variety of products and
expanding its marketing area.

NIB and AIB currently market health and life insurance for the following
companies:

ASSOCIATION OPERATION

Membership and fee income from the Association program of AAQHC is as follows:

                                                 Fiscal Year Ended March 31,
                                               1996         1995         1994

Membership and fee income                    $277,754     $222,271     $270,630

The increase in membership and fee income in the fiscal year ending March 31,
1996, was attributed to an increase in individual and family members in the
Association. Membership income had decreased in the prior fiscal year as a
result of a decrease in membership in the Association.

PREMIUM FINANCE PROGRAM

Premium finance charges and late fees earned from financing policies are as
follows:

                                                Fiscal Year Ended March 31,
                                              1996         1995         1994

American Acceptance Corporation, the Company's insurance premium finance
subsidiary, provides premium financing to Crusader and to a non-affiliated
insurer on commercial auto policies produced by Unifax. AAC is continuing to
finance approximately 85% of those Crusader policies which are financed. Since
this program is financing only policies produced by Unifax, the further growth
of this program is dependent and directly related to the growth of Crusader's
written premium and the commercial auto program produced by Unifax.

SERVICE FEE INCOME

Unifax sells and services insurance policies for Crusader. The service fee
charged to the policyholder by Unifax is recognized as income in the
consolidated financial statements. The commissions paid by Crusader to Unifax
are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected in commission
income or commission expense.

Service fee income from Unifax is as follows:

Service fee income is primarily related to the number of policies written by
Unifax.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment income consists of interest, dividends and net realized investment
gain as follows:

                                               Fiscal Year Ended March 31,

                                        ----------     ----------     ----------

Investment interest and dividends earned (excluding net realized gains)
increased approximately 16% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996,
compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in invested assets (at amortized value) of $8,457,083 (13%) and, to a
lesser extent, to the mix of taxable and tax-exempt securities in the portfolio.
The mix of tax-exempt investments to total investments decreased from
$41,758,522 (65%) to $38,126,835 (53%) at March 31, 1996. Tax-exempt securities
carry a lower pre-tax yield than equivalent rated taxable securities.

Investment interest and dividends earned (excluding net realized gains)
increased approximately 2% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, compared to
the prior fiscal year. Although total invested assets (at amortized value)
increased $10,090,333 (19%) during that period, investment income only increased
slightly due to maturing investments being invested at lower yields (due to the
general decline in yields in the marketplace) and the increase in tax exempt
investments. The mix of tax-exempt investments to total investments increased
from $34,118,102 (63%) at March 31, 1994, to $41,758,522 (65%) at March 31,
1995.

Additional information regarding investments and investment income are described
in the "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

OPERATING EXPENSES

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS consist of commissions, premium taxes, inspection fees,
and certain other underwriting costs which are related to and vary with the
production of Crusader insurance policies. These costs include both Crusader
expenses and allocated expenses of other Unico subsidiaries. On


                                       19
<PAGE>


certain reinsurance treaties, Crusader receives a ceding commission from its
reinsurer which represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to
the premium ceded. Policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission, are
deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned. Policy acquisition
costs, net of ceding commission, are as follows:

                                               Fiscal Year Ended March 31,
                                           1996           1995          1994

SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS decreased $40,214 (1%) during the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1996, compared with an increase of $102,097 (3%) in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1995.

     Salaries and employee benefits     $3,684,989     $3,725,203    $3,623,106

COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS/BROKERS (not including commissions on Crusader policies
which are reflected in policy acquisition costs) are generally related to gross
commission income. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996, commission
expense decreased $28,921 (2%).

                                               Fiscal Year Ended March 31,

     Commissions to agents/brokers      $1,328,672     $1,357,593    $1,293,015

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES generally do not change significantly with changes in
production. This is true for both increases and decreases in production. Other
operating expenses decreased $451,145 (12%) during the fiscal year ended March
31, 1996, compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to
a decrease in interest and legal expenses. Included in the prior fiscal year was
a $300,000 provision for interest due the Internal Revenue Service relating to
the tax effect from timing differences of loss reserve deductions in prior
years. Legal expenses declined in the current fiscal by $110,644.

Other operating expenses increased $459,888 (15%) during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1995, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994, as a result of
a $300,000 interest expense provision to the Internal Revenue Service (discussed
above) and an increase of $74,579 in interest expense from the Company's premium
finance operation.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors
Unico American Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unico American
Corporation and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996, and 1995 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1996. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Unico
American Corporation and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996, and 1995 and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB")
Statement No. 115 ("Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities") in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994.

                                   AND SUBSIDIARIES

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS
Unico American Corporation is an insurance holding company.  Unico American
Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned (the "Company"),
provides primarily in California, property, casualty, health and life insurance
and related premium financing.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Unico American
Corporation and its subsidiaries.   All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As described in Note 17, the
Company's insurance subsidiary also files financial statements with regulatory
agencies prepared on a statutory basis of accounting which differs from
generally accepted accounting principles.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  While every effort is made to ensure the
integrity of such estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.

INVESTMENTS
The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 115 ("Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities") in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994. 
Statement No. 115 requires investments in all debt securities and equity securi-
ties to be classified in one of three categories: held-to-maturity securities,
available-for-sale securities and trading securities.  Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost.   Available-for-sale securities are
recorded at market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity.  Trading securities are recorded at market
value with unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings.  At the time the
Company adopted FASB Statement No. 115, all of its fixed income securities were
classified as held-to-maturity. 

The Company reclassified all of its fixed maturity securities as 
available-for-sale beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 1995.  This 
transaction did not have a material effect on the Company's financial 
statements.  Although all of the Company's fixed maturity investments are 
classified as available-for-sale and are stated at market value, the 
Company's investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding 
high-quality investments.  Short-term investments are carried at cost, which 
approximates market value. 

Market value for fixed maturities are obtained from a national quotation
service.  Market value for equity securities are determined by quotations on
national securities exchanges.  When a decline in the value of a fixed maturity
or equity security is considered other than temporary, a loss is recognized in
the consolidated statement of operations.   Realized gains and losses are
included in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the specific
identification method. 

The Company had net unrealized investment gains of $531,787 as of March 31,
1996, and net unrealized investment losses of $177,098 as of March 31, 1995.

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using accelerated depreciation methods over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets.

INCOME TAXES 
The provision for federal income taxes is computed on the basis of income as
reported for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting
principles.   Deferred income taxes arise principally from certain revenues and
expenses which are recognized for income tax in different periods than for
financial statements.  Effective April 1, 1993, the Company changed its method
of accounting for income taxes from the "deferred" method to the "asset and
liability" method required by FASB Statement No.  109.   Under the "asset and
liability" method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and
are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when
the differences are expected to reverse.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

a.  GENERAL AGENCY OPERATIONS
Commissions and service fees due the Company are recognized as income on the
effective date of the insurance policies. 


b.  INSURANCE COMPANY OPERATIONS 
Premiums are earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies.  
Premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force are recorded as
unearned premiums.   The Company earns a commission on policies that are ceded
to its reinsurers.  This commission is considered earned on a pro-rata basis
over the terms of the policies.  Ceding commission applicable to the unexpired
terms of policies in force are recorded as unearned ceding commission which is
included in deferred policy acquisition costs. 

c.  INSURANCE PREMIUM FINANCING OPERATIONS
Premium finance fees are charged to policyholders who choose to finance
insurance premiums.   Fees are charged at rates that vary with the amount of
premium financed.   Premium finance fees are recognized over the term of the
premium note based upon the effective yield.

LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTING EXPENSES
The process of establishing loss reserves involves significant judgmental
factors.  The reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based
on estimates of ultimate claim cost, including claims incurred but not reported.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new
information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary.  Such
adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they
become known.  Management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of
claims, both reported and unreported.

                                           -----------         -----------

    (1)  As required by law, the Company segregates from its operating accounts
         the premiums collected from insurers which are payable to insurance
         companies into separate trust accounts.  These amounts are included in
         cash and short-term investments.

    (2)  Included in fixed maturity investments are statutory deposits assigned
         to and held by the California State Treasurer and the Insurance
         Commissioner of the state of Nevada.   These deposits are required for
         writing certain lines of business in California and for admission in
         states other than California.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

Policy acquisition costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with
the production of insurance policies such as commissions, premium taxes and
certain other underwriting expenses which vary with and are primarily related to
the production of the insurance policy.  Policy acquisition costs are deferred
and amortized as the related premiums are earned and are limited to their
estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums plus
investment income less anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses.

REINSURANCE

The Company cedes reinsurance to provide for greater diversification of
business, to allow management to control exposure to potential losses arising
from large risks by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of
exposure, to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes, and to provide
additional capacity for growth.  Prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance
receivables are reported as assets and represent ceded unearned premiums and
reinsurance recoverable on both paid and unpaid losses, respectively.   Amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim
liability associated with the reinsured policies.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to
the current year presentation.

NOTE 2 - ADVANCE PREMIUMS"      


Unico subsidiaries selling auto, health, life and dental insurance policies
require payments of premium prior to the effective date of coverage.  To conform
with the above requirement, invoices are sent out as early as two months prior
to the effective date of the policy and payments are received prior to the
policy effective date.  Insurance premiums received by these subsidiaries for
coverage effective after the balance sheet date are recorded as advance
premiums.

may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.
Short-term investments have an initial maturity of one year or less and consist
of the following:

                                                   ---------         ---------

The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a minimum since the
receivables are secured by unearned premiums and funds held as security for
performance.  Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1996 and
1995 was $38,815 and $51,042 respectively.   Premium finance notes receivable
represent the balance due to the Company's premium finance subsidiary from
policyholders who elect to finance their premiums over the policy term.   These
notes are net of unearned finance charges. 

NOTE 5 - DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

Deferred policy acquisition costs, net of ceding commission, consist of
commissions, premium taxes, inspection fees, and certain other underwriting
costs which are related to and vary with the production of Crusader Insurance
Company policies.   These costs are incurred by Crusader and include allocated
expenses of other Unico subsidiaries.  Policy acquisition costs are deferred and
amortized as the related premiums are earned.  Deferred acquisition costs are
reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including
investment income.

NOTE 10 - NOTE PAYABLE - BANK"

American Acceptance Corporation ("AAC"), the Company's premium finance
subsidiary, has a line of credit with Union Bank which can be used only to fund
its premium finance operation.  This line of credit was increased from
$5,000,000 to $6,000,000 in December 1994.  Interest on the note is referenced
to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").  The note amount is
collateralized by the assets of AAC and is guaranteed by the Company.  The loan
agreement contains certain covenants including restrictions on certain
transactions between AAC and the Company and the maintenance of certain
financial ratios.   The note matures August 31, 1996, and is expected to be
renewed.  The terms of the note call for monthly payments of interest only.  
The interest rate at March 31, 1996, was 7.16%

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 12 - CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

The Company, by virtue of the nature of the business conducted by it, becomes
involved in numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either
plaintiff or defendant. The Company is required to resort to legal proceedings
from time-to-time in order to enforce collection of premiums and other
commissions or fees for the services rendered to customers or to their agents.  
These routine items of litigation do not materially affect the Company and are
handled on a routine basis by the Company through its general counsel.

Likewise, the Company is sometimes named as a cross-defendant in litigation
which is principally directed against that insurer who has issued a policy of
insurance directly or indirectly through the Company.  Incidental actions are
sometimes brought by customers or other agents which relate to disputes
concerning the issuance or non-issuance of individual policies.  These items are
also handled on a routine basis by the Company's general counsel and they do not
materially affect the operations of the Company. Management is confident that
the ultimate outcome of pending litigation should not have an adverse effect on
the Company's consolidated operation or financial position.

NOTE 13 - LEASE COMMITMENT 

The Company presently occupies a 46,000 square foot building located at 23251
Mulholland Drive, Woodland Hills, California, under a master lease expiring
March 31, 2007.  The total rent expense under this lease agreement was
$1,025,952 for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 1996; March 31, 1995;
and March 31, 1994.

The lease provides for the following minimum annual rental commitments:

Fiscal Year Ending    
- ------------------
March 31, 1997                                     $  1,025,952

March 31, 2002 (through March 31, 2007)            $  6,155,712
                                                     ----------
Total minimum payments                             $ 11,285,472

                                                     ----------

Erwin Cheldin, the Company's president, chairman and principal stockholder is
the owner of the building. On February 22, 1995, the Company signed an extension
to the lease with no increase in rent to March 31, 2007.   The terms of the
lease at inception and at the time the lease extension was signed, were at least
as favorable to the Company as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.   The Company utilizes for its own operations 100% of the space it
leases.

NOTE 14 - REINSURANCE

A reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurance company transfers (cedes) a
portion of its exposure on business written by it to a reinsurer which assumes
that risk for a premium (ceded premium).  Reinsurance does not legally discharge
the company from primary liability under its policies; and if the reinsurer
fails to meet the obligations, the company must nonetheless pay its policy
obligations.   The company continually monitors and evaluates the liquidity and
financial strength of its reinsurers to determine their ability to fulfill
obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts.

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 - REINSURANCE (continued)

Crusader has reinsurance agreements with National Reinsurance Corporation, a
California admitted reinsurance company, which helps protect it against
liabilities in excess of certain retentions, including major or catastrophic
losses which may occur from any one or more of the property and/or casualty
risks which Crusader insures.   In August 1992 Crusader purchased additional
catastrophe reinsurance from various California admitted reinsurance companies. 
Crusader's retention increased from $100,000 to $150,000 per risk on April 1,
1995.  This retention is subject to a maximum dollar amount and to catastrophe
and clash covers.  The catastrophe and clash covers (subject to a maximum
occurrence and annual aggregate amount) help protect the company from one loss
occurrence affecting multiple policies. The premium ceded to the reinsurers for
the catastrophe and clash covers and for all exposures over $500,000 is a fixed
percentage of the premium charged by Crusader.  On exposures up to $500,000, the
reinsurer charges a provisional rate which is subject to adjustment and is based
on the amount of losses ceded, limited by a maximum percentage that can be
charged by the reinsurer.  On most of the premium that Crusader cedes to the
reinsurer, the reinsurer pays a commission to Crusader, which includes a
reimbursement of the cost of acquiring the portion of the premium that is ceded.
Crusader does not currently assume any reinsurance from other insurance
companies.  The company intends to continue obtaining reinsurance although the
availability and cost may vary from time to time.

The effect of reinsurance on premiums written and earned is as follows:

NOTE 15 - CONTINGENCIES

The Company's federal tax returns for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1990,
through March 31, 1994, are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue
Service.  The primary issue of the examination is the loss reserve deductions
for the fiscal years under audit.  Any changes in the these deductions resulting
from the examination would be a temporary difference.  Since any tax increase
from this temporary difference should be offset by a tax decrease in subsequent
years, no tax liability has been accrued. Management estimated and accrued
$300,000 of interest expense in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1995, related
to this temporary difference.


NOTE 16 - PROFIT SHARING PLAN" 

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1986, the Company adopted the Unico
American Corporation Profit Sharing Plan.   Employees who are at least 21 years
of age and have been employed by the Company for at least two years are
participants in the Plan.  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company
annually contributes to the account of each participant an amount equal to a
percentage of the

NOTE 17 - STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

Crusader is required to file an annual statement with state regulatory
authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such
authorities (i.e., statutory basis).   Prescribed statutory accounting practices
include state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules, as well as a
variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC).   Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting
practices not so prescribed.

The NAIC has a project to codify statutory accounting practices, the result of
which is expected to constitute the only source of "prescribed" statutory
accounting practices.   The codification, when completed, will likely change the
definitions of what comprises prescribed as opposed to permitted statutory
accounting practices and may result in changes to the accounting policies that
insurance companies use to prepare the statutory financial statements.

Crusader Insurance Company statutory capital and surplus is as follows:
  As of March 31, 1996                          $22,721,183
  As of March 31, 1995                          $19,585,839

Crusader Insurance Company statutory net income is as follows:
  Fiscal year ended March 31, 1996 $4,639,537
  Fiscal year ended March 31, 1995               $2,661,428
  Fiscal year ended March 31, 1994               $1,287,470

Crusader's statutory capital and surplus was deemed sufficient to support the
insurance premiums written based on guidelines established by the NAIC.

Crusader is restricted in the amount of dividends it may pay to its parent Unico
without prior approval of the California Insurance Department.  Presently,
without prior approval, Crusader may pay a dividend to Unico equal to the
greater of (1) 10% of Crusader's statutory policyholders' surplus or (2)
Crusader's statutory net income for the preceding calendar year.  The maximum
dividend which may be made without prior approval in calendar year 1996 is
$4,113,181.

NOTE 19 - TAXES ON INCOME (continued)" 

The provision for deferred income taxes results from the following temporary
differences between taxable income and income reported in the accompanying
financial statements.

Discount on salvage & subrogation                        8,589           1,727

  Total deferred tax assets                         $3,271,191      $3,008,814
                                                     ---------       ---------

Deferred tax liabilities:

Deferred acquisition costs                          $1,473,461      $1,398,739

                                                     ---------       ---------

  Net deferred tax asset                            $1,523,778      $1,610,075
                                                     ---------       ---------
                                                     ---------       ---------

Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than
not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized.  The amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near
term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are
reduced.

As a California insurance company, Crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on
gross premiums written in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada
and Arizona. The premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes; thus, the
above provision for state taxes does not include the premium tax.

In April 1993 the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109.  The cumulative effect
of this change in accounting for income taxes was immaterial; therefore, there
is no cumulative effect reported in the consolidated statement of operations for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994.   Prior years' financial statements have
not been restated to apply the provisions of FASB Statement No. 109.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
                        ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

Board of Directors
Unico American Corporation

Under date of June 20, 1996, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of
Unico American Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996, and 1995 and
the related consolidated statement of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1996, as
contained in the annual report of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1996.   In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated
financial statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial
statement schedules as listed under Item 14(a)2. These financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.   Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statement schedules
based on our audits.

In our opinion, such schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB")
Statement No.  115 ("Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities") in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994.
