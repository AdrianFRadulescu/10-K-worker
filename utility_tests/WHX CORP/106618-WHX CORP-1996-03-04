                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
OVERVIEW
 
     WHX Corporation ("WHX"), (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the
"Company"), indirectly through Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation ("WPC"), a wholly
owned subsidiary, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation ("WPSC"), a wholly
owned subsidiary of WPC, is the ninth largest domestic integrated steel
manufacturer.
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries were reorganized into a new holding
company structure on July 26, 1994. The steel-related businesses of the Company
(including WPSC) other than Unimast, Inc. ("Unimast") continue to be owned by
WPC, and the other businesses and assets of the Company including Unimast are
owned by WHX. Pursuant to the reorganization, WPC became a wholly owned
subsidiary of WHX. WHX, the new holding company, became the publicly held issuer
for all Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company. In addition, WHX guaranteed WPC's
outstanding 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2003 (the "Senior Notes") and 12 1/4% First
Mortgage Notes due 2000 (the "First Mortgage Notes") as well as certain other
debt of WPC. The transactions were accounted for as a reorganization of entities
under common control. On the merger date, WHX had the same consolidated net
worth as WPC and its subsidiaries prior to the reorganization.
 
     Through two operating units of WPSC, the Steel Division and Wheeling
Corrugating Company ("Wheeling Corrugating") and Unimast, the Company shipped
2.5 million tons of steel products in 1995. In 1995, the Company reported sales
of $1.36 billion and net income of $78.0 million (before preferred stock
dividends of approximately $22.9 million).
 
     The Company's products include hot rolled and cold rolled sheet, and coated
products such as galvanized, prepainted and tin mill sheet. The Company also
manufactures a variety of fabricated steel products including roll formed
corrugated roofing, roof deck, form deck, floor deck, culvert, bridge form and
other products used primarily by the construction, highway and agricultural
markets.
 
     The Company's strategy is to pursue growth in profitability through the
manufacture and sale of value-added steel products, and to moderate the impact
on the Company's earnings during periods of low steel demand. Its strategic
initiatives focus on:
 
     - Expanding internally and through acquisitions into value-added products,
       while reducing the Company's reliance upon basic steel products;
 
     - Deploying and investing in fixed assets that allow for high utilization
       during periods of weak steel demand and expanded volume during periods of
       strong steel demand; and
 
     - Improving the Company's cost structure through prudent capital
       expenditures, productivity increases, business improvement teams and a
       cooperative partnership agreement with its union employees.
 
     Value-added steel products.  The Company seeks to further expand into the
manufacture of processed steel products, such as coated and fabricated steel,
while reducing its reliance upon basic products, such as hot rolled sheet. The
Company believes such products provide higher margins than are found on basic
steel products and are less sensitive to the steel industry cycle. The Company's
Wheeling-Nisshin Inc. joint venture ("Wheeling-Nisshin"), for example, which
commenced operations in 1988 and doubled its capacity in 1993, currently
produces over 600,000 tons annually of galvanized, galvannealed and aluminized
products and used approximately 450,000 tons of the Company's cold rolled sheet
in 1995.
 
     In 1994 and 1995 the Company negotiated several transactions that furthered
its strategy of expansion into higher value-added products. In March 1995 the
Company acquired Unimast, a leading manufacturer of steel framing and related
accessories for residential and commercial building construction with shipments
of approximately 130,000 tons of steel products in 1995. Unimast uses galvanized
steel to manufacture steel framing components for wall, floor and roofing
systems, in addition to other roll formed expanded metal
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   3
 
construction accessories. Unimast also uses non-prime galvanized substrate for a
material portion of its requirements. As such, the Company has an additional
outlet to apply for further processing some portion of its non-prime products.
In December 1994, the Company acquired the Bowman Metal Deck Division of Armco,
Inc. ("Bowman"), which currently utilizes approximately 40,000 tons of the
Company's cold rolled and hot dipped galvanized production annually for
conversion into specialized construction products. In June 1994, the Company
entered into a joint venture with Dong Yang Tinplate Ltd. ("Dong Yang"), a
leading South Korea-based tin plate producer, and Nittetsu Shoji America, a
U.S.-based tin plate importer, to construct and operate a state-of-the-art tin
coating line facility in Belmont County, Ohio with an expected annual capacity
of 250,000 tons. The Company owns 50% of the common stock of the tin mill joint
venture, Ohio Coatings Co., and will supply up to 100% of the steel substrate
used by the facility. The facility is expected to be completed in 1997, at which
time the Company will phase out its existing tin mill production facilities
which currently produce approximately 130,000 tons annually. This will enable
the Company to convert more hot rolled sheet into tin-mill substrate as well as
expand its line of tin-mill product offerings.
 
     The Company's Wheeling Corrugating operations (including Unimast), its
shipments to Wheeling-Nisshin and the Company's tin plating, coating and cold
rolling operations accounted for 1.8 million tons, or approximately 72% of the
Company's shipments, in 1995. The Company believes that as a result of the
higher than average proportion of the Company's output that is further processed
beyond the hot rolled stage, as well as the rationalization of its fixed costs
discussed below, the Company has, in recent years reported higher annual
operating profits on a per ton basis than most of its integrated steel
competitors. However, in 1995 the Company fell behind most of its integrated
steel competitors due to higher costs attributable to the scheduled outage of
its No. 5 Blast Furnace for relining.
 
     Rationalization of fixed costs.  The Company's strategy also focuses on the
minimization of fixed costs and maximization of capacity utilization throughout
the steel industry cycle. Since 1985, the Company's overall steelmaking capacity
has been reduced by 45%, or 2.0 million tons. As a result, the Company's
steelmaking operations are better balanced with its finishing operations,
resulting in capacity that is more efficiently employed. By having capacity at
its 80-inch hot strip mill in excess of its steelmaking capacity, the Company
seeks to take advantage of periods of strong steel demand by purchasing
semi-finished steel from third parties, while better absorbing its fixed costs
in periods of low demand by maintaining full utilization of its steel melting
facilities. The cost efficiencies afforded by this operating configuration
enhance the Company's ability to produce a low cost product. In furtherance of
this strategy, in September 1994 the Company entered into a joint venture with
ISPAT Mexicana, S.A.De C.V.("ISPAT"), whereby ISPAT sells to the joint venture
slabs it produces in Mexico and Canada, for conversion at the Company's
facilities in Steubenville, Ohio. The joint venture converts the slabs into hot
rolled products which are marketed by the Company to third-party trade
customers. The joint venture provides the Company greater flexibility in
supplying slabs to the Company's 80-inch hot strip mill in times of high steel
demand as well as during blast furnace outages.
 
     Improving cost structure.  The Company continually seeks to improve its
cost structure and product quality through capital expenditures, productivity
increases, business improvement teams and a Cooperative Partnership Agreement
("CPA") with its union employees. In the past five years, the Company has spent
in excess of $404 million in capital expenditures to modernize and upgrade its
facilities, including upgrades to its cold rolling mills at its Allenport,
Pennsylvania and Yorkville, Ohio facilities in 1991 and 1993, respectively, and
the modernization of its 80-inch hot strip mill at Steubenville, Ohio in 1993.
The Company spent approximately $83 million in 1995, which included
approximately $42 million of the $54 million reline of its No. 5 blast furnace
in Steubenville, Ohio. The reline increased the productivity of the No. 5 Blast
Furnace and provided the Company with the ability to produce 100% of the hot
metal necessary to satisfy caster production requirements from a two, rather
than three, blast furnace configuration. This allowed the Company to idle one
blast furnace and to possibly idle in the future its older and less efficient
coke ovens, which the Company believes will result in a material reduction in
future capital expenditure requirements and manning levels.

     Hot Rolled Products.  Hot rolled coils represent the least processed of the
Company's finished goods. Approximately 72% of the Company's 1995 production of
hot rolled coils was further processed internally into value-added finished
products such as cold-rolled coils. The balance of the tonnage is sold as
hot-rolled black or pickled (acid cleaned) coils to a variety of consumers such
as converters/processors and steel service centers and the automotive and
appliance industries. The converters/processors transform the hot-rolled coil
into a finished product such as pipe and tubing, while the service centers
typically slit or cut the material to
 
                                        3

size for resale to the end user. In July 1993, the Company completed a $39
million modernization of its 80-inch hot strip mill located at Steubenville,
Ohio. The Steubenville project included installation of a coil box and gauge
controls that improved gauge, shape and physical characteristics on all tonnage
passing through the hot strip mill.
 
     From 1991 to 1995, the Company reduced its shipments of hot rolled products
from 38.5% to 28.3% of its total product mix. Management projects a further
reduction in such percentage as resources are deployed to expand the Company's
downstream operations.
 
     Cold Rolled Products.  Cold-rolled coils are manufactured from hot rolled
coils by employing a variety of processing techniques, including pickling, cold
reduction, annealing and temper rolling. Cold rolled processing is designed to
reduce the thickness and improve the shape, surface characteristics and
formability of the product. In its finished form, the product may be sold to a
variety of end users such as appliance or automotive manufacturers or further
processed internally into corrosion-resistant coated products including
hot-dipped galvanized, electrogalvanized, or tin line products. In recent years,
the Company has increased its cold rolled production to support increased sales
to Wheeling-Nisshin, the expansion of Wheeling Corrugating and third-party sales
of its hot-dipped and electrogalvanized products.
 
     In May 1991, the Company completed an upgrade to its Allenport facility at
a cost of approximately $27 million that increased the productivity and
efficiency of Allenport's cold rolling mill. As the Allenport facility provides
substrate for the first line at Wheeling-Nisshin, that upgrade has enhanced the
Company's ability to support its supply commitments to Wheeling-Nisshin. To
further lower operating costs and improve its cost competitiveness, the Company
installed tension levelers at a cost of $13 million at its Yorkville and Martins
Ferry facilities. In 1992, the Company also undertook a $29 million automatic
gauge control project at its Yorkville cold rolling facility similar to that
undertaken at Allenport. This modernization, completed in 1993, has improved the
quality and productivity of the Yorkville tandem mill, which supplies a large
portion of the substrate for the second Wheeling-Nisshin line and tin and
galvanized products to the trade. Although both cold mills have been
substantially upgraded, each is relatively older compared to competitors'
facilities. The Company intends to continue to improve its cold-rolling
facilities to remain competitive, particularly as it pursues a strategy of
shifting product to higher value-added applications.
 
     Coated Products.  The Company manufactures a number of corrosion-resistant,
zinc-coated products including hot-dipped galvanized sheets for resale to trade
accounts and to support the fabricating operations of Wheeling Corrugating. The
coated products are manufactured from a steel substrate of cold rolled or hot
rolled pickled coils by applying zinc to the surface of the material to enhance
its corrosion protection. The Company's trade sales of hot dipped galvanized
products are heavily oriented to unexposed applications, principally in the
appliance, construction, service center and automotive markets. Typical industry
applications include auto underbody parts, refrigerator backs and heating/air
conditioning ducts. Approximately 57% of hot dipped galvanized production
tonnage is transferred to Wheeling Corrugating for further processing. The
Company's hot dipped galvanized lines are older than those of certain of its
competitors and will require ongoing capital expenditures to remain competitive.
The Company also produces and sells electrogalvanized products for applications
in the appliance and construction markets. Unimast, which was acquired in March
1995, uses galvanized steel to manufacture steel framing components for wall,
floor and roofing systems.
 
     Tin Mill Products.  Tin mill products consist of tinplate and blackplate,
which products are utilized principally in the manufacture of food, beverage,
general line and aerosol containers. Blackplate is a cold rolled substrate
(uncoated) the thickness of which is less than .0142 inches and is utilized
extensively in the manufacture of pails and shelving. Tinplate is produced by
the electro-deposition of tin to a blackplate substrate. While the majority of
the Company's sales of these products is concentrated in a variety of container
markets, the Company also markets products for automotive applications, such as
oil filters and gaskets. The Company's participation in Ohio Coatings may enable
it to expand the Company's presence in the tin plate market. Ohio Coatings' $69
million tin coating mill, expected to commence operations in 1997, will have a
nominal annual capacity of 250,000 net tons. The Company will supply up to 100%
of the substrate requirements of the joint venture at market prices. The Company
and Nittetsu Shoji America, a U.S. based tin plate importer ("NSA") will act as
the distributors of the joint venture's products.

WHEELING CORRUGATING (FABRICATED PRODUCTS)
 
     Wheeling Corrugating is a leading fabricator of roll-formed products for
the construction, highway, and agricultural products industries. In conjunction
with the Company's business strategy of expanding its sales of higher
value-added products, Wheeling Corrugating has increased its shipments of
fabricated products by approximately 145% since 1984. Following the
establishment of its Lenexa, Kansas and Minneapolis, Minnesota locations,
Wheeling Corrugating expanded its regional operations, through acquisitions, in
Houston, Texas (1986), Fort Payne, Alabama (1989), Wilmington, North Carolina
(1993), Gary, Indiana and Warren, Ohio (1994). The regional presence of these
facilities has enabled Wheeling Corrugating to take advantage of low-cost barge
freight from the Company's Ohio Valley plants and to provide customers in the
outlying areas with competitive services through "just-in-time delivery." In
some of its product lines, Wheeling Corrugating has substantial market share and
therefore has increased opportunity to pursue higher profit margins. Wheeling
Corrugating intends to expand the manufacture, marketing and sale of products in
which it already has a significant market presence, including through potential
acquisitions and to take advantage of expected improvements in demand for
construction and highway products. The acquisition of Unimast with facilities in
Franklin Park, Illinois; Warren, Ohio; Morrow, Georgia and Boonton, New Jersey
will assist the Company in expanding its market presence in these areas. The
Company believes that it would be difficult for a competitor to replicate
Wheeling Corrugating's geographical breadth. The following table sets forth
certain shipment information relating to Wheeling Corrugating's major product
categories:

     Construction Products.  Construction products consist of roll-formed
sheets, which are utilized in the non-residential building market such as
commercial, institutional and manufacturing. They are classified into three
basic categories. Roof decking is a formed steel sheet, painted or galvanized
product, which provides structural support in non-residential roofing systems.
Form deck is a formed steel sheet, painted, galvanized or uncoated, that
provides structural form support for structural or insulating concrete slabs in
non-residential floor or roofing systems. Composite floor deck is a formed steel
sheet, painted, galvanized or uncoated, that provides structural form support
and positive reinforcement for structural concrete slabs in non-residential
floor systems. Unimast manufactures steel framing components for wall, floor and
roofing systems, in addition to other roll formed expanded metal construction
accessories.
 
     Highway Products.  Highway products consist of three classifications of
material that are designed to service the highway construction industry. Culvert
products are hot dipped galvanized sheets and coils which are produced
predominantly from a hot-rolled pickled substrate. Such products are marketed to
independent manufacturers of corrugated culvert pipe. Culvert pipe is spiral
formed or riveted corrugated pipe which is used for highway drainage
applications or in site preparation for homes, light buildings, and shopping
malls. Bridge form is roll-formed corrugated sheets which are swedged on both
ends and are utilized as concrete support forms in the construction of highway
bridges.
 
     Agricultural Products.  Agricultural products consist of roll-formed,
corrugated sheets which are used as roofing and siding in the construction of
barns, farm machinery enclosures and light commercial buildings. The products
can be manufactured from plain hot-dipped galvanized coils or from painted coils
employing a zinc-coated base steel. Historically, these products have been sold
primarily in rural areas. In recent years, however, such products have found
increasing acceptance in light commercial buildings.
 
                                        5

     Other.  Other products include a variety of hardened and non-hardened cut
nails sold under the trademark Labelle. These products are used for a number of
general construction applications including hardwood flooring work, masonry work
and boat building. Hot-rolled sheet is employed as the base steel in the
manufacture of such products.
 
     Wheeling Corrugating represented 32.6% or $444 million of the Company's net
sales in 1995. Management intends to continue to expand Wheeling Corrugating
through the acquisition of fabricating facilities that manufacture products
comparable or closely related to those of Wheeling Corrugating. The Company
intends to continue to expand its emphasis on value-added products.
 
WHEELING-NISSHIN
 
     The Company has a 35.7% equity interest in Wheeling-Nisshin, which
commenced commercial operations in April 1988. Shipments by Wheeling-Nisshin of
hot dipped galvanized, galvannealed and aluminized products, principally to the
construction industry, have increased from 158,600 tons in 1988 to 651,153 tons
in 1995.
 
     In March 1993, Wheeling-Nisshin added a second hot-dipped galvanizing line,
which increased its capacity by 67%, to approximately 600,000 annual tons and
allows Wheeling-Nisshin to offer the lightest-gauge galvanized sheet products
manufactured in the United States for the construction, heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning ("HVAC") and after-market automotive applications. Shipments of
cold-rolled steel by the Company to Wheeling-Nisshin in 1995 were approximately
450,000 tons or 17.9% of the Company's total tons shipped. The increase in
shipments of cold-rolled sheet have reduced the Company's shipments of hot-
rolled coils (a lower-margin steel product) and is an integral part of the
Company's strategy of increasing its presence in higher value-added products.
 
     The Company's amended and restated supply agreement with Wheeling-Nisshin
expires in 2013. Pursuant to the amended supply agreement, the Company will
provide not less than 75% of Wheeling-Nisshin's steel substrate requirements, up
to an aggregate maximum of 9,000 tons per week subject to product quality
requirements. Pricing under the supply agreement is negotiated quarterly based
on a formula which gives effect to competitive market prices.
 
OTHER STEEL RELATED OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY
 
     The Company owns an electrogalvanizing facility which had revenues of $41.7
million while providing an outlet for 51,500 tons of steel in 1995 and a
facility that produces oxygen and other gases used in the Company's steel-making
operations. The Company is the owner of coal reserves that have generated an
average of $1.1 million in annual royalties from 1991 to 1995. The Company is
also a 12 1/2% equity partner in an iron ore mining partnership.
 
NON-STEEL RELATED INVESTMENTS OF THE COMPANY
 
     The Company made the following non-steel related acquisitions. In October
1994, WHX Entertainment Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of WHX, purchased a 50
percent interest in the operations of Wheeling Downs Racing Association
("Wheeling-Downs") from Sportsystems Corporation for $12.5 million.
Wheeling-Downs operates a racetrack and video lottery facility located in
Wheeling, West Virginia.
 
     In 1994, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Radio Corporation ("WPRC"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of WHX, purchased five operating radio stations for $12.0 million. In
late November 1994, ASQ Corporation ("ASQ"), a wholly owned subsidiary of WPRC,
entered into an agreement pursuant to which it acquired the assets and licenses
of an additional six radio stations in the eastern and mid-western United
States. In the second quarter of 1995 WPRC sold substantially all of its radio
assets and recorded a gain of $6.7 million.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
     Through an extensive mix of products, the Company markets to a wide range
of manufacturers, converters and processors. The Company's 10 largest customers
(including Wheeling-Nisshin) accounted for
 
                                        6
<PAGE>   8
 
approximately 40% of its net sales in 1993 and 1994, and 33.3% in 1995.
Wheeling-Nisshin was the only customer to account for more than 10% of net
sales. Wheeling Nisshin accounted for 13.3%, 15.5% and 13.8% of net sales in
1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. Geographically, the majority of the
Company's customers are located within a 350-mile radius of the Ohio Valley.
However, the Company has taken advantage of its river-oriented production
facilities to market via barge into more distant locations such as the Houston,
Texas and St. Louis, Missouri areas. As discussed above, Wheeling Corrugating
has acquired regional facilities to service an even broader geographical area.

</TABLE>
 
     The Company's shipments historically have been concentrated within six
major market segments. The ability to offer competitively priced fabricated
products allows the Company to service a diverse customer base and maintain
relatively stable shipments (at virtually 100% of practical melting capacity
since 1987) even in periods of low steel demand. The Company's overall
participation in the construction and the converters/processors markets
substantially exceeds the industry average and its reliance on automotive
shipments as a percentage of total shipments is substantially less than the
industry average. Set forth below is a description of the Company's business
with its major customer categories.
 
     Steel Service Centers.  The Company's shipments to steel service centers
are heavily concentrated in the areas of hot rolled and hot dipped galvanized
coils. Due to increased in-house costs to steel companies during the 1980's for
processing services such as slitting, shearing and blanking, steel service
centers have become a major factor in the distribution of hot rolled products to
ultimate end users. In addition, steel service centers have become a significant
factor in the sale of hot dipped galvanized products to a variety of small
consumers such as mechanical contractors, who desire not to be burdened with
large steel inventories.
 
     Converters/Processors.  The Company's shipments to the
converters/processors market as a percentage of total shipments have grown from
21% in 1991 to 26% in 1995. This growth is principally attributable to the
increase in shipments of full hard and fully finished cold rolled products to
Wheeling-Nisshin, which uses cold rolled coils as a substrate to manufacture a
variety of coated products, including hot dipped galvanized and aluminized coils
for the automotive, appliance and construction markets. As a result of the
second line expansion, the Company's shipments to Wheeling-Nisshin increased
significantly beginning in 1993. The converters/processors industry also
represents a major outlet for the Company's hot rolled products, which are
converted into finished commodities such as pipe, tubing and cold rolled strip.
 
     Construction.  The Company's shipments to the construction industry are
heavily influenced by the sales of Wheeling Corrugating, which services the
non-residential and agricultural building and highway industries, principally
through shipments of hot dipped galvanized and painted cold rolled products.
With its acquisition during the 1980's and early 1990's of regional facilities
in Houston, Texas, Fort Payne, Alabama, and Wilmington, North Carolina and 1994
in Gary, Indiana and Warren, Ohio, Wheeling Corrugating has been able to market
its products into broad geographical areas, which the Company expects will
mitigate the effects
 
                                        7
<PAGE>   9
 
of regional economic downturns in the construction business. The acquisition of
Unimast in March 1995 increased the Company's shipments to the construction
industry and its ability to market its products to broad geographic areas.
Unimast has facilities located in Franklin Park, Illinois; Warren, Ohio; Morrow,
Georgia and Boonton, New Jersey.
 
     Agriculture.  The Company's shipments to the agricultural market are
principally sales of Wheeling Corrugating roll-formed, corrugated sheets which
are used as roofing and siding in the construction of barns, farm machinery
enclosures and light commercial buildings.
 
     Containers.  The vast majority of the Company's shipments to the container
market are concentrated in tin mill products, which are utilized extensively in
the manufacture of food, aerosol, beverage and general line cans. The container
industry has represented a stable market subject to relatively little
recessionary impact. In addition, the Company considers the current balance
between supply and demand for tin mill products as the most favorable of major
product categories within the domestic steel industry. The balance of the
Company's shipments to this market consists of cold rolled products for pails
and drums, and hot-rolled products for steel strapping.
 
     Automotive.  Unlike the majority of its competitors, the Company is not
heavily dependent on shipments to the automotive industry. However, the Company
has established a variety of higher value-added niches in this market,
particularly in the area of hot dipped galvanized products for deep drawn
automotive underbody parts. In addition, the Company has been a supplier of tin
mill products for automotive applications, such as oil filters and gaskets. A
third niche has been the Company's participation in painted electrogalvanized
products for auto draft stripping applications. The Company also markets to the
automotive industry through Wheeling-Nisshin, which is a major supplier of
aluminized sheet for muffler and tailpipe assemblies.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     The Company obtains approximately half of its iron ore from spot and
medium-term purchase agreements at or below prevailing world market prices. It
has commitments for the majority of its blast furnace iron ore pellet needs
through 1996 from suppliers in North America. In 1992 the Company increased its
ownership interest in a mine located in Palmer, Michigan and owned by Empire
Iron Mining Partnership ("Empire") from 10% to 12.5%. The Company is obligated
to purchase approximately 12.5% or 1.0 million gross tons per year (at current
production levels) of the mine's annual ore output. Interest in related ore
reserves as of December 31, 1995, is estimated to be 27.6 million gross tons. In
1995, the Company consumed approximately 2.0 million gross tons of iron ore
pellets in its blast furnaces. The Company is contingently liable for its share
of Empire's liabilities incurred, including principal and interest on long-term
debt. The Company's share of the principal amount of such obligations was
approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 1995, which is payable in December
1996. Debt service payments are made by Empire and the costs are passed on to
its partners. The Company's pro rata cash operating cost of Empire currently
approximates the market price of ore.
 
     In November 1993, the Company sold the operating assets of its coal company
to an unrelated third party. The Company also entered into a long term supply
agreement with such third party to provide the Company with a substantial
portion of the Company's coal requirements at competitive prices. The Company's
operations require a substantial amount of coking coal.
 
     The Company currently produces all of its coke requirements and typically
consumes generally all of the resultant by-product coke oven gas. In 1995,
approximately 1.8 million tons of coking coal were consumed in the production of
blast furnace coke by the Company. Due to the reline of its No. 5 blast furnace,
the Company idled one of its blast furnaces and may possibly idle its older,
less efficient coke ovens. The Company may continue to sell its excess coke and
coke oven by-products to third-party trade customers.
 
     Material amounts of other raw materials, including limestone, oxygen,
natural gas and electricity, are required. These raw materials are readily
available and are purchased on the open market. The Company is presently
dependent on external scrap for approximately 7% of its steel melt. The cost of
these materials has been susceptible in the past to price fluctuations, but
worldwide competition in the steel industry has
 
                                        8
<PAGE>   10
 
frequently limited the ability of steel producers to raise finished product
prices to recover higher material costs. Certain of the Company's raw material
supply contracts provide for price adjustments in the event of increased
commodity or energy prices.
 
BACKLOG
 
     Order backlog was 400,624 net tons at December 31, 1995, compared to
420,900 tons at December 31, 1994. All orders related to the backlog at December
31, 1995 are expected to be shipped during the first half of 1996, subject to
delays at the customers' request. The order backlog represents orders received
but not yet completed or shipped. In times of strong demand, a higher order
backlog may allow the Company to increase production runs, thereby enhancing
production efficiencies.
 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
 
     The Company's capital expenditures (including capitalized interest) for
1995 were approximately $83.3 million, including $5.9 million on environmental
projects. From 1991 to 1995, such expenditures aggregated approximately $404
million. This level of capital expenditures was needed to maintain productive
capacity, improve productivity and upgrade selected facilities to meet
competitive requirements and maintain compliance with environmental laws and
regulations. Since 1985, the Company's capital expenditure program has been and
continues to be aimed at maintaining its core production capabilities and
selectively upgrading product characteristics. The capital expenditure program
has included improvements to the Company's infrastructure, blast furnaces,
steel-making facilities, 80-inch hot strip mill and finishing operations, and
has resulted in improved shape, gauge, surface and physical characteristics for
its products. In particular, the quality improvements completed at the Allenport
cold-rolling facility in 1992 and the installation of automatic gauge controls
at the Yorkville tandem mill in 1993 have enhanced productivity and improved the
quality of substrate provided to Wheeling-Nisshin and other customers.
Continuous and substantial capital and maintenance expenditures will be required
to maintain operating facilities, modernize finishing facilities to remain
competitive and to comply with environmental control requirements. The Company
anticipates funding its capital expenditures in 1996 from cash on hand and funds
generated by operations.
 
ENERGY REQUIREMENTS
 
     During 1995 coal constituted 73% of the Company's total energy consumption,
natural gas 22% and electricity 5%. Many of the Company's major facilities that
use natural gas have been equipped to use alternative fuels. The Company
continually monitors its operations regarding potential equipment conversion and
fuel substitution to reduce energy costs.
 
EMPLOYMENT
 
     Total employment of the Company averaged 5,996 employees during 1995, of
which 4,174 were represented by the USWA, and 86 by other unions. The remainder
consisted of 1,331 salaried employees and 405 non-union operating employees.
 
     The Company and the USWA reached agreement on the terms of its current
labor agreement on March 3, 1994. The principal terms of the labor agreement,
among other things, were hourly wage increases, lump sum bonuses plus a
contingent payment to be paid in May 1996 based on profitability of WPSC in
1995, improvements in severance and defined contribution pension plans, a
negative pledge on WPSC's property, plant and equipment in excess of amounts
permitted to be borrowed under the indenture for the Senior Notes, an agreement
to partially fund retiree medical benefits and the right of the USWA to have a
representative appointed to the Board of Directors of WPC. The Company's current
labor agreement with the USWA expires on October 1, 1996. The USWA has requested
that the Company adopt a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of the
Company's employees represented by the USWA in the next labor agreement. The
cost of adopting such a defined benefit pension plan, or of providing another
form of retirement benefit in excess of the Company's current defined
contribution plan, is not known at this time. If a new labor agreement is not
 
                                        9
<PAGE>   11
 
negotiated before the current contract expires, or if a strike were to occur,
there could be a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results
of operations of the Company.
 
     WPC, as a signatory to the collective bargaining agreement between WPSC and
the USWA, is liable for all obligations under the collective bargaining
agreement, including 100% of WPSC's obligations to provide medical insurance,
life insurance, disability and surviving spouse retirement benefits to WPSC's
retired employees and their dependents ("WPSC Retiree Benefits"). WHX is
contingently liable with respect to a portion of such benefits. WPC also is
bound by certain agreements with the USWA relating to (a) restrictions on
dividends payable to WPC by WPSC to the extent of 50% of the cumulative net
income of WPSC since January 3, 1991, (b) tax sharing arrangements between WPC
and WPSC and (c) a right of first refusal held by the respective employees of
WPSC to purchase, generally, certain of WPSC's facilities in the event of the
proposed sale of such facilities.
 
     The Company provides defined contribution pension programs for both hourly
and salaried employees. The Company annually funds its obligations for each of
the defined contribution plans.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The market for steel in the United States is supplied principally by
domestic integrated steel producers, domestic steel mini-mills and foreign steel
producers. The integrated producers typically operate large plants with annual
capacities of one million tons or more. These plants produce steel from a
combination of iron ore, coke and steel scrap using blast furnaces and basic
oxygen furnaces. Steel mini-mills utilize electric furnaces and are able to
produce steel utilizing primarily ferrous scrap metal as their basic raw
material and serve regional markets. Until recently, technology constraints
limited mini-mills' ability to produce sheet-steel products. However, several
mini-mills now produce sheet products based on a technology known as thin-slab
casting. Mini-mills use steel scrap as a primary raw material. The price of such
scrap fluctuates; during periods when scrap prices are at a high point, the
operating costs of mini-mills may rise in relation to those of integrated mills,
such as the Company.
 
     As the single largest steel consuming country in the western world, the
United States has long been a favorite market of steel producers in Europe and
Japan. Steel producers from emerging economic powers such as Korea, Taiwan, and
Brazil have also recognized the United States as a target market. Many domestic
producers have found it to their advantage to form joint venture operations with
foreign producers as a way to acquire capital, technology and access to
affiliated customers.
 
     The steel industry is cyclical in nature and has been marked historically
by overcapacity, resulting in intense competition among domestic and foreign
producers exporting to the United States. Although domestic industry capacity
has been substantially reduced through strategies such as that of the Company,
overall throughput capacity still significantly exceeds demand, due to
construction of mini-mills and continuing production efficiencies. The result
has been continuing intense competition and price volatility.
 
     Total annual steel consumption in the United States has fluctuated between
88 million and slightly over 100 million tons since the early 1980s. A number of
steel substitutes, including plastics, aluminum, composites and glass, have
reduced the growth of domestic steel consumption.
 
     Steel imports as a percentage of domestic apparent consumption, excluding
semi-finished steel, have been approximately 14% in 1993, 20% in 1994 and 18% in
1995. World steel demand, world export prices, U.S. dollar exchange rates and
the international competitiveness of the domestic steel industry have all been
factors in these import levels. However, the strong performance of the U.S.
economy, relative to weaker economies in Europe and Japan, has resulted in
increased imports in 1994 and 1995.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
     The Company has one raw steel producing plant and various other finishing
and fabricating facilities. The Steubenville plant is an integrated steel
producing facility located at Steubenville and Mingo Junction, Ohio and
Follansbee, West Virginia. It is the Company's only raw steel producing
facility. Facilities include a sinter plant, coke oven batteries that produce
all coke requirements, three blast furnaces (two operating), two basic

oxygen furnaces, a two-strand continuous slab caster with an annual slab
production capacity of approximately 2.4 million tons, an 80-inch hot strip mill
and pickling and coil finishing facilities. The Ohio and West Virginia
locations, which are separated by the Ohio River, are connected by a railroad
bridge owned by the Company. A pipeline is maintained for the transfer of coke
oven gas for use as fuel from the coke plant to several other portions of the
Steubenville plant. The Steubenville plant primarily produces hot-rolled
products, which are either sold to third parties or shipped to other affiliated
facilities for further processing.
 
     The following table lists the other principal plants of the Company and the
annual capacity of the major products produced at each facility:

     Wheeling Corrugating fabricates products at Fort Payne, Alabama; Houston,
Texas; Lenexa, Kansas; Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Warren,
Ohio; Gary, Indiana; and Wilmington, North Carolina. The Fort Payne, Houston and
Wilmington facilities were acquired in 1986, 1989 and 1993, respectively. The
Gary and Warren facilities were acquired in 1994. In addition, the Company
operates six plants located throughout the United States that fabricate culvert
pipe from sheet metal. The Company maintains five regional sales offices for
flat-rolled and tin mill products and nine sales offices and/or warehouses for
fabricated products. Unimast, acquired in March 1995, has facilities located at
Franklin Park, Illinois; Warren, Ohio; Morrow, Georgia and Boonton, New Jersey.
 
     All of the above facilities currently owned by the Company are regularly
maintained in good operating condition. However, continuous and substantial
capital and maintenance expenditures are required to maintain the operating
facilities, to modernize finishing facilities in order to remain competitive and
to meet environmental control requirements.
 
     All of the above facilities and substantially all of the other real
property of the Company are owned in fee by the Company (exclusive of coal lands
held by subsidiaries or corporations in which the Company has an interest) and
are subject to the first lien that secures ratably (i) the $9.5 million of the
First Mortgage Notes and (ii) the $12.5 million face amount (as of December 31,
1995) of Tax Benefit Transfer Letters of Credit issued to support the sale of
tax benefits associated with the construction of the slab caster located at the
Company's Steubenville facility.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The Company, as are other steel manufacturers, is subject to increasingly
stringent standards relating to the protection of the environment. In order to
facilitate compliance with these environmental standards, the Company has
incurred capital expenditures for environmental control projects aggregating
$8.0 million, $8.7 million and $5.9 million for 1993, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The Company anticipates spending approximately $53.0 million on
major environmental projects through the year 2000. Due to the possibility of
unanticipated factual or regulatory developments, the amount of future
expenditures may vary.
 
     The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("Superfund") or similar state statutes at six waste sites. The Company is
subject to joint and several liability imposed by Superfund on potentially
responsible parties. Due to the technical and regulatory complexity of remedial
activities and the difficulties attendant to identifying potentially responsible
parties and allocating or determining liability among them, the Company is
unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of compliance with superfund
laws. The Company believes, based upon information currently available, that the
Company's liability for clean up and remediation costs in connection with one of
these sites will be between $1.0 million and $4.0 million. At four other sites
the costs are estimated to aggregate between $25,000 and $250,000. The Company
lacks sufficient information regarding the remaining sites to form an estimate.
The Company is currently funding its share of remediation costs. The Company
believes that these remediation costs are not significant and will not be
significant in the forseeable future. Non-current accrued environmental
liabilities totaled $7.3 million at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994.
These liabilities were determined by the Company based on all available
information, including information provided by third parties, and existing laws
and regulations then in effect, and are reviewed and adjusted quarterly as new
information becomes available. Based upon all available information, the Company
does not anticipate that assessment and remediation costs resulting from the
Company's potentially responsible party status will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, as further
information comes into the Company's possession, it will continue to reassess
such evaluations.
 
     The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean Air Act") directly affect
the operations of many of the Company's facilities, including coke ovens. Under
the Clean Air Act, coke ovens generally will be required to comply with
progressively more stringent standards which will result in an increase in
environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance. The
costs associated with anticipated compliance with these standards for the
immediate future in the amount of $13.8 million have been included in
anticipated capital expenditure requirements.
 
     On March 31, 1993, the EPA notified the Company of Clean Air Act
violations, alleging particulate matter and hydrogen sulfide emissions in excess
of allowable concentrations, at the Company's Follansbee Coke Plant. The parties
have entered into a consent decree settling the civil penalties related to this
matter for $.7 million. The Company has accrued for the cost of this settlement.
 
     In an action brought in 1985 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of West Virginia, the EPA claimed violations of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act at a surface impoundment area at the Follansbee facility. The
Company and the EPA entered into a consent decree in October 1989 whereby soil
and groundwater testing and monitoring procedures are required. The Company has
submitted, and is awaiting EPA approval of, a testing and monitoring plan. The
extent and cost of remediation cannot be ascertained until testing in accordance
with an approved plan is completed. In June of 1995 the USEPA informally
requested corrective action affecting other areas of the Follansbee facility.
The Company believes that EPA's request is subject to dispute resolution under
the October 1989 decree.
 
     On December 20, 1995 the Department of Justice notified the Company of its
intention to bring proceedings seeking civil penalties for alleged violations of
the Clean Water Act (1991-94) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") (1990-91) at the Company's Follansbee facility. A pre-suit demand of
$.6 million has been made and the Company is in the process of conducting
settlement negotiations. The Company has accrued an appropriate reserve for the
potential cost of this claim.
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   14
 
     By letter dated March 15, 1994 the Ohio Attorney General advised the
Company of its intention to file suit on behalf of the Ohio EPA for alleged
hazardous waste violations at the Company's Steubenville, Mingo Junction,
Martins Ferry and Yorkville facilities. In subsequent correspondence the State
of Ohio demanded a civil penalty of approximately $.3 million in addition to
injunctive relief. The injunctive relief consists of remedial activities at each
facility aggregating less than $125,000, the initiation of a waste minimization
program at the affected facilities and a company wide compliance assessment. The
Company is in the process of conducting settlement negotiations which would
include the payment of penalties below the amount requested. The Company has
accrued an appropriate reserve for this claim.
 
     The Company is currently operating in substantial compliance with three
consent decrees (two with the EPA and one with Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources) with respect to wastewater discharges at Allenport,
Pennsylvania and Mingo Junction, Steubenville, and Yorkville, Ohio.
 
     The Company is aware of several environmental issues resulting from
operations, which include leakage from underground and aboveground storage
tanks, and the disposal and storage of residuals on its property. Each of these
situations is being assessed and remediated in accordance with regulatory
requirements. The Company does not believe the resolution of these issues or
other litigation occurring in the normal course of business will have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.
 
     Based upon the Company's prior capital expenditures, anticipated capital
expenditures, consent agreements negotiated with Federal and state agencies and
information available to the Company on pending judicial and administrative
proceedings, the Company does not expect its environmental compliance costs,
including the incurrence of additional fines and penalties, if any, relating to
the operation of its facilities, to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Company. However, as further
information comes into the Company's possession, it will continue to reassess
such evaluations.
 
GENERAL LITIGATION
 
     The Company is a party to various litigation matters including general
liability claims covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, such claims
are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.

NOTES TO FIVE-YEAR STATISTICAL SUMMARY
 
     The Company recorded a fourth quarter 1992 restructuring charge of $7.1
million to reflect the elimination of 156 salaried positions through a
separation incentive program. The job eliminations represented 13% of the
salaried workforce.
 
     In 1991 the tax benefit of $7.6 million consists of a current year
provision of $1.1 million of alternative minimum tax ("AMT"), and a reduction of
$8.7 million in federal income tax reserves. The AMT provision excludes the
benefit ($.9 million) of net operating loss carryforwards of the pre-reorganized
entity.
 
     In 1993 the Company recorded extraordinary charges of $37.0 million, net of
taxes, for premiums paid on early debt retirement and to provide for coal
retiree medical benefits.
 
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 112,
"Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112") as of January 1, 1994.
SFAS 112 establishes accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to
former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Those
benefits include, among others, disability, severance and workers' compensation.
The Company recorded a charge of $12.2 million ($10.0 million net of tax) in the
1994 first quarter as a result of the cumulative effect on prior years of
adoption of the change in accounting method.
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries were reorganized into a new holding
company structure on July 26, 1994. The transactions were accounted for as a
reorganization of entities under common control. On the merger date, WHX had the
same consolidated net worth as WPC and its subsidiaries prior to the
reorganization.
 
     In 1995 the Company recorded an extraordinary charge of $3.0 million, net
of taxes, to reflect the coal retiree medical benefits for additional retirees
assigned to the Company by the Social Security Administration and the effect of
recording the liability at its net present value.
 
ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
1995 COMPARED TO 1994
 
     Net sales for 1995 totaled $1,364.6 million on shipments of steel products
of 2.5 million tons, compared to $1,193.9 million on shipments of 2.4 million
tons in 1994. The 14.3% increase in net sales reflects the acquisition of
Unimast in March 1995, a 3.0% increase in steel prices and a higher valued-added
product mix. Average product prices increased by 9.0% from $498 per ton shipped
to $543.
 
     Cost of goods sold increased from $408 per ton shipped in 1994 to $456 in
1995. This increase reflects a higher value-added product mix, higher prices for
ore, scrap and purchased slabs, higher employment costs and lower productivity
primarily attributable to the planned blast furnace relining.
 
     The operating rate was 91.6% in 1995 compared to 94.6% in 1994. Raw steel
production was 100% continuous cast in 1995 and 1994.
 
     Depreciation expense increased 10.1% to $67.7 million in 1995, compared to
1994, due to increased amounts of depreciable property and the inclusion of
Unimast.
 
     Profit sharing expense decreased from $9.3 million to $6.7 million in 1995,
compared to 1994, based on terms of the collective bargaining agreement and a
similar program for non-bargaining employees.
 
     Selling, administrative and general expense increased 3.1% to $66.5 million
in 1995, from $64.5 million in 1994, due primarily to the inclusion of Unimast,
partially offset by reduced consulting fees.
 
     Interest expense increased to $22.8 million in 1995 from $22.6 million in
1994. The increase is due to less capitalized interest, partially offset by
lower levels of debt outstanding. Capitalized interest totaled $6.4 million in
1995, compared to $8.4 million in 1994.
 
                                       16
<PAGE>   18
 
     Other income increased to $47.1 million in 1995 from $17.9 million in 1994.
This increase in other income reflects a $25.1 million increase in interest and
investment income, realized gains from the sale of 2.2 million shares of common
stock of Teledyne, and a strong recovery in the bond market compared to 1994.
The Company also recorded a $6.7 million gain on the sale of the assets of WP
Radio.
 
     The tax provisions for 1995 and 1994 were $19.0 million and $24.4 million,
respectively, before recording the tax benefit related to extraordinary charges.
The tax provisions were calculated on an alternative minimum tax basis. The 1995
provision includes the effect of recognizing $58.0 million of deferred tax
assets, but excludes the benefit of applying $42.1 million of pre-reorganization
tax benefits, which are direct additions to paid-in-capital. Direct additions to
paid-in-capital in 1994 totaled $17.6 million.
 
     Income before extraordinary charges in 1995 totaled $81.1 million, or $2.18
per share of common stock, compared to $86.4 million, or $2.54 per share of
common stock in 1994 (including $36.1 million or $.93 per share of common stock
related to the settlement of the B&LE antitrust litigation).
 
     The 1995 extraordinary charge of $4.7 million ($3.0 million net of tax)
reflects additional liability for coal miner retiree medical expense
attributable to the allocations of more retirees to the Company by the Social
Security Administration. The 1994 charge for change in accounting method of
$12.2 million ($10.0 million net of tax) reflects the adoption of SFAS 112.
 
     Net income totaled $78.0 million or $2.07 per share of common stock in
1995, compared to net income of $76.4 million or $2.19 per share of common stock
in 1994.
 
1994 COMPARED TO 1993
 
     Net sales for 1994 totaled $1,193.9 million on shipments of steel products
of 2.4 million tons, compared to $1,046.8 million on shipments of 2.3 million
tons in 1993. The 14.1% increase in net sales revenue reflects a 6.5% increase
in shipping volume due to improved demand for steel products and a 6.5% increase
in steel prices. Average product prices increased by 7.1% from $465 per ton
shipped to $498.
 
     Cost of goods sold increased to $408 per ton shipped in 1994 from $389 in
1993. This increase was due to consumption of a greater proportion of purchased
versus internally produced slabs (semi-finished steel), increased employment
costs and price increases on purchased slabs and scrap. The Company purchased
slabs in order to (i) improve profitability by increasing shipments beyond the
Company's own steel melting capacity, and (ii) offset lost raw steel production
caused by certain unscheduled blast furnace outages and a two-day strike by USWA
employees in March 1994.
 
     The operating rate (raw steel production as a percentage of continuous
caster capacity) increased to 94.6% in 1994 from 94.1% in 1993. Continuous cast
steel totaled 100% of total steel production in 1994 and 1993.
 
     Depreciation expense increased 7.8% to $61.5 million in 1994, compared to
$57.1 million in 1993, due to increased amounts of depreciable property and
higher levels of capitalized interest.
 
     Profit sharing contributions, based on terms of the collective bargaining
agreement, increased to $9.3 million in 1994 from $4.8 million in 1993, due
primarily to increased income before taxes.
 
     Selling, administrative and general expense increased 10.2% to $64.5
million in 1994, compared to 1993, reflecting changes in organizational
structure and acquisition activities, higher bonus payments and higher legal
expenses.
 
     Interest expense increased to $22.6 million in 1994 from $21.4 million in
1993. The increase is due to higher levels of debt outstanding, partially offset
by lower interest rates. Capitalized interest totaled $8.4 million in 1994,
compared to $6.5 million in 1993.
 
     Other income increased to $17.9 million in 1994 from $12.0 million in 1993.
The income reflects increased investment income on higher levels of short term
investments.
 
                                       17
<PAGE>   19
 
     The 1994 and 1993 tax provisions were calculated on an alternative minimum
tax basis. The tax provisions totaled $22.2 million and $.7 million, after
recording the benefits related to extraordinary charges, in 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
 
     Income before extraordinary items in 1994 totaled $86.4 million or $2.54
per share of common stock (including $36.1 million or $.93 per share of common
stock related to settlement of a lawsuit) compared to $30.7 million, or $1.02
per share of common stock, in 1993.
 
     The 1994 charge for change in accounting method of $12.2 million ($10.0
million net of tax) reflects the adoption of SFAS 112. The statement establishes
accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. The benefits include, among
others, disability, severance and workers' compensation. The 1994 charge totaled
$10.0 million, or 35 cents per common share, compared to an extraordinary charge
of $37.0 million, or $1.45 per common share, in 1993 for early debt retirement
and coal retirement medical expense.
 
     Net income totaled $76.4 million or $2.19 per common share, in 1994,
compared to a net loss of $6.2 million, or 43 cents per common share, in 1993.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Net cash flow from operating activities for 1995 totaled $139.5 million.
Short term trading investments are reported as cash flow from operating
activities and used cash of $20.4 million. Working capital accounts (excluding
cash, short term investments and current maturities of long-term debt) provided
$17.2 million of funds, excluding $22.8 million of working capital at Unimast
which was acquired on March 31, 1995. Accounts receivable decreased $47.7
million (excluding a $22 million sale of trade receivables presented separately
as a financing activity) due to a lower level of sales and more timely average
collections. Inventories valued principally by the LIFO method for financial
reporting purposes, totaled $285.9 million at December 31, 1995, an increase of
$1.3 million from the prior year end (excluding the effect of the Unimast
acquisition). Trade payables decreased $13.5 million due to lower operating
levels at year end compared to the prior year.
 
     In August 1994 the Company entered into an agreement to sell, up to $75
million on a revolving basis, an undivided percentage ownership in a designated
pool of accounts receivable generated by WPSC and two of its affiliates,
Wheeling Construction Products, Inc. and Pittsburgh-Canfield Corporation. The
agreement expires in August 1999. In July 1995, WPSC amended such agreement to
sell an additional $20 million on similar terms and conditions. In October 1995,
WPSC entered into an agreement to include the receivables generated by Unimast,
in the pool of accounts receivable sold. Accounts receivable at December 31,
1995, exclude $67 million representing accounts receivable sold with recourse
limited to the extent of uncollectible balances. Fees of $4.3 million paid by
the Company under this agreement were based upon a fixed rate set on the date
the initial $45 million of accounts receivable were sold and variable rates on
subsequent sales that range from 6.219% to 9.0% of the outstanding amount of
receivables sold. Based on the Company's collection history, the Company
believes that credit risk associated with the above arrangement is immaterial.
 
     For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company spent $83.3 million
(including capitalized interest) on capital improvements, including $5.9 million
on environmental control projects. The Company completed the acquisition of
Unimast during the first quarter of 1995 for cash consideration of $27.5 million
and the assumption of liabilities of $35.0 million, including long-term debt of
$19.7 million. Non-current accrued environmental liabilities totaled $7.3
million at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994. These liabilities were
determined by the Company when the Company reorganized under the federal
bankruptcy laws in January 1991, based on all available information, including
information provided by third parties, and existing laws and regulations then in
effect, and are reviewed and adjusted quarterly as new information becomes
available. Based upon all available information, the Company does not anticipate
that assessment and remediation costs resulting from the Company's status as a
potentially responsible party will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations. However, as further information
comes into the Company's possession, it will continue to reassess such
evaluations. The Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 is expected to increase the
Company's costs related to environmental compliance; however, such an
 
                                       18
<PAGE>   20
 
increase in cost is not reasonably estimable, but is not anticipated to have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
 
     Continuous and substantial capital and maintenance expenditures will be
required to maintain and, where necessary, upgrade operating facilities to
remain competitive, and to comply with environmental control requirements. It is
anticipated that necessary capital expenditures including required environmental
expenditures in future years will continue to exceed depreciation expense and
represent a material use of operating funds. Additionally, the Company through
its newly formed joint venture, Ohio Coatings Company, is in the process of
constructing a $69 million tin coating facility, which will require $16.5
million of funds from the Company in 1996. The Company anticipates funding its
capital expenditures and joint venture commitment through 1996 from cash on hand
and funds generated from operations.
 
     On December 28, 1995, WPSC entered into a new Revolving Credit Facility
("RCF") with Citibank, N.A. as agent. The RCF provides for borrowing for general
corporate purposes of up to $125 million. The RCF expires May 3, 1999. Interest
is calculated at a Citibank prime rate plus .5% and/or a Eurodollar rate plus
2.0%. Borrowings under the RCF are secured primarily by 100% of WPSC's eligible
inventory and requires that WPSC maintain a specified level of tangible net
worth. The RCF has certain financial covenants restricting indebtedness, liens
and distributions. There were no borrowings under the RCF at December 31, 1995.
 
     The collective bargaining agreement between the USWA and the Company
expires on October 1, 1996. If a new labor agreement is not negotiated before
the current contract expires, or if a strike were to occur, there could be a
material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company.
 
     Short-term liquidity is dependent, in large part, on cash on hand,
investments, general economic conditions and their effect on steel demand and
prices. At December 31, 1995 the Company had cash and short-term investments
totaling $439.5 million. Long-term liquidity is dependent upon the Company's
ability to sustain profitable operations and control costs during periods of low
demand or pricing in order to sustain positive cash flow. The Company satisfies
its working capital requirements through cash on hand, investments, the asset
securitization facility, borrowing availability under the RCF and funds
generated from operations. The Company believes that such sources will provide
the Company for the next twelve months with the funds required to satisfy
working capital and capital expenditure requirements. External factors, such as
worldwide steel production and demand and currency exchange rates, could
materially affect the Company's results of operations. During 1995 the Company
had minimal activity with respect to futures contracts, and the impact of such
activity was not material on its financial condition or results of operations of
the Company.
 
     The Company sent a letter to the Board of Directors of Teledyne, Inc.
("Teledyne") on November 28, 1994 with a merger proposal in which Teledyne's
shareholders would receive $22.00 per share in a combination of cash (at least
$11 per share) and the balance in a WHX convertible preferred stock. The
Teledyne Board of Directors rejected the proposal on December 21, 1994. On
February 9, 1996, the Company sent a letter to the Board of Directors of
Teledyne proposing a business combination between the Company and Teledyne on a
negotiated basis at a price of $30 per Teledyne share (approximately two-thirds
in cash and one-third in Company common stock). On February 23, 1996, the
Company informed Teledyne of the Company's intention to nominate directors at
Teledyne's 1996 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled to be held April 24,
1996. On February 26, 1996, the Company sent a letter to the Board of Directors
of Teledyne increasing the terms of its February 9, 1996 offer to $32 per
Teledyne share ($22 per share in cash and $10 per share in Company common
stock). Teledyne rejected this proposal on February 29, 1996.

accepted accounting principles requires the use of management's estimates. Due
to uncertainty involved in estimating the costs, it is reasonably possible that
a change in estimates may occur in the near term as more information becomes
available.
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method of accounting
for investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20% or more.
 
BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
     The Company is primarily engaged in one line of business and has one
industry segment, which is the making, processing and fabricating of steel and
steel products. The Company's products include hot rolled and cold rolled sheet,
and coated products such as galvanized, prepainted and tin mill sheet. The
Company also manufactures a variety of fabricated steel products including roll
formed corrugated roofing, roof deck, form deck, floor deck, culvert, bridge
form and other products used primarily by the construction, highway and
agricultural markets.
 
     Through an extensive mix of products, the Company markets to a wide range
of manufacturers, converters and processors. The Company's 10 largest customers
(including Wheeling-Nisshin) accounted for approximately 40% of its net sales in
1993 and 1994, and 33.3% in 1995. Wheeling-Nisshin was the only customer to
account for more than 10% of net sales. Wheeling-Nisshin accounted for 13.3%,
15.5% and 13.8% of net sales in 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively.
Geographically, the majority of the Company's customers are located within a
350-mile radius of the Ohio Valley. However, the Company has taken advantage of
its river-oriented production facilities to market via barge into more distant
locations such as the Houston, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri areas. Wheeling
Corrugating has acquired regional facilities to service an even broader
geographical area.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
     Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly
liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The recorded amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Short term investments are
recorded at fair market value based on trading in the public market. Redeemable
common stock is recorded at the redemption amount which is considered to
approximate fair value. See Note H for a description of fair value of debt
instruments.
 
     The Company accounts for short-term investments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" and in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards No. 119, "Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments
and Fair Value of Financial Instruments." Unrealized investment gains and losses
are recognized based on specific identification of securities.

INVENTORIES
 
     Inventories are stated at cost which is lower than market. Cost is
determined by the last-in first-out ("LIFO") method for substantially all
inventories.
 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
 
     Depreciation is computed on the modified units of production method for
financial statement purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes.
Interest cost is capitalized for qualifying assets during the assets'
acquisition period. Capitalized interest cost is amortized on the same basis as
the related depreciation.
 
     Maintenance and repairs are charged to income. Renewals and betterments
made through replacements are capitalized. Profit or loss on property
dispositions is credited or charged to income.
 
PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS
 
     The Company has tax qualified defined contribution pension plans covering
substantially all employees. The programs provide for contributions based on a
percentage of compensation for salaried employees and a rate per hour worked for
hourly employees. Costs for these programs are being funded currently.
 
     The Company sponsors medical and life insurance programs for substantially
all employees. Similar group medical programs extend to pensioners and
dependents. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"), Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The Company accounts for
Postemployment Benefits in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting No.
112 ("SFAS 112"), "Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits other than
Retirements". When accounts are reasonably determinable, they are calculated at
their net present value.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), Accounting for Income
Taxes. Recognition is given in the accounts for the income tax effect of
temporary differences in reporting transactions for financial and tax purposes
using the deferred liability method.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
     The Company has not decided whether it will adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123," Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123") or continue to account for stock based compensation under Accounting
Principle Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The Company provides for remediation costs and penalties associated with
environmental non-compliance when the responsibility of costs is probable and
the amount is estimable. Generally, remediation accruals are recorded when a
feasibility study of plan of action has been determined.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
     Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each year,
excluding redeemable common shares.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE A -- REORGANIZATION
 
     The Company and its subsidiaries were reorganized into a new holding
company structure ("Corporate Reorganization") on July 26, 1994. The majority of
the steel-related business of the Company (including Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel
Corporation ("WPSC") continues to be owned by Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation
("WPC") and the other businesses and assets of the Company, including Unimast,
Inc. are owned by WHX Corporation ("WHX"). Pursuant to the reorganization, WPC
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WHX. WHX, the new holding company, is the
publicly held issuer for all of the Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company presently
outstanding. In addition, WHX guaranteed the Company's outstanding 9 3/8% Senior
Notes due 2003 and 12 1/4% First Mortgage Notes due 2000. The merger was
accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. On the
merger date, WHX Corporation had the same consolidated net worth as the Company
and its subsidiaries prior to the merger.
 
     As a condition of the Corporate Reorganization, the financial and other
covenants under the Senior Notes and First Mortgage Notes indentures also apply
to WHX and accordingly, actions taken by WHX which violate such covenants or
otherwise cause an event of default under such indentures could accelerate the
obligations due thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
 
NOTE B -- UNIMAST ACQUISITION
 
     On March 31, 1995, the Company completed the purchase of all of the
outstanding stock of Unimast. The purchase price to the Company was $27.5
million cash, plus the assumption of liabilities totaling $35.0 million,
including long term debt of $19.7 million. The acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase. Goodwill amounting to $4.6 million was recorded in connection with
this acquisition and will be amortized over 15 years. The Consolidated Statement
of Income includes the results of operations of Unimast since its acquisition on
March 31, 1995.
 
NOTE C -- PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
 
PENSION PROGRAMS
 
     The Company provides defined contribution pension programs for both hourly
and salaried employees. Tax qualified defined contribution plans provide, in the
case of hourly employees, an increasing Company contribution per hour worked
based on the age of its employees. A similar tax qualified plan for salaried
employees provides defined Company contributions based on age and years of
service.
 
     As of December 31, 1995, $96.5 million of fully vested funds are held in
trust for benefits earned under the hourly defined contribution pension plans
and $25.8 million is held in trust for fully vested benefits earned under the
salaried employees defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 1995,
approximately 46% of the assets of the hourly pension plans was in fixed income
investments and 54% in equity investments; approximately 52% of the assets of
the salaried pension plan was in fixed income investments and 48% in equity
investments. All plan assets are invested by professional investment managers.
Pension provisions charged against income were $9.6 million, $10.5 million and
$10.8 million in 1993, 1994, and 1995 respectively.
 
     Effective January 1, 1994 the Company began matching salaried employee
contributions to the 401(K) plan with shares of the Company's Common Stock. The
Company matches 50% of the employees contributions. The employer contribution is
limited to a maximum of 3% of an employee's salary. At December 31, 1994 and
1995, the 401(K) plan held 32,851 shares of the Company's Common Stock and
115,151 of the Company's Common Stock, respectively.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)
 
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company adopted SFAS 112 as of January 1, 1994. SFAS 112 establishes
accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits include, among
others, disability, severance and workers' compensation. The Company recorded a
charge of $12.2 million ($10.0 million net of tax) in the 1994 first quarter as
a result of the cumulative effect on prior years of adoption of SFAS 112. The
assumed discount rate used to measure the benefit liability was 8% at December
31, 1994 and 7.5% at December 31, 1995.
 
OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
     The Company sponsors postretirement benefit plans that cover both
management and hourly retirees and dependents. The plans provide medical
benefits including hospital, physicians' services and major medical expense
benefits and a life insurance benefit. The hourly employees' plans provide
non-contributory basic medical and a supplement to Medicare benefits, and major
medical coverage to which the Company contributes 50% of the insurance premium
cost. The management plan has provided basic medical and major medical benefits
on a non-contributory basis through age 65.
 
     The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106.
The cost of postretirement medical and life benefits for eligible employees are
accrued during the employee's service period through the date the employee
reaches full benefit eligibility. The Company delays recognition of changes to
the unfunded obligation that arise from the effects of current actuarial gains
and losses and the effects of changes in assumptions. The Company funds the
plans as current benefit obligations are paid. Additionally, in 1994 the Company
began funding a qualified trust in accordance with the collective bargaining
agreement effective March 1, 1994. The following table sets forth the
reconciliation of the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation ("APBO") to
the accrued obligation included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 1994 and 1995.

</TABLE>
 
     For measurement purposes, medical costs are assumed to increase at annual
rates as stated above and declining gradually to 4.5% in 2004 and beyond. The
medical cost trend rate assumption has significant effect on the costs and
obligation reported. A 1% increase in the medical cost trend rate in each year
would result in approximate increases in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of $52.4 million, and net periodic benefit cost of $4.7 million.
 
COAL INDUSTRY RETIREE HEALTH BENEFIT ACT
 
     The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the "Act") created a
new United Mine Workers of America postretirement medical and death benefit plan
to replace two existing plans which had developed significant deficits. The Act
assigns companies the remaining benefit obligations for former employees and
beneficiaries, and a pro rata allocation of benefits related to unassigned
beneficiaries ("orphans"). The Company's obligation under the Act related to its
previous and present ownership of coal mining operations had been estimated at
$14.3 million (based on preliminary assignment of retirees by the Social
Security Administration ("SSA")) and recorded as an extraordinary charge in the
1993 fourth quarter. The Company reduced this liability in 1994 by $2.4 million
to reflect current premium payments, reductions in the number of assigned former
employees and beneficiaries and a lower anticipated medical trend rate.
 
     In July and October 1995 SSA assigned an additional 379 retirees and 130
orphans to the Company. The Company's obligation under the Act has been
estimated as an additional $18.2 million. Based on the information obtained over
the past three years the Company believes the liability has been reasonably
determined and has valued the liability at its net present value using a 7.5%
discount rate. After discounting the liability to present value, the net charge
to income totals $3.0 million.

     The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective
January 1, 1993, on a prospective basis. Previously, the Company used the SFAS
96 asset and liability approach that gave no recognition to future events other
than the recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying
amounts. There was no effect on retained earnings of adopting SFAS 109.

     Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the financial
basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The type of differences that give

     As of December 31, 1995, for financial statement reporting purposes a
balance of approximately $29 million of prereorganization tax benefits exist.
These benefits will be reported as a direct addition to equity as they are
recognized. In 1994 and 1995, tax benefits of $17.6 million and $42.1 million,
respectively, were recognized as a direct addition to equity. The decrease in
the valuation allowance in 1994 and 1995 represents current recognition of tax
benefits.
 
     During 1994, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined by
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As the result of this event, the
Company will be limited in its ability to use net operating loss carryforwards
and certain other tax attributes to reduce subsequent tax liabilities. The
amount of taxable income that can be offset in any annual period is limited to
approximately $32 million.
 
     Total federal and state income taxes paid in 1993, 1994 and 1995 were $3.2
million, $1.8 million and $18.0 million, respectively.
 
     Federal tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") through 1987. The statute of limitations has expired for years through
1991; however, the IRS can review such years to adjust any NOL's incurred in
such years and carried forward to offset income in subsequent years. Management
believes it has adequately provided for all taxes on income.

     These investments are subject to price volatility associated with any
interest bearing instrument. Fluctuations in general interest rates effect the
value of these investments.
 
     The Company recognizes gains and losses based on specific identification of
the securities which comprise the investment balance. At December 31, 1994 and
1995 unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities of $3.1 and $1.1
million, respectively, were reported as a separate component of stockholder's
equity. Net unrealized holding gains and (losses) on trading securities included
in net income for 1994 and 1995 were $4.0 million loss and $8.7 million gain,
respectively. SFAS 115 was adopted effective January 1, 1994 and had no
cumulative effect on prior years.
 
     On December 21, 1995, the Company purchased a "When-Issued" contract which
allowed it to purchase United States 5-year Treasury Notes at the next scheduled
auction. The contract had a notional value of $700 million, although purchased
at a discount, with an average fair value through December 31, 1995 of $700.7
million. Fair value at December 31, 1995 was $702.8 million with $4.2 million
gain included in fourth quarter earnings. The Company has accounted for this
investment on a trade-date basis, consistent with other non-financial entities
and is classified as a trading security.

     During 1994 and 1995, certain inventory quantities were reduced, resulting
in liquidations of LIFO inventories, the effect of which decreased income by
approximately $.3 million in 1994 and increased income by approximately $.8
million in 1995.

     The Company utilizes the modified units of production method of
depreciation which recognizes that the depreciation of steelmaking machinery is
related to the physical wear of the equipment as well as a time factor. The
modified units of production method provides for straight line depreciation
charges modified (adjusted) by the level of raw steel production. In 1994 and
1995 depreciation under the modified units of production method was $2.8 million
or 6.1% and $4.9 million or 9.6%, respectively, less than straight line
depreciation.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)
 
     A summary of the financial agreements at December 31, 1995 follows:
 
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY:
 
     On December 28, 1995, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation entered into a
Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility ("RCF") with Citibank,
N.A. as agent. The RCF provides for borrowings for general corporate purposes up
to $125 million and a $35 million sub-limit for Letters of Credit.
 
     The Credit Agreement expires May 3, 1999. Initial interest rates are based
on the Citibank prime rate plus .50% and/or a Eurodollar rate plus 1.75%,
however, the margin over the prime rate and the Eurodollar rate can fluctuate up
or down based upon performance. The maximum prime rate margin is 1.00% and the
maximum Eurodollar margin is 2.25%. The initial letter of credit fee is 1.75%
and is also performance based with a maximum rate of 2.25%.
 
     Borrowings are secured primarily by 100% of the eligible inventory of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, Pittsburgh-Canfield Corporation, Wheeling
Construction Products, Inc. and Unimast, and the terms of the RCF contain
various restrictive covenants, limiting among other things dividend payments or
other distribution of assets, as defined in the RCF. Certain financial covenants
associated with leverage, net worth, capital spending, cash flow and interest
coverage must be maintained. There are no borrowings or letters of credit
outstanding against the RCF at December 31, 1995.
 
     In August 1994 WPSC entered into a separate facility for letters of credit
up to $50 million. At December 31, 1995 letters of credit totaling $27.6 million
were outstanding under this facility. The letters of credit are collateralized
at 105% with U.S. Government securities owned by the Company, and are subject to
an administrative charge of .4% per annum on the amount of outstanding letters
of credit.
 
FIRST MORTGAGE NOTES:
 
     On November 27, 1991 the Company completed an offering of $175.0 million of
12 1/4% First Mortgage Notes. Interest on the First Mortgage Notes is payable
semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, at the rate of 12 1/4% per
annum. The First Mortgage Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the
option of the Company, on or after November 15, 1996, at specified redemption
prices plus accrued interest.
 
     Pursuant to an October 1993 offer to repurchase by the Company, $165.5
million aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Notes (or 94.5% of the
outstanding First Mortgage Notes) were tendered and accepted for payment by the
Company. In November 1993 the Company simultaneously issued $325.0 million of
9 3/8% Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were partially used to purchase the
First Mortgage Notes and pay related premiums. Pursuant to the Company's
reorganization in 1994, WHX guaranteed the payment of the First Mortgage Notes.
 
9 3/8% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2003:
 
     On November 23, 1993 WPC issued $325 million of 9 3/8% Senior Notes.
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15
of each year, commencing May 15, 1994. The Senior Notes mature on November 15,
2003. During 1994, the Company repurchased $54.3 million of its outstanding
9 3/8% Senior Notes at an average price of 94% of the related outstanding
principal amount.
 
     The Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of WPC, in whole or in part,
at any time on or after November 15, 2000 at specified redemption prices, plus
accrued interest to the date of redemption.
 
     Upon a Change of Control (as defined), WPC will have the option to redeem
the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium (as defined) and, upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined), each holder of Senior Notes
will have the right to require WPC to repurchase such holder's Senior Notes at
101% of the principal amount thereof, together, in each case, with accrued
interest to the date of redemption or repurchase.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)
 
     The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of WPC ranking senior in right
of payment to WPC's subordinated indebtedness, if any, and pari passu with all
other senior indebtedness of WPC. Pursuant to the Company's reorganization in
1994, WHX guaranteed the payment of the Senior Notes.
 
     The Indenture contains certain covenants, including but not limited to,
covenants with respect to the following matters: (i) the incurrence of
additional indebtedness by WPC and its subsidiaries; (ii) the incurrence of
certain liens by WPC and its subsidiaries; (iii) the making of certain
sale-leaseback transactions; (iv) the disposition by WPC and its subsidiaries of
the proceeds of certain asset sales; (v) the making by WPC and its subsidiaries
of certain dividends and other restricted payments; (vi) the entry into certain
transactions with affiliates of WPC and (vii) the ability of WPC to engage in
certain mergers, consolidations or asset sales.

REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK
 
     Certain present and former employees of the Company were issued preferred
shares of the Company prior to the Chapter 11 proceeding of the Company's
predecessor in exchange for wage and salary concessions. Such preferred shares
were exchanged for 1,279,935 shares of Common Stock under the Chapter 11 Plan of
Reorganization, which shares were issued to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan
("ESOP") on such employees' behalf. Beneficial owners of such shares who were
active employees on August 15, 1990 and who have either retired, died or become
disabled, or who reach 30 years of service, may sell their Common Stock to the
Company at a price of $15 or, upon qualified retirement, $20 per share. These
contingent obligations are expected to extend over many years, as participants
in the ESOP satisfy the criteria for selling shares to the Company. In addition,
each beneficiary can direct the ESOP to sell any or all of its Common Stock into
the public markets at any time; provided, however, that the ESOP will not on any
day sell in the public markets more than 20% of the number of shares of Common
Stock traded during the previous day. As of December 31, 1995, 444,160 shares of
such Common Stock remained outstanding.

STOCK OPTION PLAN
 
     The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation Stock Option Plan ("1991 Plan") is
intended to assist the Company in securing and retaining key employees by
allowing them to participate in the ownership and growth of the Company through
the grant of incentive and non-qualified options (collectively, the "Options")
to full-time employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Incentive stock
options granted under the Option Plan are intended to be "Incentive Stock
Options" as defined by Section 422 of the Code.
 
     An aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock has been reserved for
issuance upon exercise of Options under the 1991 Plan. The 1991 Plan is
administered by a committee (the "Committee") consisting of not less than three
nonemployee members appointed by the Board of Directors. The term of Options
granted under the 1991 Plan may not exceed 10 years (five years in the case of
an incentive Option granted to an optionee owning more than 10% of the voting
stock of the Company (a "10% Holder"). The Option price for Options shall not be
less than 100% of the "fair market value" of the shares of Common Stock at the
time the Option is granted; provided, however, that with respect to an incentive
option, in the case of a 10% Holder, the purchase price per share shall be at
least 110% of such fair market value. The aggregate fair market value of the
shares of Common Stock as to which an optionee may first exercise incentive
stock options in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Payment for shares
purchased upon exercise of Options is to be made in cash, but, at the discretion
of the Committee, may be made by delivery of other shares of Common Stock of
comparable value. The 1991 Plan will terminate on September 24, 2001 and may be
terminated at any time by the Board of Directors prior to that date.

shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of options with respect to a
maximum of 400,000 shares of Common Stock. The options vest over three years
from the date of grant.
 
OPTION GRANTS TO WPN CORP.
 
     On July 29, 1993 (the "Approval Date"), the Board of Directors approved the
grant of options to WPN Corporation to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock

March 31, 1994.
 
     The options are exercisable with respect to one-third of the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise thereunder at any time on or after the
date of stockholder approval of the Option Grants. The options with respect to
an additional one-third of the share of Common Stock may be exercised on the

Options outstanding at December 31, <1995 which are exercisable totaled
1,449,556.
 
     During 1995 the Company issued 68,000 options with an exercise price of
$11.00. The value of those options as determined under the Black-Scholes option
pricing formula was below the exercise price on the grant date. Accordingly, if
SFAS 123 had been adopted, no compensation expense would have been recognized in
1995.
 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
     The computation of primary earnings per common share is based upon the
average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding. Common
stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of assuming the exercise of

NOTE J -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The Company, as well as other steel companies, is subject to demanding
environmental standards imposed by Federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. For 1993, 1994, and 1995 aggregate capital expenditures for
environmental control projects totaled approximately $8.0 million, $8.7 million
and $5.9 million, respectively. In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the Company paid $.1
million, $.6 million and less than $.1 million, respectively, in civil penalties
from previously established reserves. The Company is currently funding its share
of remediation costs of certain hazardous wastes sites. The Company believes
that these remediation costs are not significant and will not be significant in
the foreseeable future. Based upon the Company's prior capital expenditures,
anticipated capital expenditures, consent agreements negotiated with Federal and
state agencies and information available to the Company on pending judicial and
administrative proceedings, the Company does not expect its environmental
compliance costs, including the incurrence of any additional fines and penalties
relating to the operation of its facilities, to have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
 
     The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("Superfund") or similar state statutes at six waste sites. The Company is
subject to joint and several liability imposed by Superfund on potentially
responsible parties. Due to the technical and regulatory complexity of remedial
activities and the difficulties attendant to identifying potentially responsible
parties and allocating or determining liability among them, the Company is
unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of compliance with superfund
laws. The Company believes, based upon information currently available, that the
Company's liability for clean up and remediation costs in connection with one of
these sites will be between $1 million and $4 million. At four other sites the
costs are estimated to aggregate between $25,000 and $250,000. The Company lacks
sufficient information regarding the remaining sites to form an estimate. The
Company is currently funding its share of remediation costs. The Company
believes that these remediation costs are not significant and will not be
significant in the forseeable future. Non-current accrued environmental
liabilities totaled $7.3 million at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994.
These liabilities were determined by the Company when the Company reorganized
under the federal bankruptcy laws in January 1991, based on all available
information, including information provided by third parties, and existing laws
and regulations then in effect, and are reviewed and adjusted quarterly as new
information becomes available. Based upon all available information, the Company
does not anticipate that assessment and remediation costs resulting from the
Company being a potentially responsible party will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, as further
information comes into the Company's possession, it will continue to reassess
such evaluations.
 
     The amounts cited above are estimates based on the most recent information
management has at December 31, 1995. Due to the uncertainty involved in
estimating the above costs, it is reasonably possible that a change in the
estimates may occur in the near term as more information becomes available.
 
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
 
     The Company's current labor agreement with the USWA expires on October 1,
1996. Approximately 70% of the Company workforce are covered by the collective
bargaining agreement. It is likely that the

USWA will request that the Company adopt a defined benefit pension plan for the
benefit of the Company's employees represented by the USWA in the next labor
agreement. The cost of such a defined benefit pension plan is not known at this
time.

     The Company has a 35.7% ownership in Wheeling-Nisshin. Wheeling-Nisshin had
total debt outstanding at December 31, 1995 of approximately $36.7 million.
During 1995, the Company derived approximately 13.8% of its revenue from sales
of steel to Wheeling-Nisshin and at December 31, 1995 had a receivable from
Wheeling-Nisshin of $6.3 million. The Company received dividends of $2.5 million

NOTE P -- SALE OF RECEIVABLES
 
     In August 1994 Wheeling-Pittsburgh Funding, Inc. a special purpose
wholly-owned subsidiary ("Funding") of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation
("WPSC"), entered into an agreement to sell (up to $75 million on a revolving
basis) an undivided percentage ownership in a designated pool of accounts
receivable generated by WPSC, Wheeling Construction Products, Inc. and
Pittsburgh Canfield Corporation. The agreement expires in August 1999. In July
1995 WPSC amended such agreement to sell an additional $20 million on similar
terms and conditions. In October 1995 WPSC entered into an agreement to include
the receivable generated by Unimast, in the pool of accounts receivable sold.
Accounts receivable at December 31, 1995 and 1994 exclude $67 million and $45
million, respectively, representing uncollected accounts receivable sold with
recourse limited to the extent of uncollectible balances. Fees of $4.3 million
paid by the Company under this agreement were based upon a fixed rate set on the
date the initial $45 million of receivables were sold and variable rates on
subsequent sales that range from 6.219% to 9.0% of the outstanding amount of
receivables sold. Based on the Company's collection history, the Company
believes that credit risk associated with the above arrangement is immaterial.

<PAGE>   37
(each a "Swing Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day

Loans made by it and the Swing Bank's Ratable Portion of the outstanding Letter
of Credit Obligations. The Swing Bank shall be entitled to rely on the most
recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to the Agent.

                  2.3. Making the Loans. (a) Except as provided for in Sections
2.4(a), 2.9(b), 2.17(h) and 2.18, each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made
on notice, given by the Borrower to the Agent (x) in the case of a Revolving
Credit Borrowing requested to refinance a Swing Loan, not later than 12:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on one Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Revolving Credit Borrowing and (y) in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing
requested as a direct advance to the Borrower, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing. Each
such notice shall be executed by an officer of the Borrower indicated on
Schedule 2.3 or such other persons as agreed to, in writing, by the Agent (a
"Notice of Borrowing"), which notice shall be in substantially the form of
Exhibit B, specifying therein (i) the date of such proposed Borrowing, (ii) the
aggregate amount of such proposed Borrowing and (iii) a statement that the
proposed Borrowing does not exceed the Available Credit. The Revolving Credit
Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.

                  (b) Each Swing Loan Borrowing shall be made on notice, given
by the Borrower to the Swing Bank not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time)
on the Business Day of the proposed Swing Loan Borrowing. All Swing Loans shall
be made as Base Rate Loans.

                  (c) The Agent shall give to each Lender prompt notice of the
Agent's receipt of a Notice of Borrowing. Each Lender shall, (x) in the case of
a Revolving Credit Borrowing requested to refinance a Swing Loan, before 12:00
P.M. (New York City time) and (y) in the case of a Revolving Credit Loan
requested as a direct advance to the Borrower, before 2:00 P.M. (New York City
time), in each case on the date of the proposed Borrowing, make available for
the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent's Account, in
immediately available funds, such Lender's Ratable Portion of such proposed
Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent
will promptly make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address. In determining whether such applicable conditions have been satisfied,
the Agent shall be entitled to rely on the most recent Borrowing Base
Certificate received from the Borrower.



                                      -28-
<PAGE>   38
                  (d) Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount of not less than $100,000. Each Swing Loan shall be in the amount of not
less than $100,000 unless a lower amount is permitted by the Swing Bank in its
sole discretion from time to time.

                  (e) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding
on the Borrower.

                  (f) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender
will not make available to the Agent such Lender's Ratable Portion of such
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
Ratable Portion of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing available to the
Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.3 and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have so made such portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on the next Business
Day following the day on which the Lender does not make such portion available
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Revolving Credit Loans comprising such Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender
shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement. If the Borrower shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount,
such payment shall not relieve such Lender of any obligation it may have to the
Borrower hereunder.

                  (g) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by
it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

                  2.4. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
benefit of each Lender a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") on the daily
unused portion of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment from the date hereof
until the Termination Date at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per annum, payable in
arrears on (i) the first day of each month during the term of such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment and (ii) the Termination Date. If the Borrower fails
to pay (either from the proceeds of a Borrowing or otherwise) any Commitment Fee
when due, such Commitment Fee shall immediately constitute, without necessity of
further act or 


                                      -29-
<PAGE>   39
evidence, a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower. All Revolving Credit Loans
made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be made as Base Rate Loans.

                  (b) The Borrower has agreed to pay to Citibank additional
fees, the amount and dates of payment of which are embodied in a separate
agreement by and between the Borrower and Citibank dated September 18, 1995.

                  2.5. Reduction and Termination of the Revolving Credit
Commitments. The Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' prior notice

of the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders; provided,
however, that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of not
less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

                  2.6. Repayment. The Borrower shall repay the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Loans on the Termination Date.

                  2.7. Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have no right to
prepay the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan or any Swing Loan other
than as provided in this Section 2.7.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the Swing Loans in whole or ratably in part.

                  (c) (i) The Borrower may at any time prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans in whole or ratably in part with the proceeds of
Collateral.

                  (ii) The Borrower may, upon at least one Business Day's prior
notice to the Agent stating the proposed date of the prepayment, prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans in whole (together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment) or ratably in part. Upon the giving of
such notice of prepayment, the principal amount of the Loans specified to be
prepaid shall become due and payable on the date specified for each such
prepayment.

                  (iii) The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, prepay an
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising part of the
same Borrowing and Swing Loans equal to the amount by which (A) (I) the sum of
the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, Letter of Credit
Obligations and Swing Loans then outstanding minus (II) the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral
Account exceeds (B) the lesser of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the
Borrowing Base.


                                      -30-
<PAGE>   40
                  (iv) Any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) shall
be applied first to the Swing Loans outstanding and, if no Swing Loans are
outstanding, then, to the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding. If (A) the only
Loans outstanding are Eurodollar Rate Loans, (B) there are no Letter of Credit
Obligations immediately due and payable, (C) the application of such immediately
available funds will cause the Borrower to incur an obligation under Section
10.4 and (D) there is no Default or Event of Default then continuing, then such
prepayment shall be deposited into the Cash Collateral Account and shall be
retained therein until one of the conditions set forth in clauses (A) through
(D) are no longer met, in which case such funds shall be applied as provided in
this Section 2.7(c); provided, however, that at any time the only condition not
met is the condition specified in clause (B), then such funds shall be applied
to fund the L/C Cash Collateral Account.

                  (d) After the occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or
a Triggering Condition and until such Default or Event of Default has been cured
or waived or the occurrence of a Triggering Condition Unwind, all immediately
available funds in the Concentration Account shall be applied on the date on
which they are immediately available first to the outstanding principal amount
of the Swing Loans, next to the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans, and next to the other Obligations (other than any Letter of Credit
Obligations), as more fully described in Section 5 of the Cash Collateral
Account Agreement. Thereafter, the Borrower may direct the disposition of any
funds remaining in the Concentration Account and the Investment Account;
provided that, if a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then such funds in the Concentration Account and the Investment
Account shall be used to cash collateralize the Letter of Credit Obligations,
and thereafter, the Borrower shall direct the disposition of such remaining
funds.

                  (e) All proceeds of Collateral received by the Secured Parties
after the giving of notice to the Borrower pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of the
first sentence of Section 8.2 shall be applied first to fund the L/C Cash
Collateral Account, and if the L/C Cash Collateral Account has been fully funded
pursuant to Section 8.3, to repay any Swing Loans then outstanding together with
accrued interest thereon, and if no Swing Loans or accrued interest are
outstanding, ratably, to repay all other Loans outstanding together with accrued
interest thereon, and if no such Loans or accrued interest are outstanding, then
to repay the Secured Parties, ratably, in respect of all other Obligations
hereunder.

                  2.8. Conversion/Continuation Option. The Borrower may elect
(i) at any time to convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof to Eurodollar
Rate Loans or (ii) at the end of any Interest Period with respect thereto, to
convert Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans, or to
continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof for an additional
Interest Period; provided, however, that the aggregate of the Eurodollar Rate
Loans for each Interest 


                                      -31-
<PAGE>   41
Period therefor must be in the amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each conversion or continuation shall be allocated
among the Revolving Credit Loans of all Lenders in accordance with their Ratable
Portion. Each such election shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit D
hereto (a "Notice of Conversion or Continuation") and shall be made by giving
the Agent at least three Business Days' prior written notice thereof specifying
(A) the amount and type of conversion or continuation, and (B) in the case of a
conversion, the date of conversion (which date shall be a Business Day and, if a
conversion from Eurodollar Rate Loans, shall also be the last day of the
Interest Period therefor). No conversion of any Swing Loan from a Base Rate Loan
may be made. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion or Continuation and of the contents thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no conversion in whole or in part of Base Rate
Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, and no continuation in whole or in part of
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon the expiration of any Interest Period therefor, shall
be permitted at any time at which a Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing. If, within the time period required under the terms
of this Section 2.8, the Agent does not receive a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation from the Borrower containing a permitted election to continue any
Eurodollar Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period or to convert any such
Loans, or on any date the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate
Loans comprising any Borrowing is reduced, by payment or prepayment or
otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, then, upon the expiration of the Interest
Period therefor, such Loans will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans.
Each Notice of Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable.

                  2.9. Interest. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date thereof until the principal
amount thereof shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                  (i) Base Rate Loans. For Base Rate Loans, at a rate per annum
         equal at all times to the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate in
         effect from time to time, payable in arrears monthly on the first day
         of each month and on the Termination Date; provided, however, that
         during the continuance of an Event of Default, Base Rate Loans shall
         bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all
         times to 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from time to time
         plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (ii) Eurodollar Rate Loans. For Eurodollar Rate Loans, at a
         rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for
         the applicable Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan plus the
         Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on
         each day during such Interest Period which occurs on the first day of a
         month and on the last day of such Interest Period; provided, however,
         that during the continuance of an Event of Default, all Eurodollar Rate
         Loans shall bear interest, payable on 


                                      -32-
<PAGE>   42
         demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% above the
         Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan plus the Applicable
         Margin.

                  (b) If the Borrower fails to pay any interest when due, such
interest shall immediately constitute, without necessity of further act or
evidence, a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower.

                  2.10. Interest Rate Determination. (a) The Eurodollar Rate for
each Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be determined by the Agent
two Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period.

                  (b) The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of
Section 2.8.

                  (c) If, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, any Lender
notifies the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period therefor
will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lender of making such Loans or
funding or maintaining its respective Eurodollar Rate Loans for such Interest
Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders,
whereupon;

                  (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically, on the last
         day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into a Base
         Rate Loan; and

                  (ii) the obligations of all the Lenders to make Eurodollar
         Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans
         shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower that such
         Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension
         no longer exist.

                  2.11. Increased Costs. If, due to either (i) the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation (other
than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements
included in determining the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) or (ii)
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or making,
funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans or of agreeing to issue or of
issuing or maintaining Letters of Credit, then the Borrower shall from time to
time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost. A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower
and the Agent by such Lender Party, shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error. If the Borrower so notifies the Agent within
five Business Days after any Lender Party notifies the Borrower of any increased
cost pursuant to the foregoing provisions 


                                      -33-
<PAGE>   43
of this Section 2.11, the Borrower may convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of all
Lenders then outstanding into Base Rate Loans, in accordance with Section 2.8
and, additionally, reimburse such Lender Party for such increased cost in
accordance with this Section 2.11.

                  2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the
interpretation of, any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central
bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof and
demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, (i) the
obligation of such Lender to make or to continue Eurodollar Rate Loans and to
convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall terminate and (ii) the
Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender
then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, unless the Borrower,
within five Business Days of such notice and demand, converts all Eurodollar
Rate Loans of all Lenders then outstanding into Base Rate Loans.

                  2.13. Capital Adequacy. If (i) the introduction of, or any
change in or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation, (ii) the
compliance with any law or regulation, or (iii) compliance with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law), affects or would affect the amount of capital required
or expected to be maintained by any Lender Party or any corporation controlling
any Lender Party and such Lender Party reasonably determines that such amount is
based upon the existence of such Lender Party's Commitment and Loans and other
commitments and loans of this type including, without limitation, such Lender
Party's commitments in respect of Letters of Credit (or similar contingent
obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand
to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such
Lender Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender Party, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the light of such
circumstances, to the extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's
Commitment or Loans and such Lender Party's agreements herein with respect to
the issuance or maintenance of Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such
amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender Party shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.

                  2.14. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make
each payment hereunder and under the Revolving Credit Notes not later than 12:00
P.M. (New York City time) (except for payments made pursuant to Section 2.7(e)
which shall be credited no later than when received by the Agent) on the day
when due, in Dollars, to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.2 in
immediately 


                                      -34-
<PAGE>   44
available funds without set-off or counterclaim. The Agent will, on the Business
Day of its receipt thereof, cause to be distributed like funds relating to the
payment of principal of or interest on the Loans (other than Swing Loans) or
fees with respect to any Loans (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, or 2.17(h)) to the Lenders, in accordance with their
respective Ratable Portions, for the account of their respective Applicable
Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount
payable to any Lender Party to such Lender Party for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that payment of principal of the
Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(e) need not be distributed by the Agent
prior to the Settlement Date referred to in Section 2.18. With respect to the
Swing Loans, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds relating to the payment of principal of or interest on the Swing Loans to
the Swing Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 10.7, from and after the
effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all
payments hereunder and under the Revolving Credit Notes in respect of the
interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the
parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments
in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between
themselves. Payment received by the Agent after 12:00 P.M. (New York City time)
shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day (except for payments
made pursuant to Section 2.7(e) which shall be credited no later than when
received by the Agent). Prior to the distribution of any funds to any Lender
Party pursuant to this Section 2.14, the Agent shall use its best efforts to
notify such Lender Party of such distribution.

                  (b) Upon the occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or a
Triggering Condition, all amounts on deposit in each of the Blocked Account and
the Cash Collateral Account shall be applied by the Agent against the
outstanding balance of the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.7(d);
provided, however, that in no event shall any amount be required to be applied
by the Agent against the outstanding balance of the Obligations unless and until
such amount shall have been credited in immediately available funds to the
Blocked Account or the Cash Collateral Account.

                  (c) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party, if and
to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder,
to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with
such Lender Party any amount so due or to treat any amounts due hereunder as
having been paid by proceeds of a Revolving Credit Borrowing. The Borrower and
the Lender Parties hereby authorize the Swing Bank to pay directly any amount
due hereunder and to treat such payment as a Swing Loan.



                                      -35-
<PAGE>   45
                  (d) All computations of interest and fees shall be made by the
Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, and the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest and fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

                  (e) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Revolving
Credit Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or
fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan to be made in
the next calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

                  (f) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder to any Lender
Party hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such
date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each such Lender Party on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender Party. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not
have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each such Lender Party shall
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  2.15. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder, under the Revolving Credit Notes and under the Letter of Credit
Reimbursement Agreements shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.14, free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, (i) in the case of each Lender Party and the Agent,
taxes measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case
may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) in the case of
each Lender Party, taxes (including, but not limited to, the Branch Profits Tax
under Section 884 of the Code) measured by its net income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender Party's Applicable Lending
Office or any political subdivision thereof and (iii) in the case of each Lender
Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States,
United States federal withholding tax payable with respect to payments by the
Borrower which would not have been imposed had such Lender Party, to the extent
then required thereunder, delivered to the Borrower and the Agent the forms
prescribed by Section 2.15(f) (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If the Borrower 


                                      -36-
<PAGE>   46
shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Lender Party or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including, without limitation, deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.15) such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) the Borrower shall
deliver to the Agent evidence of such payment to the relevant taxation or other
authority.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or
any applicable foreign jurisdiction which arise from any payment made by the
Borrower hereunder or under any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement or from
the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any
Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender Party and the
Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 2.15) imposed on or paid by such Lender Party or the
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including, without limitation, for
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender
Party or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. Any such
demand shall show in reasonable detail the amount payable and the calculations
used to determine, in good faith, such amount and shall provide reasonably
acceptable proof of payment of such Tax or Other Tax.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or
Other Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to
in Section 10.2, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder
made (i) by or on behalf of the Borrower other than by a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) out of funds from
an account outside the United States, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent a
certificate from each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of counsel
acceptable to the Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from
or not subject to Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (f),
the term "United States" shall have the meaning specified in Section 7701 of the
Code.



                                      -37-
<PAGE>   47
                  (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower
contained in this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in full of principal
and interest hereunder and the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  (f) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the Effective Date in the
case of each Lender Party listed on the signature pages hereof, and on the date
of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in
the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter if
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent (unless such Lender Party is
unable to do so by reason of a change in law (including, without limitation, any
statute, treaty, ruling, determination or regulation) occurring subsequent to
the Effective Date or date of Assignment and Acceptance, as the case may be),
each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United
States shall provide the Agent and the Borrower with two original IRS Forms 4224
or 1001, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate or document
prescribed by the IRS, certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax with respect to all
payments to be made to such Lender Party hereunder, under any Revolving Credit
Note and under any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement. If any form or
document referred to in this subsection (f) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or
4224 that the Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender
Party shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to
include in such form or document such confidential information. Unless the
Borrower and the Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to
them indicating that payments hereunder, under any Revolving Credit Note or
under any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement are not subject to United
States withholding tax, the Borrower or the Agent shall, in the case of payments
to or for any Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United States, (i) withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable
statutory rate, or at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty (provided that
the Borrower and the Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory
to them indicating that such reduced rate applies) and (ii) pay such Lender
Party such payment net of any taxes withheld; provided, however, that should a
Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender Party
shall reasonably request to assist such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

                  2.16. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Loans (other than Swing Loans)
made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.7, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 or
2.17(h)) in excess of its Ratable Portion of payments on account of the Loans
(other than Swing Loans) obtained by all 


                                      -38-
<PAGE>   48
the Lender Parties, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other
Lender Parties such participations in their Loans (other than Swing Loans) as
shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender
Party, such purchase from each Lender Party shall be rescinded and such Lender
Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the
extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender
Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The
Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing a participation from another
Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including, without limitation, the
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                  2.17. Letter of Credit Facility. (a) On the terms and subject
to the conditions contained in this Agreement, each Issuer agrees to issue one
or more Letters of Credit at the request of the Borrower for the account of the
Borrower from time to time during the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Termination Date; provided, however, that no Issuer shall issue
any Letter of Credit if:

                  (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
         Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or
         restrain such Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit or any
         Requirement of Law applicable to such Issuer or any request or
         directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
         Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuer shall
         prohibit, or request that such Issuer refrain from, the issuance of
         letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or
         shall impose upon such Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any
         restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuer is
         not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the date hereof or result
         in any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in
         effect or known to such Issuer as of the date hereof and which such
         Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

                  (ii) such Issuer shall have received written notice from any
         Lender Party or the Borrower, on or prior to the Business Day prior to
         the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or
         more of the applicable conditions contained in Article III is not then
         satisfied;



                                      -39-
<PAGE>   49
                  (iii) the amount of the Letter of Credit requested exceeds the
         Available Credit or, upon the issuance of the requested Letter of
         Credit, the Letter of Credit Undrawn Amounts would exceed $35,000,000;
         or

                  (iv) fees due in connection with a requested issuance have not
         been paid.

None of the Lender Parties (other than the Issuers) shall have any obligation to
issue any Letters of Credit.

                  (b) In no event shall:

                  (i) the expiration date of any Letter of Credit be more than
         one year after the date of issuance thereof, nor shall the expiration
         date of any Letter of Credit fall after the date that is 60 days prior
         to the Termination Date; except that any such Letter of Credit may also
         be on the following terms: such Letter of Credit shall have an initial
         one year term which shall be automatically extended for successive
         one-year terms (but in no case may such Letter of Credit be extended
         such that its expiration date falls after the date that is 60 days
         prior to the Termination Date); provided, however, that such a Letter
         of Credit shall not be automatically extended if either (A) the
         beneficiary of such Letter of Credit is sent a notice that an Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing at any time prior to the
         date that is 30 days prior to the date of such extension or (B) the
         Borrower requests in writing no later than 40 days prior to the date of
         such extension that the term of such Letter of Credit shall not be
         extended; or

                  (ii) any Issuer issue any Letter of Credit for the purpose of
         supporting the issuance of any letter of credit by any other Person
         except with the prior written consent of the Agent.

                  (c) Prior to the issuance of each Letter of Credit, and as a
condition of such issuance and of the participation of each Lender (other than
the Issuer thereof) in the Letter of Credit Obligations arising with respect
thereto, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Issuer thereof a letter of
credit reimbursement agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Issuer (as the
same as may be amended or otherwise modified, a "Letter of Credit Reimbursement
Agreement"), signed by the Borrower, and such other documents or items as may be
required pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise reasonably required by the
Issuer. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any Letter of Credit
Reimbursement Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
govern.

                  (d) In connection with the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
the Borrower shall give the Issuer thereof and the Agent at least two Business
Days' prior 


                                      -40-
<PAGE>   50
written notice of its requested issuance of a Letter of Credit in substantially
the form of Exhibit C (a "Letter of Credit Request"). Such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the stated amount of the Letter of Credit
requested, which stated amount shall not be less than $50,000, the date of
issuance of such requested Letter of Credit (which day shall be a Business Day),
the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire, and the Person for whose
benefit the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued. Such notice, to be
effective, must be received by such Issuer and the Agent not later than 11:00
A.M. (New York City time) on or prior to the last Business Day on which notice
can be given under the immediately preceding sentence. Prior to the close of
business on the Business Day following the Business Day on which the Agent first
receives such notice, the Agent shall confirm to the Issuer of the requested
Letter of Credit whether the applicable conditions in Article III are satisfied
as of such date.

                  (e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.17
and provided that the applicable conditions set forth in Article III have been
satisfied, such Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit on
behalf of the Borrower in accordance with the Issuer's usual and customary
business practices.

                  (f) Immediately upon the issuance by an Issuer of a Letter of
Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each
Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and
received from such Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest
and participation, to the extent of such Lender's Ratable Portion, in such
Letter of Credit and the obligations of the Borrower with respect thereto
(including, without limitation, all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect
thereto) and any security therefor and guaranty pertaining thereto and each
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent of such
Lender's Ratable Portion of such Letter of Credit Obligations.

                  (g) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit,
no Issuer shall have any obligation relative to the Lenders other than to
confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit
appear to have been delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with
the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken
or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not
put such Issuer under any resulting liability to any Lender, or diminish the
Agent's or any Lender's obligations hereunder to the Issuer.

                  (h) In the event that any Issuer makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit and the Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to such
Issuer pursuant to Section 2.17(l), such Issuer shall promptly notify the Agent,
which shall promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall
promptly and unconditionally pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuer the
amount of such Lender's 


                                      -41-
<PAGE>   51
Ratable Portion of such payment in Dollars and in same day funds (and upon
receipt the Agent shall promptly pay the same to the Issuer); provided, however,
if the Swing Bank so elects and if a Swing Loan can be made in such amount, the
Agent shall promptly notify the Swing Bank of such failure, and the Swing Bank
shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuer the amount of such payment
in Dollars and in same day funds. This Revolving Credit Loan shall be made, or
the Swing Loan may be made, notwithstanding the Borrower's failure to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 3.3. If the Agent so notifies such Lender
prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any Business Day, such Lender shall
make available to the Agent for the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion
of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day funds. If and to
the extent such Lender shall not have so made such Lender's Ratable Portion of
the amount of such payment available to the Agent for the account of such
Issuer, such Lender agrees to repay to the Agent for the account of such Issuer
forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from such date until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent for the account
of such Issuer, at the Federal Funds Rate. The failure of any Lender to make
available to the Agent for the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion of any
such payment shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to
make available to the Agent for the account of such Issuer its Ratable Portion
of any payment on the date such payment is to be made, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make available to the Agent
for the account of any Issuer such other Lender's Ratable Portion of any such
payment.

                  (i) Whenever any Issuer receives a payment of a Reimbursement
Obligation as to which the Agent has received for the account of such Issuer any
payment from a Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(h) (and such amount has been paid
to such Issuer), the Issuer shall pay to the Agent such amount so received and
the Agent shall promptly pay to each Lender which has paid such Lender's Ratable

<PAGE>   52
                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
         or any of the Collateral Documents;

                  (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right which the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary
         named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or
         any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Agent, any
         Lender Party or any other Person, whether in connection with this
         Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein
         or any unrelated transactions (including, without limitation, any
         underlying transaction between the Borrower and the beneficiary named
         in any Letter of Credit);

                  (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented
         under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the
         performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Collateral
         Documents; or

                  (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

                  (l) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuer the amount of
all Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuer under any Letter of Credit
immediately when due, irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
which the Borrower may have at any time against such Issuer or any other Person.
The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuer for all amounts which such Issuer
pays under such Letter of Credit no later than the time specified in such Letter
of Credit Reimbursement Agreement. If the Borrower does not pay (either from the
proceeds of a Borrowing or otherwise) any such Reimbursement Obligation when
due, such Reimbursement Obligation shall immediately constitute, without
necessity of further act or evidence, a Loan made by the relevant Issuer payable
on demand or, to the extent the Agent has received any payments from Lenders for
the account of such Issuer pursuant to Section 2.17(h), Revolving Credit Loans
made by such Lenders (which, in the case of each Lender, shall be to the extent
of such Lender's Ratable Portion of such Reimbursement Obligation) to the
Borrower, in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Reimbursement
Obligation remaining unpaid, or, to the extent the Agent has received any
payments from the Swing Bank for the account of such Issuer pursuant to Section
2.17(h), Swing Loans made by the Swing Bank, computed from the date on which
such Reimbursement Obligation arose to the date of repayment in full thereof at
the rate of interest applicable to past due Revolving Credit Loans at a rate
based on the Base Rate during such period. If any payment made by or on behalf
of the Borrower and received by any Issuer with respect to any Letter of Credit
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by such Issuer for any reason, each
Lender shall, upon notice by such Issuer, forthwith pay over to such 


                                      -43-
<PAGE>   53
Issuer an amount equal to such Lender's Ratable Portion of the amount which must
be so returned by such Issuer or the Swing Bank may, upon notice to the Issuer,
forthwith pay over to such Issuer an amount equal to the amount which must be
returned by such Issuer.

                  (m) The Borrower agrees to pay the following amounts with
respect to Letters of Credit issued for it:

                  (i) to the Agent, for the benefit of each Lender who has
         purchased or has been deemed to have purchased participations in the
         Letters of Credit, with respect to each standby Letter of Credit or
         documentary Letter of Credit, an administrative fee equal to a rate per
         annum equal at all times to the Applicable Margin for Letter of Credit
         Fees multiplied by the average daily maximum amount available from time
         to time to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, payable monthly in
         arrears and on the termination of such Letter of Credit, and, in each
         case, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number
         of days elapsed; provided, however, that, during the continuance of an
         Event of Default, such administrative fee shall increase by 2% per
         annum and shall be payable on demand;

                  (ii) to each Issuer, with respect to each standby Letter of
         Credit or documentary Letter of Credit issued by such Issuer, 0.375%
         per annum of the average daily maximum amount available from time to
         time to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, payable monthly in
         arrears and on the termination of such Letter of Credit, and, in each
         case calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of
         days elapsed; and

                  (iii) to each Issuer, with respect to the issuance, amendment
         or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each drawing made thereunder,
         issuance, documentary, processing and other charges in accordance with
         such Issuer's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time
         of issuance, amendment, transfer or drawing, as the case may be.

                  2.18. Settlement of Accounts. The Agent shall notify each
Lender no less frequently than weekly, as determined by the Agent, of the
principal amount of Swing Loans outstanding as of 1:00 P.M. (New York City time)
as of such date (the "Computation Date") and each Lender's Ratable Portion
thereof. Each Lender shall before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the next
Business Day (the "Settlement Date") make available to the Agent, in immediately
available funds, the amount of its Ratable Portion of such principal amount of
Swing Loans outstanding. Upon such payment by a Lender, such Lender shall be
deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower, notwithstanding any
failure by the Borrower to satisfy the conditions in Section 3.3. The Agent
shall use such funds to repay the principal 


                                      -44-
<PAGE>   54
amount of Swing Loans to the Swing Bank. All interest due on the Swing Loans
shall be payable to the Swing Bank in accordance with Sections 2.9 and 2.14.

                  2.19. The Blocked Account. (a) The Borrower has established
and shall maintain, pursuant to the Blocked Account Letter, an account with PNC
Bank, N.A., account number 0002881016, in the name and under the sole dominion
and control of the Agent (the "Blocked Account").

                  (b) As collateral security for the Obligations, the Borrower
hereby transfers, assigns and pledges to the Agent and grants to the Agent a
Lien on and security interest in, for the benefit of the Secured Parties on a
first priority basis, all of the right, title and interest of the Borrower in
the Blocked Account and all cash, deposits, Cash Equivalents and other
instruments held in the Blocked Account, as security for the Obligations. The
Agent shall possess sole dominion and control over the Blocked Account as
provided in the Blocked Account Letter. Except as provided in Section 2.7(d) and
the Blocked Account Letter, as long as any of the Obligations remain unpaid or
any of the Commitments are outstanding, the Borrower agrees that neither the
Borrower nor any Person or entity claiming by, through or under the Borrower
shall have any control over the use of, or any right to effect a withdrawal
from, the Blocked Account. All amounts in the Blocked Account shall be applied
to the Obligations by the Agent as specified in Section 2.7(d).

                  (c) Except for the funds held in the bank accounts otherwise
permitted by Section 7.17, the Borrower shall cause all cash, Cash Equivalents,
checks, notes, drafts or similar items of payments received by it which
constitute (i) payments from account debtors for Accounts not sold pursuant to
the Receivables Securitization, including, without limitation, all intercompany
receivables and (ii) proceeds of all other Collateral to be deposited on the
date of receipt thereof or the next Business Day following receipt thereof in
the Blocked Account.

                  4.20. Intellectual Property. The Loan Parties and their
Subsidiaries own or license or otherwise have the right to use all material
licenses, permits, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark
applications, service marks, trade names, copyrights, copyright applications,
franchises, authorizations and other intellectual property rights that are
necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, without infringement
upon or conflict with the rights of any other Person with respect thereto,
including, without limitation, all trade names, except where such failure would
have no Material Adverse Effect. To the best knowledge of the Borrower, no
slogan or other advertising device, product, process, method, substance, part or
other material now employed, or now contemplated to be employed, by any Loan
Party or any of its Subsidiaries infringes upon or conflicts with any rights
owned by any other Person, and no claim or litigation regarding any of the
foregoing is pending or threatened, other than those which in the aggregate
would have no

Material Adverse Effect. No patent, invention, device, application, principle or
any statute, law, rule, regulation, standard or code relating thereto is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, proposed, other than those the
consequences of which, in the aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  4.21. Title. (a) The Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries own
fee simple absolute title to all of the Real Estate described in Schedule
4.21(a), as may be supplemented from time to time pursuant to Section 6.11(n),
and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests pursuant to the Leases in,
all other properties and assets purported to be owned by any Loan Party or any
of their Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, valid leasehold interests
pursuant to the Leases and all property reflected in the balance sheet referred
to in Section 4.5(a), except for such failures which in the aggregate would have
no Material Adverse Effect. None of such properties and assets, including,
without limitation, the Real Estate and the Leases, is subject to any Lien,
except Liens permitted hereunder. The Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries have
received all deeds, assignments, waivers, consents, non-disturbance and
recognition or similar agreements, bills of sale and other documents, and have
duly effected all recordings, filings and other actions necessary to establish,
protect and perfect such Loan Parties and its Subsidiaries' right, title and
interest in and to all such property except for such failures which would in the
aggregate have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) All real property leased, with an annual base rent of at
least $100,000, at the date of this Agreement by any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries is listed on Schedule 4.21(b), as may be supplemented from time to
time pursuant to Section 6.11(n), setting forth information regarding the
commencement date, termination date, renewal options and purchase options (if
any) and annual base rents as specified therein. Each of such leases is valid
and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect
other than those leases which if not valid and enforceable, would in the
aggregate have no Material Adverse Effect. None of any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any other party to any such
lease is in default of its obligations thereunder or has delivered or received
any notice of default under any such lease and no event has occurred which, with
the giving of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute a default
under any such lease, except, in either case, for defaults the consequence of
which in the aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Except as listed on Schedule 4.21(c), as may be
supplemented from time to time pursuant to Section 6.11(n), neither any Loan
Party nor any of its Subsidiaries owns or holds, or is obligated under or a
party to, any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right to
purchase, acquire, sell, assign or dispose of any real property owned or leased
by such Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (d) All components of all improvements included within the
real property owned or leased by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Improvements"), including, without limitation, the roofs and
structural elements thereof and the heating, ventilation, air conditioning,
plumbing, electrical, mechanical, sewer, waste water, storm water, paving and
parking equipment, systems and facilities included therein, are in good working
order and repair other than such failures the consequences of which in the
aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect. All water, gas, electrical,
steam, compressed air, telecommunication, sanitary and storm sewage lines and
systems and other similar systems serving the real property owned or leased by
any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries are installed and operating and are
sufficient to enable the real property owned or leased by such Loan Party and
its Subsidiaries to continue to be used and operated in the manner currently
being used and operated other than such failures which in the aggregate would
have no Material Adverse Effect, and neither any Loan Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any fact or condition that could result in the
termination or material impairment of the furnishing thereof, other than such
failures which in the aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect. No
Improvement or portion thereof is dependent for its access, operation or utility
on any land, building or other Improvement not included in the real property
owned or leased by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries except where the
consequences of such in the aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) All Permits required to have been issued or appropriate to
enable all real property owned or leased by any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries to be lawfully occupied and used for all of the purposes for which
they are currently occupied and used, have been lawfully issued and are in full
force and effect, other than such failures the consequences of which in the
aggregate would have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice, nor has any knowledge, of any pending, threatened or
contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any real property owned or leased
by such Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any
proposed termination or impairment of any parking at any such owned or leased
real property or of any sale or other disposition of any real property owned or
leased by such Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof in lieu
of condemnation, except for notices affecting real property which in the
aggregate, if lost, would have no Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) No portion of any real property owned or leased by any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any material damage by fire
or other casualty loss which has not heretofore been completely replaced,
repaired and restored to its original condition, except to the extent that the
failure to replace, repair or restore such real property would in the aggregate
have no Material Adverse Effect.

of Default, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the consent, of the

                                      -91-
<PAGE>   101
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly

automatically be terminated and (B) the Revolving Credit Notes, all such
interest and all such Obligations shall automatically become and be due and

after the giving of notice as provided in clause (ii) above, exercise any

in same day funds at the Agent's office, for deposit in a special cash
collateral account (Account #40688567) maintained in the name of the Agent on
behalf of the Secured Parties at Citibank (the "L/C Cash Collateral Account"),
an amount equal to all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations. In the Agent's
discretion, the L/C Cash Collateral Account may be an interest or a non-interest
bearing account.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby pledges, and grants to the Agent a
Lien on and security interest in, all of its right, title and interest in and to
the L/C Cash Collateral Account, all funds held in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account from time to time and all proceeds thereof, as security for the payment
of all amounts due and to become due from the Borrower to the Secured Parties
under the Loan Documents.

                  (c) The Agent shall, from time to time after funds are
deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, apply funds then held in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account to the Issuer for the payment of any Reimbursement
Obligations owing to it and then in such order as the Agent shall determine, as
shall have become or shall become due and payable by the Borrower to the Secured
Parties in respect of the Obligations.

                  (d) Neither the Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of
or through the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held

dispose of any interest in the L/C Cash Collateral Account or any funds held
therein or (ii) create or permit to exist any Lien upon or with respect to the
L/C Cash Collateral


                                      -92-
<PAGE>   102
Account or any funds held therein, except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (f) The Agent may also exercise, in its sole discretion, in
respect of the L/C Cash Collateral Account, in addition to the other rights and
remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and
remedies of a secured party upon default under the UCC in effect in the State of
New York at that time, and the Agent may, without notice except as specified
below, sell the L/C Cash Collateral Account or any part thereof in one or more
parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Agent's offices or elsewhere,
for cash, or credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the
Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent
notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to the
Borrower of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any
private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Agent
shall not be obligated to make any sale of the L/C Cash Collateral Account,
regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent may adjourn any public
or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and
place to which it was so adjourned.

                  (g) Any cash held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, and all
cash proceeds received by the Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from
or other realization upon all or any part of the L/C Cash Collateral Account,
may, in the discretion of the Agent, then or at any time thereafter be applied
(after the expiration of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the payment of
any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.3(c) and 10.4) in whole or in part by
the Agent against all or any part of the Obligations now or hereafter existing
under any of the Loan Documents in such order as the Agent shall elect. Any
surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the Agent and remaining after the
indefeasible cash payment in full of all of the Obligations shall be paid over
to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such
surplus.

                                   ARTICLE IX

required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of
Revolving Credit Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required
to take any action which the Agent in good faith believes exposes it to personal
liability or is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees

Loan Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                  9.2. Agent's Reliance, Etc. None of the Agent or any of its
Affiliates or any of the respective directors, officers, agents or employees of

other Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful

covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents on
the part of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or to inspect the property

other Loan Party; (vi) shall not be responsible to any Lender Party for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or
purported to be created under or in connection with any Loan Document, of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (vii) shall incur no liability under
or in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents by acting
upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may
be by telegram, telecopy, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and
signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                  9.3. Citibank, Citicorp and Affiliates. With respect to its
Revolving Credit Commitment, the Loans (including, without limitation, the
Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Loans) made by it, any each Revolving Credit
Note and any Letters


                                      -94-
<PAGE>   104
of Credit issued by it, Citicorp shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as any other Lender Party and may exercise the same as though it
were not an Affiliate of the Agent; and the term "Lender Party" or "Lender
Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citicorp in its
individual capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries and any Person
who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries, all as if Citibank were not the
Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties.

                  9.4. Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in
Article IV and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and other Loan Documents.

                  9.5. Indemnification. (a) The Lender Parties severally agree
to indemnify the Agent, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and advisors (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or
other Loan Parties), from and against such Lender Party's ratable share
(determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements
(including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of legal counsel) of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against, the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents including, without
limitation, the preparation of reports with respect to the Collateral; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's (or any of its
agent's) gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and disbursements of legal counsel) incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration (including,
without limitation, field examinations of Collateral), modification, amendment
or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of, or legal advice in respect of its rights or responsibilities under, this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, to the


                                      -95-
<PAGE>   105
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower or
another Loan Party except to the extent such expenses result from the Agent's
(or any of its agent's) gross negligence or willful misconduct. For purposes of
this Section 9.5, the Lender Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount
shall be determined, at any time, according to the sum of (a) the aggregate
principal amount of the Loans outstanding at such time and owing to the
respective Lender Parties, (b) their respective Ratable Portions of the
aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding at such time plus (c) their
respective Ratable Portions of the Available Credit at such time. The failure of
any Lender Party to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any amount required to be paid by the Lender Party to the Agent as
provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its obligation
hereunder to reimburse the Agent for its ratable share of such amount, but no
Lender Party shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to
reimburse the Agent for such other Lender Party's ratable share of such amount.
Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender Party
hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender Party contained in this
Section 9.5(a) shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all
other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify each
Issuer (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against
such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Issuer in any way relating to
or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such
Issuer under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall
be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from such Issuer's (or any of its agent's) gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to
reimburse such Issuer promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel)
payable by the Borrower under Section 10.4, to the extent that such Issuer is
not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Borrower except to
the extent such expenses result form such Issuer's (or any of its agent's) gross
negligence or willful misconduct. For purposes of this Section 9.5(b), the
Lender Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at
any time, according to the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of the
Loans outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties, (b)
their respective Ratable Portions of the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations
outstanding at such time plus (c) their respective Ratable Portions of the
Available Credit at such time. The failure of any Lender Party to reimburse such
Issuer promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be
paid by the Lender Parties to such Issuer as provided herein shall not relieve
any other Lender Party of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Issuer for


                                      -96-
<PAGE>   106
its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse such Issuer for such other
Lender Party's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival
of any other agreement of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement and
obligations of each Lender Party contained in this Section 9.5(b) shall survive
the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

                  9.6. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower. Upon any
such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent; provided, that if no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, such successor Agent shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower, which shall be (a) a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof and having
total assets of at least $1,000,000,000 and a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000 or (b) a Lender as of the Effective Date. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the removal of the retiring Agent at the request of all
of the Lenders (other than the Agent and its Affiliates), then the retiring
Agent may, on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Agent approved,
as long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, by the
Borrower, such approval not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, which successor
shall be (a) a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State thereof and having total assets of at least
$1,000,000,000 and a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b)
a Lender as of the Effective Date. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent and upon the execution and filing or
recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other
instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Majority
Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or
purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretions,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  10.1. Amendments, Etc. (a) No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, without
limitation, the waiver of any Default or Event of Default) nor consent to any
departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed (or, in the case of
the Collateral Documents, consented to) by the Borrower and the Majority
Lenders, and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by all the Lenders do any of the following at any time: (i) waive any of
the conditions specified in Sections 3.1 or 3.2 except as otherwise provided
therein; (ii) increase, or extend the expiration date of, the Revolving Credit

postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder; (v) change the percentage
of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Loans or the Letter of Credit Obligations, or the number of Lenders which
shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder;
(vi) release any of the Collateral except that, so long as no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, (A) as

(B) in any Fiscal Year, Collateral having an aggregate Fair Market Value not in
excess of $25,000,000 shall require only the consent of the Agent; (vii) amend
this Section 10.1; (viii) amend the definition of Majority Lenders; (ix)

Guaranty, the Guaranty or any other keepwell agreement or guaranty delivered

amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing
Bank or each Issuer, as the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required
above to take such action, affect the rights or obligations of the Swing Bank or
of the Issuers, as the case may be, under this Agreement, and provided further
that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the
rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) Each Lender Party grants (x) to the Agent the right to
purchase all (but not less than all) of such Lender Party's Commitments and
Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it and all of its rights and obligations
hereunder and under the

Loans owed to such Lender Party (together with all accrued and unpaid interest
and fees owed to such Lender), and (y) to the Borrower the right to cause an
assignment of all (but not less than all) of such Lender Party's Commitments and
Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it and all of its rights and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, which right may be exercised by
the Agent or the Borrower, as the case may be, if such Lender Party refuses to
execute any amendment, waiver or consent which requires the written consent of
all the Lenders and to which the Agent and the Borrower have agreed. Each Lender
Party agrees that if the Agent or the Borrower, as the case may be, exercises
its option hereunder, it shall promptly execute and deliver all agreements and
documentation necessary to effectuate such assignment as set forth in Section
10.7. Any purchase of such Lender Party's Commitments and Loans owing to it and
the Notes held by it must (i) occur within 30 Business Days from the date that
such Lender Party refuses to execute any amendment, waiver or consent which
requires the written consent of all the Lenders and to which the Agent and the
Borrower have agreed and (ii) include an amount payable to such Lender Party
which is sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for any loss, expense, or
liability as a result of any purchase of such Lender Party's Commitments and
Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it under this Section 10.1(b) which
arises out of, or is in connection with, any funds acquired by such Lender Party
to make, continue, or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan
as, or to convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into, a
Eurodollar Rate Loan.

provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including, without limitation,
telegraphic, telex, telecopy or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed,

                                      -99-
<PAGE>   109
Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered hereunder shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

                  10.3. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender Party or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder or under any Revolving Credit Note shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  10.4. Costs; Expenses; Indemnities. (a) The Borrower agrees to

Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to negotiations with any
Loan Party or with other creditors of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent, each Lender Party and their respective Affiliates, and the directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants and advisors of or to any of
the foregoing (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with
the satisfaction or attempted satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
Article III) (each of the foregoing being an "Indemnitee") from and against any
and all claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, disbursements and expenses of any kind or nature
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to
any such Indemnitee) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
any such Indemnitee in connection with or arising out of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding, whether or not any such Indemnitee is a party thereto,
whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal,


                                      -100-
<PAGE>   110
state or local law or other statutory regulation, securities or commercial law
or regulation, or under common law or in equity, or on contract, tort or
otherwise, in any manner relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, any Obligation, any Letter of Credit or any act, event or
transaction related or attendant to any thereof or in connection with any
investigation by any Governmental Authority of any potential matter covered
hereby or thereby (collectively, the "Indemnified Matters"), including, without
limitation, (i) all Environmental Liabilities and Costs arising from or
connected with the past, present or future operations of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, or damage to real or personal property or natural resources or
harm or injury alleged to have resulted from any Release; (ii) any costs or
liabilities incurred in connection with the investigation, removal, cleanup
and/or remediation of any Contaminant present or arising out of the operations
of any facility of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) any costs or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Environmental Lien; (iv) any costs
or liabilities incurred in connection with any other matter affecting any
facility pursuant to Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, CERCLA
and applicable state property transfer laws, including, without limitation,
whether, with respect to any of the foregoing, such Indemnitee is a mortgagee
pursuant to any leasehold mortgage, a mortgagee in possession, the successor in
interest to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or the owner, lessee or
operator of any facility of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries by virtue of
foreclosure, except, with respect to any of the foregoing referred to in clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), to the extent attributable solely to acts of the
Agent or such Indemnitee or any agent on behalf of the Agent or such Lender
following (x) foreclosure by the Agent or any Indemnitee, or (y) the Agent or
any Lender having become the successor in interest to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries; (v) the management of the Loans and Letters of Credit, or (vi) the
use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not have any obligation under this Section
10.4(b) to an Indemnitee with respect to any Indemnified Matter caused by or
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee.

                  (c) If any Lender receives any payment of principal of, or is
subject to a conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Loan, other than on the last day
of an Interest Period relating to such Loan, as a result of any payment or
conversion made by the Borrower (other than a payment made to the Agent pursuant
to Section 2.3(f)) or acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit Notes
pursuant to Section 8.2 or for any other reason or a conversion of a Eurodollar
Rate Loan does not occur by reason of the fourth sentence of Section 2.8, the
Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender all amounts required to
compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may
reasonably have incurred or in the future incur as a result of such payment or
conversion, including, without limitation, any actual out-of-pocket loss, cost
or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or


                                      -101-
<PAGE>   111
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or
maintain such Loan.

                  (d) The Agent and each Lender agree that in the event that any
such investigation, litigation or proceeding set forth in subparagraph (b) above
is asserted or threatened in writing or instituted against it or any other
Indemnitee, or any remedial, removal or response action is requested of it or
any of its officers, directors, agents and employees, for which any Indemnitee
may desire indemnity or defense hereunder, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify
the Borrower in writing.

                  (e) The Borrower, at the request of any Indemnitee, shall have
the obligation to defend against such investigation, litigation or proceeding or
requested remedial, removal or response action, and the Borrower, in any event,
may control the defense thereof with legal counsel of the Borrower's choice. In
the event that such Indemnitee requests the Borrower to defend against such
investigation, litigation or proceeding or requested remedial, removal or
response action, the Borrower shall promptly do so and such Indemnitee shall
have the right to have legal counsel of its choice participate in such defense
at such Indemnitee's expense. If, without the Borrower's prior written consent
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, an Indemnitee shall settle any
such investigation, litigation, proceeding or other action, such Indemnitee
shall be deemed to have waived its rights to indemnity and defense hereunder.

                  (f) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 10.4
and under Sections 2.10 and 2.12 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and
the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments.

                  10.5. Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender Party and each of its
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender Party or such Affiliate to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the
Obligations now or hereafter existing irrespective of whether or not such Lender
Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement, any Revolving Credit Note
or any Reimbursement Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
Obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender Party agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such Lender Party or its
Affiliate; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender
Party and its respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to the
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which such Lender Party and its respective Affiliates may have.

<PAGE>   112
                  10.6. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the
Agent shall have been notified by each Lender Party that such Lender Party has
executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender Party and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lender
Parties.

                  10.7. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may
sell, transfer, negotiate or assign to one or more other Lenders or Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitments, commitment to
issue Letters of Credit and the Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations owing to
it and Revolving Credit Notes held by it and a commensurate portion of its
rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided,
however, that (i) if such an assignment is of Revolving Credit Loans and
Revolving Credit Commitments, each such assignment shall be of a constant, and
not a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement with respect to Revolving Credit Loans, Letters of Credit and
Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments, Letters of Credit, Letter of Credit Obligations and Loans being
assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be
less than $5,000,000, in the case of an assignment to a Lender Party, or
$15,000,000, in the case of an assignment to a Person that is not a Lender
Party, or, in each case, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
unless such assignment is of the Lender's entire Revolving Credit Commitment,
and (iii) each assignee hereunder shall be an Eligible Assignee. The parties to
each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a fee of
$3,500 and the Revolving Credit Note (or an affidavit of loss and indemnity with
respect to such Revolving Credit Note, satisfactory to the Agent) subject to
such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (A)
the assignee thereunder shall become a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents have been assigned to such
assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender, and if such Lender was an Issuer, of an Issuer
hereunder and thereunder with respect to Letters of Credit issued after such
effective date, and (B) the assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (except for those rights which
survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder) and be released
from its obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment
and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's or
Issuer's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender or Issuer
shall cease to be a party hereto).

                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any instrument or other document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (ii) such
assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the
performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or of any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents together
with a copy of any of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.5 of
this Agreement and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender Party or any other Lender Party,
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender and, if
appropriate, an Issuer.

                  (c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted
by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lender Parties and the Revolving Credit Commitments of, Letter of Credit
Obligations owing to, and principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender
Party from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Loan
Parties, the Agent and the Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender Party for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Agent or any
Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, together with the Revolving Credit Note subject to such assignment,
the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed, (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its
own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent, in exchange for such
surrendered Revolving Credit Note, a new Revolving Credit Note to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment
assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning
Lender Party has retained a Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, a new
Revolving Credit Note to the order of the assigning Lender Party in an amount
equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new
Revolving Credit Note shall be dated the same date as the surrendered Revolving
Credit Note and be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

                  (e) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more
banks or other Persons in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Revolving Credit Commitment, the Letter of Credit Obligations owing to it and
the Loans owing to it and the Revolving Credit Note held by it). The terms of
such participation shall not, in any event, require the participant's consent to
any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan
Document, the consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, or to the
exercising or refraining from the exercise of any powers or rights which such
Lender Party may have under or in respect of the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, the right to enforce the obligations of the Loan Parties),
except if any such amendment, waiver or other modification or consent would (i)
reduce the amount, or postpone any date fixed for, any amount (whether of
principal, interest or fees) payable to such participant under the Loan
Documents to which such participant would otherwise be entitled under such
participation or (ii) result in the release of any of the Collateral, except (A)
as shall otherwise be provided in the Collateral Documents and (B) Collateral
having an aggregate Fair Market Value not in excess of $25,000,000 in any Fiscal
Year. In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender Party, (i)
such Lender Party's obligations under the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, its Revolving Credit Commitment) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender Party shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder
of such Revolving Credit Note and Obligations for all purposes of this
Agreement, (iv) such Lender Party shall disclose to the Agent the identity of
each bank or other entity purchasing a participation and the principal amount of
such participation within five Business Days after the sale and purchase of such
participation, and (v) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lender


                                      -105-
<PAGE>   115
Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

                  (f) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

                  10.8.  Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Revolving Credit
Notes and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto and thereto shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

                  10.9. Submission to Jurisdiction. (a) Any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes or any
document related thereto may be brought in the courts of the State of New York
or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and,
by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby accepts for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waive any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the laying
of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which any of them may
now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such
respective jurisdictions.

                  (b) The Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of
process of any of the aforesaid courts in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
the Borrower at its address provided herein.

                  (c) Nothing contained in this Section 10.9 shall affect the
right of the Agent or any Lender Party or any holder of a Revolving Credit Note
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

                  10.10. Section Titles. The Section titles contained in this
Agreement are and shall be without substantive meaning or content of any kind
whatsoever and are not a part of the agreement among the parties hereto.

                  10.12. No Liability of the Issuers. The Borrower assumes all
risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of
Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither any Issuer nor
any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use
that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency
or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such
documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuer against presentation of
documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including
failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the
Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing
to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have
a claim against such Issuer, and such Issuer shall be liable to the Borrower, to
the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by the
Borrower that the Borrower prove were caused by (i) such Issuer's willful
misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under
any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such
Issuer's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after
the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, such Issuer may accept documents that appear on
their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

                  10.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all of
the other Loan Documents and all certificates and documents delivered hereunder
or thereunder, and the fee letter by and between the Borrower and each of the
Lender Parties embody the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

                  10.14. Confidentiality. Each Lender Party and the Agent agree
to keep information obtained by it pursuant hereto and the other Loan Documents
confidential in accordance with such Lender Party's or the Agent's, as the case
may be, customary practices and agrees that it will only use such information in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and not disclose
any of such information other than (i) to such Lender Party's or the Agent's, as
the case may be, Affiliates, employees, representatives and agents who are or
are expected to be involved in the evaluation of such information in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who are advised of the
confidential nature of such information, (ii) to the extent such information
presently is or hereafter becomes available to such Lender Party or the Agent,
as the case may be, on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Borrower, (iii) to the extent disclosure is required by law, regulation or
judicial order (which requirement or order shall be promptly notified to the
Borrower) or requested or required by bank regulators or


                                      -107-

                  10.15. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan Documents, the Loans or
the actions of the Agent or any Lender Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance or enforcement thereof.
