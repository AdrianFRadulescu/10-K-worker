Item 1.  BUSINESS
       (a) General Development of Business. Dean Witter Diversified Futures
Fund II L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed
to engage in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and
other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, forward
contracts on foreign currencies and options on futures contracts and
physical commodities.
         Units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership were
registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 33-
24662) which became effective on October 28, 1988.  The offering of units
was underwritten on a "best efforts" basis by Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
("DWR"), a commodity broker and an affiliated corporation of the
Partnership's General Partner, Demeter Management Corporation ("Demeter"). 
The Partnership commenced operations on January 18, 1989.  The
Partnership's net asset value per unit, as of December 31, 1995, was
$2,534.82 representing a decrease of 2.90 percent from the net asset value
per unit of $2,610.40 at December 31, 1994.  For a more detailed
description of the Partnership's business see subparagraph (c).
       (b) Financial Information about Industry Segments.  The
Partnership's business comprises only one segment for financial reporting
purposes, speculative trading of commodity futures contracts and other
commodity interests.  The relevant financial information is presented in
Items 6 and 8.
       (c) Narrative Description of Business.  The Partnership is in the
business of speculative trading in commodity futures contracts and other
commodity interests, pursuant to trading instructions provided by Dean
Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc. ("DWFCM"), a wholly-owned 
<PAGE>
subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co. ("DWD") and an affiliate of DWR,
and Demeter Management Corporation ("Demeter").  For a detailed
description of the different facets of the Partnership's business,  see

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

       Liquidity.  The Partnership's assets are deposited in separate
commodity interest trading accounts with DWR, the commodity broker, and
are used by the Partnership as margin to engage in commodity futures
contract trading.  DWR holds such assets in either designated depositories
or in securities approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
("CFTC") for investment of customer funds.  The Partnership's assets held
by DWR may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading.  Since
the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in commodity futures contracts
and other commodity interests, it is expected that the Partnership will
continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.
       The Partnership's investment in commodity futures contracts and
other commodity interests may be illiquid.  If the price for a futures
contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an
amount equal to the "daily limit", positions in the commodity can neither
be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or
within the limit.  Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the
daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading.  Such
market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating
its commodity futures positions.
       There is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward
contracts on foreign currencies.  The markets for some world currencies
have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the
Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the
Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such
markets and subjecting it to substantial losses.
       Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on
redemptions.
<PAGE>
       Market Risk.  The Partnership trades futures, options and forward
contracts in interest rates, stock indices, commodities and currencies. 
In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Partnership
(market risk) that such contracts may be significantly influenced by
market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such
contracts being less valuable.  If the markets should move against all of
the commodity interest positions held by the Partnership at the same time,
and if the Trading Advisor was unable to offset commodity interest
positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its
assets.  The Partnership has established Trading Policies for liquidity
and leverage which help control market risk.  Both the Trading Advisor and
Demeter monitor the Partnership's trading activities on a daily basis to
ensure compliance with the Trading Policies.  Demeter may (under terms of
the Management Agreement) override the trading instructions of the Trading
Advisor to the extent necessary to comply with the Partnership's Trading
Policies.
       Credit Risk.  In addition to market risk, the Partnership is subject
to credit risk in that a counterparty may not be able to meet its
obligations to the Partnership.  The counterparty of the Partnership for
futures contracts traded in the United States and most foreign exchanges
on which the Partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such
exchange.  In general, clearinghouses are backed by the membership of the
exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its
members or one of its members' customers, and as such, should
significantly reduce this credit risk.  In cases where the Partnership
trades on exchanges where the clearinghouse is not backed by the
membership or when the Partnership enters into off-exchange contracts with
a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the 
<PAGE>
clearinghouse or the counterparty as the case may be.  With respect to
futures contracts, DWR, in its business as an international commodity
broker, constantly monitors the credit-worthiness of the exchanges and
clearing members of the foreign exchanges with which it does business for
clients, including the Partnership.  If DWR believes that there was a
problem with the credit-worthiness of an exchange on which the Partnership
deals, it would so advise Demeter.  With respect to forward contract
trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which
Demeter, together with DWR, have determined to be creditworthy.  As set
forth in the Partnership's Trading Policies, in determining credit-
worthiness, Demeter and DWR consult with the Corporate Credit Department
of DWR.  Currently, the Partnership deals solely with DWR as its
counterparty on forward contracts.  While DWR and Demeter monitor credit-
worthiness and risk involved in dealing on the various exchanges and with
counterparties, there can be no assurance that an exchange or counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. 
       Capital Resources.  The Partnership does not have, nor does it
expect to have, any capital assets.  Redemptions of Units in the future
will impact the amount of funds available for investments in commodity
futures, forward contracts on foreign currencies and other commodity
interests in subsequent periods.  As redemptions are at the discretion of
Limited Partners, it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore,
the impact of future redemptions.

DIVERSIFIED FUTURES FUND II
ANNUAL REPORT
1995
 
Dear Limited Partner:
 
This marks the seventh annual report for the Dean Witter Diversified Futures
Fund II (the "Fund"). The Fund began the year at a Net Asset Value per Unit of
$2,610.40 and finished 1995 at $2,534.82, reflecting a loss of 2.9%. DFF II has
increased by 153.5% since it began trading in 1989 (a compound annualized
return of 14.3%).
 
Losses were recorded during January primarily as a result of trading in the
currency and financial futures markets. In currency trading, an upward move in
the value of most major European currencies relative to the U.S. dollar,
followed by an extremely sharp and sudden reversal late in the month, resulted
in Fund losses. Smaller losses were the result of trading global interest rate
futures. Trading gains were recorded in February and March as global financial
futures prices strengthened, resulting in profits for the Fund's long stock
index and bond futures positions. Additional gains during February and March
were experienced in currency trading due to a strengthening in the value of the
Japanese yen and most major European currencies versus the U.S. dollar.
 
The Fund posted profits during April as a result of a continued upward move in
global financial futures prices. Smaller gains were recorded from trading in
the currency and energy futures markets. Short-term volatile price movement in
the currency and energy markets resulted in losses for the Fund during May.
Additional losses were recorded from trendless price movement in base
<PAGE>
 
metals, as well as in soft commodities. Smaller trading gains recorded in
international interest rate futures offset a portion of these losses. During
June, international bond futures prices retreated from their previous four
month upward trend resulting in losses to the Fund. Additional losses were
recorded in the currency markets from transactions involving the Canadian
dollar, Japanese yen and most major European currencies.
 
Trendless price movement in a majority of the markets traded by the Fund
resulted in losses for the Fund during July. The most significant losses were
experienced in agricultural futures trading. Smaller losses were experienced
from trading in the financial, metals and energy futures markets. Smaller
losses were recorded in August as trading gains in the currency markets were
more than offset by losses in U.S. financial futures and commodities trading.
During September, currency trading resulted in losses due primarily to a sharp
and extremely significant reversal in the upward move of the U.S. dollar
relative to most European currencies on September 20 and 21. Energy futures
prices also reversed their previous upward move, resulting in additional losses
for the Fund.
 
Continued trendless price movement in energy futures resulted in losses for the
Fund during October. Additional losses were recorded in global financial
futures and soft commodities as prices in each of these markets moved without
consistent direction. During November, trendless price movement in the currency
markets early in the month, as well as in a majority of the other markets
traded, resulted in net losses for the Fund. Smaller gains recorded in
financial futures trading offset a portion of these losses. Energy prices broke
out of their previous trendless pattern and moved higher during December
enabling the Fund to record profits from long positions in oil and gas futures.
Additional gains during December
<PAGE>
 
were recorded in agricultural and financial futures as well as in soft
commodities trading.
 
Overall, 1995 proved to be a difficult year for the Fund as a result of
extended periods of short-term volatile price movement in a majority of
traditional commodities markets. Trading gains in the financial futures and
currency markets during 1995 offset a portion of the overall losses for the
Fund. We continue to believe Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc.'s
(the Fund's sole trading advisor) diversified trading approach has served the
Fund well since its inception, and we are confident it will continue to do so
over the long-term.
 
Should you have any questions concerning this report, please feel free to

New York, NY 10048, or your Dean Witter Account Executive.
 
I hereby affirm, that to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information
contained in this report is accurate and complete. Past performance is not a
guarantee of future results.

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Dean

1995 and 1994 and the related statements of operations, changes in partners'
capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Diversified Futures Fund II
L.P. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in

DEAN WITTER DIVERSIFIED FUTURES FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
ORGANIZATION--Dean Witter Diversified Futures Fund II L.P. (the "Partnership")
was organized to engage in the speculative trading of commodity futures
contracts and futures related contracts including forward contracts on foreign
currencies. The general partner is Demeter Management Corporation (the "General
Partner"). The commodity broker is Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ("DWR"). The
Trading Manager is Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc. ("DWFCM").
DWR, DWFCM and the General Partner are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Dean
Witter, Discover & Co.
 
The General Partner is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity
of the Partnership and income (losses) are shared by the General and Limited
Partners based upon their proportional ownership interests.
 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements.
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION--Commodity futures contracts and other commodity interests
are open commitments until settlement date. They are valued at market and the
resulting unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income. Monthly, DWR
pays the Partnership interest income based upon 80% of the average daily Net
Assets for the month at a rate equal to the average yield on 13-Week U.S.
Treasury Bills issued during such month. For purposes of such interest
payments, Net Assets do not include monies due the Partnership on forward
contracts and other commodity interests, but not actually received.
 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER UNIT--Net income (loss) per Unit is computed using the
weighted average number of units outstanding during the period.
 
EQUITY IN COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNTS--The Partnership's asset "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" consists of cash on deposit at DWR to be
used as margin for trading and the net asset or liability related to unrealized
gains or losses on open contracts. The asset or liability related to the
unrealized gains or losses on forward contracts is presented as a net amount
because the Partnership has a master netting agreement with DWR.
 
BROKERAGE FEES AND RELATED TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS--The monthly brokerage
fee is equal to 3/4 of 1% per month of the Partnership's adjusted month-end Net
Assets, as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, that are allocated for
commodity trading.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER DIVERSIFIED FUTURES FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Through September 30, 1993, the monthly brokerage fee was equal to 4/5 of 1%.
Transaction fees and costs are accrued on a half-turn basis.
 
OPERATING EXPENSES--The Partnership incurs a monthly management fee and may
incur an incentive fee. The General Partner and/or DWR bear all other operating
expenses.
 
INCOME TAXES--No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying
financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting
income or loss based upon their respective share of the Partnership's revenues
and expenses for income tax purposes.
 
DISTRIBUTIONS--Distributions, other than on redemptions of Units, are made on a
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of the General Partner. No distributions
have been made to date.
 
REDEMPTIONS--Limited Partners may redeem some or all of their Units at 100% of
the Net Asset Value per Unit effective as of the last day of any calendar
quarter upon five business days advance notice by redemption form to the
General Partner.
 
DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP--The Partnership will terminate on December 31,
2025 or at an earlier date if certain conditions set forth in the Limited
Partnership Agreement occur.
 
2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
Under its Customer Agreement with DWR, the Partnership pays a monthly brokerage
fee to DWR as described in Note 1. The Partnership's cash is on deposit with
DWR in commodity trading accounts to meet margin requirements as needed. DWR
pays interest on these funds as described in Note 1.
 
The General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership and itself, has entered into
a Management Agreement with DWFCM to make all trading decisions for the
Partnership.
 
Compensation to DWFCM by the Partnership consists of a management fee and an
incentive fee as follows:
 
MANAGEMENT FEE--The management fee is accrued daily at the rate of 1/4 of 1%
per month of the Net Assets, as defined in the Management Agreement, at each
month-end.
 
INCENTIVE FEE--The Partnership will pay an annual incentive fee to DWFCM equal
to 15% of the "Trading Profits", as defined in the Management Agreement, earned
by the Partnership as of the end of each annual incentive period ending January
31. Such incentive fee is accrued in each month in which "Trading Profits"
occur. In those months in which "Trading Profits" are negative, previous
accruals, if any, during the incentive period will be reduced.

3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Partnership trades futures and forward contracts in interest rates, stock
indices, commodities, currencies, petroleum, and precious metals. Futures and
forwards represent contracts for delayed delivery of an instrument at a
specified date and price. Risk arises from changes in the value of these
contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the
terms of the contracts. There are numerous factors which may significantly
influence the market value of these contracts, including interest rate
volatility. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, open contracts were:

</TABLE>
 
A portion of the amounts indicated as off-balance-sheet risk in forward foreign
currency contracts is due to offsetting forward commitments to purchase and to
sell the same currency on the same date in the future. These commitments are
economically offsetting, but are not offset in the forward market until the
settlement date.
 
The unrealized gains on open contracts are reported as a component of "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" on the Statements of Financial Condition
and totaled $852,419 and $2,176,680 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
 
Of the $852,419 net unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1995,
$1,413,016 related to exchange-traded futures contracts and $(560,597) related
to off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts. Of the $2,176,680 net
unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994, $1,710,196 related to
exchange-traded futures contracts and $466,484 related to off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONCLUDED)
 
Exchange-traded futures contracts held by the Partnership at December 31, 1995
and 1994 mature through September 1996 and June 1995, respectively. Off-
exchange-traded forward currency contracts held by the Partnership at December
31, 1995 and 1994 mature through February 1996 and March 1995, respectively.
The contract amounts in the above table represent the Partnership's extent of
involvement in the particular class of financial instrument, but not the credit
risk associated with counterparty nonperformance. The credit risk associated
with these instruments is limited to the amounts reflected in the Partnership's
Statements of Financial Condition.
 
The Partnership also has credit risk because the sole counterparty, with
respect to most of the Partnership's assets, is DWR. Exchange-traded futures
contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in value
settled on a daily basis. DWR, as the futures commission merchant for all of
the Partnership's exchange-traded futures contracts, is required pursuant to
regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to segregate from its
own assets, and for the sole benefit of its commodity customers, all funds held
by DWR with respect to exchange-traded futures contracts including an amount
equal to the net unrealized gain on all open futures contracts which funds
totaled $16,056,545 and $17,176,572 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. With respect to the Partnership's off-exchange-traded forward
currency contracts, there are no daily settlements of variations in value nor
is there any requirement that an amount equal to the net unrealized gain on
open forward contracts be segregated. With respect to those off-exchange-traded
forward currency contracts, the Partnership is at risk to the ability of DWR,
the counterparty on all of such contracts, to perform.
 
For the year ended December 31, 1995, the average fair value of financial
instruments held for trading purposes was as follows:
