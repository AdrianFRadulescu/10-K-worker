ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 

United Trust, Inc. (the "Registrant") was incorporated in 1984, under the laws
of  the State  of  Illinois to  serve as  an  insurance holding  company.   At
December 31,  1995, significant majority-owned subsidiaries  and affiliates of
the Registrant were as depicted on the following organizational chart:


                               ORGANIZATIONAL CHART
                              AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1995


United Trust, Inc. ("UTI") is the ultimate controlling company.  UTI owns  53%
of United Trust Group ("UTG")  and  30% of  United  Income, Inc. ("UII").  UII
owns 47% of UTG.  UTG owns 72% of First Commonwealth Corporation ("FCC").  FCC
owns 100% of  Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("UG").  UG  owns 100%
of  United Security Assurance  Company ("USA").  USA  owns  84% of Appalachian
Life  Insurance  Company ("APPL")  and  APPL   owns 100%  of Abraham   Lincoln
Insurance Company ("ABE").



                                      2

(a)  GENERAL

The Registrant and its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate principally in the
individual life  insurance business.  The primary  business of the Company has
been the servicing of  existing insurance business in force,  the solicitation
of new insurance business, and the  acquisition of other companies in  similar
lines of business.

Between March 28,  1985, and May 20,  1987, UTI was  engaged in an  intrastate
public  offering of  its securities,  raising  a total  of $12,585,086  net of
offering  costs.   United  Trust  Assurance  Company  ("UTAC"), was  initially
capitalized with a $5,000,000  contribution from UTI in 1986 and began selling
life insurance products in 1987.  

Beginning in  1988, an affiliated company, UII,  conducted a stock offering in
the State of  Ohio.  The  investors purchased units  consisting of one  $2 par
value,  9% noncumulative,  redeemable preferred  share and  one common  share.
Each  unit sold  for $10.   The preferred  stock has  been converted  into two
shares of common stock.

Between March  1988  and August  1990,  UII raised  a  total of  approximately
$15,000,000  in an  intrastate public  offering in  Ohio.   USA  was initially
capitalized with  a $5,000,000 contribution  from UII  in 1990 in  Ohio.   USA
began selling life insurance products in August 1990.

Since  the inception  of the  offering, the  Company's ownership  interest has
dropped from 49% to 30%.  The Company accounts for its investment in UII using
the  equity  method.    Because  the offering  price  per  share  exceeded the
Company's carrying amount per share, the Company's equity in UII has increased
$4,359,749.


(b)  FORMATION OF UNITED TRUST GROUP, INC.

On February 20, 1992, UTI and its affiliate, UII, formed a joint venture, UTG.

On June 16, 1992, UTI contributed $2.7 million in cash, an $840,000 promissory
note and 100% of  the common stock of its wholly owned  subsidiary, UTAC.  UII
contributed $7.6  million in cash and  100% of its life  insurance subsidiary,
USA to UTG.  After the contributions of cash,  subsidiaries, and the note, UII
owns 47% and UTI owns 53% of UTG.


(c)  ACQUISITION OF CIC

Pursuant  to the terms of  a stock purchase  agreement, on June  16, 1992, UTG
acquired 6,771 shares of the 8,776 no par value, issued and outstanding common
stock  of CIC.   Additionally,  options  for 1,300  shares  were acquired  and
simultaneously exercised.  Further, UTG acquired  729 shares of CIC stock from
Mr. James Melville, a former officer of CIC.  The  adjusted purchase price for
all  shares purchased including the options  was $15,567,179.  CIC then issued
315 shares of CIC common stock to UGIC and 2,730 shares of CIC common stock to
FCC in satisfaction of debt.  As a result UTG owned 67% of CIC. 

Also, June 16, 1992, UTG sold, at book value, its insurance subsidiaries, UTAC
and  USA along  with $6,000,000  of FCC's  senior debt  to FCC,  an indirectly
controlled subsidiary of  CIC, in exchange  for $3,300,000 in  cash, ten  year
promissory notes totalling $5,669,988,  twenty year promissory notes totalling
$3,529,865 and  11,134,000 shares of FCC unissued  common stock, approximately
46% of the outstanding common stock of FCC.

(d)  RESTRUCTURING OF AFFILIATES

The  Company has taken several steps to  streamline and simplify the corporate
structure following the acquisitions.

On December 28, 1992, UG was the surviving company  to a merger with Roosevelt
National  Life Insurance  Company  ("RNLIC"), United  Trust Assurance  Company
("UTAC") and  Cimarron Life  Insurance Company  ("CIM").   On  June 30,  1993,
Alliance Life Insurance Company ("ALLI"), a  subsidiary of UG, was merged into
UG.

On  March 30, 1994,  Farmers and Ranchers  Life Insurance Company  ("F&R") was
sold to  an unrelated third  party.  F&R  was a  small life insurance  company
which did  not significantly contribute to  the operations of the  group.  F&R
primarily represented  a marketing  opportunity.   The  Company determined  it
would not  be able to  allocate the time  and resources necessary  to properly
develop the opportunity, due to continued focus and emphasis on  certain other
agency forces of the Company.

The transactions described below, which transpired during 1994, were necessary
to position  Universal Guaranty Investment Company  ("UGIC"), Investors Trust,
Inc. ("ITI")  and Commonwealth Industries Corporation  ("CIC") for liquidation
and dissolution.

Pursuant to an Agreement of Merger  dated July 7, 1994 between Investors Trust
Assurance Company, an Illinois life  insurance  company ("ITAC"), and ALIC, on 
July 31,  1994, ITAC merged  with and  into ALIC  and ALIC  was the  surviving
company.   On  the effective  date of  the merger, ALIC  succeeded to  all the
rights and property of ITAC and assumed all of the liabilities and obligations
and became subject to  all of the debts of ITAC in the  same manner as if ALIC
had itself incurred them.  The merger was approved by the Illinois Director of
Insurance.

Prior  to the  merger of  ITAC with  and into  ALIC, ITAC  was a  wholly owned
subsidiary of ITI.  ITAC owned 1,549,549 (approximately 66%) of the issued and
outstanding common  stock  of UGIC.   Prior  to  July 31,  1994, ITI  was  the
indirect beneficial owner of the shares of UGIC common stock directly owned by
ITAC.  On  July 31, immediately  prior to the  effectiveness of the merger  of
ITAC with and into ALIC, ITI purchased 758,946 shares of the UGIC common stock
owned by ITAC.  The  total purchase price was  $2,276,793.  On July 31,  1994,
ITAC also transferred to ITI at no cost 790,603 shares of the common  stock of
the Company.   On such  date, ITI became  the direct  beneficial owner of  all
1,549,549  shares of  the  common stock  of UGIC.   In  order to  purchase the
758,946  shares of UGIC common stock, ITI received  a loan from UTI and UII in
the  aggregate principal amount of $2,164,293.  ITI transferred 721,431 shares
of the common  stock of UGIC  that it purchased  from ITAC to  UTI and UII  in
payment  of the loan.   These shares were  then contributed by  UTI and UII to
their subsidiary, UTG.

The  balance sheet of Commonwealth Industries Corporation for the period ended
July  31, 1994,  included  liabilities in  the  aggregate amount  of  $402,861
comprised  of a future liability  under a consulting  agreement, escheat funds
and an account payable.   On July 31, 1994, these liabilities  were assumed by
UTG in exchange for 1,558,318 shares of the common stock of ITI.

The  balance sheet  of  UGIC for  the  period ended  July  31, 1994,  included
liabilities in  the aggregate amount  of $461,102.   On July  31, 1994,  these
liabilities  were assumed by UTG in exchange  for 106,392 shares of the common
stock  of FCC  and 315  shares of the  common stock  of CIC.   The  FCC shares
transferred  reduced  UGIC's  percentage  ownership  of  FCC from  50.396%  to
49.959%.  

Prior to  these transactions, UGIC, ITI and CIC each had liabilities in excess
of assets  excluding the stock holdings  of their respective subsidiary.   The
1994 transactions enabled the companies to extinguish their liabilities.

                                     4
<PAGE>

On  August  15, 1995,  the  shareholders  of  CIC,  ITI,  and  UGIC  voted  to
voluntarily liquidate each  of the companies and distribute  the assets to the
shareholders  (consisting   solely  of   common  stock  of   their  respective
subsidiary).    As a  result of  the  liquidations, the  shareholders  of each
company  became shareholders of FCC, following the liquidations, UTG holds 72%
of the common stock of FCC.


PRODUCTS 

The  Company's portfolio consists of  three universal life insurance products.
The primary  universal life insurance  product is referred to  as the "Century
2000".   This product was  introduced to the  marketing force in  1993 and has
become the cornerstone of current marketing.  This product has  a minimum face
amount  of  $25,000.   The  product  currently  credits  6%  interest  with  a
guaranteed rate of 4.5% in the first 20 years and 3% in years 21 and  greater.
The policy values are subject to a $4.50 monthly policy fee, an administrative
load  and a premium load  of 6.5% in  all years.  The  administrative load and
surrender charge  are based  on the  issue age,  sex and  rating class  of the
policy.  A  surrender charge is effective  for the first 14 policy  years.  In
general, the surrender charge  is very high in  the first couple of years  and
then declines to zero at the end of  14 years.  Policy loans are available  at
7% interest  in advance.  The  policy's accumulated fund will  be credited the
guaranteed interest rate in relation to the amount of the policy loan.

The second  product, referred  to as the  "Eagle USL 400"  has a  minimum face
amount of $50,000 with a 3% load on all premiums and a policy fee of $4.75 per
month.   This  product is  sold at  issue ages  of 0-18.    The Eagle  USL 400
currently  credits 6%  interest  and 4%  guaranteed  interest rate.    Partial
withdrawals  are allowed after the first policy duration.  Partial withdrawals
are allowed once a year subject to a $25 fee.  Partial withdrawals are subject
to a minimum of $500 cash surrender value remaining.  Policy loans are charged
8% interest in arrears with the loaned value receiving the 4% guaranteed rate.
Surrender charges are based on a percentage of target premium starting at 150%
for years 1-5  and decreasing 10% each year  thereafter until year 15  when it
becomes zero.

The third universal life product was designed in 1990 and  introduced for sale
in the fourth quarter of that year.  This product, referred to as the "UL90A",
has a minimum face amount of $25,000.  The administrative load is based on the
issue age, sex and rating  class of the policy.  Policy fees vary  from $1 per
month in the first  year to $4 per month in the second  and third years and $3
per month each year thereafter.   The UL90A currently credits 6%  interest and
4.5%  guaranteed interest  rate.   Partial withdrawals  are allowed  after the
first duration.   Partial withdrawals  are allowed once  a year subject  a $25
fee.   A partial withdrawal  is subject  to a minimum  of $500  cash surrender
value remaining.  Policy  loans are available at 7% interest  in advance.  The
policy's accumulated fund  will be  credited the guaranteed  interest rate  in
relation to  the amount of the policy loan.   Surrender charges are based on a
percentage of  target premium  starting  at 120%  for years  1-5 then  grading
downward  to zero  in year  15.   This policy  contains a  guaranteed interest
credit  bonus  for the  long term  policyholder.   From  years 10  through 20,
additional  interest bonuses are earned with a  total in the twentieth year of
1.375%.    The  bonus  is  calculated  from  the  policy  issue  date  and  is
contractually guaranteed.

The Company  markets other  products,  none of  which  is significant  to  the
operations  of the Company.  In late  1994, the Company discontinued marketing
interest sensitive  whole life  insurance and traditional  participating whole
life  insurance products.   The  Company has  a variety  of policies  in force
different from those which are currently being marketed.  Approximately 34% of
the  insurance  in force  is participating  business.   The  Company's average
persistency  rate  for all  policies  in  force for  1995  and  1994 has  been
approximately  87.5% and

                                      5
<PAGE>

86.3%, respectively. The Company does not anticipate any material fluctuations
in these rates  in the future that  may result from competition.

The Company's  experience for earned interest, persistency  and mortality vary
from   the  assumptions   applied   to  pricing   and  determining   premiums.
Accordingly,  differences   between  the   Company's   experience  and   those 
assumptions applied may impact the profitability of the  Company.  The minimum
interest spread between earned and credited  rates is 1% on the "Century 2000"
universal  life insurance product, the Company's primary product.  The Company
monitors investment yields, and when necessary takes action to adjust credited
interest  rates  on  its  insurance products  to  preserve  targeted  interest
spreads.    Credited  rates are  reviewed  and  established  by  the Board  of
Directors.

The premium rates are  competitive with other insurers  doing business in  the
states in which the Company is marketing its products.


MARKETING

The  Company markets its products through separate and distinct agency forces.
The  Company has approximately 100  independent agents who  actively write new
business.  No  individual sales agent accounted for over  10% of the Company's
premium volume in 1995.   The Company's sales agents do not have  the power to
bind the Company.

The change in marketing  strategy from traditional life insurance  products to
universal life insurance  products had  a significant impact  on new  business
production.  As a result of the  change in marketing strategy the agency force
went through  a restructure and retraining  process.  Marketing is  based on a
referral  network  of  community leaders  and  shareholders  of  UII and  UTI.
Recruiting of agents is also based on the same referral network. 

New  sales  are marketed  by  UG and  USA  through their  agency  forces using
contemporary sales  approaches with personal computer  illustrations.  Current
marketing efforts are primarily focused on the Midwest region.

Recruiting of agents is based on obtaining people with little or no experience
in the  life  insurance business.    These recruits  go through  an  extensive
internal training program.

USA is  licensed in Illinois, Indiana  and Ohio.  During  1995, Ohio accounted
for 99% of USA's direct premiums collected.

ALIC is  licensed  in  Alabama,  Arizona,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Louisiana  and
Missouri.   During  1995, Illinois  and  Indiana accounted  for  47% and  33%,
respectively of ALIC's direct premiums collected.

APPL is licensed  in Alabama, Arizona,  Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,  Indiana,
Kansas,  Kentucky, Louisiana,  Missouri,  Montana,  Nebraska, Ohio,  Oklahoma,
Tennessee,  Utah,  Virginia, West  Virginia and  Wyoming.   During  1995, West
Virginia accounted for 95% of APPL's direct premiums collected.

UG is  licensed in  Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,  Colorado, Delaware,  Florida,
Georgia,  Idaho,   Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kansas,   Kentucky,  Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,  Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New  Mexico,  North Carolina,  North Dakota,  Ohio, Oklahoma,  Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode  Island, South  Carolina, South Dakota,  Tennessee, Texas,
Utah,  Virginia, Washington,  West  Virginia  and  Wisconsin.    During  1995,
Illinois and  Ohio  accounted  for  32% and 16%, respectively,  of UG's direct
premiums collected.  No other states account  for more than 6% of UG's  direct
premiums collected.

UNDERWRITING

Policies  are  issued  by  the  Company  based   upon  underwriting  practices
established for each market in which the Company operates.   Most policies are
individually  underwritten.    Applications  for  insurance  are  reviewed  to
determine additional  information required  to make an  underwriting decision,
which  depends on the amount of insurance  applied for and the applicant's age
and medical history.  Additional information may include medical examinations,
statements from  doctors who have treated the applicant in the past and, where
indicated, special medical  tests.  After reviewing the information collected,
the  Company  either   issues  the  policy  as  applied  for  or  rejects  the
application.  


RESERVES AND REINSURANCE

The  Company  establishes  reserves   for  future  policy  benefits,  unearned
premiums, reported claims and claims incurred but not reported.  Such reserves
are  based  on  regulatory  accounting  requirements  and  generally  accepted
accounting principles. 

The Company reinsures  its insurance products  with other insurance  companies
under agreements of reinsurance.  Reinsurance agreements are intended to limit
the Company's maximum loss  and provide other financial benefits.   The ceding
of  reinsurance  does not  discharge the  Company's  primary liability  to the
insured, however  it is  the practice of  insurers to  reduce their  financial
statement liabilities to the extent  that they have been reinsured  with other
insurance companies. 

In  selecting  a  reinsurance  company,  the  Company  examines  many  factors
including:  

1)  Whether the  reinsurer is  licensed  in the  states  in which  reinsurance
coverage is being sought;

2)  the solvency  and stability  of the company.   One source  utilized is the
rating  given the reinsurer  by the A.M.  Best Company, an  insurance industry
rating  company.   Another source  is the  statutory  annual statement  of the
reinsurer;

3)  the history and reputation of the Company;

4)  competitive pricing of  reinsurance coverage.  The Company generally seeks
quotes from several reinsurers when considering a new treaty. 

On  existing reinsurance  treaties,  the Company  monitors reinsurers  through
sources such  as, the ratings  provided by  the A.M.  Best Company,  reinsurer
financial statements and industry publications and literature.

In December 1991, UG  entered into a 50% coinsurance arrangement with Republic
Vanguard Life Insurance Company to  enable the Company  to maintain  increased
production levels while containing first year statutory costs.   The ceding of
new business under  this treaty was  terminated December 31,  1993.   Republic
Vanguard holds an "A" (Excellent)  rating from A. M. Best, an  industry rating
company.   The coinsurance arrangement,  which was effective  January 1, 1991,
allowed UG to cede to Republic Vanguard a 50% quota share of all new universal
life policies issued after the effective date through date of termination.  UG
receives a commission allowance of 11% of excess premium and renewal  premium.
Monies pertaining to  the coinsurance  arrangement are settled  monthly.   The
agreement  contains  a provision  whereby risks  in  excess of  UG's retention
($125,000  maximum) are transferred to  the reinsurer.   Risks are transferred
under  an  automatic ceding  arrangement up  to  $1,000,000 and  a facultative
arrangement for amounts in excess of $1,000,000.

                                      7
<PAGE>

In December 1993, UG  entered into reinsurance agreements with  Business Men's
Assurance Company, ("BMA") and Life Reassurance Corporation,  ("LIFE RE"). BMA
and  LIFE RE each hold an  "A+" (Superior) rating from  A.M. Best, an industry
rating company.  The  reinsurance arrangement was effective December  1, 1993,
and covered  all new  business of the  Company.  The  agreements are  a yearly
renewable  term ("YRT")  treaty  where the  Company  cedes amounts  above  its
retention limit of $100,000 with a minimum cession of $25,000.

During  1993, USA  entered into  a coinsurance  agreement with  LIFE RE.   The
coinsurance arrangement allows USA to cede to LIFE RE a 50% quota share of the
traditional participating policies issued  by USA after the effective  date of
July 1,  1992.   USA entered  into the  arrangement to enable  the Company  to
maintain  increased production  levels while  containing first  year statutory
costs.   USA receives commission allowances of 150% of first year premium, 27%
of second year  premium, 32% of third year premium and  37% of fourth year and
beyond.  Monies pertaining to the coinsurance arrangement are settled monthly.

The  Company  does not  have any  short-duration  reinsurance contracts.   The
effect of the Company's long-duration reinsurance contracts on premiums earned
in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:

Net premiums                   $   29,998     $   32,404    $   31,160


As  a  result of  amounts  ceded  to under  reinsurance  treaties, total  life
insurance  in force  was reduced  by approximately  $1.088 billion  and $1.217
billion  at  December 31,  1995, and  1994,  respectively.   Ceded reinsurance
premiums as  a percentage of gross premium  revenues were 15%, 15%  and 22% in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  


INVESTMENTS

Effective October 15, 1990, the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors
retained Alpha Advisors,  Inc., of Chicago, Illinois, a  registered investment
advisor,  to assist  the Company  in managing  its investment portfolio.   The
Company may modify  its present investment strategy at any  time, provided its
strategy continues to be in compliance with the limitations of state insurance
department regulations.

Investment  income represents  a significant  portion of  the Company's  total
income.   Investments  are  subject to  applicable  state insurance  laws  and
regulations which limit the  concentration of investments in any  one category
or class and further limit the investment in any one issuer.  Generally, these
limitations are imposed as  a percentage of statutory assets  or percentage of
statutory capital and surplus of each company.

At December 31, 1995, fixed maturities and fixed maturities held for sale have
a  market value of  $202,179,000.  Fixed  maturities are  carried at amortized
cost.   It  is management's intent  to hold  these securities  until maturity.
Fixed maturities held for sale are carried at market.  

The Company holds  approximately $425,000  in short term  investments.   Other
investments include  fixed maturities and  mortgage loans  of $10,788,000  and
$523,000, respectively, maturing  in one year and $91,652,000  and $2,420,000,
respectively,  maturing  in  two  to  five  years,  which  in  the  opinion of
management is sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.

The Company holds approximately $13,892,000 in mortgage loans which represents
4% of the total assets.  All  mortgage loans are first position loans.  Before
a new  loan is issued, the applicant is subject  to certain criteria set forth
by  Company management to ensure quality control.  These criteria include, but
are not limited to,  personal financial information such as  outstanding debt,
sources  of income, and  personal equity.   A credit report  is also obtained.
Loans  issued are limited to  no more than  80% of the appraised  value of the
property, and the loan must have first position against the collateral.

The  Company has  $618,000  of  mortgage  loans,  net  of  a  $10,000  reserve
allowance, which are in default or in the process of foreclosure.  These loans
represent approximately  4% of  the total  portfolio.   The Company  has three
loans  that total  approximately $102,000  which are  under a  repayment plan.
Letters  are sent  to each  mortgagee when  the loan becomes  30 days  or more
delinquent.  Loans 90 days  or more delinquent are placed on  a non-performing
status and  classified as  delinquent loans.   Reserves  for  loan losses  are
established  based on management's analysis  of the loan  balances compared to
the expected realizable value should foreclosure take place.  Loans are placed
on a non-accrual  status based on  a quarterly analysis  of the likelihood  of
repayment.  All  delinquent and troubled loans held by  the Company were loans
held  in  portfolios  by  acquired  companies  at  the  time  of  acquisition.
Management  believes  the internal  controls  surrounding,  the mortgage  loan
selection  process  have provided  a quality  portfolio  with minimal  risk of
foreclosure and/or negative financial impact.

The  Company has  in place  a  monitoring system  to  provide management  with
information regarding potential troubled loans.  Management is provided with a
monthly listing of loans that are 30 days or  more past due along with a brief
description  of what  steps  are  being  taken  to  resolve  the  delinquency.
Quarterly,  coinciding  with   external  financial   reporting,  the   Company
determines  how each delinquent loan should be  classified.  All loans 90 days
or  more

                                    10
<PAGE>

past  due are  classified  as delinquent.   Each  delinquent loan is reviewed
to determine the classification and status the loan should be given. Interest
accruals  are analyzed  based on  the likelihood  of repayment.   In no event 
will  interest  continue  to  accrue  when accrued  interest  along  with the
outstanding principal exceeds the  net realizable value of the property.  The
Company does not  utilize a specified number of days  delinquent to cause  an
automatic non-accrual status.

The  mortgage loan reserve is  established and adjusted  based on management's
quarterly analysis  of the  portfolio and any  deterioration in  value of  the
underlying  property  which  would reduce  the  net  realizable  value of  the
property below its current carrying value.

In addition, the Company also  monitors that the insurance on the  property is
being maintained.   The Company requires  proof of insurance on  each loan and
further requires to be shown as a lienholder on the policy so that  any change
in coverage  status is  reported to  the Company.   Proof  of payment  of real
estate  taxes  is  another  monitoring  technique  utilized  by  the  Company.
Management believes a change in insurance status or non-payment of real estate
taxes are indicators that a loan is potentially troubled.  Correspondence with
the mortgagee is performed to determine the reasons for either of these events
occurring.

COMPETITION

The insurance business is highly  competitive and there are a number  of other
companies, both stock  and mutual, doing business  in areas where the  Company
operates.  Many of these competing insurers are larger,  have more diversified
lines of  insurance coverage,  have substantially greater  financial resources
and have  a greater number of  agents.  Other  significant competitive factors
include policyholder benefits, service to policyholders, and premium rates.

The  products offered (see  Products) are  similar to  those offered  by other
major companies.   The product  features are regulated  by the states  and are
subject to  extensive competition  among major insurance  organizations.   The
Company believes a  strong service commitment to policyholders, efficiency and
flexibility  of operations,  timely  service  to  the  agency  force  and  the
expertise of its key executives help minimize the competitive pressures of the
insurance industry.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION

In common with  all domestic insurance  companies, the Company  is subject  to
regulation  and supervision  in the  jurisdictions in  which it  does business
under   statutes  which   typically  delegate   regulatory,  supervisory   and
administrative powers to state insurance commissions.   USA, UG, APPL and ALIC
are  domiciled  in the  states  of  Ohio, Ohio,  West  Virginia  and Illinois,
respectively.   The method  of regulation  varies,  but generally,  regulation
relates  to  the  licensing  of  insurers  and  their  agents,  nature  of and
limitations on  investments, approval  

                                        12
<PAGE>

of policy forms,  reserve requirements, standards   of  solvency, deposits  of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, periodic examination of insurers,
and trade practices.

Most  states  also  have  insurance holding  company  statutes  which  require
registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other
corporations   licensed   to  transact   business   within   their  respective
jurisdictions.  The insurance subsidiaries are subject to such legislation and
are registered as  controlled insurers  in those jurisdictions  in which  such
registration is  required.  Statutes  vary from state  to state  but typically
require  periodic  disclosure concerning  the  corporation  that controls  the
registered  insurers and all subsidiaries  of such corporation.   In addition,
prior notice to, or  approval by, the state  insurance commission of  material
intercorporate  transfers   of  assets,  reinsurance   agreements,  management
agreements (see  Note  9 to  Notes to  Financial Statements),  and payment  of
dividends (see Note 2 to Notes to Financial Statements) in excess of specified
amounts  by the  insurance subsidiary  within the  holding company  system are
required.

The  National Association of Insurance Commissioners  (NAIC) is an association
whose membership consists of the insurance commissioners or their designees of
the  various  states.   The  NAIC  has  no direct  regulatory  authority  over
insurance companies.   The primary purpose of  the NAIC is  to provide a  more
consistent method  of regulation and reporting  from state to state.   This is
accomplished through the issuance  of model regulations, which can  be adopted
by the individual  state as presented, modified to meet  the state's own needs
or requirements, or dismissed entirely.

Each year the NAIC prepares financial  ratio results (commonly referred to  as
IRIS  ratios)  for  each company.    These  ratios  compare various  financial
information pertaining to  the statutory balance  sheet and income  statement.
The results are then  compared to pre-established normal ranges  determined by
the NAIC.   Results  outside the range  typically require  explanation to  the
domiciliary insurance department.

At  year end  1995, UG  had  two ratios  outside the  norm.   The  first ratio
compared investment in affiliates to  total capital and surplus.  At  December
31,  1995,  UG had  an  investment in  affiliate  (USA) slightly  greater than
capital and  surplus.   It is  believed that  this ratio  will be  outside the
normal range  in future periods, but is not considered  by management to be an
issue as both companies are under common control. 

The  second ratio related to the decrease  in premium.  The ratio fell outside
the norm due  to the significant reduction in first  year business compared to
the prior year.   Management does not believe that this ratio  will be outside
the normal range in future periods.

The NAIC has adopted Risk Based Capital ("RBC") rules, which  became effective
December 31, 1993, to  evaluate the adequacy of statutory  capital and surplus
in relation  to a company's investment  and insurance risks.   The RBC formula
reflects  the level  of risk  of invested  assets and  the types  of insurance
products.  The formula classifies company risks into four categories:

1)          Asset risk  - the risk of loss of principal due to default through
            creditor bankruptcy or decline in market value for assets reported
            at market.

2)          Pricing inadequacy - the risk of adverse mortality, morbidity, and
            expense experience in relation to pricing assumptions.

3)          Asset  and liability  mismatch -  the risk  of having  to reinvest
            funds when  market yields fall below levels guaranteed to contract
            holders, and the risk of having to  sell assets when market yields
            are above the levels at which the assets were purchased.

The  RBC formula  will be  used  by the  states as  an early  warning  tool to
identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory
action.   Generally, the RBC requirements provide for four different levels of
regulatory  attention depending upon the  ratio of a  company's total adjusted
capital (defined  as the  total of  its statutory  capital, surplus  and asset
valuation reserve) to its RBC.   The "Company Action Level" is triggered if  a
company's total adjusted capital is  less than 100% but greater than  or equal
to 75% of  its Company  Action Level RBC.   At The  Company Action Level,  the
company must submit  a comprehensive  plan to the  regulatory authority  which
discusses  proposed corrective actions to  improve its capital  position.  The
"Regulatory Action Level" is  triggered if a company's total  adjusted capital
is less than 75% but greater than or equal to 50% of its Company  Action Level
RBC.   At the Regulatory Action Level, the regulatory authority will perform a
special examination if the  company's total adjusted capital is  less than 50%
but greater than  or equal  to 35% of  its Company Action  Level RBC, and  the
regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary, including placing
the  company under  regulatory  control.   The  "Mandatory Control  Level"  is
triggered  if a  company's total  adjusted  capital is  less than  35% of  its
Company  Action  Level RBC,  and the  regulatory  authority mandates  that the
company  be  placed under  its control.   At  December 31,  1995, each  of the
Company's insurance  subsidiaries  has  a  Ratio  in excess  of  250%  of  the
authorized  control   level;  accordingly   the  subsidiaries  meet   the  RBC
requirements. 

The NAIC has proposed a new Model Investment Law that may affect the statutory
carrying values of  certain investments;  however,  the final outcome  of that
proposal  is not  certain,  nor is  it  possible to  predict  what impact  the
proposal will  have or whether the proposal will be adopted in the foreseeable
future.

The  current statutory  accounting  treatment  of  DAC  taxes  results  in  an
understatement of  companies' surplus.   These  taxes result  from a  law that
approximates  acquisition  expenses   and  then   spreads  the   corresponding
deductions over a period of years.  The result is a DAC tax which is collected
immediately and subsequently returned through deductions in later years.


EMPLOYEES

There are  approximately 110 persons who  are employed by the  Company and its
affiliates.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The following table shows the distribution of real estate by type.


        Real Estate                     Amount             % of Total 
        Home Office                  $ 3,054,115               18%
        Commercial                   $ 2,680,318               15%
        Residential development      $ 6,244,142               36%
        Foreclosed real estate       $ 5,332,413               31%


Real estate holdings  represent approximately 5%  of the total  assets of  the
Company net of accumulated depreciation of $1,050,000 and $802,000 at year end
1995  and  1994   respectively.    The  Company  owns  an  office  complex  in
Springfield, Illinois, which  houses the  primary insurance  operations.   The
office buildings contain  57,000 square  feet of office  and warehouse  space.
The  properties  are carried  at approximately  $2,838,000.   In  addition, an

                                     14
<PAGE>

insurance subsidiary owns a home office building in Huntington, West Virginia.
The  building  has  15,000 square  feet  and  is  carried  at $216,000.    The
facilities  occupied by  the Company  are adequate  relative to  the Company's
present operations. 

Commercial  property consists  primarily of  former home  office buildings  of
acquired companies no  longer used in  the operations of  the Company.   These
properties  are leased  to various  unaffiliated companies  and organizations.
Residential   development  property  is   primarily  located  in  Springfield,
Illinois,  and entails  several developments,  each targeted  for  a different
segment of the population.  These targets include a  development primarily for
the  first time  home buyer,  an upscale  development for  existing homeowners
looking for  a larger  home,  and duplex  condominiums  for those  who  desire
maintenance free exteriors and  surroundings.  The Company's primary  focus is
on the development and sale  of lots, with an occasional home  construction to
help stimulate interest.

Springfield is the State Capital  of Illinois.  The City's economy  is service
oriented  with the main employers being the  State of Illinois, two major area
hospitals and two large insurance companies.   This provides for a very stable
economy not as dramatically affected by economic  conditions in other parts of
the United States.  

Foreclosed  property  is carried  at the  unpaid  loan principal  balance plus
accrued interest on  the loan and other costs associated  with the foreclosure
process.     The  carrying  value  of  foreclosed  property  does  not  exceed
management's estimate of net  realizable value.  Management's estimate  of net
realizable  value is  based on  significant internal  real  estate experience,
local  market experience,  independent appraisals  and evaluation  of existing
comparable property sales.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

During the third  quarter of 1994, UG became aware  that certain new insurance
business  was  being solicited  by certain  agents  and issued  to individuals
considered to be  not insurable by  Company standards.   These policies had  a
face amount of $22,700,000 and represent 1/2  of 1% of the insurance in force.
Management's analysis indicates that the expected death claims on the business
in force to be adequately covered by the mortality assumptions inherent in the
calculation of statutory reserves.  Nevertheless, management has determined it
is in the best interest of  the Company to repurchase as many of  the policies
as possible.  As of December 31, 1995, there remained approximately $5,738,000
of the  original face amount  which have not  been settled.  The  Company will
continue  its efforts to  repurchase as many  of the policies  as possible and
regularly apprise the  Ohio Department  of Insurance regarding  the status  of
this  situation.   Through December  31, 1995,  the Company  spent a  total of
$2,886,000 for the repurchase of  these policies and for the legal  defense of
related litigation.

The Company  is currently  involved in the  following litigation:   Freeman v.
Universal  Guaranty Life  Insurance Company  (U.S.D.C.,N.D.Ga, 1994,  1-94-CV-
2593-RCF);  Armstrong v.  Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company  and James
Melville  (Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tenn., 1994, 94C3222);  Armstrong
v. Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company and James Melville (Circuit Court
of Davidson County, Tenn., 1994, 94C3720);  Ridings v. Universal Guaranty Life
Insurance Company and James Melville (Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tenn.,
1994, 94C3221);   Ronald L. Mekkes,  Jr. v. Universal Guaranty  Life Insurance
Company and James Melville, (Circuit Court of Kent County, Michigan, 1995, 95-
1073-NZ).

Four general  agents of UG  filed independent suits  against UG in  the latter
part  of September or  early October  1994.  In  February 1996,  the Ronald L.
Mekkes, Jr. suit was  dismissed with prejudice.  Kathy  Armstrong (3-94-1085),
another general agent,  filed her suit on November 16, 1994.  All of the suits
allege that the plaintiff was libeled  by statements made in a 

                                      15
<PAGE>

letter sent  by UG.   The letter  was sent  to  persons who  had  been issued
life insurance policies by UG as the result of policy applications  submitted
by the five agents.  Mr. Melville is a defendant in some of the suits because
he signed the letter as president of UG. 

In addition  to the defamation count,  Mr. Freeman alleges that  UG breached a
contract by failing to pay  his commissions for policies issued.   Mr. Freeman
claims unpaid commissions of $104,000.  In the libel claim, Mr. Freeman claims
compensatory damages of over $5,000,000,  punitive damages of over $3,000,000,
costs, and litigation  expenses.  The  other plaintiffs  request the award  of
unspecified  compensatory damages and punitive (or special) damages as well as
costs and  attorney's  fees.   UG has  filed  Answers to  all  of these  suits
asserting various defenses and, where appropriate, counterclaims.  UG believes
that  it has no liability to any of  the plaintiffs and intends to defend each
of the suits  vigorously.  The  Freeman suit is  scheduled for trial April  8,
1996.

Jeffrey  Ploskonka, Keith  Bohn and  Paul Phinney  v. Universal  Guaranty Life
Insurance Company  (Circuit  Court of  the Seventh  Judicial Circuit  Sangamon
County, Illinois Case No.:  95-L-0213)

On March 9, 1995 a lawsuit was filed against Universal Guaranty Life Insurance
Company  on behalf of three insureds and  a potential class of other insureds.
The Plaintiffs allege that UG violated the insurance contract in attempting to
cancel  life  insurance  contracts.     Additionally,  the  Plaintiffs  assert
violations  of  Illinois law  alleging  vexations  and unreasonable  insurance
practices, breach  of duty of good  faith and fair dealing,  and that Illinois
consumer  fraud  laws have  been violated.    The Plaintiffs  seek unspecified
compensatory damages, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, statutory damages in
an amount up  to $25,000, punitive damages of $1,000,000,  and other equitable
relief.   UG filed an  Answer to this  lawsuit in May  1995, asserting various
defenses  and reserving the right to assert  counterclaims.  UG has also filed
motions to  dismiss certain allegations  and claims made  in the lawsuit.   UG
believes it  has no liability  to any  of the plaintiffs,  or other  potential
class members,  and intends to defend  the lawsuit vigorously.   In June 1995,
the court conditionally certified a class of non-settling insureds.

The Company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants  in a number of legal
actions  arising primarily from claims  made under insurance  policies.  Those
actions  have  been  considered  in establishing  the  Company's  liabilities.
Management and its  legal counsel are  of the opinion  that the settlement  of
those  actions  will not  have  a  material adverse  effect  on  the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM  7.   MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND  ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company and its  consolidated subsidiaries have three principal  needs for
cash  - the insurance company's  contractual obligations to policyholders, the
payment of operating  expenses and servicing of its long-term  debt.  Cash and
cash equivalents as a percentage of total assets were 4% and 3% as of December
31,  1995, and 1994, respectively.  Fixed  maturities as a percentage of total
invested  assets  were  78%  and  77%  as  of  December  31,  1995  and  1994,
respectively.    Fixed  maturities increased  4%  in  1995  compared to  1994.
Investing cash and cash equivalents in fixed maturities allowed the Company to
increase investment yield on these monies by  extending time to maturity while
maintaining cash  balances at an  adequate level to  meet the  Company's short
term obligations.  

The Company holds  approximately $425,000  in short term  investments.   Other
investments  mature at  varying times  including bonds  and mortgage  loans of
$10,788,000 and $523,000, respectively,  maturing in one year and  $89,405,000
and  $2,420,000, respectively,  maturing in two  to five  years, which  in the
opinion of management is sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.

Consolidated  operating activities of the Company produced negative cash flows
of  ($6,204,000),  ($3,786,000) and  ($7,298,000)  in  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  The  net cash  provided by operating  activities plus  interest
credited  to account balances and net policyholder contract deposits after the
payment of policyholder withdrawals,  equalled $9,454,000 in 1995, $10,361,000
in 1994, and  $10,029,000 in  1993.  Management  believes this measurement  of
cash  flows  more  accurately  indicates  the  performance  of  the  Company's
insurance  operations, since  reporting regulations  require cash  inflows and
outflows  from  universal life  insurance products  to  be shown  as financing
activities.  

Cash  used  in  investing   activities  was  ($8,030,000),  ($28,595,000)  and
($22,041,000),  for 1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively.   The most significant
aspect  of investing  activities is  the fixed  maturity transactions.   Fixed
maturities  account for  76%, 78%  and 88%  of the  total cost  of investments
acquired in 1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively.  The Company has  not directed
its investable funds to so-called "junk bonds" or derivative investments.  The
cash used  by investing  activities in  the last three  years was  provided by
investing excess cash and cash equivalents and financing activities.  

Net cash  provided by  financing activities  was $15,064,000,  $11,775,000 and
$14,082,000 for  1995,  1994 and  1993, respectively.   Policyholder  contract
deposits increased 8% in 1995 compared to 1994, and decreased  4% in 1994 when
compared to 1993.  The increase between 1995 and 1994 is due to the  change in
marketing  focus  of the  Company.   All of  the  Company's agency  forces are
marketing universal life insurance products.  The change between 1994 and 1993
is a normal fluctuation in marketing of the Company's universal life products.
Policyholder contract withdrawals has  increased 7% in 1995 compared  to 1994,
and increased 10% in 1994 compared to 1993.   The increase in 1995 and 1994 is
not attributable  to any one significant  event.  Factors that  may be causing
the  increase are  the fluctuation  of interest  rates, competition  and other
economic  factors.   The  Company's  current  marketing strategy  and  product
portfolio is directly structured to conserve the existing customer base and at
the same time increase the customer base through new policy production.

                                      19
<PAGE>

Interest credited to account balances increased 12% in 1995 compared to  1994,
and decreased 14% when comparing 1994 to 1993.  The increase in 1995 is due to
the  increase in policyholder contract deposits.   The decrease in 1994 is due
to a reduction in interest rates  credited on the Company's insurance products
in January 1994.  It takes approximately one year to fully realize a change in
credited  rates since  a  change  becomes  effective  on  each  policy's  next
anniversary.   Insurance products that the Company is issuing are crediting 6%
interest and the Company does  not have any immediate plans to  change product
interest rates.

The payment of cash dividends  to shareholders is not legally restricted.   At
December  31, 1995, substantially all  of the consolidated shareholders equity
represents net assets of its subsidiaries.   UTI does not have significant day
to  day operations of its own.   Cash requirements of  UTI primarily relate to
the payment of expenses related to maintaining the Company as a corporation in
good  standing with the various regulatory bodies which govern corporations in
the jurisdictions where  the Company does business.   UTI is able to  meet its
cash needs through its  management agreement with UII and  its income received
on invested assets and cash balances.  Insurance company dividend payments are
regulated  by the state insurance  department where the  company is domiciled.
UG's dividend limitations are described below.

Ohio domiciled insurance companies require five days prior notification to the
insurance  commissioner for  the payment  of an  ordinary dividend.   Ordinary
dividends are defined as the greater of:  a) prior year statutory earnings  or
b) 10%  of statutory capital  and surplus.   For the  year ended December  31,
1995, UG had a statutory gain from operations of $3,197,000.   At December 31,
1995,   UG's   statutory  capital   and   surplus   amounted  to   $7,274,000.
Extraordinary dividends  (amounts in excess of  ordinary dividend limitations)
require prior approval of the insurance commissioner and are not restricted to
a specific calculation.

The Company's Senior  Debt bears interest  equal to 1%  over the variable  per
annum rate most recently announced by the First Bank  of Missouri as its "Base
Rate".  As of March 1, 1996, the "Base Rate" was 8.25%.  The principal balance
of the Company's  Senior Debt is payable  in installments on June  1st of each
year.  On  December 2, 1994, the Company prepaid  $2,000,000 of the $2,900,000
scheduled principal payment due June 1,  1995.  On March 1, 1995, the  Company
prepaid  the  remaining  $900,000 of  the  June  1,  1995 scheduled  principal
payment.    On January  31,  1996,  the  Company  prepaid  $1,500,000  of  the
$3,900,000 scheduled principal payment due June 1, 1996.

Management  believes the  overall  sources  of  liquidity  available  will  be
sufficient to satisfy its financial obligations.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1995 COMPARED TO 1994

(a)  REVENUES

Total revenue increased 1% when comparing 1995 to 1994. 

Premium income, net of  reinsurance premium, decreased 7% when  comparing 1995
to 1994.    The decrease  is  primarily attributed  to  the reduction  in  new
business production and the change in products marketed.  In 1995, the Company
has streamlined the product  portfolio, as well as restructured  the marketing
force.  The decrease in  first year premium production is directly  related to
the Company's change  in distribution systems.   The Company  has changed  its
focus  from primarily a broker  agency distribution system  to a captive agent
system.

                                        20
<PAGE>

Business  written  by  the  broker  agency force in  recent years did not meet 
Company expectations.  With the  change in focus of distribution systems, most 
of the broker agents  were terminated.   (The termination of the broker agency 
force caused a non-recurring write-down of  the value  of agency  force asset.
See discussion of amortization of agency force for further details.)

The change in marketing  strategy from traditional life insurance  products to
universal life insurance  products had  a significant impact  on new  business
production.  As a result of the  change in marketing strategy the agency force
went through a  restructure and retraining  process.  Cash collected  from the
universal life and interest sensitive products contribute only the risk charge
to premium  income, however  traditional insurance products  contribute monies
received  to premium income.   One  factor that has  had a  positive impact on
premium income is the improvement of persistency.  Persistency is a measure of
insurance  in force  retained  in relation  to  the previous  year.   Overall,
persistency improved to 87.5% in 1995 compared to 86.3% in 1994.  

Other considerations, net of  reinsurance, increased 13% compared to  one year
ago.   Other considerations  consists of  administrative charges  on universal
life and interest sensitive life  insurance products.  The insurance in  force
relating to these types of products continues to increase as marketing efforts
are focused on universal life insurance products.

Net investment  income increased 8% when  comparing 1995 to 1994.   The change
reflected an increase  in the amount of  invested assets, which was  partially
offset by  a lower  effective  yield on  investments made  during  1995.   The
overall investment yields for 1995, 1994 and 1993, are 7.04%, 7.13% and 7.22%,
respectively.  The Company  has been able to increase its investment portfolio
through  financing cash  flows, generated  by cash  received through  sales of
universal  life  insurance  products.   Although  the  Company  sold no  fixed
maturities during the last few years, it did experience a significant turnover
in  the portfolio.  Many companies with bond issues outstanding took advantage
of lower  interest rates  and retired older  debt which carried  higher rates.
This was accomplished through  early calls and accelerated pay-downs  of fixed
maturity investments.  

The Company's investments are generally managed to match related insurance and
policyholder  liabilities.  The Company,  in conjunction with  the decrease in
average  yield of  the Company's  fixed maturity  portfolio has  decreased the
average  crediting  rate  for the  insurance  and  investment  products.   The
comparison of investment return with insurance or investment product crediting
rates establishes an  interest spread.   The minimum  interest spread  between
earned and credited rates is 1% on the "Century 2000" universal life insurance
product,  the  Company's primary  product.   The  Company  monitors investment
yields, and when  necessary takes action to adjust credited  interest rates on
its  insurance  products  to preserve  targeted  spreads.    Over  60% of  the
insurance and investment product reserves are crediting 5% or less in interest
and 39% of  the insurance and investment product  reserves are crediting 5.25%
to 6% in interest.  It is expected that the monitoring of the interest spreads
by  management will  provide the  necessary margin  to adequately  provide for
associated costs on insurance policies the Company has in force and will write
in the future. 

Realized  investment losses  were $124,000  and $1,437,000  in 1995  and 1994,
respectively.  Fixed maturities and  equity securities realized net investment
losses of $224,000  and real estate realized net investment  gains of $100,000
in 1995.  The realized loss in 1995 can not be attributed to any  one specific
transaction.    In 1994,  the Company  realized losses  of  $865,000 due  to a
permanent  impairment  of  property  located  in  Louisiana.    The  permanent
impairment  was  based   on  recent  appraisals  and   marketing  analysis  of
surrounding  properties.  

                                     21
<PAGE>
The Company  realized a gain  of $467,000 from the  sale  of an  insignificant
subsidiary  in  1994.   In  1994,  the  Company  realized a  loss of  $212,000
from  the  charge  off of  its investment  in  its  equity  subsidiary, United
Fidelity, Inc.   The Company  had other  gains and  losses  during  the period
that comprised the remaining amount reported but were routine or immaterial in
nature to disclose on an individual basis.


(b)  EXPENSES

Total expenses increased 16% when comparing 1995 to 1994. 

Life benefits, net of  reinsurance benefits and claims, decreased  4% compared
to  1994.   The  decrease is  related to  the decrease  in first  year premium
production.  Another factor that has  caused life benefits to decrease is that
during 1994, the  Company lowered  its crediting rates  on interest  sensitive
products  in  response  to financial  market  conditions.    This action  will
facilitate  the appropriate  spreads between  investment returns  and credited
interest rates.  It takes approximately one year to  fully realize a change in
credited  rates since  a  change  becomes  effective  on  each  policy's  next
anniversary.  Please refer to discussion of net investment income for analysis
of interest spreads. 

The Company experienced an increase of 6% in mortality during 1995 compared to
1994.   The increase  in  mortality is  due primarily  to settlement  expenses
discussed in the following paragraph:

During the third quarter of  1994, UG became aware that certain  new insurance
business  was  being solicited  by certain  agents  and issued  to individuals
considered to  be not insurable  by Company standards.   These policies  had a
face amount of $22,700,000 and represent 1/2  of 1% of the insurance in force.
Management's analysis indicates that the expected death claims on the business
in force to be adequately covered by the mortality assumptions inherent in the
calculation of statutory reserves.  Nevertheless, management has determined it
is in the best interest of the  Company to repurchase as many of the  policies
as possible.  As of December 31, 1995, there remained approximately $5,738,000
of the original  face amount which  have not been  settled.  The Company  will
continue its efforts  to repurchase as  many of the  policies as possible  and
regularly apprise the  Ohio Department  of Insurance regarding  the status  of
this  situation.   Through December  31, 1995,  the Company  spent a  total of
$2,886,000  for the repurchase of these policies  and for the legal defense of
related litigation.   In relation to the repurchase  of insurance policies the
Company incurred  life benefits of $720,000  and $1,250,000 in  1995 and 1994,
respectively.  The Company  incurred legal costs of  $687,000 and $229,000  in
1995 and 1994, respectively.

Dividends to policyholders increased approximately 16% when comparing 1995  to
1994.   USA continued to  market participating policies  through most of 1994.
Management expects dividends to policyholders will continue to increase in the
future.   A significant  portion of  the insurance  in force  is participating
insurance.   A significant portion of the participating business is relatively
newer business, and the dividend scale for participating policies increases in
the early durations.   The dividend scale is subject to  approval of the Board
of  Directors  and may  be  changed  at their  discretion.    The Company  has
discontinued its marketing of participating policies.

Commissions and  amortization of  deferred policy acquisition  costs increased
21% in  1995 compared  to 1994.   The increase  is directly attributed  to the
amortization of a larger  asset.  The increase is also caused by the reduction
in  first  year premium  production.    To a  lesser  extent  the increase  in
amortization of deferred policy  acquisition costs is directly related  to the
change  in  products that  is  currently marketed.   The  Company  revised its
portfolio of  products as previously  discussed in premium income.   These new
products pay  lower first  year 

                                    22
<PAGE>

commissions than  the products  sold in  prior periods.   The  asset increased
due  to first  year premium  production by the agency force.  The  Company did
benefit from improved persistency.  

Amortization of cost  of insurance acquired decreased 40% in  1995 compared to
1994.  Cost of insurance acquired is amortized in relation  to expected future
profits,  including direct charge-offs for any excess of the unamortized asset
over the projected future profits.   The Company did not have  any charge-offs
during the  periods covered  by this  report.   The  decrease in  amortization
during the current  period is a normal fluctuation due  to the expected future
profits.  Amortization of cost of insurance acquired is particularly sensitive
to changes  in persistency  of  certain blocks  of insurance  in  force.   The
Company's average persistency rate for all policies in force for 1995 and 1994
has been approximately 87.5% and 86.3%, respectively.

During 1995,  the  Company reported  a non-recurring  write down  of value  of
agency force  of  $8,297,000.   The  write down  is  directly related  to  the
Company's change in distribution  systems.  The Company has  changed its focus
from primarily a  broker agency distribution system to a captive agent system.
Business produced  by the broker  agency force  in recent years  did not  meet
Company expectations.  With the change in  focus of distribution systems, most
of the broker agents were  terminated.  The termination of most of  the agents
involved in the broker agency force caused management to re-evaluate the value
of  the agency force carried  on the balance sheet.   As of December 31, 1995,
the remaining  value of the agency  force on the balance  sheet represents the
active agency forces that continue to originate premium production.   

Operating expenses increased  18% in 1995 compared to 1994.   The increase was
caused by several factors.   The primary factor for the increase  in operating
expenses is due to the decrease in production.  The decrease in production was
discussed  in the  analysis  of premium  income.   As  such,  the Company  was
positioned  to  handle  significantly  more first  year  production  than  was
produced.  First year operating expenses that were deferred and capitalized as
a  deferred policy acquisition  costs asset was  $532,000 in 1995  compared to
$1,757,000  in  1994.   The difference  between  the policy  acquisition costs
deferred  in 1995  compared  to  1994,  effected  the  increase  in  operating
expenses.  The increase in operating  expenses was offset, to a lesser extent,
from a 12%  reduction in  staff in 1995  compared to 1994.   The reduction  in
staff was achieved by attrition.

Another  factor that  caused the  increase in  operating expenses  is directly
related to increased legal costs.  During the third quarter of 1994, UG became
aware  that  certain new  insurance business  was  being solicited  by certain
agents and  issued to individuals  considered to be  not insurable  by Company
standards.  These policies had a face amount of $22,700,000  and represent 1/2
of 1%  of the insurance  in force of  the Company.   As of December  31, 1995,
there remained approximately $5,738,000 of the original face amount which have
not been settled.  The Company will continue its efforts to repurchase as many
of the  policies  as possible  and regularly  apprise the  Ohio Department  of
Insurance regarding the status of this situation.  The Company  incurred legal
costs  of $687,000 and $229,000 in 1995  and 1994, respectively, for the legal
defense of related litigation. 

Interest expense increased  slightly in 1995 compared  to 1994.  The  increase
was due to  the increase in  the interest rate  on the Company's senior  debt,
which is tied to  the base rate of the  First Bank of Missouri.   The interest
rate on the senior  debt increased to 10% on  March 1, 1995 compared to  7% on
March  1, 1994.   The Company was  able to minimize  the effect of  the higher
interest  rate  in 1995  by early  payments of  principal.   The  Company paid
$600,000 in principal payments in early 1995.  The interest rate on the senior
debt has decreased to 9.25% as of March 1, 1996.

                                      23

(c)  NET LOSS

The Company had  a net loss of  $3,001,000 in 1995 compared  to a net loss  of
$1,624,000 in  1994.  The decline  in 1995 is attributed  to the non-recurring
write  down  of the  value  of  agency force  and  the  increase in  operating
expenses.  The  write down of agency  force, net of deferred  income taxes and
minority interest, caused $2,608,000 of the  $3,001,000 net loss in 1995.  The
net  loss  was minimized  by  the improvement  of  net  investment income  and
realized investment losses when compared to the previous year. 


1994 COMPARED TO 1993

(a)  REVENUES

Total revenues increased  1% when comparing 1994 to 1993.   The termination of
the  Company's  coinsurance  agreement   with  Republic  Vanguard  contributed
significantly to the increase in revenues.

Premium income, net of  reinsurance premium, increased 4% when  comparing 1994
to 1993.   The termination of the coinsurance agreement with Republic Vanguard
contributed  significantly to  the  increase in  premium,  net of  reinsurance
premium.   UG terminated the  coinsurance agreement with  Republic Vanguard on
December  31, 1993.  In  UG, first year reinsurance  premium was 21% of direct
first year  premium in 1993  compared to 3%  in 1994.   Coinsurance agreements
provide  a sharing  or 50/50 relationship  between the direct  company and the
reinsurer  of the premiums, benefits  and the profitability  of the underlying
product.   Management  believes that  terminating the  agreement was  the best
alternative for long term benefit of the Company. 

In  1994,  the  Company has  been  very  active  in streamlining  the  product
portfolio, as  well as  restructuring the  marketing force.    The Company  is
currently marketing three universal life products.   In late 1994, the Company
discontinued  marketing the traditional and interest  sensitive products.  The
current universal life products feature lower first year costs compared to the
discontinued  products.   The marketing  force  is made  up of  three distinct
groups.  Business produced by the broker agency force did not meet the Company
standards.   Therefore, most  of the  agents associated  with that group  were
terminated.  The other  two agency forces  continued to grow  in 1994.   First
year direct premium decreased 3% in 1994 compared to 1993.  The small decrease
is  perceived as  a  positive  result  when considering  the  changes  to  the
portfolio and marketing force.

Net investment  income decreased slightly  when comparing  1994 to 1993.   The
Company's  average yield on its investments declined slightly in 1994 compared
to  1993.   The Company  has been  able to  increase its  investment portfolio
through financing cash  flows and reducing its cash  and short term positions.
Although  the Company  sold no fixed  maturities during  1994 or  1993, it did
experience a significant turnover  in the portfolio.  Many companies with bond
issues outstanding  took advantage of the  lower interest rates in  the market
during 1993 and early 1994 and retired older debt which  carried higher rates.
This was accomplished through  early calls and accelerated pay-downs  of fixed
maturity investments.   In late 1994 and  early 1995, there has  been a slight
upward movement in general interest rates.  

The Company's investments are generally managed to match related insurance and
policyholder  liabilities.  The overall  investment yields for  1994, 1993 and
1992, are  7.13%, 7.22% and 7.86%,  respectively.  The  Company in conjunction
with  the decrease in average yield of  the Company's fixed maturity portfolio
has  decreased  the average  crediting rate  for  the Company's  insurance and
investment  products.  The comparison  of investment return  with insurance or
investment  product crediting rates  establishes an interest  spread.  Minimum
interest spreads  between earned  and  credited rates  are 1%  to  1.5%.   The
Company  continually  assesses 

                                      24
<PAGE>

investment yields, and when necessary takes action to reduce credited interest
rates on its insurance products to preserve targeted spreads.  Credited  rates 
are   established  by  the Board  of Directors.  Over 60% of the insurance and
investment product reserves are crediting 5% or  less  in  interest and 39% of
the insurance and investment   product  reserves  are crediting 5.25% to 6% in
interest.  It is expected that  the  monitoring of the   interest  spreads  by
management will  provide  the  necessary  margin to   adequately   provide for
associated costs on insurance policies that the Company  has in force and will
write in the future. 

Realized  investment losses  were $1,437,000  and $562,000  in 1994  and 1993,
respectively.   The Company  realized losses of  $865,000 and $505,000  due to
permanent impairment  of the value of  property located in Louisiana,  in 1994
and 1993,  respectively.  The  Company is  actively pursuing a  buyer for  the
property.  The permanent impairment was due to recent appraisals and marketing
analysis of  the  surrounding properties.    The Company  realized  a gain  of
$467,000 due  to the sale of an insignificant subsidiary in 1994.  The Company
realized a loss of $212,000 from the charge off of its remaining investment in
its  equity  subsidiary, United  Fidelity, Inc.    The Company  determined any
material recoverability of  its investment  to be unlikely  due to  continuing
losses and  limited capital of United  Fidelity, Inc.  The  Company realized a
loss of $394,000 due to calls and accelerated pay-downs of fixed maturities in
1994.  The Company realized a loss of $119,000 due to the sale of common stock
which was acquired through the reorganization  of a fixed maturity security of
Savin Corporation.   The Company had other gains and  losses during the period
that  compromised the remaining amount reported but were routine or immaterial
in nature to disclose on an individual basis.


(b)  EXPENSES

Total  expenses increased 4%  when comparing 1994  to 1993.   Life and annuity
benefits, net of  reinsurance, contributed  significantly to  the increase  in
expenses.  Operating expenses decreased during 1994 compared to 1993.  

Life benefits and  reinsurance benefits  and claims increased  5% compared  to
1993.   Reinsurance  benefits  and claims  changed  significantly due  to  the
termination  of the coinsurance  treaty with  Republic Vanguard.   Coinsurance
agreements  provide a sharing or 50/50 relationship between the direct company
and  the reinsurer  of the  premiums, benefits  and the  profitability  of the
underlying product.   Management believes  that terminating the  agreement was
the best alternative for the long term benefit of the Company. 

Mortality remained  at the same  level in 1994 compared  to 1993.   Changes in
mortality can have a significant impact on life benefits. 

During the  third quarter of 1994,  the Company became aware  that certain new
insurance  business was being solicited by certain  agents of UG and issued to
individuals  considered to  be  not insurable  by  Company standards.    These
policies had a face amount of $22,700,000 and represent less than 1/2 of 1% of
the insurance in force of the Company.  Management's analysis  of the business
in force indicates that the expected death claims on the business  in force to
be adequately covered by the mortality assumptions inherent in the calculation
of statutory reserves.   Nevertheless, management has determined it  is in the
best interest of the Company to attempt to acquire as many of the  policies as
possible. 

During  1994, the Company authorized  $1,250,000 for the  acquisition of these
policies.   At December 31, 1994,  the Company had $227,961  remaining for the
purchase of these policies.  The $1,250,000 has been charged to life benefits,
claims and settlement expenses.

                                     25
<PAGE>

During 1993  and  early 1994,  the  Company  lowered its  crediting  rates  on
interest  sensitive products in response to financial market conditions.  This
action will facilitate the appropriate spreads between  investment returns and
credited interest rates.   The result is a reduction to the life benefits line
item as the increase in policy values through credited interest is lower.  The
overall investment yields for 1994, 1993 and 1992, are 7.13%, 7.22% and 7.86%,
respectively.   The Company in conjunction  with the decrease in average yield
of  the Company's fixed maturity portfolio has decreased the average crediting
rate for the Company's insurance  and investment products.  The  comparison of
investment  return  with  insurance  or  investment  product  crediting  rates
establishes an interest spread.   Minimum interest spreads between  earned and
credited  rates are 1%  to 1.5%.  The  Company continually assesses investment
yields, and  when necessary takes action to  reduce credited interest rates on
its  insurance  products to  preserve targeted  spreads.   Credited  rates are
established  by  the Board  of  Directors.   Over  60%  of  the insurance  and
investment product  reserves are crediting 5%  or less in interest  and 39% of
the insurance and  investment product reserves  are crediting  5.25% to 6%  in
interest.   It  is expected  that the  monitoring of  the interest  spreads by
management  will  provide the  necessary  margin  to  adequately  provide  for
associated costs on insurance policies that  the Company has in force and will
write in the  future.   Management anticipates that  the lowering of  credited
interest rates will benefit future periods. 

Dividends to policyholders increased approximately  23% when comparing 1994 to
1993.   USA continued to  market participating policies  through most of 1994.
Management expects dividends to policyholders will continue to increase in the
future.   A  portion  of the  Company's insurance  in  force is  participating
insurance.   A significant portion of the participating business is relatively
newer  business.   The  dividend scale  for  participating policies  increases
significantly in the early years.   The dividend scale is subject  to approval
of the Board of Directors and may be changed at their discretion.  The Company
no longer markets any participating policies.

Commissions and  amortization of  deferred policy acquisition  costs increased
15% in  1994 compared to 1993.   The increase is directly  attributable to the
amortization of  a larger asset.   The  asset is increasing  due to  continued
first year  premium production by the  agency force.  The  Company did benefit
from  improved persistency.  Persistency  is the measurement  of policies that
the Company was  able to  retain in  a given period  of time.   The  Company's
average persistency rate for  all policies in force for 1994 and 1993 has been
approximately 86%  and 85%,  respectively.   The  overall improvement  appears
small but  has a  significant impact  on the  amortization of deferred  policy
acquisition  costs.    There was  significant  improvement  in persistency  on
certain  blocks of insurance that are sensitive to fluctuations in persistency
and directly  affect the  amortization of deferred  policy acquisition  costs.
The  Company  revised its  portfolio of  products  as previously  discussed in
premium income.   These new products pay  lower commissions than  the previous
products sold in prior periods.

Amortization  of cost of insurance acquired  increased 36% in 1994 compared to
1993.   Cost of insurance acquired is amortized in relation to expected future
profits,  including direct charge-offs for any excess of the unamortized asset
over the projected  future profits.  The Company did  not have any charge-offs
during  the periods  covered by  this report.   The  increase in  amortization
during  the current period is a normal  fluctuation due to the expected future
profits.

Operating expenses  decreased 13% in 1994  compared to 1993.   The decrease is
not attributable to  one particular event but to the  overall savings produced
from the recent  streamlining efforts.  A  reduction of operating expenses  is
being  realized from  operating fewer  insurance subsidiaries.   In  1992, the
Company  was operating eleven insurance companies, but through mergers and the
sale  of one  insignificant  subsidiary, the  Company  is now  operating  four

                                      26
<PAGE>

insurance  companies.  The Company  also completed conversion  of an insurance
subsidiary's  computer system to  its Life 70  system.  The  Company had a 11%
reduction  in staff in  1994 compared to  1993.   This was achieved  mostly by
attrition.   The Company feels that this  reduction was necessary and could be
achieved through continued improvement in efficiency and automation. 

Interest expense  decreased slightly in 1994  compared to 1993.   The decrease
was  due  to  the  reduction  in  the Company's  senior  debt.    The  Company
experienced an  increase in the  interest rate on  the Company's  senior debt,
which is  tied to the prime  rate of the lead  bank.  The Company  was able to
minimize the  effect of  the increase  in interest rate  by early  payments of
principal.   The Company paid $2,000,000  in principal payments in  1994.  The
Company believes that interest rates will not change dramatically in 1995, and
therefore will not significantly impact interest expense.


(c)  NET LOSS

The Company had  a net loss of  $1,624,000 in 1994 compared  to a net loss  of
$862,000 in 1993.   The decline in 1994 was the result of the establishment of
a reserve of  $1,250,000 for  the acquisition of  certain policies,  continued
losses experienced  by the  Company's  36% owned  affiliate, United  Fidelity,
Inc., and realized  investment losses.   See the  discussion of the  Company's
life  benefits for  further discussion  regarding the  acquisition of  certain
policies.   At December  31, 1994,  UFI has  a carrying value  of zero  on the
Company's financial  statements.  See  Note 9A of  the notes to  the financial
statements for further discussion of United Fidelity, Inc.  See the discussion
of the Company's  revenues for  further discussion of  the Company's  realized
investment losses.  The  Company was able to  benefit from an increase in  the
credit provided by deferred income taxes.   Deferred income taxes are affected
by  changes  in  timing  differences  between  the  financial  statements  and
reportable for  federal income tax purposes.   Also, a  reduction in operating
expenses contributed to  reducing the  loss in 1994.   Management  anticipates
that the  lowering of credited interest  rates on the Company's  insurance and
investment products will benefit future periods. 


FINANCIAL CONDITION

(a)  ASSETS

The Company's financial position at December 31, 1995, reflected a decrease in
assets and an increase in liabilities compared to the preceding year end.   As
of   December  31,  1995  and  1994,  cash  and  invested  assets  represented
approximately 72% and 69% of consolidated assets, respectively.  Cash and cash
equivalents increased 7% when comparing 1995 to 1994.  As of December 31, 1995
and 1994, fixed maturities represented 74% of total invested assets and cash.

                                    27
<PAGE>

By  insurance statute, the majority  of the Company's  investment portfolio is
required  to be  invested  in investment  grade  securities to  provide  ample
protection to policyholders.   The liabilities are predominantly long  term in
nature  and therefore,  the  Company  invests  in  long  term  fixed  maturity
investments  which are reported in the financial statements at their amortized
cost.  The Company  has the ability  and intent to  hold these investments  to
maturity; consequently, the Company does not expect to realize any significant
loss  from  these investments.    The  Company  does  not own  any  derivative
investments  or "junk bonds".  As of  December 31, 1995, the carrying value of
fixed  maturity  securities  in  default  as  to  principal  or  interest  was
immaterial in the context of consolidated assets or shareholders' equity.  The
Company  has  identified  securities  it  may  sell  and  classified  them  as
"investments held for sale".  Investments held for sale are carried at market.

The  Company's  fixed maturity  securities  include  mortgage-backed bonds  of
$21,415,000 and $22,444,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.   The
mortgage-backed  bonds   are  subject   to  risks  associated   with  variable
prepayments  of  the  underlying  mortgage  loans.   Prepayments  cause  those
securities to have different actual maturities  than that expected at the time
of purchase.  Prepayment of mortgage backed securities  with an amortized cost
greater than par  will incur a reduction in  yield or loss.   Those securities
that  have an amortized cost less than  par will generate an increase in yield
or gain.  The  degree to which  a security is susceptible  to either gains  or
losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par, the
relative interest  rate sensitivity  of the  underlying mortgages backing  the
assets  and  the  repayment   priority  of  the  securities  in   the  overall
securitization structure.

The  Company limits its credit risk by  purchasing securities backed by stable
collateral  and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their
trust  structure.  Such  securities with reduced  risk typically  have a lower
yield  (but higher  liquidity) than  higher-risk mortgage-backed  bonds (i.e.,
mortgage-backed  bonds structured  to share  in residual  cash flows  or which
cover only interest  payments).  At  December 31, 1995,  the Company does  not
have a significant  amount of  higher-risk mortgage-backed bonds.   There  are
negligible  default risks in the Company's mortgage-backed bond portfolio as a
whole.    The vast  majority  of  the assets  are  either  guaranteed by  U.S.
government-sponsored entities or are supported in the securitization structure
by  junior securities  enabling the  assets to  achieve high  investment grade
status.

The  Company experienced moderate  turnover in its  fixed maturities portfolio
during 1995.  As previously discussed, this was the result of companies taking
advantage of lower  interest rates.  This was accomplished through early calls
and accelerated  pay downs.  During the year, the Company reinvested its funds
and  invested  new  monies  from  operations  and from  cash  and  short  term
investments primarily in investment grade corporate bonds.

Mortgage loans decreased 12% in  1995 as compared to 1994.  The Company is not
actively seeking new mortgage loans, and the decrease is due to early pay-offs
from  mortgagee's seeking refinancing at  lower interest rates.   All mortgage
loans  held by the Company are first position loans.  The Company has $618,000
in mortgage loans, net of a $10,000 reserve allowance, which are in default or
in the process of  foreclosure, this represents approximately 4%  of the total
portfolio.

Investment  real estate  and  real estate  acquired  in satisfaction  of  debt
decreased slightly  in 1995 compared to  1994.  The decrease  is primarily the
net  result  of  improvements made  and  sales  of  homes  and lots  from  the
residential  developments.     Total  real  estate  is  separated   into  four
categories:   Home Office 18%, Commercial 15%, Residential Development 36% and
Foreclosed Properties 31%.

                                    28

Policy loans increased 4% in 1995 compared to 1994.   There is no single event
that  caused policy loans to  increase.  Industry  experience for policy loans
indicates  few policy  loans are  ever repaid  by the policyholder  other than
through termination of the  policy.  Policy loans are  systematically reviewed
to ensure that no individual policy  loan exceeds the underlying cash value of
the policy.    Policy loans  will  generally increase  due  to new  loans  and
interest compounding on existing policy loans.

Value  of agency force acquired decreased significantly when compared to 1994.
The decrease  is primarily due to the non-recurring write down of a portion of
the asset.   The write  down of agency force  accounted for $8,297,000  of the
decrease.   The  write down  is directly  related to  the Company's  change in
distribution  systems.   The Company  has changed its  focus from  primarily a
broker agency distribution system to a captive agent system.  Business written
by  the broker agency  force in recent  years did not  meet Company standards.
With the  change in focus of  distribution systems, most of  the broker agents
were terminated.  The termination of most of the agents involved in the broker
agency force caused management  to re-evaluate the  value of the agency  force
carried on the balance sheet.  As of December 31, 1995, the remaining value of
the agency force on the balance sheet represents the active agency forces that
continue to originate premium production.   

Cost  of insurance  acquired  and  cost  in excess  of  net  assets  purchased
decreased 7% in 1995 compared to 1994.  The decrease is directly attributed to
normal  amortization during  the period.   The  Company did not  recognize any
impairments during the period.

Deferred policy acquisition costs increased 8% in 1995 compared to  1994.  The
Company  had $2,370,000  in  policy acquisition  costs  deferred, $338,000  in
interest accretion  and $1,905,000 in  amortization.  The  Company anticipates
similar increases  in the  future due  to continued  marketing efforts  by the
Company's agency force.  The Company did not  recognize any impairments during
the period.

   
(b)  LIABILITIES

Total liabilities increased approximately 1% in 1995 compared to 1994.  Future
policy benefits increased 3% in 1995 and represented 80% of total  liabilities
at December 31, 1995.   Management expects future policy benefits  to increase
in the  future  due to  the aging  of the  volume  of insurance  in force  and
continued production by the Company's sales force.  

Policy  claims and  benefits payable decreased  3% in  1995 compared  to 1994.
There is no  single event that  caused this item  to decrease.  Policy  claims
vary from year to year and therefore, fluctuations in this liability are to be
expected and are not considered unusual by management.  

Other policyholder funds decreased 4% in 1995 compared to 1994.   The decrease
can be  attributed to a  decrease in premium  deposit funds.   Premium deposit
funds are  funds deposited by the  policyholder with the  insurance company to
accumulate  interest and pay future policy premiums.   The change in marketing
from traditional  insurance products to  universal life insurance  products is
the primary reason for the decrease.  Universal life insurance products do not
have premium  deposit funds.  All premiums  received from the policyholder are
credited to  the life  insurance policy  and  are reflected  in future  policy
benefits. 

Dividend and endowment accumulations  increased 14% in 1995 compared  to 1994.
The increase is attributed to the significant amount of participating business
the Company has in force.  There are generally four options a policyholder can
select to pay policy dividends.   Over 47% of  all dividends paid were put  on
deposit  to accumulate with  interest.   Accordingly, management  expects this
liability to increase in the future. 

                                    29
<PAGE>

Income taxes payable and deferred income taxes payable decreased significantly
in 1995  compared to 1994.   The primary reason  for the decrease  in deferred
income taxes is due to the impairment of the agency force acquired asset.  The
impairment  decreased  deferred income  taxes by  $2,904,000.   The  change in
deferred income taxes payable is attributable to temporary differences between
Generally  Accepted Accounting  Principles ("GAAP")  and tax  basis.   Federal
income taxes  are fully  disclosed in  Note 3  of the Notes  to the  Financial
Statements.

Notes  payable decreased $600,000  in 1995 compared  to 1994.   On January 31,
1996, the Company prepaid  $1,500,000 of the $3,900,000 principal  payment due
on June 1, 1996.  The Company's long term debt is discussed in more  detail in
Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.


(c)  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Total shareholders'  equity  decreased 13%  in  1995 compared  to  1994.   The
decrease  in shareholders'  equity  is  primarily  due  to  the  net  loss  of
$3,001,000  in  1995.     The  Company  experienced   $142,000  in  unrealized
appreciation of equity securities and investments held for sale in 1995.


REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

The Company is  highly regulated by state insurance authorities  in the states
its affiliates are domiciled.  Such regulations, among other things, limit the
amount of dividends, tax sharing payments,  other payments that can be made by
affiliates without  prior regulatory approval  and impose restrictions  on the
amount and  type of  investments the Company  may own.   The  Company also  is
regulated  in various states as an insurance  holding company system.  Because
the Company  is an  insurance holding  company, an  investment in  the Company
which could result in a change in  control must be passed on by certain  state
departments of insurance.

There  is currently  increased scrutiny placed  upon the  insurance regulatory
framework.  As a result, certain state legislatures have considered or enacted
laws  that  alter, and  in many  cases increase,  state authority  to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems.  In light of recent
legislative developments, the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners
("NAIC") and state insurance regulators have begun examining existing laws and
regulations,  specifically focusing on insurance company investments, solvency
issues, risk-adjusted capital  guidelines, interpretations  of existing  laws,
the  development of new  laws, the implementation  of nonstatutory guidelines,
and  the circumstances under which dividends may  be paid.  The Company cannot
predict with certainty the  effect that any NAIC recommendations,  proposed or
future legislation, may have on the financial condition or operations.  

The Company receives  funds from  its insurance  subsidiaries in  the form  of
management and cost sharing  arrangements (See Note 9) and  through dividends.
Annual dividends in  excess of  maximum amounts prescribed  by state  statutes
("extraordinary  dividends") may  not  be paid  without  the approval  of  the
insurance commissioner in  which an  insurance subsidiary is  domiciled.   The
National  Association of  Insurance Commissioners  ("NAIC") has  proposed, and
certain  states have adopted, legislation that lowers the threshold amount for
determining  what constitutes  an  extraordinary dividend.   Such  legislative
changes  could  make  it more  difficult  for  insurance  subsidiaries to  pay
dividends to their parents. 

                                    30
<PAGE>

The  NAIC has adopted Risk-Based  Capital ("RBC") requirements for life/health
insurance  companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus
in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality, mortality
and morbidity, asset and liability  matching and other business factors.   The
RBC formula  will be used  by state insurance  regulators as an  early warning
tool to identify, for  the purpose of initiating regulatory  action, insurance
companies that potentially  are inadequately  capitalized.   In addition,  the
formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current
system  of low fixed minimum  capital and surplus  requirements on a state-by-
state basis.  Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio  of the insurance
company's regulatory  total adjusted capital, as  defined by the NAIC,  to its
authorized control level  RBC, as defined  by the  NAIC.  Insurance  company's
below  specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels,
each of which requires specific corrective  action.  The levels and ratios are
as follows:

                                       Ratio of Total Adjusted Capital to
                                          Authorized Control Level RBC 
          Regulatory Event                   (Less Than or Equal to)    

        Company action level                            2*
        Regulatory action level                         1.5
        Authorized control level                        1
        Mandatory control level                         0.7

        * Or, 2.5 with negative trend.

At December 31, 1995, each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries has a Ratio
that is  in excess of  250% of the  authorized control level;  accordingly the
Company's subsidiaries meet the RBC requirements. 

The NAIC has proposed a new Model Investment Law that may affect the statutory
carrying values of  certain investments;  however,  the final outcome of  that
proposal  is  not certain,  nor  is it  possible  to predict  what  impact the
proposal will have on the Company or  whether the proposal will be adopted  in
the foreseeable future.


FUTURE OUTLOOK

Factors  expected to  influence life  insurance industry  growth include:   1)
competitive pressure among the large number of existing firms; 2)  competition
from  financial service  companies,  as they  seek  to expand  into  insurance
marketing; 3)  customers' changing needs for  new types of insurance products;
4)   customers' lack of confidence  in the entire industry as  a result of the
recent  highly visible  failures; and  5)   uncertainty concerning  the future
regulation of  the industry.   Growth  in demand for  insurance products  will
depend upon demographic variables such as income  growth, wealth accumulation,
population and work force changes.

ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The  Financial  Accounting Standards  Board  (FASB)  has issued  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114  entitled "Accounting by Creditors  for
Impairment of a Loan" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118,
an amendment of Statement No. 114.  The Statement amends FASB Statement No.  5
"Accounting  for  Contingencies" and  FASB  Statement  No. 15  "Accounting  by
Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring".  This Statement, which
became effective  for financial statements  for fiscal  years beginning  after
December  15, 1994,  applies to  all troubled  debt restructuring  involving a
modification of terms.

A  loan  is impaired  when, based  on current  information  and events,  it is
probable  that a creditor will be unable  to collect all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  As used in this Statement and
in Statement 5, as amended, all amounts due according to the contractual terms
means  that  both  the  contractual  interest  payments  and  the  contractual
principal  payments of  a loan  will  be collected  as scheduled  in the  loan
agreement.  This  Statement does not  specify how a creditor  should determine
that  it  is probable  that  it will  be  unable  to collect  all  amounts due
according to  the contractual terms  of a loan.   A creditor  should apply its
normal loan review procedures in making that judgment.  An insignificant delay
or  insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not require application
of this Statement.  A loan is not impaired during a period of delay in payment
if the creditor expects to collect all amounts due including interest  accrued
at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.  Thus, a demand loan
or other loan with  no stated maturity is not impaired if the creditor expects
to  collect  all amounts  due including  interest  accrued at  the contractual
interest rate during the period the loan is outstanding.

This  statement was adopted for  the 1995 financial  statements.  The adoption
did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements.

The  Financial  Accounting Standards  Board  (FASB)  has issued  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 entitled "Accounting for the Impairment
of  Long-Lived Assets  and for  Long-Lived Assets  to be  Disposed of".   This
Statement,  becomes  effective  for  financial  statements  for  fiscal  years
beginning after December 31, 1995, with early adoption encouraged.

An entity shall review long-lived assets and  certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events  or changes in circumstances indicate  that the
carrying  amount of an  asset may  not be recoverable.   If  certain events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable,  the entity shall estimate  the future cash flows  expected to
result from the  use of the asset  and its eventual disposition.   Future cash
flows are the future  cash inflows expected to  be generated by an  asset less
the future cash outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows.  If
the sum of the expected  future cash flows (undiscounted and  without interest
charges)  is less  than the  carrying amount  of the  asset, the  entity shall
recognize an impairment loss in accordance with this Statement.  Otherwise, an
impairment loss shall  not be  recognized; however, a  review of  depreciation
policies may be appropriate.

This statement was  adopted for the 1995  financial statements.   The adoption
did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements.

                         Independent Auditors' Report



Board of Directors and Shareholders
United Trust, Inc.


      We have audited  the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of United
Trust, Inc. (an Illinois corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995
and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity, and  cash  flows for  each of  the  three years  in the  period  ended
December 31, 1995.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of  the
Company's management.   Our responsibility is  to express an opinion  on these
financial statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in  accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.   Those standards  require that  we plan and  perform the  audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates  made by  management, as  well as  evaluating the  overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

      In  our opinion,  the  financial statements  referred  to above  present
fairly, in  all  material respects,  the  consolidated financial  position  of
United Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December  31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
each of  the three years in the period  ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

      We have also audited Schedule  I as of December 31, 1995,  and Schedules
II, IV and  V as  of December 31,  1995 and  1994, of United  Trust, Inc.  and
subsidiaries and Schedules  II, IV and  V for each of  the three years  in the
period  then ended.   In our opinion,  these schedules present  fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be set forth therein.

      ability  to exercise  significant influence  are included  based on  the
      equity  method of accounting and the Company's share of such affiliates'
      operating  results  is reflected  in Equity  in  loss of  investee, net.
      Other  investments in affiliates are  carried at cost.   All significant
      intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

D.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The financial statements of United Trust, Inc.'s
      life  insurance  subsidiaries  have  been prepared  in  accordance  with
      generally  accepted accounting  principles which  differ from  statutory
      accounting practices permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.

E.    USE  OF ESTIMATES - In preparing financial statements in conformity with
      generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities, the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
      date of the financial  statements, and the reported amounts  of revenues
      and expenses during the  reporting period.  Actual results  could differ
      from those estimates.

F.    INVESTMENTS - Investments are shown on the following bases:

      Fixed maturities --  at cost,  adjusted for amortization  of premium  or
      discount and other-than-temporary market  value declines.  The amortized
      cost  of such investments differs from their market values; however, the
      Company  has the  ability  and  intent  to  hold  these  investments  to
      maturity, at which time the full face value is expected to be realized.

      Investments  held  for  sale  -- at  current  market  value,  unrealized
      appreciation  or  depreciation  is  charged  directly  to  shareholders'
      equity. 

      Mortgage  loans on  real  estate --  at  unpaid balances,  adjusted  for
      amortization of premium or discount, less allowance for possible losses.

      Real  estate  --  at cost,  less  allowances  for  depreciation and  any
      impairment which would result  in a carrying value below  net realizable
      value.  Foreclosed  real estate  is adjusted for  any impairment at  the
      foreclosure date.

      Policy  loans -- at  unpaid balances including  accumulated interest but
      not in excess of the cash surrender value.

      Short-term investments -- at cost, which approximates market value.

      Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are  recognized in net
      income on the specific identification basis.  

                                      40

G.    RECOGNITION OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES - Premiums  for traditional
      life insurance  products, which  include those products  with fixed  and
      guaranteed  premiums and  benefits,  consist principally  of whole  life
      insurance policies, limited-payment life insurance policies, and certain
      annuities with life contingencies are  recognized as revenues when  due.
      Accident  and health  insurance premiums are  recognized as  revenue pro
      rata over  the terms  of the  policies.   Benefits and  related expenses
      associated   with   the  premiums   earned   are   charged  to   expense
      proportionately over the lives  of the policies through a  provision for
      future policy benefit liabilities  and through deferral and amortization
      of deferred policy acquisition costs.  For universal life and investment
      products, generally there is no requirement for payment of premium other
      than to maintain  account values at a level sufficient  to pay mortality
      and expense charges.  Consequently, premiums for universal life policies
      and  investment products are not  reported as revenue,  but as deposits.
      Policy fee revenue for  universal life policies and investment  products
      consists of  charges for the  cost of insurance,  policy administration,
      and surrenders assessed  during the period.   Expenses include  interest
      credited  to policy  account  balances and  benefit  claims incurred  in
      excess of policy account balances.

H.    DEFERRED  POLICY ACQUISITION  COSTS  - Commissions  and  other costs  of
      acquiring life insurance products have been deferred.   Traditional life
      insurance and accident and health insurance acquisition costs are  being
      amortized over the premium-paying  period of the related policies  using
      assumptions  consistent  with those  used  in  computing policy  benefit
      reserves. 

      For  universal  life insurance  and  interest  sensitive life  insurance
      products, acquisition costs are  being amortized generally in proportion
      to  the present value of  expected gross profits  from surrender charges
      and  investment, mortality, and  expense margins.   This amortization is
      adjusted  retrospectively  when estimates  of  current  or future  gross
      profits to be realized from a group of products are revised.

I.    COST OF INSURANCE ACQUIRED - Policy acquisition costs established at the
      time a company is  acquired are amortized with  interest in relation  to
      expected future profits, including direct charge-offs for any excess  of
      the unamortized asset over  the projected future profits.   The interest
      rates utilized in  the amortization calculation are  9% on approximately
      23% of the balance and 15% on the remaining balance.  The interest rates
      vary due to different blocks of business.

                                       1995           1994           1993

J.    COST  IN EXCESS OF NET  ASSETS PURCHASED - Cost  in excess of net assets
      purchased are amortized over periods not exceeding forty years using the
      straight-line method.  Management reviews the valuation and amortization
      of goodwill  on an annual  basis.  As part  of this review,  the Company
      estimates  the value of and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
      expected to be generated  by the related subsidiaries to  determine that
      no impairment has occurred.

K.    FUTURE POLICY  BENEFITS AND EXPENSES  - The liabilities  for traditional
      life insurance and  accident and  health insurance  policy benefits  are
      computed   using  a  net  level  method.     These  liabilities  include
      assumptions as  to investment yields, mortality,  withdrawals, and other
      assumptions  based   on  the  life  insurance  subsidiaries'  experience
      adjusted to  reflect anticipated  trends and  to include  provisions for
      possible  unfavorable  deviations.   Reserve  interest  assumptions  are
      graded and  range from 6% to  2%.  Such liabilities,  for certain plans,
      are graded 

                                           43
<PAGE>

      to   equal   statutory  values  or  cash   values   prior  to  maturity.
      Benefit reserves for traditional life insurance policies include certain
      deferred profits  on limited-payment policies that  are being recognized
      in income  over the policy term.   Policy benefit claims  are charged to
      expense in the  period that the claims are incurred.   Current mortality
      rate assumptions  are  based  on 1975-80  select  and  ultimate  tables.
      Withdrawal rate assumptions are based upon Linton B or Linton C.

      Benefit  reserves for  universal life  insurance and  interest sensitive
      life  insurance  products are  computed  under  a retrospective  deposit
      method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender
      charges.  Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include
      benefit claims in excess  of related policy account balances.   Interest
      crediting rates for universal life and interest sensitive products range
      from 5.0% to  6.0% in 1995,  5.0% to 6.0%  in 1994 and  5.0% to 7.5%  in
      1993.

L.    POLICY  AND  CONTRACT  CLAIMS  -  Policy  and  contract  claims  include
      provisions  for reported  claims  in process  of  settlement, valued  in
      accordance with  the terms  of the  policies and  contracts, as well  as
      provisions for claims incurred and unreported  based on prior experience
      of the Company.

M.    PARTICIPATING INSURANCE - Participating  business represents 34% and 31%
      of the ordinary  life insurance in force at December  31, 1995 and 1994,
      respectively.   Premium  income  from participating  business represents
      55%, 53%, and  51% of total  premiums for the  years ended December  31,
      1995, 1994 and  1993, respectively.  The amount of  dividends to be paid
      is determined annually by the Board of Directors.  Earnings allocable to
      participating policyholders  are based on legal  requirements which vary
      by state.

N.    INCOME  TAXES - Income taxes  are reported under  Statement of Financial
      Accounting  Standards Number 109.  Deferred income taxes are recorded to
      reflect  the tax consequences  on future periods  of differences between
      the  tax bases of assets  and liabilities and  their financial reporting
      amounts at the end of each such period.

O.    BUSINESS SEGMENTS - The  Company operates principally in  the individual
      life insurance business.

P.    EARNINGS  PER  SHARE -  Earnings per  share  are based  on  the weighted
      average  number  of  common  shares outstanding  during  the  respective
      period.

Q.    CASH  EQUIVALENTS -  The Company  considers certificates of  deposit and
      other  short term  instruments with  an original  purchased maturity  of
      three months or less cash equivalents.

R.    RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
      conform with the 1995 presentation.

S.    REINSURANCE - In  the normal  course of business,  the Company seeks  to
      limit its  exposure to  loss  on any  single insured  and  to recover  a
      portion  of  benefits  paid by  ceding  reinsurance  to  other insurance
      enterprises  or  reinsurers   under  excess  coverage   and  coinsurance
      contracts.   The Company retains  a maximum of  $125,000 of coverage per
      individual life.  

      Amounts paid or deemed  to have been paid for reinsurance  contracts are
      recorded as reinsurance  receivables. Reinsurance premiums, commissions,
      expense reimbursements, and reserves on reinsured business are accounted
      for on a basis consistent with

                                          44
<PAGE>

      those used in accounting for the original policies issued and  the terms
      of   the  reinsurance  contracts.   Expense  reimbursements received  in
      connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction
      of   the   related  policy   acquisition  costs  or, to the  extent such 
      reimbursements exceed the related  acquisition costs, as revenue.

      Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to
      policyholders.  Failure of reinsurers  to honor their obligations  could
      result  in   losses  to   the  Company;  consequently,   allowances  are
      established for amounts deemed uncollectible.  The Company evaluates the
      financial  condition of  its reinsurers  and monitors  concentrations of
      credit  risk arising  from  similar geographic  regions, activities,  or
      economic  characteristics of the reinsurers to  minimize its exposure to
      significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.


2.  SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND RESTRICTION

At December 31, 1995,  substantially all of consolidated shareholders'  equity
represents net assets of UTI's subsidiaries.  The payment of cash dividends to
shareholders  by UTI  or  UTG  is  not  legally  restricted.    UG's  dividend
limitations are described below.

Ohio domiciled insurance companies require five days prior notification to the
insurance  commissioner for  the payment  of an  ordinary dividend.   Ordinary
dividends are defined as the greater of:  a) prior year  statutory earnings or
b) 10% of  statutory capital and  surplus.   For the year  ended December  31,
1995, UG had a statutory gain from operations  of $3,197,000.  At December 31,
1995,   UG's   statutory  capital   and   surplus   amounted  to   $7,274,000.
Extraordinary dividends  (amounts in excess of  ordinary dividend limitations)
require prior approval of the insurance commissioner and are not restricted to
a specific calculation.


3.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Until 1984,  the insurance companies  were taxed under  the provisions of  the
Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 as amended by the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.  These laws were superseded  by the Deficit
Reduction Act of 1984.  All  of these laws are based primarily upon  statutory
results with certain special deductions and other items available only to life
insurance companies.   If any of the life  companies pay shareholder dividends
in excess  of "shareholders' surplus"  they will be  required to pay  taxes on
income not taxed under the pre-1984 acts.

The  following  table summarizes  the companies  with  this situation  and the
maximum amount of income which has not been taxed in each.

                                   Shareholders'         Untaxed

                                     45
<PAGE>

The  payment of taxes on this income  is not anticipated; and, accordingly, no
deferred taxes have been established.

The life insurance company subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax
return. The holding companies of the group file separate returns.

Life insurance company taxation is based primarily upon statutory results with
certain  special deductions and other  items available only  to life insurance
companies.  Income tax expense consists of the following components:


                                         1995          1994           1993

The Company  has  established  a deferred  tax  asset of  $3,755,000  for  its
operating loss carryforwards and has established an allowance of $3,105,000.

UTI has  a net operating loss carryforward of $1,858,000 at December 31, 1995.
UTI has historically  reported net  losses for tax  purposes, however  general
expenses  of the  combined  companies were  reduced  dramatically from  levels
experienced  by the companies as  separate entities. A  significant portion of
the expense savings were realized by UTI.  UTI must average taxable  income of
$155,000  per  year to  fully realize  its  net operating  loss carryforwards.
UTI's operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire  until 2003.  Due to
continuing efforts to reduce  expenses, 1996 and  future years will result  in
additional expense savings, thus enabling UTI to achieve taxable income levels
which will fully utilize its net operating loss carryforwards.

The  provision  or  (credit)  for income  taxes  shown  in  the  statements of
operations does not bear the normal relationship to pre-tax income as a result
of certain permanent differences.  The sources and effects of such differences
are summarized in the following table:

      By insurance statute, the majority of the Company's investment portfolio
      is required to  be invested  in investment grade  securities to  provide
      ample  protection for policyholders.  The Company does not invest in so-
      called "junk bonds" or derivative investments.

      Below investment  grade debt securities generally  provide higher yields
      and involve greater risks than  investment grade debt securities because
      their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to
      adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers.  In addition,
      the trading market for these securities is usually more limited than for
      investment grade debt securities.   Debt securities classified as below-
      investment grade are those that receive a Standard & Poor's rating of BB
      or below.

$440,000 were realized on those sales, calls and maturities.

C.    INVESTMENTS  ON DEPOSIT - At  December 31, 1995,  investments carried at
      approximately $46,957,000  were on deposit with  various state insurance
      departments.

D.    INVESTMENTS  IN AND  ADVANCES TO  AFFILIATED COMPANIES  - The  Company's
      investment in United Income, Inc., a  30% owned affiliate, is carried at
      an amount equal  to the Company's share of the  equity of United Income.
      The  Company's equity in United Income, Inc. has increased $4,359,749 as
      a  result of  a public  offering of stock  by United  Income, Inc.   The
      shares sold  in the  public offering  decreased the  Company's ownership
      share from  49% to 30%.   The  Company's equity in  United Income,  Inc.
      includes  the original investment of $194,304 and the Company's share of
      United Income, Inc.'s earnings and losses since inception.  


5.    DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The  financial statements include various  estimated fair value information at
December  31, 1995 and 1994, as  required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  107, Disclosure about  Fair Value  of Financial  Instruments ("SFAS
107").     Such  information,  which  pertains  to   the  Company's  financial
instruments, is based on the requirements set forth in that Statement and does
not purport to represent the aggregate net fair value of the Company.

The following methods and assumptions were  used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument required to be valued by SFAS 107 for which
it is practicable to estimate that value:

(a)  Cash and Cash equivalents

The  carrying amount  in  the  financial  statements approximates  fair  value
because of the relatively short period  of time between the origination of the
instruments and their expected realization.

(b)  Fixed maturities and investments held for sale

Quoted market prices, if available, are used to  determine the fair value.  If
quoted  market prices are not  available, management estimates  the fair value
based  on the  quoted  market price  of a  financial  instrument with  similar
characteristics.

(c)  Mortgage loans on real estate

An estimate of fair  value is based on management's review of the portfolio in
relation  to market  prices  of similar  loans  with similar  credit  ratings,
interest rates, and  maturity dates.  Management conservatively estimates fair
value of the portfolio is equal to the carrying value.

                                       51
<PAGE>

(d)  Investment real estate and real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt

An estimate  of fair value is  based on management's review  of the individual
real estate  holdings.  Management  utilizes sales of  surrounding properties,
current  market   conditions  and   geographic  considerations.     Management
conservatively  estimates the  fair value  of the  portfolio is  equal  to the
carrying value.

(e)  Policy loans

It is not  practicable to estimate the fair value of policy loans as they have
no stated maturity and their rates are set at a fixed spread to related policy
liability rates.  Policy  loans are carried at the aggregate  unpaid principal
balances  in the  consolidated  balance sheets,  and  earn interest  at  rates
ranging from 4% to  8%.  Individual policy liabilities  in all cases equal  or
exceed outstanding policy loan balances.

(f)  Short term investments

For short term  instruments, the carrying  amount is a reasonable  estimate of
fair value.   All  short term  instruments  represent certificates  of deposit
with various banks and all are protected under FDIC.

(g)  Notes and accounts receivable and uncollected premiums

The Company  holds a $840,000 note  receivable for which  the determination of
fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current
rates at  which similar loans would  be made to borrowers  with similar credit
ratings  and for  the  same remaining  maturities.   Accounts  receivable  and
uncollected  premiums are  primarily  insurance  contract related  receivables
which are determined based upon the underlying insurance liabilities and added
reinsurance amounts,  and thus  are excluded  for the  purpose  of fair  value
disclosure by paragraph 8(c) of SFAS 107.

(h)  Notes payable

For  borrowings under the senior loan agreement,  which is subject to floating
rates of interest, carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  For
subordinated borrowings fair value was determined based on the borrowing rates
currently available to  the Company for  loans with similar terms  and average
maturities.

6.  STATUTORY EQUITY AND GAIN FROM OPERATIONS

The  Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Ohio, Illinois and West
Virginia and prepare their  statutory-based financial statements in accordance
with accounting practices prescribed or  permitted by the respective insurance
department.   These  principles differ  significantly from  generally accepted
accounting  principles.   "Prescribed" statutory accounting  practices include
state  laws, regulations,  and  general administrative  rules,  as well  as  a
variety  of  publications  of  the NAIC.    "Permitted"  statutory  accounting
practices encompass all  accounting practices  that are  not prescribed;  such
practices may  differ from state  to state, from  company to company  within a
state, and may change  in the future.  The NAIC currently is in the process of
codifying statutory accounting practices,  the result of which is  expected to
constitute  the only  source of  "prescribed" statutory  accounting practices.
Accordingly, that project,  which is expected  to be  completed in 1996,  will
likely change  prescribed statutory  accounting  practices and  may result  in
changes  to the accounting practices that insurance enterprises use to prepare
their  statutory financial  statements.   UG's  total statutory  shareholders'
equity   was  $7,274,000  and  $7,683,000  at  December  31,  1995  and  1994,
respectively.   The  combined  statutory gain  from  operations (exclusive  of
intercompany dividends)  was $4,076,000,  $3,071,000 and $1,628,000  for 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

7.  REINSURANCE

In December 1991, UG entered into a 50% coinsurance arrangement with  Republic
Vanguard  Life Insurance Company to  enable the Company  to maintain increased
production levels while containing  first year statutory costs.  The ceding of
new business  under this treaty  was terminated  December 31, 1993.   Republic
Vanguard  holds an "A" (Excellent) rating from  A. M. Best, an industry rating
company.   The coinsurance arrangement,  which was effective  January 1, 1991,
allowed UG to cede to Republic Vanguard a 50% quota share of all new universal
life policies issued after the effective date through date of termination.  UG
receives a commission allowance of 11%  of excess premium and renewal premium.
Monies pertaining to  the coinsurance  arrangement are settled  monthly.   The
agreement  contains  a provision  whereby risks  in  excess of  UG's retention
($125,000  maximum) are transferred to  the reinsurer.   Risks are transferred
under  an  automatic ceding  arrangement up  to  $1,000,000 and  a facultative
arrangement for amounts in excess of $1,000,000.

In December 1993, UG  entered into reinsurance agreements with  Business Men's
Assurance Company, ("BMA") and Life Reassurance Corporation, ("LIFE RE").  BMA
and  LIFE RE each hold  an "A+" (Superior) rating from  A.M. Best, an industry
rating company.  The  reinsurance arrangement was effective December  1, 1993,
and  covered all  new business of  the Company.   The agreements  are a yearly
renewable  term ("YRT")  treaty  where the  Company  cedes amounts  above  its
retention limit of $100,000 with a minimum cession of $25,000.

During  1993, USA  entered into  a coinsurance  agreement with  LIFE RE.   The
coinsurance arrangement allows USA to cede to LIFE RE a 50% quota share of the
traditional participating policies issued  by USA after the effective  date of
July 1,  1992.   USA entered  into the  arrangement to  enable the  Company to
maintain  increased production  levels while  containing first  year statutory
costs.  USA receives commission allowances of 150% of first  year premium, 27%
of second  year premium, 32% of third year premium  and 37% of fourth year and
beyond.  Monies pertaining to the coinsurance arrangement are settled monthly.
  
The  Company  does not  have any  short-duration  reinsurance contracts.   The
effect of the Company's long-duration reinsurance contracts on premiums earned
in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:

recoveries under reinsurance treaties.

8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

During  the third quarter of 1994, UG  became aware that certain new insurance
business  was  being solicited  by certain  agents  and issued  to individuals
considered  to be not  insurable by Company  standards.  These  policies had a
face  amount of $22,700,000 and represent 1/2 of 1% of the insurance in force.
Management's analysis indicates that the expected death claims on the business
in force to be adequately covered by the mortality assumptions inherent in the
calculation of statutory reserves.  Nevertheless, management has determined it
is in  the best interest of the Company to  repurchase as many of the policies
as possible.  As of December 31, 1995, there remained approximately $5,738,000
of the original  face amount which have  not been settled.   The Company  will
continue its  efforts to repurchase  as many of  the policies as  possible and
regularly apprise the  Ohio Department  of Insurance regarding  the status  of
this  situation.   Through December  31, 1995,  the Company  spent a  total of
$2,886,000 for the repurchase of these policies and for the defense of related
litigation.

The Company  is currently involved  in the following  litigation:  Freeman  v.
Universal  Guaranty Life  Insurance  Company (U.S.D.C.,N.D.Ga,  1994, 1-94-CV-
2593-RCF);  Armstrong v.  Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company  and James
Melville  (Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tenn., 1994, 94C3222);  Armstrong
v. Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company and James Melville (Circuit Court
of Davidson County, Tenn., 1994, 94C3720);  Ridings v. Universal Guaranty Life
Insurance Company and James Melville (Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tenn.,
1994, 94C3221).

Four general  agents of UG  filed independent suits  against UG in  the latter
part of September or early October 1994.  Kathy Armstrong (3-94-1085), another
general agent, filed her suit  on November 16, 1994.  All of  the suits allege
that the plaintiff was libeled by statements made in a letter sent by UG.  The
letter was sent to  persons who had been issued life insurance  policies by UG
as the  result of  policy  applications submitted  by the  five  agents.   Mr.
Melville is a defendant in some of  the suits because he signed the letter  as
president of UG.  

In addition to the defamation count, Mr. Freeman alleges that UG also breached
a contract by failing to pay his commissions for policies issued.  Mr. Freeman
claims unpaid commissions of $104,000.  In the libel claim, Mr. Freeman claims
compensatory damages of over $5,000,000, punitive damages of  over $3,000,000,
costs, and  litigation expenses.   The other plaintiffs  request the award  of
unspecified  compensatory damages and punitive (or special) damages as well as
costs and  attorney's  fees.   UG  has filed  Answers to  all  of these  suits
asserting various defenses and, where appropriate, counterclaims.  UG believes
that it has  no liability to any of the plaintiffs  and intends to defend each
of  the suits vigorously.   The Freeman  suit is scheduled for  trial April 8,
1996.

Jeffrey  Ploskonka, Keith  Bohn and  Paul Phinney  v. Universal  Guaranty Life
Insurance  Company (Circuit  Court of  the  Seventh Judicial  Circuit Sangamon
County, Illinois Case No.:  95-L-0213)

On March 9, 1995 a lawsuit was filed against Universal Guaranty Life Insurance
on behalf  of three insureds  and a  potential class of  other insureds.   The
Plaintiffs allege that  UG violated  the insurance contract  in attempting  to
cancel  life  insurance  contracts.     Additionally,  the  Plaintiffs  assert
violations  of  Illinois law  alleging  vexations  and unreasonable  insurance
practices, breach  of duty of good  faith and fair dealing,  and that Illinois
consumer  fraud  laws have  been violated.    The Plaintiffs  seek unspecified
compensatory damages, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, statutory damages in
an  amount  up to  $25,000.00, punitive  damages  of $1,000,000.00,  and other
equitable  relief.  UG filed an Answer to  this lawsuit in May 1995, asserting
various defenses and reserving the right to 

                                    55
<PAGE>

assert   counterclaims.   UG  has  also  filed   motions to  dismiss   certain 
allegations and claims made in the lawsuit.  UG believes it  has no  liability
to any of the  plaintiffs, or other potential class  members,  and  intends to
defend  the lawsuit   vigorously.   In  June 1995, the   court   conditionally 
certified a class of non-settling insureds.

The Company and its subsidiaries are named  as defendants in a number of legal
actions  arising primarily from claims  made under insurance  policies.  Those
actions  have  been  considered  in establishing  the  Company's  liabilities.
Management and its  legal counsel are  of the opinion  that the settlement  of
those actions  will  not  have a  material  adverse effect  on  the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.

The  number of insurance companies  that are under  regulatory supervision has
increased,  and  that  increase  is  expected  to  result  in an  increase  in
assessments  by  state guarantee  funds to  cover  losses to  policyholders of
insolvent  or rehabilitated  companies.   Those mandatory  assessments may  be
partially  recovered through  a  reduction in  future  premium taxes  in  some
states.   For all assessment  notifications received, the  Company has accrued
for those assessments.


9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

United Trust, Inc.  has a service  agreement with  its affiliate, UII  (equity
investee),  to perform  services and  provide personnel  and facilities.   The
services  included  in  the  agreement  are  claim  processing,  underwriting,
processing and  servicing of  policies, accounting services,  agency services,
data processing and all other expenses necessary to carry on the business of a
life insurance company.

UII's service  agreement states that USA  is to pay UII monthly  fees equal to
22% of the  amount of collected first year premiums, 20% in second year and 6%
of the renewal premiums in years three and after.  UII's subcontract agreement
with UTI states that UII is to pay UTI monthly fees equal to 60%  of collected
service fees from USA as stated above.

USA  paid $2,015,000, $1,357,000 and $1,202,000 under their agreement with UII
for 1995,  1994 and  1993, respectively.   UII paid  $1,209,000, $814,000  and
$721,000 under their agreement with UTI for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The  agreements of  the  insurance  companies  have  been  approved  by  their
respective domiciliary  insurance departments  and it is  Management's opinion
that where applicable, costs  have been allocated fairly and  such allocations
are based upon  generally accepted accounting principles.   The costs  paid by
UTI for these services include costs related to the production of new business
which  are deferred as policy acquisition costs  and charged off to the income
statement through "Amortization of  deferred policy acquisition costs".   Also
included  are costs associated with the maintenance of existing policies which
are charged as current period costs and included in "general expenses".

The transactions described below, which transpired during 1994, were necessary
to position  Universal Guaranty Investment Company  ("UGIC"), Investors Trust,
Inc. ("ITI")  and Commonwealth Industries Corporation  ("CIC") for liquidation
and dissolution.

Pursuant to an Agreement of Merger  dated July 7, 1994 between Investors Trust
Assurance Company, an Illinois  life insurance company ("ITAC"), and  ALIC, on
July 31,  1994, ITAC  merged with  and into  ALIC and  ALIC was the  surviving
company.   On the effective  date of  the merger,  ALIC succeeded  to all  the
rights and property of ITAC and assumed all of the liabilities and obligations
and became subject to  all of the debts of ITAC in the  same manner as if ALIC
had itself incurred them.  The merger was approved by the Illinois Director of
Insurance.
                                     56
<PAGE>

Prior  to the  merger of  ITAC with  and into  ALIC, ITAC  was a  wholly owned
subsidiary of ITI.  ITAC owned 1,549,549 (approximately 66%) of the issued and
outstanding common  stock of  UGIC.   Prior  to July  31,  1994, ITI  was  the
indirect beneficial owner of the shares of UGIC common stock directly owned by
ITAC.  On  July 31, immediately  prior to the effectiveness  of the merger  of
ITAC with and into ALIC, ITI purchased 758,946 shares of the UGIC common stock
owned by ITAC.  The  total purchase price was  $2,276,793.  On July 31,  1994,
ITAC also transferred to ITI at no cost 790,603 shares of the common  stock of
the Company.   On such  date, ITI  became the direct  beneficial owner  of all
1,549,549  shares of  the common  stock of  UGIC.   In order  to purchase  the
758,946  shares of UGIC common stock, ITI received  a loan from UTI and UII in
the  aggregate principal amount of $2,164,293.  ITI transferred 721,431 shares
of the  common stock of  UGIC that it  purchased from ITAC  to UTI and  UII in
payment  of the loan.   These shares were  then contributed by  UTI and UII to
their subsidiary, UTG.

The  balance sheet of Commonwealth Industries Corporation for the period ended
July  31, 1994,  included  liabilities in  the  aggregate amount  of  $402,861
comprised  of a future liability  under a consulting  agreement, escheat funds
and an  account payable.  On July 31,  1994, these liabilities were assumed by
UTG in exchange for 1,558,318 shares of the common stock of ITI.

The balance  sheet  of UGIC  for  the period  ended  July 31,  1994,  included
liabilities  in the  aggregate amount of  $461,102.   On July  31, 1994, these
liabilities were assumed  by UTG in exchange for 106,392  shares of the common
stock of  FCC and  315 shares  of the  common stock  of CIC.   The FCC  shares
transferred  reduced  UGIC's  percentage  ownership  of  FCC  from  50.396% to
49.959%.  

Prior to these transactions, UGIC, ITI and CIC each had  liabilities in excess
of  assets excluding the  stock holdings of their  respective subsidiary.  The
1994 transactions enabled the companies to extinguish their liabilities.

On  August  15,  1995,  the  shareholders  of CIC,  ITI,  and  UGIC  voted  to
voluntarily liquidate each  of the companies and distribute the  assets to the
shareholders  (consisting   solely  of   common  stock  of   their  respective
subsidiary).   As  a  result of  the  liquidations, the  shareholders of  each
company  became shareholders of FCC, following the liquidations, UTG holds 72%
of the common stock of FCC.


10.   CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS

A.    PUBLIC OFFERING OF AFFILIATE STOCK

      During 1991, an affiliated company, United Fidelity, Inc., (UFI) began a
      stock  offering  in the  State of  Illinois.   UFI was  offering 400,000
      units, each  unit consisting of one  share of no par  value common stock
      and  one share of Class A  Preferred Stock, $15 par  value per share, 9%
      non-cumulative  convertible.  The units were being offered to the public
      at $30 per unit.  Due to large losses reported by UFI, the sale of stock
      units to the public was stopped on June 2, 1994.  The Board of Directors
      of UFI voted to voluntarily terminate the offering on August 18, 1994.

      Since the  inception of the  offering, the Company's  ownership interest
      dropped from  46% to 36%.   The Company accounted for  the investment in
      UFI using the equity method.  At December 31, 1994,  the Company charged
      off its remaining investment in UFI of $212,247.  The Company determined
      any  material recoverability  of its  investment to  be unlikely  due to
      continuing losses and limited capital of UFI.  On May 26, 1995, pursuant
      to  a plan of restructure  of UFI's subsidiary,  First Fidelity Mortgage
      Company, UTI surrendered its common stock holdings of UFI for no value.

B.    STOCK OPTION PLAN

      In  1985, the  Company initiated  a nonqualified  stock option  plan for
      employees,  agents and directors of  the Company under  which options to

C.    DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

      UTI and FCC have  instituted a deferred compensation plan  effective May
      1, 1993  pursuant to which an officer or agent of FCC, UTI or affiliates
      of UTI, may defer a  portion of their income over the next  two and one-
      half years  in return for a deferred compensation payment payable at the
      end of seven years in the amount equal to the total income deferred plus
      interest at a rate of approximately 8.5% per annum and a stock option to
      purchase shares  of common  stock  of UTI.   An  officer  or agent  will
      receive an immediately  exercisable option to purchase  23,000 shares of
      UTI common stock at $1.75  per share for each $25,000 ($10,000  per year
      for  two and  one-half years)  of  total income  deferred.   The  option
      expires  on December  31, 2000.    At December  31, 1995  and 1994,  the
      Company  held  a liability  of  $1,167,000  and $851,000,  respectively,
      relating to this plan.  


11.   NOTES PAYABLE

At  December  31,  1995,  the  Company  has  $21,447,000  in  long  term  debt
outstanding.  The debt is comprised of the following components:

                                                   1995             1994    

      Senior debt                             $  11,400,000    $  12,000,000
      Subordinated 10 yr. notes                   6,209,000        6,494,000
      Subordinated 20 yr. notes                   3,815,000        3,530,000
      Encumbrance on real estate                     23,000           29,000
                                              $  21,447,000    $  22,053,000


                                      58
<PAGE>

The senior  debt is comprised of participations of the First Bank of Missouri,
(First  Bank of Missouri was the successor bank to a merger with First Bank of
Gladstone, Citizen's  Bank and  Trust Company,  and Bank  of  St. Joseph,  all
Missouri Banks), Massachusetts General Life Insurance Company and Philadelphia
Life  Insurance Company  (the "Senior  Lenders").   The loan  is subject  to a
certain  Credit Agreement  between the  parties stipulating  the terms  of the
loan.  The  FCC Senior Debt bears  interest equal to 1% over  the variable per
annum  rate of interest most recently announced  by the First Bank of Missouri
as its "Base Rate".   As of  March 1, 1996,  the "Base Rate"  was 8.25%.   The
principal balance  of the FCC Senior  Debt is payable in  installments on June
1st of each year commencing June 1, 1994 and  ending June 1, 1998.  On January
31, 1996, FCC prepaid $1,500,000 of the $3,900,000 scheduled principal payment
due June  1, 1996.   At December  31, 1995,  the principal amount  of the  FCC
Senior Debt to outside parties was $10,400,000.

The Credit Agreement  includes an  earnings covenant which  provides that  FCC
will  not  permit  the  sum  of  (i)  the  combined  pre-tax  earnings of  the
subsidiaries of FCC, excluding  the results of any surplus  relief reinsurance
and  any  intercompany  dividends,  determined in  accordance  with  statutory
accounting  practices,  and (ii)  the pre-tax  earnings  of FCC  plus interest
expense and non-cash charges, determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  practices, to  be less than  the amounts  specified in  the Credit
Agreement.    The Credit  Agreement requires  that  the earnings  as specified
above, be not less  than $7,450,000 for 1995.   The Company has not  satisfied
the earnings requirement for the past several years.  The lenders have granted
waivers or modifications to the earnings requirement in each of the past years
in which the Company did not meet the requirement.  Management expects similar
treatment of the 1995 requirement.

The subordinated debt was  incurred June 16, 1992 as a part of an acquisition.
The 10 year notes bear interest at the rate of 7 1/2% per annum, payable semi-
annually  beginning  December 16,  1992.   These  notes provide  for principal
payments equal  to 1/20th  of  the principal  balance due  with each  interest
installment beginning June 16, 1997,  with a final payment due June  16, 2002.
During 1995, the Company refinanced $300,695 of 10 year notes to 20 year notes
bearing interest at the rate of 8.75%.  The repayment terms of these notes are
similar to the original 20 year notes.  The 20 year notes bear interest at the
rate  of 8 1/2% per annum,  payable semi-annually beginning December 16, 1992,
with a  lump sum  principal payment  due June 16,  2012.   Scheduled principal
reductions on the Company's debt for the next five years is as follows:

                         Year            Amount  

                         1996         $ 3,900,000
                         1997           4,437,000
                         1998           3,137,000  
                         1999             537,000
                         2000             537,000


12.  OTHER CASH FLOW DISCLOSURE

The Company recognized an increase in its paid-in capital of  $0, $277,559 and
$723,618 for  the  years 1995,  1994 and  1993 respectively,  from its  equity
investment  in UFI from  the offering price  per share of  UFI exceeding UTI's
carrying amount per share.

On a  cash basis, the  Company paid  $1,934,326, $1,937,123 and  $1,923,286 in
interest expense for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company
paid $25,821, $190 and $328,287 in federal income tax for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

13.  NON-RECURRING WRITE DOWN OF VALUE OF AGENCY FORCE ACQUIRED

The Company recognized a non-recurring  write down of $8,297,000 on its  value
of agency force acquired for the year ended December 31, 1995.  The write down
released   $2,904,000  of  the  deferred  tax  liability  and  $3,327,000  was
attributed  to minority  interest in  loss of  consolidated subsidiaries.   In
addition, equity loss  of investees was negatively impacted by  $542,000.  The
effect  of  this  write  down resulted  in  an  increase in  the  net  loss of
$2,608,000.   This write down is  directly related to the  Company's change in
distribution systems.  Due to the broker agency force not meeting management's
expectations and lack of  production, the Company has  changed its focus  from
primarily broker agency  distribution system to a captive agent  system.  With
the change in focus, most of  the broker agents were terminated and therefore,
management re-evaluated  the value of the agency  force carried on the balance
sheet.  For purposes of the write-down, the  broker agency force has no future
expected cash  flows and therefore  warranted a write-off  of the value.   The
write down  is reported as a  separate line item "non-recurring  write down of
value of agency force acquired" and the release of the  deferred tax liability
is  reported in  the  credit for  income  taxes payable  in  the Statement  of
Operations.    In  addition,  the  impact  to  minority  interest  in  loss of
consolidated subsidiaries  and equity loss of investees is in the Statement of
Operations.


14.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company maintains cash  balances in financial institutions which  at times
may exceed  federally insured  limits.   The Company  has not  experienced any
losses in  such accounts and  believes it  is not exposed  to any  significant
credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.


15.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  has  issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 114 entitled "Accounting  by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118,
an amendment of Statement No. 114.   The Statement amends FASB Statement No. 5
"Accounting  for  Contingencies"  and FASB  Statement  No.  15 "Accounting  by
Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring".  This Statement, which
became effective  for financial  statements for fiscal  years beginning  after
December  15, 1994,  applies to  all troubled  debt restructuring  involving a
modification of terms.

A loan  is impaired  when,  based on  current information  and  events, it  is
probable that a  creditor will be unable to collect  all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  As used in this Statement and
in Statement 5, as amended, all amounts due according to the contractual terms
means  that  both  the  contractual  interest  payments  and  the  contractual
principal  payments  of a  loan will  be collected  as  scheduled in  the loan
agreement.  This  Statement does not specify  how a creditor should  determine
that  it  is probable  that  it will  be  unable to  collect  all  amounts due
according  to the contractual terms  of a loan.   A creditor  should apply its
normal loan review procedures in making that judgment.  An insignificant delay
or  insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not require application
of this Statement.  A loan is not impaired during a period of delay in payment
if the creditor expects to collect all amounts  due including interest accrued
at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.  Thus, a demand loan
or other loan with no stated maturity  is not impaired if the creditor expects
to  collect  all amounts  due including  interest  accrued at  the contractual
interest rate during the period the loan is outstanding.

This statement was adopted  for the 1995  Financial Statements.  The  adoption
did not have any impact on the Company's financial statement.

The Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB) has  issued  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 entitled "Accounting for the Impairment
of  Long-Lived Assets  and for  Long-Lived Assets  to be  Disposed of".   This
Statement,  becomes  effective  for  financial  statements  for  fiscal  years
beginning after December 31, 1995, with early adoption encouraged.

An entity  shall review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events  or changes in circumstances indicate  that the
carrying amount  of an  asset may not  be recoverable.   If certain  events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable,  the entity shall estimate  the future cash flows  expected to
result  from the use of  the asset and its eventual  disposition.  Future cash
flows are the  future cash inflows expected  to be generated by  an asset less
the future cash outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows.  If
the sum of the expected future  cash flows (undiscounted and without  interest
charges)  is less  than the  carrying amount  of the  asset, the  entity shall
recognize an impairment loss in accordance with this Statement.  Otherwise, an
impairment loss shall  not be  recognized; however, a  review of  depreciation
policies may be appropriate.

This statement was adopted  for the 1995 financial  statements.  The  adoption
did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements.
