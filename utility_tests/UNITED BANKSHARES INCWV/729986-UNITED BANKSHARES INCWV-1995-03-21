                    DESCRIPTION OF UNITED BANKSHARES, INC.


Organizational History and Subsidiaries
- ---------------------------------------

     United Bankshares, Inc. ("United") is a West Virginia corporation
registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended. United was incorporated on March 26, 1982 and organized on
September 9, 1982. United began conducting business on May 1, 1984 with the
acquisition of three wholly-owned subsidiaries. On October 1, 1985, these three
subsidiaries were merged and on November 1, 1985, were renamed United National
Bank ("UNB").

     Since that time UNB has acquired through merger or consolidation the
following banks: Heritage Bancorp, Inc. (a holding company); First National Bank
of Ripley; Kanawha Banking and Trust Company; Ohio Valley National Bank; Elk
National Bank; Montgomery National Bank, the sole subsidiary of Liberty
Bancshares Inc., a bank holding company; First Bank of Ceredo, the bank
subsidiary of Financial Future Corporation, a bank holding company; CB&T
Westover Bank and the Star City Branch of Community Bank & Trust, N. A.

     On September 1, 1993, UBC Holding Company, ("UBC"), a United subsidiary,
was formed to effect the Financial Future Corporation transaction. UBC is a
second tier holding company with UNB currently being its only subsidiary.

     United National Bank-North ("UNB-N"), now merged into UNB, was formed on
August 31, 1987, through the merger of Half Dollar Trust and Savings Bank, a
previously acquired subsidiary of United, and First National Bank of
Moundsville. Since that time the First National Bank of Weirton had also been
merged into UNB-N.

     United National Bank-Central ("UNB-C"), now merged into UNB, was formed on
July 1, 1989, with the merger of Kanawha Union Bank, Webster County Bank and
Weston National Bank, all previously acquired subsidiaries of United.

     On January 1, 1993, UNB-N and UNB-C were merged into and became a part of
UNB. Offices of UNB-N and UNB-C became branch offices of UNB.

     On August 9, 1990, United acquired BankFirst Corporation ("BankFirst"), a
one bank holding company based in McLean, Virginia. BankFirst was merged with
UBF Holding Company, Inc. ("UBF"), a United subsidiary formed to effect this
acquisition. UBF acquired Bank First, N.A. ("Bank First"), the subsidiary of
BankFirst.

     United National Bank-South ("UNB-S"), was formed on November 1, 1992, as a
part of United's acquisition of Summit Holding Corporation and their lead bank,
Raleigh County National Bank.

                                       5

     In late 1988, United chartered and capitalized United Venture Fund, Inc., a
West Virginia corporation which has qualified as a Capital Company under the
West Virginia Capital Company Act.  This subsidiary makes loans and limited
equity investments, consistent with the Bank Holding Company Act, that will
result in or contribute to new jobs and/or industry in West Virginia.

     The headquarters of United are located in United Center at 500 Virginia

operates six branches throughout West Virginia's northern panhandle. The main
facility of UNB's Wheeling area is leased from Ogden Newspapers, Inc. See Part
                                                                      --------

Employees
- ---------

     As of December 31, 1994 United and its subsidiaries had approximately 834
full-time equivalent employees and officers.


Business of United
- ------------------

     As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended, United's present business is the operation of its bank
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 1994, United's consolidated assets approximated
$1,787,641,000 and total shareholders' equity approximated $179,746,000.

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
     United is permitted to acquire other banks and bank holding companies, as
well as thrift institutions. United is also permitted to engage in certain non-
banking activities which are closely related to banking under the provisions of
the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y.
Management continues to consider such opportunities as they arise and in this
regard, management from time to time makes inquiries, proposals, offers or
expressions of interest as to potential opportunities; although no agreements or
understandings to acquire other banks or bank holding companies or nonbanking
subsidiaries or to engage in other nonbanking activities, other than those
identified herein, presently exist. With regard to pending acquisitions, United
has executed a definitive merger agreement with First Commercial Bank,
Arlington, Virginia, dated as of March 7, 1995. For further discussion, see Note
Q, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Business of Subsidiary Banks
- ----------------------------

     All of United's subsidiary banks are full-service commercial banks and, as
such, engage in most types of business permitted by law and regulation. Included
among the banking services offered are the acceptance of deposits in checking,
savings, time and money market accounts; the making and servicing of personal,
commercial, floor plan and student loans; and the making of construction and
real estate loans. Also offered are individual retirement accounts, safe deposit
boxes, wire transfers and other standard banking products and services. As a
part of their lending function, UNB, UNB-S and Bank First offer credit card
services including accounts issued under the name of certain correspondent
banks.

     UNB and UNB-S also maintain trust departments which act as trustees under
wills, trust and pension and profit sharing plans, as executors and
administrators of estates, and as guardians for estates of minors and
incompetents, and in addition perform a variety of investment and security
services. UNB trust services are available to customers of affiliate banks. UNB
provides services to its correspondent banks such as check clearing, safekeeping
and the buying and selling of federal funds.

     UNB and UNB-S are members of a regional network of automated teller
machines known as the MAC ATM network while Bank First participates in the MOST
network. Through MAC and MOST, all of United's subsidiary banks are participants
in a network known as Cirrus which provides banking on a nationwide basis.

Competition
- -----------

     United faces a high degree of competition in nearly all of the markets it
serves. These markets may generally be defined as Wood, Kanawha, Putnam,
Monongalia, Jackson, Cabell, Wayne, Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, Gilmer,
Braxton, Lewis, Webster, Fayette and Raleigh Counties in West Virginia;
Lawrence, Belmont, Jefferson and Washington Counties in Ohio; and Fairfax County
in Virginia. United competes in

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
Ohio markets because of the close proximity to the Ohio border of certain
subsidiary offices.  Included in United's markets are the Parkersburg
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the Charleston MSA, the Huntington MSA, the
Wheeling MSA and the Weirton MSA.  These represent the five largest West
Virginia MSA's.

     West Virginia banks are allowed unlimited branch banking throughout the
state. In addition, interstate acquisitions of and by West Virginia banks and
bank holding companies are permissible on a reciprocal basis. West Virginia also
allows reciprocal interstate acquisitions by thrift institutions. These
conditions serve to intensify competition within United's market.

     As of December 31, 1994, there were 16 multi-bank holding companies and 33
one-bank holding companies in the State of West Virginia registered with the
Federal Reserve System. United presently ranks fourth among these bank holding
companies and second among holding companies headquartered in West Virginia
based on both asset and deposit size. These holding companies are headquartered
in various West Virginia cities and control banks throughout the state,
including banks which compete for business as well as for the acquisition of
additional banks.

Regulation and Supervision
- --------------------------

     United, as a bank holding company, is subject to the restrictions of the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered pursuant to its
provisions. As such, United is subject to the reporting requirements of and
examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Board of
Governors").

     The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding
company of direct or indirect ownership of more than five percent of the voting
shares of any bank within the United States without prior approval of the Board
of Governors. With certain exceptions, a bank holding company also is prohibited
from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent
of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank, and from engaging
directly or indirectly in business unrelated to the business of banking, or
managing or controlling banks.

     The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in its Regulation Y,
permits bank holding companies to engage in non-banking activities closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Approval of the Board of
Governors is necessary to engage in these activities or to make acquisitions of
corporations engaging in these activities. In addition, on a case by case basis,
the Board of Governors may approve other non-banking activities.

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
     As a bank holding company doing business in West Virginia, United is also
subject to regulation and examination by the West Virginia Board of Banking and
Financial Institutions (the "West Virginia Banking Board") and must submit
annual reports to the department. Further, any acquisition application which
United must submit to the Board of Governors must also be submitted to the West
Virginia Banking Board for approval.

     United is also registered under and is subject to the requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

     UNB, UNB-S and Bank First, as national banking associations, are subject to
supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. They are also members of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, are
subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations
issued thereunder.

     The deposits of United's three wholly-owned national banking subsidiaries
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to the extent
provided by law. Accordingly, these banks are also subject to regulation by the
FDIC.

Dividends
- ---------

     The shareholders of United are entitled to receive dividends when and as
declared by its Board of Directors. Dividends are paid quarterly. Aggregate
dividends were $1.06 per share in 1994, $.95 per share in 1993 and $.85 per
share in 1992. Dividends are paid out of funds legally available; therefore, the
payment of dividends is subject to the restrictions set forth in the West
Virginia Corporation Act.

     Payment of Dividends by United is dependent upon payment of dividends to it
by its subsidiary banks. The ability of national banks to pay dividends is
subject to certain limitations imposed by the national banking laws. The Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") may prohibit dividends if it deems
the payment to be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The OCC has issued
guidelines for dividend payments by national banks, emphasizing that proper
dividend size depends on the bank's earnings and capital. See Note C - Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock
- -----

     As of December 31, 1994, 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $2.50
per share, were authorized for United, of which 11,954,453 were issued and
outstanding including 137,520 shares held as treasury shares. These shares are
held by approximately 5,087 shareholders of record as of December 31, 1994. The
unissued portion of United's authorized common stock (subject to registration
approval by the SEC) and the treasury shares are available for issuance as the
Board of Directors determines advisable. United offers its shareholders the
opportunity to invest dividends in shares of United stock through its dividend
reinvestment plan. United has also established stock option plans and a stock
bonus plan as incentive for certain eligible officers. See PART III - Succession
                                                       ------------
Management Stock Bonus Plan and Incentive Stock Option Plans. United offers an
employee stock purchase plan for all employees. See PART III - Employee Benefit
                                                    --------
Plans. While there are no present plans, understandings, arrangements or
agreements, except for the above incentive plans, to issue any additional shares
of United stock, additional shares could be issued for the purpose of raising
capital, in connection with acquisitions of other businesses, or for other
appropriate purposes.

     The Board of Directors believes that the availability of authorized but
unissued common stock of United is of considerable value if opportunities should
arise for the acquisition of another business through the issuance of United's
stock. Shareholders do not have preemptive rights, which allows United to issue
additional authorized shares without first offering them to current
shareholders.

     United has only one class of stock and all voting rights are vested in the
holders of United's stock. On all matters subject to a vote of shareholders, the
shareholders of United will be entitled to one vote for each share of common
stock owned. Shareholders of United have cumulative voting rights with regard to
election of directors. At the present time, no senior securities of United are
outstanding, nor does the Board of Directors presently contemplate issuing
senior securities.

     There are no preemptive or conversion rights or, redemption or sinking fund
provisions with respect to United's Stock. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of United's stock are fully paid and non-assessable.

     As a bank holding company, United is permitted by Regulation Y of the
Federal Reserve Board, under certain circumstances, to purchase up to 10% of its
common stock as treasury stock without obtaining prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board. In March 1994, United approved a plan to repurchase up to $10
million of its common stock on the open market. The timing, price, and quantity
of any such purchases may be made at the discretion of the Company and the
program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. Through January 31, 1995,
378,900 shares have been repurchased at a cost of $7,030,086 and 238,880 shares
have been reissued for proceeds of $3,566,323 under this program. Total treasury
shares at January 31, 1995 amount to 140,020 at a cost of $3,403,979.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in
financial condition and the results of operations of United and its subsidiaries
for the periods indicated below. This discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes
thereto, which are included elsewhere in this document. All references to United
in this discussion and analysis are considered to refer to United and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.


1994 COMPARED TO 1993

EARNINGS SUMMARY

For the year ended December 31, 1994, net income increased 14.7% to a record
$24,902,000. Net income per share of $2.08 for the year was up 14.3% from $1.82
in 1993. United's return on average assets of 1.42% makes United one of the
nation's most profitable regional banking companies. Dividends per share
increased 11.6% from $.95 in 1993 to a record level of $1.06 per share in 1994.
This was the twenty-first consecutive year of dividend increases to
shareholders. Core earnings, or earnings before taxes, security transactions,
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and the provision for
possible loan losses, were strong and increased 19.7% for 1994 compared to 1993.
These strong core earnings are indicative of the 8.1% increase in net interest
income driven by an increase in average net earning assets with significant
growth of 8.6% in average net loans.

Factors contributing to the 1994 earnings increase include an improved net
interest margin, partially resulting from a $39,338,000 increase in average
earning assets from 1993, a lower loan loss provision due to improved credit
quality and increased earnings from 1993 acquisitions. The favorable impact of
the above items was partly offset by increased occupancy expenses, decreased fee
income from customer accounts for which a fee is charged and losses from the
sale of securities. United is in the process of realigning its interest rate
sensitivity for 1995 to a more interest-rate-neutral position. This investment
strategy may reduce current earnings, but will enhance United's future earnings
momentum.

Key performance measures improved significantly from 1993 and remained very
strong in comparison to industry standards. United's return on average assets of
1.42% makes United one of the nation's most profitable regional banking
companies. United has a strong capital position and is well positioned to take
advantage of future growth opportunities.

The following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations and
changes in financial condition by major category.

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income represents the primary component of United's earnings. It is
the difference between interest and fee income related to earning assets and
interest expense incurred to fund these earning assets. Net interest income is
impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in market interest rates. Such
changes, and their impact on net interest income in 1994, are explained below.

For the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, net interest income approximated
$77,270,000 and $71,496,000, respectively. On a tax-equivalent basis the net
interest margin was strong at 4.97% in 1994 and 4.75% in 1993. Higher average
loan volumes of $98 million contributed to the increase in net interest income.
United also experienced modest decreases in its overall cost of funds. At 4.97%,
United's net interest margin remains well above peer group averages.

Total interest income of $121,157,000 increased 4.0% in 1994 over 1993 as a
result of higher volumes of interest-earning assets. Comparing year-end 1994 to
year-end 1993, a moderate decrease in commercial loans of 4.6% and a slight
increase in consumer loans of 1.8%, which resulted from lower commercial and
consumer demand, were offset by significant mortgage loan growth of 16.4%.

Total interest expense decreased 2.5% in 1994. This decrease can be attributed
primarily to lower rates paid on interest-bearing funds. United's average
interest-bearing deposits increased only slightly or 0.5% in 1994, while its
average long-term borrowings increased 25.1% as United made greater use of these
funds in order to meet the demand for mortgage loan products with matching
maturities. The average cost of funds reflected the general downward trend in
market interest rates in 1994, falling from 3.44% in 1993 to 3.30% in 1994.

PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES

United evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly
basis and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk.

Nonperforming loans were $6,036,000 at December 31, 1994 and $13,517,000 at
December 31, 1993, a decrease of 55.4%. The level of nonperforming assets
declined as a result of the recovering of the regional economy and management's
continual monitoring of problem loans. The components of nonperforming loans
include nonaccrual loans, loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more
as to interest or principal, but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis and
troubled debt restructurings. Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $173,000
or 7.0% during 1994; while troubled debt restructurings decreased $2,453,000 or
100.0% and nonaccrual loans decreased $4,855,000 or 56.5% since year-end 1993.
Nonperforming loans continue to decline and represented less than 0.34% of total
assets at the end of 1994, which is less one-half of the national peer levels.

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
At year-end 1994 and 1993 the allowance for possible loan losses was 1.54% and
1.61% of total loans, net of unearned income, respectively. As of December 31,
1994, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was
331.5% as compared to 140.7% as of December 31, 1993.

Management believes that the allowance for loan losses of $20,008,000 as of
December 31, 1994, is adequate to provide for potential losses on existing loans
based on information currently available.

For the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 the provision for loan losses was
$1,818,000 and $4,332,000, respectively. The decrease can be attributed to the
general improvement in all areas of asset quality and the increased coverage
ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans. The provision for
loan losses charged to operations is based on management's evaluation of
individual credits, the past loan loss experience, and other factors which, in
management's judgment, deserve recognition in estimating possible loan losses.
Such other factors considered by management include growth and composition of
the loan portfolio, known deterioration in certain classes of loans or
collateral, trends in delinquencies, and current economic conditions.

Total net charge-offs were $825,000 in 1994 and $1,773,000 in 1993, which
represents .07% and .16% of average loans for the respective years. United's
ratio of net charge-offs to average loans compares very favorably with its
peers.

Management is not aware of any potential problem loans, trends or uncertainties
which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating
results, liquidity, or capital resources which have not been disclosed.
Additionally, management has disclosed all known material credits which cause
management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply
with the loan repayments. Management is not aware of any current recommendations
by regulatory authorities which, if implemented, would have a material effect on
liquidity, capital resources or operations.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosures." The requirements
of SFAS No.'s 114 and 118 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994. SFAS No. 114 requires that impaired loans be measured based
on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable
market price or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. SFAS No. 118 clarified creditor reporting of income on an impaired
loan and disclosure requirements. The adoption of SFAS No. 114, which will occur
in the first quarter of 1995, is not expected to have a material effect on
United's allowance for loan losses.

OTHER INCOME

Noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for
improving United's profitability. Recognizing this importance, management
continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced. Other
income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee
income related to earning assets. In 1994, other income, excluding securities
transactions, was flat when compared to 1993. The overall decrease in
noninterest income of $1,451,000 or 11.4% is primarily attributed to the net
losses on securities transactions.

Trust income increased $229,000 or 8.7% in 1994. This was due to repricing of
services and an increased volume of trust business.

Service charges, commissions and fees decreased by $194,000 or 2.2% in 1994.
This income consists of charges and fees related to various banking services
provided by United. The decrease was primarily due to a combination of decreased
activity in customer accounts and a decline in net account analysis fees.

Securities transactions resulted in a net loss of $872,000 in 1994 and a net
gain of $479,000 in 1993. As evidenced by the Statement of Cash Flows, the
volume of securities sold increased significantly in 1994. The primary reason
for this increased sales activity was to restructure a portion of the investment
portfolio to reflect current market rates in response to the rising interest
rate environment in order to enhance United's future earnings momentum.

On January 1, 1994, United adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
(SFAS No. 115) which was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1993. The $872,000 of net securities losses for 1994 relates primarily to debt
securities losses of approximately $1,024,000 which were reclassified to
available for sale at January 1, 1994. For further details, see Note D to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER EXPENSE

Just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be
enhanced, it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations and thus reduce
operating costs. United's cost control efforts have been very successful with an
efficiency ratio of 53.2%, which is well below that reported by peer group
averages.

Other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense, the
provision for possible loan losses, and income taxes. In total, other expenses
were flat in 1994, and management was successful in controlling costs. The
income statement reflects a 2.0% decrease in 1994 as compared to 1993.

Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased $176,000 or 1.0% in 1994. As of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, United employed 834 and 889 full-time equivalent
employees, respectively.

Net occupancy expense in 1994 exceeded 1993 levels by $390,000 or 8.7% primarily
due to decreased rental income from vacancies and an increase in real property
taxes.

Other expense decreased $1,228,000 or 5.4% in 1994 compared to 1993.  The
decrease in other expenses for the year relates primarily to nonrecurring
expenses during 1993 which included certain merger expenses for the two
acquisitions consummated by United during 1993, a lower provision for other real
estate owned and the realization of further economies from recent mergers.

INCOME TAXES

For the year ended December 31, 1994, income taxes approximated $13,096,000
compared to $9,770,000 for 1993. This increase is principally the result of
lower levels of tax-exempt income and higher levels of pretax income, combined
with higher statutory federal tax rates in 1994. United's effective tax rates in
these two years were 34.5% and 32.4%, respectively.

At December 31, 1994, gross deferred tax assets totaled approximately $11.5
million. The allowance for loan losses and various accrued liabilities represent
the most significant temporary differences. Based on management's evaluation at
December 31, 1994, no valuation allowance has been allocated to deferred tax
assets.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1994 was $6,156,000, an increase of 20.0%
from the $5,130,000 earned in the fourth quarter of 1993. On a per share basis,
fourth quarter earnings were $.51 per share in 1994 and $.43 per share in 1993.
Net income was higher in 1994 than in 1993 because of the factors previously
discussed herein relative to annual results.

Additional quarterly financial data for 1994 and 1993 may be found in Note S to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

THE EFFECT OF INFLATION

United's income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation. Since
interest rates, loan demand, and deposit levels are related to inflation, the
resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included
in net interest income. Similarly, operating expenses such as salaries, rents,
and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation. One item which
would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense. Subsequent to
the acquisition of depreciable assets, inflation causes price levels to rise;
therefore, historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary
condition. With inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and
fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an
acceptable range, management expects the impact of inflation would be minimal in
the near future.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

Interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or
liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time-frame. The
principal function of asset and liability management is to maintain an
appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive
to changing market interest rates. This relationship has become very important,
given the volatility in interest rates over the last several years, due to the
potential impact on earnings. United closely monitors the sensitivity of its
assets and liabilities on an on-going basis and projects the effect of various
interest rate changes on its net interest margin.

The difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for
specified periods of time is known as the "GAP".

A primary objective of Asset/Liability Management is managing interest rate
risk. At United, interest rate risk is managed to minimize the impact of
fluctuating interest rates on earnings. As shown in the interest rate
sensitivity gap table on page 23 of this report, United was liability sensitive
(excess of liabilities over assets) in the one year horizon. United, however,
has not experienced the kind of earnings volatility indicated from the
cumulative gap. This is because a significant portion of United's retail deposit
base does not reprice on a contractual basis. Management has estimated, based
upon historical analyses, that savings deposits are less sensitive to interest
rate changes than are other forms of deposits. The GAP table presented herein
has been adapted to show the estimated differences in interest rate sensitivity
which result when the retail deposit base is assumed to reprice in a manner
consistent with historical trends. (See "Management Adjustments" in the GAP
table). Using these estimates, United was asset sensitive in the one year
horizon in the amount of $124,816,000 or 7.53% of the cumulative gap to related
earning assets. The primary method of measuring the sensitivity of earnings to
changing market interest rates is to simulate expected cash flows using varying
assumed interest rates while also adjusting the timing and magnitude of non-
contractual deposit repricing to more accurately reflect anticipated pricing
behavior. These simulations include adjustments for the lag in prime loan
repricing and the spread and volume elasticity of interest-bearing deposit
accounts, regular savings and money market deposit accounts. To aid in interest
rate management, United's lead bank, UNB, is a member of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB). The use of FHLB advances provides United with a low
risk means to match maturities of earning assets and interest-bearing funds to
achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets.

Additionally, United has begun using certain off-balance-sheet instruments known
as interest rate swaps, to further aid in interest rate risk management. The use
of interest rate swaps is a cost effective means of synthetically altering the
repricing structure of balance sheet items. The interest rate swap transaction
involves the exchange of a floating rate payment based on the one month London
interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for a fixed rate receipt based on the U. S.
three year treasury note. The net pay and receive amount is calculated

on an underlying notional amount without the exchange of the underlying
principal amount. The interest rate swap subjects United to market risk
associated with changes in interest rates, as well as the risk that the
counterparty will fail to perform. Only the interest payments are exchanged, and
therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount.

At December 31, 1994, the total notional amount of interest rate swaps in effect
was only $50 million. The current maturity of the swap portfolio is two years
and one month. During 1994, interest rate swaps reduced net interest income by
$1,000. United did not have interest rate swaps during 1993. For further
details, see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

In the opinion of management, United maintains liquidity which is sufficient to
satisfy its depositors' requirements and the credit needs of its customers. Like
all banks, United depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other
liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets. A
significant source of funds available to United are "core deposits". Core
deposits include certain demand deposits, statement and special savings and NOW
accounts. These deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost
source of funds available to United. Short-term borrowings have also been a
significant source of funds. These include federal funds purchased and
securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Repurchase agreements represent
funds which are generally obtained as the result of a competitive bidding
process.

Liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash. All banks
must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near-cash items to meet the 
day-to-day demands of customers. Other than cash and due from banks, the
available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary
sources of liquidity.

The goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding
which enables United to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of
depositors and borrowers and meet United's cash needs. Liquidity is managed by
monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources. Substantial
funding is available from cash and cash equivalents, unused short-term
borrowings and a geographically dispersed network of subsidiary banks providing
access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market.

Short-term needs can be met through a wide array of sources such as
correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of
Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

Other sources of liquidity available to United to provide long-term as well as
short-term funding alternatives, in addition to FHLB advances, are long-term
certificates of deposit, lines of credit, and borrowings secured by bank
premises or stock of United's subsidiaries. United has no intention at this time
to utilize any long-term funding sources other than FHLB advances and long-term
certificates of deposit.

Cash flows from operations in 1994 of $34,458,000 were 12.4% higher than the
$30,657,000 in 1993 as a result of a $3.2 million increase in net income. In
1994, investing activities resulted in a use of cash of $52,200,000 as compared
to 1993 in which investing activities resulted in a use of cash of $50,647,000.
The primary reason for the slight increase in the use of cash for investing
activities is that the $88.3 million increase in net loan originations was
almost entirely offset by a net $85.2 million in excess of proceeds from sales,
maturities and calls of securities over security purchases. Financing activities
resulted in a source of cash in 1994 of $39,655,000 primarily due to a
$47,633,000 increase in net borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and an
increase in deposits of $4,372,000. See the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

United anticipates no problems in its ability to service its obligations over
the next 12 months and has no material commitments for capital expenditures.
There are no known trends, demands, commitments, or events that will result in
or that are reasonably likely to result in United's liquidity increasing or
decreasing in any material way. United also has significant lines of credit
available to it. See Note J, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The asset and liability committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a strong
liquidity position is maintained. In addition, variable rate loans are a
priority. These policies should help to protect net interest income against
fluctuations in interest rates.

United also seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total
assets in order to support growth and sustain earnings. United's average equity
to average asset ratio was 10.16% in 1994 and 9.78% in 1993. United's risk-based
capital ratio was 15.52% in 1994 and 15.28% in 1993 which are both significantly
higher than the minimum regulatory requirements. United's Tier 1 capital and
leverage ratios of 14.27% and 9.55%, respectively, at December 31, 1994, are
also strong relative to its peers and are well above regulatory minimums.

1993 COMPARED TO 1992

EARNINGS SUMMARY

For the year ended December 31, 1993, net income increased 32.7% to $21,706,000.
Net income per share of $1.82 for the year was up 19.7% from 1992 levels.
United's return on average assets was 1.27%. Dividends declared per share
increased 11.8% from $.85 in 1992 to $.95 per share in 1993. Earnings before
taxes, security transactions, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle and the provision for possible loan losses were strong and increased
24.4% for 1993 compared to 1992. This reflected a 12.4% improvement in net
interest income driven by a significant increase in average net earning assets.
Noninterest expenses were flat in 1993 as compared to 1992 as management was
effective in its ability to control expenses. Income taxes increased by 36.9%
from 1992, principally because of increased pretax income, decreases in income
from investment securities exempt from federal taxes and higher statutory
federal income tax rates. During 1993 the market price for United stock
increased from $20.00 to $26.50 or 31%.

Earnings for 1993 included certain nonrecurring income and expense items. The
nonrecurring income item, which is reported as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle of $1,329,000, is the result of United's adoption of SFAS
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," during the first quarter of 1993. For
further details, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
nonrecurring expense items were primarily the result of management's
conservative review of certain credits which resulted in additional provisions
being made to the reserve for other real estate owned and the allowance for loan
losses. Additional nonrecurring expenses resulted from the mergers consummated
by United.

The following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations and
changes in financial condition by major category.

NET INTEREST INCOME

For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, net interest income approximated
$71,496,000 and $63,605,000, respectively. On a tax-equivalent basis the net
interest margin was strong at 4.75% in 1993 and 4.83% in 1992. Higher average
loan volumes of $143 million contributed to the increase in net interest income.
United also experienced significant decreases in its overall cost of funds. At
4.75%, United's net interest margin remained well above peer group averages.

Total interest income of $116,505,000 increased 2.6% in 1993 over 1992 as a
result of higher volumes of interest-earning assets. Comparing year-end 1993 to
year-end 1992, moderate decreases in commercial and consumer loans of 6.5% and
5.7%, respectively, which resulted from lower commercial and consumer demand,
were offset by significant mortgage loan growth of 15.3%.

                                       26
<PAGE>
 
Total interest expense decreased 9.8% in 1993. This decrease can be attributed
primarily to lower rates paid on interest-bearing funds. United's average
interest-bearing deposits increased 12.46% in 1993, while its average long-term
borrowings increased 160.88% as United made greater use of these funds in order
to meet the demand for mortgage loan products while matching maturities. The
average cost of funds reflected the general downward trend in market interest
rates in 1993, falling from 4.27% in 1992 to 3.44% in 1993.

PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES

United evaluated the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly
basis and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio.

Nonperforming loans were $13,517,000 at December 31, 1993 and $15,955,000 at
December 31, 1992, a decrease of 15.3%. The components of nonperforming loans
include nonaccrual loans, loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more
as to interest or principal, but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis and
troubled debt restructurings.

At year-end 1993 and 1992 the allowance for possible loan losses was 1.61% and
1.43% of total loans, net of unearned income, respectively. As of December 31,
1993, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was
140.7% as compared to 100.0% as of December 31, 1992.

For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 the provision for loan losses was
$4,332,000 and $4,242,000, respectively. The provision for loan losses charged
to operations was based on management's evaluation of individual credits, the
past loan loss experience, and other factors which, in management's judgment,
deserved recognition in estimating possible loan losses. Such other factors
considered by management included growth and composition of the loan portfolio,
known deterioration in certain classes of loans or collateral, trends in
delinquencies, and current economic conditions.

Total net charge-offs were $1,773,000 in 1993 and $5,144,000 in 1992, which
represents .16% and .52% of average loans for the respective years. United's
ratio of net charge-offs to average loans compared very favorably with its
peers.

OTHER INCOME

Other income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee
income related to earning assets. In 1993, other income increased by $1,550,000
or 13.94%. The overall increase in noninterest income is primarily attributed to
the October 20, 1992, acquisition of UNB-South and increased activity in
customer accounts for which a fee is charged.

Trust income increased $124,000 or 4.93% in 1993. This was due to repricing of
services and an increased volume of trust business.

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
Service charges, commissions and fees increased by $1,430,000 or 19.32% in 1993.
This income consisted of charges and fees related to various banking services
provided by United and was primarily due to a restructuring of fees and the
acquisition of UNB-South.

Securities transactions resulted in a net gain of $479,000 in 1993 and a net
gain of $403,000 in 1992. As evidenced by the Statement of Cash Flows in the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the volume of securities sold increased
significantly in 1993. The primary reason for this increased sales activity was
a one-time restructuring of the portfolio of an acquired subsidiary. Included in
the 1993 gains are debt securities gains of approximately $332,000 which were
realized primarily on sales of mortgage-backed security obligations which were
experiencing accelerated prepayments.

OTHER EXPENSE

Other expense included all items of expense other than interest expense, the
provision for possible loan losses, and income taxes. In total, other expenses
were flat in 1993, and management was successful in controlling costs. The
income statement reflected a 5.7% increase in 1993 as compared to 1992. The
increase was due to certain nonrecurring costs and certain other costs in
connection with the mergers of FFC, Westover and Star City into United during
1993. The October 20, 1992 acquisition of UNB-South also increased reported
expenses for 1993.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 6.26% in 1993 due to the
acquisitions of UNB-South, Westover and Star City. As of December 31, 1993 and
1992, United employed 889 and 879 full-time equivalent employees, respectively.

Other expense increased 5.63% in 1993 compared to 1992. This increase was mainly
due to the acquisition of UNB-South, nonrecurring merger expenses and provisions
for estimated losses on other real estate owned.

INCOME TAXES

For the year ended December 31, 1993, income taxes approximated $9,770,000
compared to $7,136,000 for 1992. This increase is principally the result of
lower levels of tax-exempt income and higher levels of pretax income, combined
with higher statutory federal tax rates in 1993. United's effective tax rates in
these two years were 32.4% and 30.4%, respectively.

Effective January 1, 1993, United prospectively adopted FASB Statement No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, the liability method is used
in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse.

                                       28
<PAGE>
 
Prior to the adoption of Statement 109, income tax expense was determined using
the deferred method. Deferred tax expense was based on items of income and
expense that were reported in different years in the financial statements and
tax returns and was measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the
differences originated.

As permitted by Statement 109, United has elected not to restate the financial
statements of any prior years. The effect of the change on pretax income for the
year ended December 31, 1993 was not material; however, the cumulative effect of
the change increased net income by $1,329,000 or $0.11 per share.

At December 31, 1993, gross deferred tax assets totaled approximately $10.4
million. The allowance for loan losses and various accrued liabilities
represented the most significant temporary differences. Based on management's
evaluation at December 31, 1993, no valuation allowance had been allocated to
deferred tax assets.

RISK ELEMENTS

Nonperforming Loans

Nonperforming loans include loans on which no interest is currently being
accrued, loans which are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest
payments, and loans for which the terms have been modified due to a
deterioration in the financial position of the borrower. Management is not aware
of any other significant loans, groups of loans, or segments of the loan
portfolio not included below where there are serious doubts as to the ability of
the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. The following
table summarizes nonperforming loans for the indicated periods.

Loans are designated as nonaccrual when, in the opinion of management, the
collection of principal or interest is doubtful. This generally occurs when a
loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is
both well secured and in the process of collection. When interest accruals are
discontinued, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is
reversed, and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance
for loan losses. See Note F to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information regarding nonperforming loans and credit risk
concentration.

(1) The amount charged to operations and the related balance in the allowance
    for possible loan losses is based upon periodic evaluations of the loan
    portfolio by management. These evaluations consider several factors
    including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, loan portfolio
    composition, prior loan loss experience and management's estimation of
    future potential losses.

    Quarterly reviews of individual loans as well as the loan portfolio as a
    whole are made by management and the credit department. Management performs
    extensive procedures in granting and monitoring loans on a continual basis.
    Further, management believes that the allowance for possible loan losses is
    adequate to absorb anticipated losses.

                             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



Board of Directors and Shareholders
United Bankshares, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Financial Future
Corporation for 1992, which statements reflect total revenues constituting 10%
of the related consolidated totals in 1992. Those statements were audited by
other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar
as it relates to data included for Financial Future Corporation for 1992, is
based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 1992, the reports of other
auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Bankshares,
Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes D and K to the consolidated financial statements, United
Bankshares, Inc. changed its method of accounting for certain debt securities as
of January 1, 1994 and its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                    UNITED BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                               December 31, 1994


NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of United Bankshares, Inc. and
subsidiaries (United) conform with generally accepted accounting principles. A
description of the significant accounting policies is presented below.

Basis of Presentation:  The consolidated financial statements include the
- ----------------------                                                   
accounts of United Bankshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. United
considers all of its principal business activities to be bank related. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.

Certain amounts in the prior year's financial statements have been reclassified
to conform with the 1994 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on
net income.

Securities:  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities
- -----------                                                                    
at the time of purchase. Debt securities that management has the intent and
United has the ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost.
Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and all marketable equity
securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for
sale are carried as a separate component of shareholders' equity net of deferred
income taxes.

Gains or losses on sales of securities are recognized by the specific
identification method and are reported separately in the statements of income.

Loans:  Interest on loans is accrued and credited to operations using methods
- ------                                                                       
that approximate a level yield on principal amounts outstanding. Loan
origination and commitment fees and related direct loan origination costs are
deferred and amortized as an adjustment of loan yield over the estimated life of
the related loan.

The accrual of interest income generally is discontinued when a loan becomes 90
days past due as to principal or interest. When interest accruals are
discontinued, unpaid interest recognized in income in the current year is
reversed, and interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for
loan losses. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the
estimated net realizable value of collateral exceeds the principal balance and
accrued interest, and the loan is in the process of collection.

NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Allowance for Possible Loan Losses:  In providing for loan losses, United
- -----------------------------------                                      
considers all significant factors that affect the collectibility of loans. The
provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on management's
evaluation of individual credits, the past loan loss experience, and other
factors which, in management's judgment, deserve recognition in estimating
possible loan losses. Such other factors considered by management include growth
and composition of the loan portfolio, known deterioration in certain classes of
loans or collateral, trends in delinquencies, and current economic conditions.

Bank Premises and Equipment:  Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost,
- ----------------------------                                                 
less allowances for depreciation and amortization. The provision for
depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

Other Assets:  Other real estate owned (OREO), acquired principally through
- -------------                                                              
foreclosure on collateral securing loans made by United, is reported at the
lower of cost or fair value less costs estimated to sell and is included in
other assets. Any write-downs at the date of foreclosure are charged to the
allowance for possible loan losses. Expenses incurred in connection with
ownership, subsequent declines in estimated net realizable value, and realized
gains and losses upon sale of the properties are included in other expenses, or
other income, as appropriate.

United maintains an allowance for possible OREO losses. Such allowance is based
upon the estimated values of specific properties in consideration of prevailing

statutory tax rates.

United and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and state income tax
returns. The subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis
and remit amounts to the parent company deemed to be currently payable.

subsidiary bank customers are not included in the balance sheets since such
items are not assets of the subsidiary banks. Trust department income is
reported on a cash basis. Reporting such income on an accrual basis would not
materially affect United's consolidated financial position or its results of
operations as reported herein.

equivalents. Interest paid approximated $43,478,000, $45,502,000 and $51,084,000
in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Income taxes paid approximated

- --------------------                                                      
interest rate exposure. Income or expense derived from these instruments is
recognized as an adjustment to interest income of the underlying instrument.

Earnings Per Common Share:  Earnings per common share is computed based on the
- --------------------------                                                    
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable
period. The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options is not included in the
computation because it is not material.

NOTE B--ACQUISITIONS

On October 20, 1992, United acquired all of the outstanding stock of Summit
Holding Corporation ("Summit") of Beckley, West Virginia, in a common stock
exchange accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As of the date
of acquisition, Summit reported total consolidated assets of $208,130,000. The
results of operations of Summit, now UNB-South, have been included in the
consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

On September 10, 1993, United acquired 100% of the common stock of Westover Bank
("Westover") and certain assets and liabilities of the Star City Branch which
was formerly owned and operated by another bank ("Star City"), both of which are
located in the Morgantown, West Virginia area, for cash of $8,300,000. As of the
date of acquisition, the acquirees had combined total assets of $68,482,000. The
acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The results of operations of Westover and Star City, now branches of United
National Bank, ("UNB"), have been included in the consolidated results of
operations from the date of acquisition.

The purchase prices of these acquisitions and certain acquisitions made in prior
years were allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired
based upon their fair values at the acquisition dates. Intangible assets
relating to the estimated value of the deposit base of the acquired institutions
are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a 7 to 10 year period. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets of the
banks acquired (goodwill) is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 15
years. Net intangible assets (deposit base intangibles and goodwill) of
approximately $10,276,000 and $12,269,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, are included in other assets.

On October 21, 1992, United acquired Liberty Bancshares Inc. ("Liberty") of
Montgomery, West Virginia, in a transaction accounted for under the pooling of
interests method. Liberty reported consolidated total assets of $89,149,000 at
the date of acquisition.

On September 1, 1993 United acquired Financial Future Corporation ("FFC") of
Ceredo, West Virginia, in a transaction accounted for under the pooling of

consolidated assets of $135,665,000.

NOTE C--REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

The subsidiary banks are required to maintain average reserve balances with
their respective Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve
balances for the year ended December 31, 1994 was approximately $30,911,000.

The primary source of funds for the dividends paid by United Bankshares, Inc. is
dividends received from its subsidiary banks. Dividends paid by the subsidiary
banks are subject to restrictions by banking regulations. The most restrictive
provision requires approval by the Comptroller of the Currency if dividends
declared in any year exceed the year's net income, as defined, plus the retained
net profits of the two preceding years. During 1995, the retained net profits
available for distribution to United Bankshares, Inc., as dividends without
regulatory approval, are approximately $8,864,000, plus net income for the
interim periods through the date of declaration.

Under Federal Reserve regulation, the banking subsidiaries are also limited as
to the amount they may loan to affiliates, including the parent company. Loans
from the banking subsidiaries to the parent company are limited to 10% of the
banking subsidiaries' capital, and surplus, as defined, or $17,832,000 at
December 31, 1994, and must be secured by qualifying collateral.

NOTE D--SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE

Effective January 1, 1994, United adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board

on securities classified as available for sale which were previously carried at
amortized cost.

NOTE F--LOANS - continued

The amount of interest income which would have been recorded under the original
terms for the above loans classified as nonaccrual or troubled debt
restructurings was $346,000, $793,000 and $686,000 for the years ended December
31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Amounts recorded as interest income for
these loans totaled $1,000, $183,000 and $224,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

For purposes of the above disclosure, troubled debt restructurings are loans for
which original terms have been modified in response to financial difficulties of
the borrower.  Each of these loans is contractually current based on the revised
terms.

United has commercial real estate loans, including owner occupied, income
producing real estate and land development loans, of approximately $300,679,000
and $267,936,000 as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The loans are
primarily secured by real estate located in West Virginia, Southeastern Ohio,
and Virginia.  The loans were originated by United's subsidiary banks using
underwriting standards as set forth by management.  United's loan administration
policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio,
including commercial real estate loans, in terms of loan approval and credit
quality.  It is the opinion of management that these loans do not pose any
unnecessary risks and that adequate consideration has been given to the above
loans in establishing the allowance for  loan losses.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 114,
(SFAS No. 114), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," which was
amended by Statement No. 118 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994.  SFAS No. 114 requires that loans be measured at the present
value of expected future cash flows using the loan's original effective interest
rate, or alternatively, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value
of the collateral for collateral dependent loans.   United will adopt SFAS No.
114 in the first quarter of 1995 and does not anticipate that the new rule will
have a material impact on the allowance for loan losses.

United's subsidiary banks have made loans, in the normal course of business, to
the directors and officers of United and its subsidiaries, and to their
associates.  Such related party loans were made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with unrelated persons and did not involve more than
normal risk of collectibility.  The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was
$57,310,000 and $48,613,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During
1994, $45,873,000 of new loans were made and repayments totaled $37,176,000.

NOTE J--SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

During 1991, United's lead subsidiary, United National Bank (UNB), was approved
for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, (the FHLB). Since
becoming a member bank, UNB has purchased 102,405 shares of the FHLB stock at
par value. Such purchases entitle UNB to its pro rata share of the quarterly
dividends declared by the FHLB and provide an additional source of short-term
and long-term funding, in the form of collateralized advances. Based upon the
shares presently held by UNB, as well as its Qualifying Collateral and Mortgage
Assets Ratio, as defined in the Master Agreement with the FHLB (the Agreement),
at December 31, 1994, UNB is entitled to receive approximately $496,355,000 in
collateralized advances from the FHLB at prevailing interest rates, subject to
satisfying the Capital Stock Requirement provisions of the Agreement, as
defined.

UNB also has various unused lines of credit available from certain of its
correspondent banks in the aggregate amount of $44,650,000.  These lines of
credit, which bear interest at prevailing market rates, permit UNB to borrow
funds in the overnight market, and are renewable annually provided that UNB does
not experience a material adverse change in its financial position or results of
operations.

Scheduled maturities of the FHLB advances and the contractual rates of interest
paid at December 31, 1994, which require monthly interest payments, are as
follows:

NOTE K--INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, United changed its method of accounting for income
taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  As permitted under the new
rules, prior years' financial statements were not restated.  The cumulative
effect of the change increased net income by $1,329,000 or $0.11 per share and
is reported in the 1993 Statement of Income.

    NOTE L--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    United has a defined benefit retirement plan covering substantially all
    employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the average of the
    employee's highest five consecutive plan years of basic compensation paid
    during the ten plan years preceding the date of determination. United's
    funding policy is to contribute annually the maximum amount that can be
    deducted for federal income tax purposes. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for
    those expected to be earned in the future.

The changes in unrecognized net gain, actual loss (return) on plan assets and
net amortization and deferral are primarily due to differences in the expected
return and the actual return or loss on plan assets and an increase in the
weighted average discount rate from 7.5% in 1993 to 8.5% in 1994.

NOTE L--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - continued

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation
levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligation were approximately 8.5% and 4.5% at December 31, 1994 and 7.5% and
4.5% at December 31, 1993.  The weighted average expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 9.0% for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992.

The United Savings and Stock Investment Plan (the Plan) is a deferred
compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  All
employees who complete one year of service are eligible to participate in the
Plan.  Each participant may contribute from 1% to 10% of pre-tax earnings to
his/her account which may be invested in any of four investment options chosen
by the employee.  United matches 100% of the first 2% of salary deferred and 25%
of the next 2% of salary deferred with United common stock.  Vesting is 100% for
employee deferrals and the United match at the time the employee makes his/her
deferral.  United's expense relating to the Plan approximated $336,000, $280,000
and $241,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

The assets of United's defined benefit plan and 401(k) Plan each include
investments in United common stock.  At December 31, 1994, the combined plan
assets included 178,317 shares of United common stock with a market value of
approximately $4,280,000.

United has certain deferred compensation plans covering various key employees.
Periodic charges are made to operations so that the present value of the
liability due each employee is fully recorded as of the date of their
retirement.  Amounts charged to expense have not been significant in any year.

During 1988, United formed the 1988 Incentive Stock Option Plan for key
employees.  Stock option grants are awarded at the fair market value of United's
common stock on the date of the grant.  The options are immediately exercisable
and have a maximum duration of 10 years.  Options need not be exercised in the
order granted.  The final 20,000 options under this plan were granted in January
1992 at the then current market price of $13.25.

During 1991, United formed the 1991 Incentive Stock Option Plan for key
employees.  Five hundred thousand (500,000) shares were allocated to the plan
with no more than 100,000 options to be awarded each year.  Stock option grants
are awarded at the fair market value of United's common stock on the date of the
grant.  The options may be exercised in accordance with a three year vesting
schedule and have a maximum duration of 10 years.  Options need not be exercised
in the order granted.  In November 1994, the Board granted 100,000 options at
the then current market price of $23.00.

United provides postretirement benefits for certain employees at subsidiaries
acquired in prior years.  United accounts for such costs as expense when paid.
United's analysis indicates that accounting for such costs when paid does not
produce results materially different from those which would result if such costs
were accrued during the period of employee service.  United does not anticipate
providing postretirement benefits to its currently active employees after
retirement except on a fully contributory basis.

NOTE L--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - continued

In 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 112,
(SFAS No. 112), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.  The provisions of
SFAS No. 112 require employers to recognize the obligation to provide
postemployment benefits to former employees if the obligation is attributable to
the employees' services previously rendered, the employees' rights to those
benefits vest or accumulate, the payment of the benefit is probable, and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. United's analysis indicates that accounting
for such costs when paid does not produce results materially different from the
method of recognizing such costs as prescribed by SFAS No. 112.

NOTE M--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

United is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to
alter its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.  These financial
instruments include loan commitments, standby letters of credit and interest
rate swap agreements.  The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
financial statements.

United's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby
letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
United uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed
necessary upon the extension of credit, is based on management's credit
evaluation of the counterparty. United had approximately $244,975,000 and
$216,789,000 of loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, with substantially all of them expiring within one year.

Standby letters of credit are agreements used by United's customers as a means
of improving their credit standing in their dealings with others. Under these
agreements, United guarantees certain financial commitments of its customers.
United has issued standby letters of credit of $15,022,000 and $21,030,000 as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these loan
commitments, standby letters of credit and interest rate swap agreements.

NOTE M--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES - continued

In 1994 United entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its
interest rate exposure.  The interest rate swap transaction involves the
exchange of a floating rate payment based on the one month London inter-bank
offered rate (LIBOR) for a fixed rate receipt based on the U. S. three year
treasury note. The net pay and receive amount is calculated on an underlying
notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. The
interest rate swap subjects United to market risk associated with changes in
interest rates, as well as the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform.
Only the interest payments are exchanged, and therefore, cash requirements and
exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount.

The notional amount shown below represents an agreed upon amount on which
calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based.  It does not represent direct
credit exposure.  United's credit exposure is limited to the net difference
between the calculated pay and receive amounts on the transaction which is
netted monthly.

The swap, which matures in 1997, is summarized as follows:

<TABLE> 

<S>                                               <C> 
Receive fixed generic swap:
     Notional value                               $50,000,000
     Average receive rate during 1994                  4.50% 
     Average pay Rate during 1994                      4.50%  
</TABLE> 

During 1994 the interest rate swap reduced interest income by $1,000.  At
December 31, 1994, the estimated unrealized loss on the swap, which may reduce
interest income in future periods, approximated $3,120,000.  A key assumption
utilized in computing the unrealized loss is that interest rates will remain at
the December 31, 1994 level throughout the term of the agreement.

NOTE O--FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used by United in estimating its fair
value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet
- --------------------------                                                    
for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values.

Securities:  The estimated fair values of securities are based on quoted market
- -----------                                                                    
prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans:  The estimated fair values of variable-rate loans that reprice frequently
- ------                                                                          
with no significant change in credit risk are based on carrying values.  The
fair values of certain mortgage loans (e.g., one-to-four family residential),
credit card loans, and other consumer loans are based on quoted market prices of
similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions, adjusted for
differences in loan characteristics.  The fair values of other loans (e.g.,
commercial real estate and rental property mortgage loans, commercial and
industrial loans, financial institution loans, and agricultural loans) are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently
being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
worthiness.

Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments:  Fair values of United's loan commitments are
- ------------------------------                                              
based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into
account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit
standing.  The estimated fair values of these commitments approximate their
carrying values.  The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is
calculated with pricing models using current rate assumptions.  A key assumption
utilized in computing the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap
agreement is that interest rates will remain at the December 31, 1994 level
throughout the term of the agreement.

Deposits:  The fair values of demand deposits (e.g. interest and non-interest
- ---------                                                                    
checking, regular savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by
definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e.
their carrying amounts).  The carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term
money market accounts and certificates of deposits approximate their fair values
at the reporting date.  Fair values of fixed-rate certificates of deposit are
estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates
currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected
monthly maturities on time deposits.

Short-term Borrowings:  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased,
- ----------------------                                                  
borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings
approximate their fair values.

Long-term Borrowings:  The fair values of United's long-term borrowings are
- ---------------------                                                      
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on United's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  The
carrying value of long-term borrowings approximates their fair value.

NOTE P--LITIGATION

In the normal course of business, United and its subsidiaries are currently
involved in various legal proceedings.  Management is vigorously pursuing all
its legal and factual defenses and, after consultation with legal counsel,
believes that all such litigation will be resolved with no material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.


NOTE Q--SUBSEQUENT EVENT

United has entered into an agreement in principle with First Commercial Bank,
Arlington, Virginia ("First Commercial") to acquire First Commercial for stock
and cash of approximately $10,900,000.  The transaction will be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting.  It is anticipated that the proposed
acquisition will be consummated during the fourth quarter of 1995.  At December
31, 1994, First Commercial had $60,916,000 in total assets and $5,717,000 in
shareholders' equity.  Proforma financial information regarding the effects of
the transaction would not be materially different from that reported herein.

Certain Reports
- ---------------

      Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 requires United's
directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten
percent of United's stock (currently, to the best of United's knowledge, there
are no such persons) to file initial forms of beneficial ownership (Form 3),
statements of changes in beneficial ownership (Form 4) and annual statements of
beneficial ownership (Form 5) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). Persons filing such reports are required by SEC regulations to furnish
United with copies of all such beneficial ownership statements filed under
section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

                                      81
<PAGE>
 
      Based solely on a review of such reports and representations from United
directors and executive officers, United believes that during 1994 all such
reports were filed on a timely basis, with four exceptions: Director Leonard A.
Harvey did not file a Form 4 to report the purchase of 2,000 shares of common
stock in April 1994; Director Robert P. McLean did not file two Forms 4 to
report the purchase of 50 shares of common stock in February 1994 and 100 shares
of common stock in May 1994; and Directors Harry L. Buch and Joseph N. Gompers,
as co-trustees of United Trust in which they shared voting and dispositive power
of the 300,000 shares of common stock held in the trust, each failed to file one
Form 4 each in February 1994 to report the distribution of the United Trust
shares to the beneficiaries of the trust. Messrs. Harvey, McLean, Buch, and
Gompers each reported the transactions on a Form 5 filed with respect to 1994.

      United's contributions to the Pension Plan, a defined benefit plan, are
not and cannot be calculated separately for specific participants by the Pension
Plan's actuary. No company contributions to the Pension Plan are included in the
amounts shown as aggregate or contingent forms of remuneration. See the section
captioned, Employee Benefit Plans, beginning on page 85.

      As of December 31, 1994, the persons named in the table above had compiled
and credited service under the Pension Plan as follows: R. Adams 26 years; I.N.
Smith 35 years; G. Ellis 13 years; T. McPherson 32 years; S. Wilson 23 years.

      Executive officers above are eligible to participate in the 401(K) Plan, a
defined contribution plan. Discretionary contributions made by the individuals
are matched in accordance with provisions of the plan as described under the
section entitled Employee Benefit Plans. Discretionary contributions, made from
the participant's regular pay, are reflected in Cash Compensation above.
United's matching contributions are not reflected in Cash Compensation. Both the
individual contributions and matching contributions are tax deferred income.

Officer Employment Contracts
- ----------------------------

      Richard M. Adams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United and UNB
entered into an employment contract with United effective April 11, 1986. This
contract was amended in 1989, again in January and November 1991, April 1992 and
again in November 1993. This most recent amendment also served to initiate a new
five year term. Under the contract Mr. Adams is required to devote his full-time
energies to performing his duties as Chairman and CEO on behalf of United and
UNB. The contract provides for a base compensation of $300,000 and additional
benefits consistent with the office. This base compensation may be increased but
not decreased. If the contract is terminated by Adams for change in control, or
for any reason other than mutual consent or criminal misconduct, Mr. Adams, or
his family or estate, is entitled to his base salary for the remainder of the
contract term.

                                      82
<PAGE>
 
      On July 27, 1990, United also entered into a Supplemental Retirement Plan
with Mr. Adams. This plan provides for an annual supplemental retirement benefit
upon his reaching age 65 or upon the later termination of his employment with
United. The annual benefit will be equal to seventy percent of the average of
Mr. Adams' three highest base salaries during his employment with United,
reduced by benefits. The plan also provides for reduced benefits for early
retirement after age 62 as well as payments to his spouse in the event of his
death.

      United and UNB entered into an employment agreement with I. N. Smith, Jr.,
President of United and Vice-Chairman of UNB, on December 17, 1985. The term of
the agreement extends until Mr. Smith reaches the age of 75. Until Smith becomes
65, he will be employed full-time by United as an executive officer and will
receive an annual salary of no less than $115,000. Upon reaching the age of 65
and until he reaches the age of 75, Mr. Smith shall render such consulting and
advisory services as United may request, and shall receive for such services an
annual fee of $36,000 from age 65 until he reaches age 70, and $30,000
thereafter. The agreement also contains provisions which address the issues of
disability, early retirement and the death of Mr. Smith. All of these events
carry reduced payment provisions. In addition, until Mr. Smith reaches age 65,
he has agreed to serve as, and United has agreed to use its best efforts to
nominate and elect him, a director of United and UNB.

      Ohio Valley National Bank, (now a part of UNB as a result of its merger
with United) entered into a Salary Contribution Agreement with Douglass H.
Adams, Executive Vice President of United, on June 13, 1985. This agreement
provides at age 65 for an annual supplemental retirement equal to $30,000 for
life or fifteen years certain. This future liability is being funded with life
insurance. Provision is made for an early retirement benefit beginning at age 60
at a reduced percentage of the normal benefit. The agreement also provides for
payment to beneficiaries in the event of his death.

Change of Control Agreements
- ----------------------------

      In March of 1994, United entered into agreements with G. Ellis, S. Wilson,
T. McPherson, J. Hayhurst and J. Wilson to encourage those executive officers
not to terminate their employment with United because of the possibility that
United might be acquired by another entity. The Board of Directors determined
that such an arrangement was appropriate, especially in view of the recent entry
of large regional bank holding companies into West Virginia. The agreements were
not undertaken in the belief that a change of control of United was imminent.

      Generally, the agreements provide severance compensation to those officers
if their employment should end under certain specified conditions after a change
of control of United. Compensation is paid upon any involuntary termination
following a change of control unless the officer is terminated for cause. In
addition, compensation will be paid after a change of control if the officer
voluntarily terminates employment because of a decrease in the total amount of
the officer's 

                                      83
<PAGE>
 
base salary below the level in effect on the date of consummation of the change
of control, without the officer's consent; a material reduction in the
importance of the officer's job responsibilities without the officer's consent;
geographical relocation of the officer without consent to an office more than
fifty (50) miles from the officer's location at the time of a change of control;
failure by United to obtain assumption of the contract by its successor or any
termination of employment within thirty-six (36) months after consummation of a
change of control which is effected for any reason other than good cause.

      Under the agreements, a change of control is deemed to occur in the event
of a change of ownership of United which must be reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a change of control, including but not limited to the
acquisition by any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) of direct or
indirect "beneficial ownership" (as defined by Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of
United's then outstanding securities, or the failure during any period of two
(2) consecutive years of individuals who at the beginning of such period
constitute the Board for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof,
unless the election of each director who was not a director at the beginning of
such period has been approved in advance by directors representing at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the directors at the beginning of the period.

      Under the agreements, severance benefits include: (a) cash payment equal
to the officers monthly base salary in effect on either (i) the date of
termination; (ii) the date immediately preceding the change of control,
whichever is higher, multiplied by the number of full months between the date of
termination and the date that is thirty-six (36) months after the date of
consummation of the change of control; (b) payment of cash incentive award, if
any, under United's Incentive Plan; (c) continuing participation in employee
benefit plans and programs such as retirement, disability and medical insurance
for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the date of termination.

Succession Management Stock Bonus Plan
- --------------------------------------

      In April 1989, the Executive Committee, which at that time also served as
the Compensation Committee, approved a management stock bonus plan. The purpose
of the plan is to retain certain key "junior" officers. The plan is intended to
encourage these individuals to stay with the company and to continue to develop
their potential for future management roles. The plan provides for grants of the
right to receive up to 500 shares per year, for five years, per officer. The
shares granted will be held in trust and the recipients have no ownership rights
until the shares are distributed. All granted stock was distributed to the
grantees at the beginning of 1994. In certain limited circumstances distribution
could have been earlier, such as, in the case of disability or death. Shares
have been purchased by United and are held in a trust account for this plan.
None of the individuals included in this plan were executive officers of United.
No grants have been made since 1990.

                                      84

Incentive Stock Option Plan
- ---------------------------

      In February, 1988, the Board adopted an incentive stock option ("ISO")
plan which was approved by United's shareholders at the 1988 annual meeting. The
ISO plan was conceived by United's Board in order to retain and motivate key
management executives of United. The class of eligible employees is executive
officers of United and its subsidiaries owning less than 10% of United's issued
and outstanding stock. The Executive Committee of United, in its sole
discretion, will award stock options to eligible employees, will determine the
conditions for exercise, and will administer the ISO plan generally. One hundred
thousand (100,000) shares were allocated to the plan, with options for no more
than 20,000 shares to be awarded each year. The option exercise price was the
fair market value of United's stock at the time the option is granted. The last
grants under this plan were awarded in 1992. All options granted are vested.
Messrs. R. Adams, Smith, S. Wilson, J. Wilson, Sowards and Ellis have exercised
options.

       In April, 1991, the Board adopted an incentive stock option plan ("1991
Plan") which was approved by United's shareholders at the 1991 annual meeting.
The 1991 Plan is intended to attract and retain qualified and motivated
management. The class of eligible employees is officers of United and its
subsidiaries owning less than 10% of United's issued and outstanding stock. The
Executive Committee of United, in its sole discretion, will award stock options
to eligible employees and will administer the 1991 Plan generally. Five hundred
thousand (500,000) shares will be allocated to the plan, with options for no
more than 100,000 shares to be awarded each year. The option exercise price will
be the fair market value of United's stock at the time the option is granted.

      In 1994, 100,000 shares were granted as follows: Richard M. Adams-14,500
shares; I. N. Smith, Jr.-3,000 shares; Gary L. Ellis-5,000 shares; Joe L. 
Wilson-4,000 shares; Steven E. Wilson-5,500 shares; James B. Hayhurst-4,700
shares; Joseph Wm. Sowards-2,700 shares; Douglass H. Adams-2,700 shares; Thomas
A. McPherson-4,700 shares and David Addison-2,700 shares. Forty-four
nonexecutive officers received a total of 50,500 shares. These shares were
granted at the then current market price of $23.00. The options granted become
exercisable in accordance with a three year vesting schedule: 50% year one; 75%
year two and 100% year three. Messrs. Addison, Smith, S. Wilson and nine
nonexecutive officers have exercised options.

Employee Benefit Plans
- ----------------------

      No directors or principal shareholders of United and its subsidiaries,
other than those persons who are salaried officers, participate in any type of
benefit plan of United.

      United's subsidiaries provide, on a substantially non-contributory basis
for all full-time employees, life, disability, hospital and dental insurance.
Life insurance with value of 250% of base salary is provided to all full-time
employees, including executive officers. The premiums paid by the subsidiaries
for life insurance on any individual which has a face value greater than $50,000
is properly reported as compensation. These plans do not discriminate, in scope,
terms or operation, in favor of the executive officers of United or its
subsidiaries and are available generally to all salaried employees of United and
its subsidiaries.

a face value greater than $50,000 is properly reported as compensation.
These plans do not discriminate, in scope, terms or operation, in favor of the 
executive officers of United or its subsidiaries and are available generally to
all salaried employees of United and its subsidiaries.
 
      Each employee of United, or its participating subsidiaries, who completes
one year of eligible service and is 21 years of age is eligible to participate
in the Pension Plan. The plan is noncontributory on the part of the employee.
Vesting is attained with five years of participation.

      Normal retirement benefits under the United Plan are equal to:

      1.25% of Average Final Compensation* plus 0.5% of Average Final
Compensation in excess of Covered Compensation** multiplied by years of service
not to exceed 25.

      *Average Final Compensation = The average of the highest five consecutive
plan years of basic compensation paid during the ten plan years preceding the
date of determination.

      **Covered Compensation = The average of the last 35 years of the social
security wage base prior to Social Security retirement age.

      Each employee of United, or its participating subsidiaries, who completes
one year of eligible service is eligible to participate in the United Savings
and Stock Investment Plan, a deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Each participant may contribute from 1% to 10% of
pre-tax earnings to his/her account which may be invested in one to four
investment options chosen by the employee. United matches 100% of the first 2%
of salary deferred and 25% of the second 2% of salary deferred with United
stock. Vesting is 100% for employee deferrals and the company match at the time
the employee makes his/her deferral.

      United employees may participate in an employee stock purchase plan
whereby its employees may purchase shares of United's common stock. Purchases
made by employees under this plan are coordinated by the Trust Department of
UNB, and involve stock purchased at market price for this purpose.

Transactions with Management and Others
- ---------------------------------------

      United's subsidiaries have had, and expect to have in the future, banking
transactions with United and with its officers, directors, principal
shareholders, or their interests (entities in which they have more than a 10%
interest). The transactions were in the ordinary course of business and with
respect to loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates, collateral and repayment terms as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions. United's subsidiary banks are subject to federal
statutes and regulations governing loans to officers and directors and extend
loans in compliance with such laws and only with the approval of the Board of
Directors.

      The building utilized by UNB to house its Rosemar Circle Branch in North
Parkersburg, West Virginia, is owned by Richard M. Adams, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of United and UNB, his brother, Douglass H. Adams, Executive
Vice President of United and their step-mother, Dorothy D. Adams. The Adams'
lease the land from UNB at a nominal annual rental and lease the branch facility
they constructed to UNB. The leases were entered into prior to UNB's ownership
of the branch facility and were assumed by UNB upon its acquisition of the
previous lessee, United Bank. Management believes the lease terms are comparable
with lease terms for similar property in the market area.

      H. Smoot Fahlgren, a member of the Board of Directors of United, is Chief
Executive Officer of Fahlgren Martin, Inc., an advertising agency with its
headquarters in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The agency has provided the
advertising for United since 1978. United utilizes an aircraft owned by Mr.
Fahlgren, a member of United's Board of Directors. During 1994, Mr. Fahlgren
received $15,672 in compensation for these services. Payment for the advertising
by United to Fahlgren Martin, Inc. was less than 5% of that firm's revenues
during the year 1994.

      F.T. Graff, Jr., a member of the Board of Directors of United, is a
partner in the law firm of Bowles Rice McDavid Graff & Love in Charleston, West
Virginia. Bowles Rice McDavid Graff & Love rendered legal services to United and
UNB during 1994 and it is expected that the firm will continue to render certain
services to both in the future. The fees paid to Bowles Rice McDavid Graff &
Love represent less than 5% of that firm's revenues for 1994.

      R. Terry Butcher, a member of the Board of Directors of United, is a
partner in the law firm of Butcher & Butcher of Glenville, West Virginia.
Butcher & Butcher has rendered legal services to UNB, a United affiliate, during
1994 and it is expected that the firm will continue to render legal services in
the future. The fees paid to Butcher & Butcher represent less than 5% of the
firm's revenues for 1994.

      UNB leases its northern region main banking premises from The Ogden
Newspapers, Inc. pursuant to a written lease agreement dated August 1, 1979 (the
"Lease"). The Ogden Newspapers, Inc. is a shareholder of United, and the voting
and investment authority for its shares are beneficially owned by its President,
G. Ogden Nutting who is a director of United. The Lease is on terms comparable
to market terms for similar rental space in Wheeling, West Virginia. The Lease
provides for five (5) successive options to renew and extend the terms of the
Lease for five (5) years each. United exercised its option to renew the Lease
for five (5) years in 1989 and again in 1994. In addition, during the year 1994
subsidiaries of United advertised, at market rates, in newspapers published by
The Ogden Newspaper, Inc. The fees paid in such advertising and the rent paid to
The Ogden Newspapers, Inc. represent less than 5% of that firm's revenue for the
year 1994.

THE FINANCIAL DATA SERVICES COMPANY DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT

THIS IS AN AGREEMENT, dated as of August 1, 1994          , between FIserv CIR, 
                                  ------------------------
Inc. a Delaware corporation          ("FIserv"), and 
United Bankshares, Inc.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
500 Virginia Street
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charleston, WV 25392                                               (the Client")
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND
- ----------

FIserv provides data processing services to a number of its client. The Client 
desires to engage FIserv to provide such services to the Client.

WHEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual covenants 
contained herein and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

The effective date of this Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the date 
first written above.

2.  THE SERVICES.

The data processing and reporting services that FIserv offers as of the 
Effective Date are set forth in Exhibit A, which is attached hereto and hereby 
incorporated by reference. The services that FIserv shall provide to the Client 
hereunder shall be those data processing and reporting services that FIserv is 
offering from time to time that the Client shall request from FIserv from time 
to time (collectively, the "Services"). During the Initial Term (as defined in 
Section 6 hereof), the Client agrees to use FIserv as its sole and exclusive 
data processor at least for each of the Basic Services set forth in Exhibit A.

3.  FEES.

3.1(a) Subject to the terms and conditions below, the total monthly fee (the 
"Fixed Monthly Fee") to be charged beginning on the Effective Date shall be
Eighty Three Thousand Two Hundred Fifty
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dollars
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    ($83,250.00)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fixed Monthly Fee shall include all of those Services identified with a "B" 
in the left margin of the Fee Schedule on Exhibit B, which is attached hereto 
and hereby incorporated by reference.

3.1(b) Except for potential adjustments as outlined in paragraphs,
3.1(c), 3.1(d), and 3.3 below, the Fixed Monthly Fee shall remain in effect 
through December 31, NA. From January 1, NA, through the last day of the term 
                    ---                 ---           
of this Agreement (as defined in Section 6 hereof), the Fixed Monthly Fee in any
given calendar year shall not increase by more than the aggregate annual 
increase in the previous calendar year's Consumer Price Index, as promulgated 
by the United States Department of Labor or any successor agency ("CPI").

3.1(c) Annually throughout the term of this Agreement, in the event that the 
Client's then current volume for those categories listed on Exhibit C, which is 
attached hereto and hereby incorporated by reference, exceeds the volumes as of 
the prior year end by more than five percent (5%), the Fixed Monthly Fee shall 
be increased by the defference between the percentage of actual volume growth
and 5%.  For this comparison volumes shall be determined by averaging the 
actual volumes of the final three (3) months of each respective calendar year,
and the percentage of actual volume growth, if any, shall be determined on an
average percentage difference basis, whereby percentage differences (current
over prior year) for each category on Exhibit C shall be individually
calculated and then averaged.

3.1(d) In the event that the Client (i) acquires other financial institutions or
branches or portfolios of accounts for which FIserv will provide data processing
services under the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (ii) elects to have
FIserv provide data processing services to existing affiliates other than the 
aforementioned under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Fixed 
Monthly Fee shall be increased upon the conversion of each such acquisition or 
affiliate. Such increases(s) shall be calculated by applying the rates in 
FIserv's then current fee schedule to the incremental accounts and activity 
converted by such acquisition(s) or affiliate(s).

3.2 The fees to be charged as of the Effective Date for each of the Services not
includes in the Fixed Monthly Fee defined in paragraph 3.1 above are set forth 
in the fee schedule on Exhibit B. FIserv may charge these fees from time to time
by giving the Client prior written notice of such change in fees.

3.3 New or replacement services that may be made available to the Client 
subsequent to the Effective Date shall be priced by FIserv at levels FIserv 
deems appropriate. However, once the Client begins to receive any such new or 
replacement services, increases in the fees to be charged for such new or 
replacement services shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 3.

3.4 FIserv shall invoice the Client on a monthly basis for all services rendered
in the prior month. The Client shall pay such invoice within 15 days of its 
receipt thereof.

4.  EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.

4.1 The Client shall obtain and maintain at its own expense such data processing
and communications equipment as may be necessary or appropriate to facilitate 
the proper use and receipt of the Services. Should the Client order equipment 
through FIserv during the term of this Agreement, the Hardware Purchase 
Agreement in Exhibit E, which is attached hereto and hereby incorporated by 
reference, shall apply to such order(s).

4.2 The Client shall be responsible for paying for all supplies to be used in 
connection with the Services.

5.  SYSTEMS MODIFICATION; AMENDMENT OF SERVICES.

5.1 FIserv may modify, amend, or provide an appropriate replacement for any of 
the Services or any element of its systems at any time (i) to improve the 
Services or (ii) to facilitate the continued economical provision of the

9.  VOLUME INCREASE AND DECREASE CALCULATIONS.

9.1 Monthly Fee Increase Pursuant to Contract Section 3.1(d): The last sentence
in Contract Section 3.1(d) shall be deleted. The fee increase, if any, shall be
due in the month following conversion and shall be calculated in accordance with
Contract Section 3.1(c) taking into account the five percent (5%) growth

percentage difference is calculated, it shall be discounted according to the
following table:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
           If Average Percentage Increase Is                                             It Will Be Discounted By
           ---------------------------------                                             ------------------------
           <S>                                                                           <C> 
               Less than or equal to 25%                                                           10%
                
                Between 25% and 50%                                                                15%

                Between 50% and 75%                                                                20%

                  Greater Than 75%                                                                 25%
</TABLE> 

9.2 For the purposes of the annual adjustment pursuant to Contract Section
3.1(c) in a year where a conversion has occurred, the converted volumes shall be
subtracted from the current year end volumes to determine internal volume
growth. The allowance to be applied shall be the amount remaining, if any, after
the calculation in Addendum Section 9.1. The increase, if any, from the annual
review shall be applied to the Fixed Monthly Fee in effect prior to a conversion
increase. The increase calculated in Addendum Section 9.1 shall then be added to
the resulting Fixed Monthly Fee along with any other previous adjustments. An
illustration of this provision is found in Exhibit C.

9.3 The volume increase calculations shall apply equally to volume decreases. In
other words, adjustments to the Fixed Monthly Fee for annual volume decreases
shall begin after the 5% allowance for decreases has been applied to the average
percentage difference by category. The resulting average percentage decrease
shall thereafter be discounted according to the percentages in Addendum Section
9.1. For example, if the average percentage difference was 20%, the 5% allowance
would be applied to arrive at the average percentage decrease of 15% before
discount. The discount would be 10% and the resulting discounted average
percentage decrease of 13.5% (15% less (.15 X .10)). In no event over the life
of the Agreement may the Fixed Monthly Fee be reduced by more than 25% of the
Fixed Monthly Fee as of the Effective Date.

application training class.

charge the Client for the first two user manuals for such new service.

11. SALE OF FUSION BY FISERV.

In the event that FIserv, Inc. sells Fusion to a third party, the Client may
terminate this Agreement, without the payment of liquidated damages, by
notifying FIserv of its intent to do so within 90 days following such sale.
FIserv agrees that the Client may elect to be processed on FIserv's platform for
up to one (1) year from such sale.

                                      -6-

12. NOTICE AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR EARLY TERMINATION.

written notice of the Client's desire to terminate the Agreement after a
definitive written agreement has been signed between the acquirer and the

In the event the Client is acquired by a FIserv, Inc. client and desires to
terminate this Agreement and convert from FIserv's Fusion Group to such other

Agreement without the payment of liquidated damages; provided, however, that the

client) or convert (in the case of other FIserv client) (collectively process 
after regulatory approval and convert shall hereinafter be referred to as 
"Transition") such an acquisition as an acquisition under this Agreement by 
providing written notice to FIserv. In addition, if such an acquisition

Client elects to extend the Agreement pursuant to this Section, the acquired 
financial institution may terminate its FIserv Fusion contract upon acquisition

institution is a FIserv, Inc. client other than with Fusion, FIserv shall use 
good faith efforts to minimize the costs associated with the termination of

Accordingly, the Client agrees as follows: (a) Client will use the program(s)

marketability of its products and to assist the Client in its duty with 
Federal regulations applicable to the data used in the Licensed         
Program(s). FIserv, therefore, reserves the right to make such changes  
the Licensed Program(s) as it deems appropriate.                             
7.  REINSTATEMENT OF SUPPORT.

are specified in Attachment A. (b) Reinstatement charges are equal to the
support services charges owned. (c) The Client is responsible for any property,
sales, use and/or excise taxes, which are accessed or payable on account of this
License Agreement.
9.  CHARGES FOR CHANGE IN LICENSE.

workstations shown on Attachment A. If the Client adds workstations, the
parties will complete an additional Attachment to reflect the
upgraded license and support service charges.
10. OTHER CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.                                               
Client will designate a responsible person to represent the Client and   
help coordinate the Client's personnel during the installation period and 
thereafter. Client will (i) provide qualified personnel to attend the
applicable training courses at FIserv headquarters to insure proper  
installation, (ii) pay the then prevailing FIserv training fees, and (iii)
make proper use of the Licensed Program(s). If the Client requests on-site

by FIserv. The Client agrees to certify to FIserv that the Licensed Program(s)
is no longer in use and after termination, FIserv shall have no further 
obligation to the Client.

It shall be an event of default should the Client fail to pay sums due
hereunder, as and when such sums are due and payable. It shall be an event of
default if either party breaches a material obligation or covenant
<PAGE>
 
of this License Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days 
from the written notice, such notice specifying in detail the nature and 
duration of default.  Client agrees that, upon the occurrence of any actual or 
threatened breach by Client of the restrictions upon the use, sale, transfer, or
disclosure of the Licensed Program(s), FIserv will suffer irreparable harm, that
monetary damages alone shall not be a sufficient remedy, and FIserv shall be 
entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief as may be deemed proper or 
necessary by a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to FIserv's other 
right herein.
13.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Any liability of FIserv to Client for any liability, loss, damage, cost or
agreement, or under-taking arising out of or relating to this License Agreement
shall be limited to actual direct damages incurred by Client, but in no event
shall FIserv's aggregate liability exceed the initial license fee. Neither party
shall be liable to the other party for any consequential, special, indirect, or
incidental damages.
14.  GENERAL
(a) FIserv shall have the right to collect from the Client reasonable expenses
incurred in enforcing the collection of fees, taxes, or any other sums payable 
hereunder or in connection with the enforcement by FIserv of its right or 
remedies hereunder including, but not limited to, any court costs or reasonable 
attorney' fees incurred in connection therewith.  No failure of FIserv to demand
any sum, when due, shall be deemed a waiver by FIserv of the obligation of 
Client to pay such a sum.
(b) FIserv may without Client's consent, assign or transfer this License 
Agreement and in such event FIserv assignee or transferee shall have the rights,
powers, privileges, and remedies of FIserv thereunder.  Client shall not assign
this License Agreement or any interest hereunder without FIserv's prior written 
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
(e) FIserv agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Client from and 
against any loss, claim, damage, or cost (including reasonable attorneys' fees) 
arising out of any action against the Client asserting a claim that the
Client's use of the License Program(s) infringes any patent of copyright held by
another party, provided, however, Client is operating under the most current 
release or version of the Licensed Program(s).  Client provides prompt notice to
FIserv of such action, and FIserv may assume the complete defense of such claim.
