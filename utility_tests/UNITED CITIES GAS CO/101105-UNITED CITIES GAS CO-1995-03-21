ITEM 1. BUSINESS
                                    GENERAL
    United Cities Gas Company (Cities) was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Illinois on September 21, 1929. Cities' predominant business is the
distribution of natural gas.  As of December 31, 1994, Cities supplied natural
gas service to approximately 301,000 customers.  In addition to its business of
natural gas distribution, Cities sells and installs gas appliances and performs
certain appliance service work.

    Since 1984, Cities has significantly increased its customer base by adding
approximately 178,000 new customers to its natural gas distribution system.
The table below reflects the areas of growth through acquisitions and internal
marketing efforts, including population growth within Cities' service areas.

    Cities has two wholly-owned subsidiaries.  One subsidiary, United Cities
Gas Storage Company (UCG Storage), was formed as a Delaware corporation in
December, 1989 to provide natural gas storage services.  In 1989, a natural gas
storage field was purchased in Kentucky to supplement natural gas used by
Cities' customers in Tennessee and Illinois.  In addition, natural gas storage
fields located in Kansas and included in Cities' 1989 acquisition of Union Gas
System, Inc. were sold to UCG Storage.  These fields are used to supplement
natural gas used by Cities' Kansas customers.

     The other subsidiary, UCG Energy Corporation (UCG Energy), incorporated
under the laws of Delaware in 1965,  is primarily a broker procuring natural
gas for Cities, certain of Cities' industrial customers, local distribution
companies and others, and is engaged in exploration and production activities.
In addition, UCG Energy leases appliances, real estate, equipment and vehicles
to Cities and others.

     UCG Energy has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, United Cities Propane Gas of
Tennessee, Inc. and UCG Leasing, Inc.  United Cities Propane Gas of Tennessee,
Inc., incorporated under the laws of Tennessee in 1976, is engaged in the
retail distribution of propane (LP) gas.  As of December 31, 1994, the propane
operation served approximately 22,000 customers in Tennessee, Virginia and
North Carolina.  UCG Leasing, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Georgia
in 1987 and leases vehicles, equipment and real estate to Cities.

     Cities and its subsidiaries, UCG Storage and UCG Energy and its
subsidiaries, are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "company".

                              UTILITY OPERATIONS
GENERAL
    Cities distributes natural gas under regulated rates to approximately
301,000 customers in the states of Tennessee, Kansas, Georgia, Illinois, 
Virginia, Missouri, Iowa and South Carolina.  Total operating revenues for the 
year ended December 31, 1994 were $280,984,000, of which approximately 46% was
derived from residential customers, 27% from industrial customers, 26% from
commercial customers and 1% from other sources. The ten largest customers of 
Cities accounted for 6.7% of operating revenues in 1994 and the largest of 
these customers accounted for 2.0%.  Cities serves a diverse industrial load 
with customers engaged in the manufacture of cars, car parts, munitions, wire,
textiles, food products, metal fabrication and electronics, among others.  
Cities also serves several colleges in a major army base.

    Cities is currently structured into four operating divisions.  The percent
of revenues contributed by each division for the three years ended December 31
is as follows:

NATURAL GAS SUPPLY
    To encourage more competition among natural gas suppliers, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Orders 636, 636-A and 636-B
(collectively, Order 636) in 1992.  Order 636 required interstate pipelines to
unbundle or separate gas sales, transportation and storage services by the
1993-1994 winter heating season.  The pipeline sales services were previously
combined and sold as a single service.  With the implementation of Order 636,
the pipelines discontinued their traditional merchant function.  Each
distribution company is now responsible for obtaining all of its gas supply in
the open market.  The unbundling of these services allows Cities more
flexibility in selecting and managing the type of services required to provide
its customers with the lowest possible priced gas while maintaining a reliable
gas supply.  However, this also places an additional responsibility on Cities
to obtain its natural gas supply in the open market on a timely basis to
fulfill its commitments during peak demand periods.  Management believes that,
to date, Cities has been successful in managing its portfolio of spot and term
supplies that it purchases from producers and marketers in the open market on
the thirteen interstate pipelines on which it operates, resulting in reliable
supplies at a competitive price.

     Another aspect of Order 636 allowed the pipelines to set rates to recover
a higher portion of their fixed costs through monthly demand charges.  As a
result, Cities is charged a higher fixed amount each month, regardless of
through-put.  Since Cities must contract for pipeline capacity to meet peak
demand, this has the effect of increasing Cities' fixed cost of gas.  Many
elements such as company owned gas storage facilities, peak shaving plants and
the liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and, in some instances, storage contracts
with Cities' suppliers are being utilized to reduce these higher pipeline
demand charges.  Order 636 also required pipelines to set up capacity release
mechanisms on their systems to allow holders of firm capacity and firm storage
to release these services when they are not needed.  Cities is active in
releasing capacity during off peak periods and the majority of revenues
generated by this activity is used to offset pipeline demand charges.  In
addition, Cities is promoting competition among pipelines to the maximum extent
possible.  Various projects are in the planning stages to add additional
pipeline suppliers in several of Cities' operating areas.  Adding alternatives
will provide bargaining power which should, over time, decrease Cities'
pipeline capacity costs.  Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses in effect in
each state allow Cities to pass through to its customers, subject to prudency
and/or administrative reviews, any increase or decrease in rates charged to
Cities related to the purchase and transportation of natural gas.

     Considerable planning is required to project demand for the winter period.
In order to provide natural gas at the lowest possible price and to meet peak
demand, Cities must have a sufficient volume of natural gas in underground
storage with its pipeline suppliers, natural gas in UCG Storage's underground
storage facilities, and propane and LNG in its own facilities.  Cities normally
injects gas into pipeline storage systems and UCG Storage's storage system
during the summer months and withdraws it in the winter months.   At the
present time, the underground storage facilities of UCG Storage have a maximum
daily output capability of approximately 53,000 Mcf.

     Other storage facilities owned by Cities are used to provide short-term
supplies to meet peak demand.  Cities has ten propane peak shaving plants with
a total capacity of approximately 1,950,000 gallons that can produce an
equivalent of 33,859 Mcf daily and a LNG storage facility with a capacity of
500,000 Mcf which can inject a daily volume of 30,000 Mcf in the system.
Cities has the ability to serve approximately 60% of its peak day load through
the use of company owned storage facilities, storage contracts with Cities'
suppliers and peaking facilities throughout the system.  This ability provides
the operational flexibility and security of supply required to meet the needs
of the highly weather sensitive firm market.

REGULATION
    In each state in which Cities operates, its rates, services and operations
as a natural gas distribution company are subject to general regulation by the
state public service commission.  Cities' pipeline suppliers, but not Cities,
are subject to regulation by the FERC (see "Utility Operations-Natural Gas
Supply").  Cities' rates, which vary in its different regulatory jurisdictions,
are determined by the cost of purchased gas to Cities, rate of return, type of
service and volume of use by the customer.  In addition, the issuance of
securities by Cities is subject to approval by the state commissions, except in
South Carolina and Iowa.  Missouri only regulates the issuance of debt
securities.

    Cities operates in each community where necessary under a franchise granted
by the municipality for a fixed term of years. To date, Cities has been able to
renew franchises and expects to continue to do so in the future.  Cities
considers the franchises held valid and adequate for the conduct of its
business.  In each of the service areas where it operates, Cities considers
that its rights to maintain gas lines through unincorporated communities over
private rights-of-way are, as a group or system, satisfactory for the adequate
conduct of the business of Cities.  Cities also has all required certificates
of convenience and necessity for the operation of its properties and the
conduct of its business from the appropriate state public utility regulatory
agencies.

    The Tennessee and Georgia Public Service Commissions approved the
implementation of Weather Normalization Adjustments (WNAs) effective in late
1991 and 1990, respectively.  The WNAs, effective October through May in
Georgia and November through April in Tennessee, allow Cities to increase the
base rate portion of bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the
base rate when weather is colder than normal.

     Effective April 1, 1993, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued
an order stating that Cities' current authorized rates in that state be
considered interim and subject to refund pending an investigation to determine
whether Cities was earning more than its authorized rate of return and whether
the authorized rate of return at that time was appropriate.  In addition, the
commission staff alleged that Cities overcollected gross receipts tax from its
customers for the years 1988 through mid-1993.  In an order issued in November,
1994, the commission reduced the company's authorized rate of return in
Virginia from 11.26% to 10.26%, resulting in a reduction in annual revenues of
$218,000.  This reduction was effective April 1, 1993.  Excess revenues of
approximately $370,000, plus interest, collected under interim rates through
December 31, 1994, are to be refunded to Cities' customers.  In addition, the
commission concluded that Cities had overcollected gross receipts tax from its
customers from 1988 through mid-1993 and ordered a refund of $301,000, plus
interest.  Cities has adequate reserves to cover its liability related to the
order.

     In 1991, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered Cities to refund
approximately $260,000 related to the reconciliation of the PGA recovery
mechanism for 1988.  Cities filed an appeal with the Appellate Court of
Illinois which in September, 1992, issued a decision upholding the commission's
decision.  Cities filed an appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court which in
September, 1994, upheld the commission's and lower court's decision.  Cities
asked for rehearing of this decision which was subsequently denied.  Cities
will refund the $260,000, plus interest, beginning in 1995 and has adequate
reserves to cover its liability.

     Effective February 7, 1995, Cities received an annual rate increase of
$253,000 in the state of South Carolina.  Cities had filed on August 8, 1994,
to increase rates by $341,000 on an annual basis.

     On January 27, 1995, Cities filed to increase rates on an annual basis by
$4,200,000 in the state of Kansas.  On November 8, 1994, Cities filed to
increase rates by $1,100,000 on an annual basis in the state of Missouri.
Cities expects that any increase granted in these two states will be effective
by the third quarter of 1995.

                                       5

     Effective July, 1993,  the Missouri Public Service Commission authorized
an annual rate increase in the amount of $425,000 in Missouri.  Cities had
filed to increase rates by $1,200,000 on an annual basis.  Effective January
12, 1993, Cities received an annual rate increase of $915,000 in the state of
Kansas.  Cities had filed to increase rates by $6,300,000 on an annual basis.

     Effective November 1, 1992, Cities was granted an annual rate increase of
$1,900,000 in Georgia.  This amount included an annual increase of $1,475,000
in revenue and a rider for an additional $425,000 to be collected in each of
the three years after November 1, 1992, related to the response action costs
incurred at a manufactured gas plant site.  Cities had requested an increase of
$3,200,000 in Georgia.

     Effective October 1, 1992, Cities received an annual rate increase of
$1,700,000 in the state of Tennessee.  Cities had filed to increase rates by
$2,900,000 on an annual basis.  As a part of a settlement agreement entered
into in connection with the rate increase, Cities agreed to a management audit.
The management audit report was issued in 1994.  Management agreed with a
majority of the recommendations made by the auditors and a number of
recommendations are currently in the process of being implemented.  Other
recommendations are being evaluated and may be implemented in the future.  In
April, 1995, Cities will report to the Tennessee Public Service Commission its
progress in addressing the issues raised by the auditors.  Management does not
believe that the implementation of the recommendations will have a material
effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.

     In 1990, Cities received an order from the Kansas State Corporation
Commission allowing Cities to defer, pending approval in rate cases, certain
safety-related costs, depreciation on safety-related capital expenditures, and
carrying charges on the total.  As of December 31, 1991, costs totaling
$1,378,000 and $2,706,000 were deferred for the years 1991 and 1990,
respectively.  The Kansas commission approved in rates effective January, 1993,
deferral and recovery of $949,000 and $1,275,000 related to 1991 and 1990,
respectively.  Each of these amounts are being amortized over a five year
period.  The difference in the approved cost and the cost previously deferred
was expensed in 1992.

     In addition, in 1990 and 1992, the Missouri Public Service Commission
issued orders allowing Cities to defer, pending approval in rate cases, similar
safety-related costs.  In 1989 through 1992, costs of $833,000 were deferred.
After reaching stipulated agreements in rate proceedings, Cities discontinued
deferring these costs and began amortizing $600,000 in 1992 and $233,000 in
1993 over five year periods.

     The FERC has permitted pipelines to recover from their customers,
including Cities, the prudently incurred costs of implementing Order 636,
referred to as transition costs.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, based on
current pipeline transition cost filings with the FERC, Cities had accrued and
deferred $6,739,000 and $1,845,000, respectively, as its estimated share of the
remaining liability related to these transition costs.  Because there are
pipeline requests not yet filed with the FERC, the 1994 estimate may differ
from the final amount of future transition costs recovered from Cities.  Cities
has been granted permission through approved PGA filings or specific orders in
all the states in which it operates to recover these transition costs from its
customers.

     Cities' pipeline suppliers have liabilities to producers for payments
under purchase contracts for quantities of gas for which deliveries have not
been taken.  Pipeline suppliers received permission from the FERC to recover
from their customers, including Cities, a portion of their take-or-pay
liabilities.  Cities has been granted permission in all of the states in which
it operates to recover from its customers any take-or-pay costs.  Total
deferred but unrecovered take-or-pay costs were $2,415,000 and $2,384,000 as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     In December, 1990, the FASB issued Statement No. 106 (SFAS 106),
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The
company adopted the statement effective January 1, 1993.  The statement
requires the company to record the expected costs of postretirement health and
life insurance benefits during the years the employees render service.  This
was a change from the company's previous policy of recognizing these costs on a
cash basis.  The annual cash payments for such benefits were $807,000 in 1992.
Costs related to these benefits calculated in accordance with SFAS 106 amounted
to $1,649,000 and $1,331,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The accumulated
benefit obligation of $8,894,000 existing at January 1, 1993, is being
amortized over a twenty year period as allowed by SFAS 106.

     Cities has received approval to recover SFAS 106 costs in South Carolina,
Kansas, Iowa and Illinois.  The Tennessee commission has approved the recovery
of these costs and is allowing Cities to defer the difference between cash
payments and SFAS 106 expense until the next rate proceeding in that state.
The Virginia commission has approved the recovery of SFAS 106 costs in rates.
However, the accumulated benefit obligation will be recovered over forty years
as opposed to the twenty year amortization period allowed by SFAS 106.  The
Georgia and Missouri commissions did not render decisions on SFAS 106 in
Cities' last rate proceedings in those states.  However, the Missouri
legislature has subsequently passed a statute allowing utilities to recover
SFAS 106 costs.  As required by some commissions, Cities has established a
trust fund to accumulate the difference between the cash payments for
postretirement benefits and SFAS 106 expense.

(1)   Residential, industrial firm and certain commercial customers are entitled
      to receive gas service on a continuous, uninterrupted basis subject to
      the application of their priority classification in the event of gas
      shortages.  Industrial interruptible and certain commercial customers
      receive a low cost, load balancing service, which permits Cities to
      interrupt service and which is limited to users with alternative fuel
      sources for use when service is interrupted.  Interruptible rates are
      generally lower than firm rates.

ACQUISITIONS
     Effective March 1, 1994, the company purchased the natural gas system in
Palmyra, Missouri from Western Resources, Inc. for approximately $665,000.  The
company also obtained a ten year non-compete agreement.  Consideration for the
agreement is contingent upon volumes sold to a certain industrial customer with
payments made over a three year period, not to exceed $720,000.  The system
serves approximately 1,400 natural gas customers.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
    Cities' business is highly seasonal in nature and heavily dependent upon
weather due to Cities' substantial heating load.  In order to moderate the
impact of weather on the financial results of the utility operation, Cities
sought and received approval from the Tennessee and Georgia commissions to
implement Weather Normalization Adjustments (WNAs).  See "Utility
Operations-Regulation" for additional information concerning WNAs.  Cities'
business will still be seasonal in nature resulting in greater earnings during
the winter months and will continue to be dependent upon weather, especially in
those states where a WNA has not been implemented.  However, Cities seeks to
minimize the quarterly variations in sales volumes and earnings by sales to
industrial customers and the diversified activities of its unregulated
subsidiaries.  See chart of quarterly earnings on page 44 for the years 1994
and 1993.

OTHER UTILITY OPERATIONS
    In addition to its sales of natural gas, Cities engages in direct
merchandising and repair of gas appliances.  The following table summarizes
revenues from these sources for 1994, 1993 and 1992.

UNITED CITIES GAS STORAGE COMPANY

    UCG Storage is engaged in constructing, maintaining and operating gas wells
for natural gas storage. UCG Storage owns and operates storage fields in
Kentucky and Kansas.  The storage fields provide a mechanism to purchase and
store gas for distribution during the winter.  In addition to providing peak
shaving gas, the storage facilities can also be used to balance gas supplies,
allowing extra gas to be diverted into the field when contract demand is not
needed and withdrawn when gas usage exceeds contract demand.  Included in the
revenues of UCG Storage are affiliated revenues of $7,037,000, $8,749,000 and
$7,613,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, for storage services and
natural gas provided to Cities' customers in Tennessee, Kansas and Illinois.

assumed of $820,000.  In addition, UCPT obtained a ten year non-compete
agreement for $100,000, to be paid over a five year period.  This acquisition
added approximately 1,400 customers in the Boone, North Carolina area.

     In 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Propane Division contributed 54%, 47% and 52%,
respectively, of UCG Energy's total revenues.  Of UCG Energy's gross properties
at December 31, 1994, approximately 37% was related to the Propane Division.

RENTAL DIVISION

    UCG Energy's Rental Division, which includes UCG Leasing, Inc., leases real
estate, vehicles, and other equipment to Cities and real estate and appliances
to non-affiliated third parties.  The Rental Division's revenues were
approximately 17% in 1994, 17% in 1993 and 20% in 1992, of UCG Energy's total
revenues.  Included in the revenues of the Rental Division are affiliated
revenues of $5,827,000, $6,042,000 and $5,805,000 for the years 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively, representing rental charges to Cities for transportation
equipment and office facilities.  Of UCG Energy's gross properties at December
31, 1994, approximately 63% was related to the Rental Division.

UTILITY SERVICES DIVISION

    UCG Energy's Utility Services Division is active in other energy related
activities.  The Utility Services Division is primarily a broker procuring
natural gas for Cities, certain of Cities' industrial customers, local
distribution companies and others, and is engaged in exploration and production
activities.  The revenues from these activities were approximately 29% in 1994,
36% in 1993 and 28% in 1992, of UCG Energy's total revenues.  Included in the
Utility Services Division's revenues are affiliated revenues of $701,000,
$1,139,000 and $1,519,000 for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
These revenues represent purchases by Cities of energy-related products from
the Utility Services Division.  A decision to discontinue the distribution of
energy-related products by the Utility Services Division was made by management
in 1994.  The discontinuance of this activity of the Utility Services Division
is not expected to materially affect the results of operations or financial
condition of the company and is expected to be completed by mid-1995.

    During the first quarter of 1995, UCG Energy purchased a 45% interest in
certain contracts related to the gas marketing business of Woodward Marketing,
Inc. (WMI), a Texas corporation.  In exchange for the acquired interest, the
shareholders of WMI will receive $5,000,000 in Cities' common stock, pending 
regulatory approval, and $750,000 in cash and may, if certain earnings
targets are met, receive an additional payment of $1,000,000 to be paid over a
five year period.  In exchange for its own gas marketing contracts and the
acquired 45% interest in the WMI gas marketing contracts, UCG Energy received a
45% interest in a newly formed limited liability company, Woodward Marketing,
L.L.C. (WMLLC).  WMI received a 55% interest in WMLLC in exchange for its
remaining 55% interest in the WMI gas marketing contracts.  WMLLC will provide
gas marketing services to industrial customers, municipalities and local
distribution companies.  UCG Energy will utilize equity accounting, effective
January 1, 1995,  for the acquisition.

                                  COMPETITION
    Cities distributes natural gas primarily to residential, commercial and
high-priority industrial users and intends to aggressively seek additional
numbers of such customers.  Competition exists between natural gas and other
forms of energy available to customers.  Cities is experiencing competition for
each class of customer; electricity is the primary competition for residential
and commercial customers, and #2 and #6 fuel oil is the primary competition for
industrial customers.  In addition, certain customers, primarily industrial,
may have the ability to by-pass Cities' distribution system by connecting
directly with a pipeline.

     Cities has received approval from all the public service commissions in
the states in which it operates, except Iowa, to place into effect a negotiated
tariff rate which allows Cities to maintain industrial loads at lower margin
rates.  Iowa has rules which allow for flexible rates.   These rates are
competitive with the price of alternative fuels.  In addition, certain
industrial customers have changed from firm to interruptible rate schedules in
order to obtain natural gas at a lower cost rather than change to an
alternative fuel source.   Additionally, Cities has received approval from all
state commissions to provide transportation service of customer-owned gas to
end users (see Item 1. Business.  "Utility Operations-Natural Gas Supply").

    UCG Energy's propane subsidiary is in competition with other suppliers of
propane, natural gas and electricity.  Competition exists in the areas of price
and service.  The wholesale cost of propane is subject to fluctuations
primarily based on demand, availability of supply and product transportation
costs.  Propane storage facilities can be utilized to store purchased gas when
the cost is more economical, thus enabling UCG Energy to more competitively
price its product.  However, during periods of colder than normal weather, when
demand is high, UCG Energy may have to replace its supply of gas at higher
costs, which may require UCG Energy to sell at reduced margins to match its
competition.

     The Utility Services Division of UCG Energy competes with other natural
gas brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for customers.  The Rental
Division competes with other rental companies.

    UCG Storage charges rates to Cities that are subject to review by the
various commissions in the states within which the storage service is provided
to Cities.  Therefore, UCG Storage's rates must be competitive with other
storage facilities.  UCG Storage also stores natural gas for unrelated third
parties.  As a result, UCG Storage is in competition with other companies that
store natural gas as to rates charged and deliverability of natural gas.
Storage agreements between UCG Storage and Cities give Cities first priority to
any storage services.

                                   PERSONNEL
    At December 31, 1994, the company employed 1,343 full time employees,
including 102 who are represented by a union.  An election is scheduled for
April 7, 1995, in Columbus, Georgia for 96 employees to determine if they would
like to be represented by a union.  Of the full time employees, 243 are engaged
in the operations of the Illinois/Tennessee/Missouri Division, 281 in the
Virginia/East Tennessee Division, 241 in the Georgia/South Carolina Division,
284 in the Kansas/Iowa/Missouri Division, 174 administrative and supervisory
personnel in the corporate office, and 120 in UCG Energy's operating locations.
At December 31, 1994, there were 587 employees participating in the employee
stock purchase plan and 1,024 employees participating in the company's 401k
savings plan.  The company considers its employee relations to be excellent.
All corporate general and administrative functions, as well as the overseeing
of engineering, marketing, accounting, finance, operations and human resources
are handled at the company's corporate offices in Brentwood and Franklin,
Tennessee.  Direct functions dealing with engineering, marketing, accounting,
operations and human resources for the service locations of each division are
handled at the division levels.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
    Cities' properties are located in operating areas as indicated on page 15,
and consist primarily of approximately 7,064 miles of distribution and
transmission mains and approximately 5,353 miles of service lines connecting
the mains to customers' premises.  The company also owns and operates ten peak
shaving plants and a LNG plant, as well as underground storage fields which are
used to supplement the supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand (see
Item 1.  Business.  "Utility Operations-Natural Gas Supply").

    Substantially all of Cities' property is subject to the lien of the
Indenture of Mortgage securing Cities' First Mortgage Bonds.  The following
table sets forth the percentages of property located in the various operating
divisions.

     The capital budget for the company for 1995 is approximately $41,700,000
(utility, $36,900,000 and non-utility, $4,800,000).  Cities is constructing a
twenty-eight mile main which will connect two of its fastest growing
distribution systems located in Middle Tennessee and is designed to provide
Cities' current customers with the lowest possible priced gas through increased
gas supply flexibility.  Included in the 1995 utility budget is approximately
$5,000,000 related to this project, which is scheduled to be completed by the
fall heating season of 1995.  The company anticipates capital expenditures of
approximately $28,400,000 in 1996 and $30,400,000 in 1997.  These reflect the
normal growth in Cities' service areas along with the increased demands for
natural gas and propane (LP) service.

    Cities follows a regular program of improvements and additions to its
properties.  Utility plant additions during 1994 amounted to approximately
$30,888,000 for system upgrading, relocations, and providing new mains, service
lines and metering equipment.   In addition, included in the 1994 capital
expenditures is $3,700,000 related to the construction of the twenty-eight mile
main in Middle Tennessee.  Total utility property at December 31, 1994 amounted
to $403,121,000.

    Non-utility property additions during 1994 amounted to approximately
$4,228,000 (UCG Energy, $4,111,000 and UCG Storage, $117,000).  The majority of
UCG Energy's 1994 additions are related to transportation equipment, rental
equipment and facilities and propane related equipment.  The upgrading of
underground storage facilities accounts for the majority of property additions
for UCG Storage.   Gross non-utility property as of December 31, 1994 amounted
to $71,222,000 (UCG Energy, $52,557,000 and UCG Storage, $18,665,000).

    The following table sets forth information with respect to utility property
additions, excluding acquisitions, made by Cities during each of the five years
ended December 31.

     The company believes its facilities are suitable and adequate for the
purpose of serving the needs of its customers.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
    Except as set forth in Item 1. Business, "Utility Operations-Regulation"
and below, there is no material litigation involving the company as of December
31, 1994. There are certain claims which are adequately covered by liability
insurance or reserves.

     The company was named, along with 26 other defendants, in a class action,
anti-trust case filed March 5, 1993 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Tennessee, Knoxville Division (the Court).  This action
involves alleged price-fixing in the 1980's in eastern Tennessee.  The Court
denied the plaintiffs' class certification motions, but granted the plaintiffs
the right to pursue individual claims against the defendants, including the
company.  The Tennessee Attorney General also filed a motion for class
certification on behalf of all individuals and businesses in the east Tennessee
area.  In February, 1995, the company reached a settlement agreement with the
Tennessee Attorney General, pending the Court's approval, in the amount of
$80,000.  The settlement agreement

                                      17
<PAGE>   20

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)
includes a provision which allows the company to cancel the settlement if 10%
or more of the individual class members or business class members option out of
the settlement class.  The company has adequate reserves to cover the
settlement of this case.  However, management cannot predict the number, if
any, of individual claims that may subsequently be filed related to this case.
In management's opinion, the resolution of any individual claim subsequently
filed will not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the company.

     During 1994, Cities discovered defects in the polyethylene piping
installed in certain of its service areas.  Cities has notified both the
manufacturers of the defective piping and the state regulatory commissions in
such service areas.  An independent laboratory is conducting a study of the
matter at the request of the gas industry and the manufacturers.  Cities also
continues to conduct its own investigation into the issue.  Cities is unable to
predict the extent of the problem or the expense which will be incurred to
repair the defective piping but anticipates recovering the cost from the
manufacturers or through the ratemaking process as a normal maintenance
expense.

     Cities is the owner or previous owner of manufactured gas plant sites
which were used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas.
Manufactured gas was an inexpensive source of fuel for lighting and heating
nationwide.  As a result of the gas manufacturing process, certain by-products
and waste materials, including coal-tar, were produced and may have been
accumulated at the plant sites.  This was an acceptable and satisfactory
process at the time of operations.  Under current environmental protection laws
and regulations, Cities may be responsible for response action with respect to
such materials, if response action is necessary.

     Cities identified a site in Columbus, Georgia, and along with other
responsible parties, has performed response action.  Cities' share of response
action costs at this site totaled approximately $1,324,000.  Of this amount,
$1,275,000 was requested and approved to be recovered over a three year period
in rates which were effective November, 1992.  The approved amount did not
include carrying costs on the deferred balance.  Cities will request and
expects approval to recover the remaining costs either in its next rate
proceeding in Georgia or as an extension of the rider.

     Cities has joined with three other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)
to fund a response investigation and feasibility study of a site in Keokuk,
Iowa.  Cities has incurred costs totaling $129,000 and has, based on available
current information, accrued an additional $644,000 for its share of possible
response action.  Cities has deferred $494,000 of the accrued amount and
expects approval for recovery in its next rate proceeding in Iowa.  Cities has
estimated that it may incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist,
an additional $856,000 of response action costs at this site.

     Cities owns or may be the successor in interest to the previous owner of
four additional former manufactured gas plant sites.  Cities is unaware of any
information which suggests that these sites give rise to a present health or
environmental risk as a result of the manufactured gas process or that any
response action will be necessary.  Accordingly, Cities has not accrued any
liabilities associated with these four sites.

     Pursuant to the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act (the
Act), Cities is required to upgrade or remove certain underground storage tanks
(USTs) situated in Tennessee.  As of December 31, 1994, Cities has identified
eight USTs in this category in Tennessee and has incurred $30,000 and, based on
available current information, accrued an additional $70,000 for the upgrade or
removal of these USTs.  Cities has estimated that it may incur, if certain
adverse conditions are found to exist, additional costs of up to $380,000 to
bring the sites into compliance with the Act.  On October 4, 1994, the
Tennessee Public Service Commission granted Cities permission to defer, until
its next rate case, all costs incurred in connection with state and federally
mandated environmental control requirements.  In addition, Cities may be able
to recover a portion of the corrective action costs from the State of Tennessee
Trust Fund for all of the UST sites in Tennessee.

     Cities has identified three USTs in Virginia and has, based on available
current information, accrued and deferred for recovery $23,000 as of December
31, 1994, for the closure of these sites.  Cities has estimated that it may
incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist, additional costs of up
to $202,000 in responding to these sites.  Cities expects recovery of any costs
incurred related to the closure of these sites.

     Cities has reviewed and commented on a proposed Consent Order from the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) regarding mercury
contamination at gas pipeline sites.  The KDHE has identified the need to
investigate gas industry activities which utilize mercury equipment in Kansas.
Cities is cooperating with the KDHE in preparing a Consent Order and a Work
Plan for responding to mercury contamination at any site which is identified as
exceeding the KDHE's established acceptable concentration levels.  As of
December 31, 1994, Cities has identified approximately 720 meter sites where
mercury may have been used and has incurred $20,000 and, based on available
current information, accrued and deferred for recovery an additional $280,000
for the investigation of these sites.  Cities has estimated that it may incur
an additional amount of up to $4,100,000 over the next seven years in
responding





                                      18
<PAGE>   21
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)
to a future administrative order for those sites, if any, that exceed the
KDHE's established acceptable concentration levels.  Based on a recent decision
by the Kansas State Corporation Commission concerning the recovery of
environmental response action costs incurred by another company, Cities expects
recovery of the costs involved in the investigation and response action
associated with the mercury meter sites in Kansas.

     Management expects that future expenditures related to response action at
any site will be recovered through rates or insurance, or shared among other
PRPs.  Therefore, the costs of responding to these sites are not expected to
materially affect the results of operations or financial condition of the
company.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
    No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                                                                             -

                                                                             - 
 
     The company is primarily a distributor of natural and propane gas serving
approximately 325,000 customers in parts of ten states. The financial condition
and results of operations of the company are significantly affected by the
weather and the regulatory environment in the eight states in which it
distributes natural gas. The following discussion focuses on the financial
condition and results of operations for the company for the past three years
and its future plans.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     At December 31, 1994, the company's capitalization ratios consisted of 45%
common stock equity and 55% long-term debt. The company's goal is to have a
common stock equity ratio of approximately 50%. This will enable the company to
maintain its current credit integrity and continue to allow access to
relatively low cost financing. The company plans to achieve its goal by the
issuance of stock through public stock offerings and the employee stock
purchase, customer stock purchase, dividend reinvestment and long-term stock
plans; and increased retained earnings.
     A substantial portion of the company's cash requirements is to fund its
ongoing construction program in order to provide natural gas services to a
growing customer base. Capital expenditures for the company's utility and
non-utility operations totaled $35,100,000, $31,000,000 and $28,900,000 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. In addition to its ongoing construction
program, the company is constructing a twenty-eight mile main which will
connect two of its fastest growing distribution systems located in Middle
Tennessee and is designed to provide the company's current customers with the
lowest possible priced gas through increased gas supply flexibility. Included
in the 1994 utility capital expenditures stated above is $3,700,000 related to
this project. Capital expenditures totaling $36,900,000 for the utility
operations and $4,800,000 for the non-utility operations are budgeted for 1995.
Included in the 1995 utility budget is approximately $5,000,000 related to the
Middle Tennessee project, which is scheduled to be completed by the fall
heating season of 1995. Total capital expenditures for 1996 and 1997 are
expected to be approximately $28,400,000 and $30,400,000, respectively.
     The nature of the company's business is highly seasonal and weather
sensitive. During 1994, 71% of the company's revenues were attributable to gas
sold in the first and fourth quarters. During the non-heating season, the
company uses short-term debt as a means of funding its ongoing construction
program and working capital requirements, which includes the purchase of gas
for storage to be used during the heating season. The short-term debt is
retired with cash from operations or long-term securities, whichever management
deems appropriate. At December 31, 1994, the company had total short-term lines
of credit of $84,000,000 in the form of master and banker's acceptance notes
bearing interest primarily at the lesser of prime or a negotiated rate during
the term of each borrowing. Under these arrangements, $46,188,000 in short-term
debt was outstanding at December 31, 1994.
     The company has filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appropriate regulatory authorities which,
when declared effective by the SEC and approved by such regulatory authorities,
will give the company the flexibility to issue from time to time in one or more
public offerings up to $200,000,000 of its securities which may include common
stock, unsecured notes and/or first mortgage bonds. Proceeds from the issuance
of securities under the company's shelf registration statement may be used to
retire long-term debt, repay short-term borrowings, finance the company's
construction program and for other corporate purposes. The company plans to
issue between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000 in securities under the shelf
registration statement during 1995.
     In 1994, the company implemented a customer stock purchase plan whereby
residents in the company's service territory can make a one-time purchase of
common stock at a 5% discount below the average market value. A participant can
invest any amount ranging from $250 to $10,000. During 1994, 147,148 shares of
common stock were issued under the new plan resulting in net proceeds to the
company of approximately $2,099,000.
     In May, 1992, the company issued 1,380,000 shares of common stock in a
public offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $17,400,000. The
proceeds from this offering were used to repay short-term borrowings, finance
the company's construction program and for other corporate purposes.
     The company did not issue any long-term debt in 1994. In 1993 and 1992,
the company issued long-term debt of $150,000 and $43,750,000, respectively.
The proceeds of long-term debt in 1992 included the issuance of Series U and V
First Mortgage Bonds totaling $30,000,000, a senior secured term note of
$5,500,000 in United Cities Gas Storage Company, and $8,250,000 of long-term
debt in UCG Energy Corporation. The proceeds of these debt issuances were used
to repay short-term borrowings, finance the company's ongoing construction
program and for other corporate purposes. At December 31, 1994, the company had
bondable property to support a first mortgage bond issuance of approximately
$41,300,000. In connection with the filing of the shelf registration statement,
the company plans to enter into an indenture

         under which the company may issue, without limitation as to
         aggregate principal amount, unsecured notes.
                In 1995, capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities,
         sinking fund requirements and dividend payments are expected to be
         provided by internally generated cash, issuance of stock through the
         company's various stock purchase plans, short-term borrowings and
         issuances of securities under the shelf registration statement.

         REGULATORY MATTERS
                Effective April 1, 1993, the Virginia State Corporation
         Commission issued an order stating that the company's current
         authorized rates in that state be considered interim and subject to
         refund pending an investigation to determine whether the company was
         earning more than its authorized rate of return and whether the
         authorized rate of return at that time was appropriate. In addition,
         the commission staff alleged that the company overcollected gross
         receipts tax from its customers for the years 1988 through mid-1993.
         In an order issued in November, 1994, the commission reduced the
         company's authorized rate of return in Virginia from 11.26% to 10.26%,
         resulting in a reduction in annual revenues of $218,000. This
         reduction was effective April 1, 1993. Excess revenues of
         approximately $370,000, plus interest, collected under interim rates
         through December 31, 1994, are to be refunded to the company's
         customers. In addition, the commission concluded that the company had
         overcollected gross receipts tax from its customers from 1988 through
         mid-1993 and ordered a refund of $301,000, plus interest. The company
         has adequate reserves to cover its liability related to the order.
                In 1991, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered the company
         to refund approximately $260,000 related to the reconciliation of the
         Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) recovery mechanism for 1988. The
         company filed an appeal with the Appellate Court of Illinois which in
         September, 1992, issued a decision upholding the commission's
         decision. The company filed an appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court
         which in September, 1994, upheld the commission's and lower court's
         decision. The company asked for rehearing of this decision which was
         subsequently denied. The company will refund the $260,000, plus
         interest, beginning in 1995 and has adequate reserves to cover its
         liability. 
                Effective February 7, 1995, the company received an annual rate
         increase of $253,000 in the state of South Carolina. The company had
         filed on August 8, 1994, to increase rates by $341,000 on an annual
         basis. 
                On January 27, 1995, the company filed to increase rates on an
         annual basis by $4,200,000 in the state of Kansas. On November 8,
         1994, the company filed to increase rates by $1,100,000 on an annual
         basis in the state of Missouri. The company expects that any increase
         granted in these two states will be effective by the third quarter of
         1995. 
                Effective July, 1993, the Missouri Public Service Commission
         authorized an annual rate increase in the amount of $425,000 in
         Missouri. The company had filed to increase rates by $1,200,000 on an
         annual basis. Effective January 12, 1993, the company received an
         annual rate increase of $915,000 in the state of Kansas. The company
         had filed to increase rates by $6,300,000 on an annual basis.
                Effective November 1, 1992, the company was granted an annual
         rate increase of $1,900,000 in Georgia. This amount included an annual
         increase of $1,475,000 in revenue and a rider for an additional
         $425,000 to be collected in each of the three years after November 1,
         1992, related to the response action costs incurred at a manufactured
         gas plant site. The company had requested an increase of $3,200,000 in
         Georgia. 
                Effective October 1, 1992, the company received an annual rate
         increase of $1,700,000 in the state of Tennessee. The company had
         filed to increase rates by $2,900,000 on an annual basis. As a part of
         a settlement agreement entered into in connection with the rate
         increase, the company agreed to a management audit. The management
         audit report was issued in 1994. Management agreed with a majority of
         the recommendations made by the auditors and a number of
         recommendations are currently in the process of being implemented.
         Other recommendations are being evaluated and may be implemented in
         the future. In April, 1995, the company will report to the Tennessee
         Public Service Commission its progress in addressing the issues raised
         by the auditors. Management does not believe that the implementation
         of the recommendations will have a material effect on the company's
         results of operations or financial condition. 
                In 1990, the company received an order from the Kansas State
         Corporation Commission allowing the company to defer, pending approval
         in rate cases, certain safety-related costs, depreciation on
         safety-related capital expenditures, and carrying charges on the
         total. As of December 31, 1991, costs totaling $1,378,000 and
         $2,706,000 were deferred for the years 1991 and 1990, respectively.
         The Kansas commission approved in rates effective January, 1993,
         deferral and recovery of $949,000 and $1,275,000 related to 1991 and
         1990, respectively. Each of these amounts are being amortized over a
         five year period. The company expensed in 1992 the difference in the
         approved cost and the cost previously deferred. 
                In addition, in 1990 and 1992, the Missouri Public Service
         Commission issued orders allowing the

                               CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                                                                              -

                                                                              - 
                                                                              
company to defer, pending approval in rate cases, similar safety-related
costs. In 1989 through 1992, costs of $833,000 were deferred. After reaching
stipulated agreements in rate proceedings, the company discontinued deferring
these costs and began amortizing $600,000 in 1992 and $233,000 in 1993 over
five year periods.
     The Georgia and Tennessee Public Service Commissions have approved Weather
Normalization Adjustments (WNAs). The WNAs, effective October through May each
year in Georgia and November through April each year in Tennessee, allow the
company to increase the base rate portion of customers' bills when weather is
warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than
normal. The net effect of the WNAs was an increase in revenues of $2,050,000,
$324,000 and $1,038,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
     The company is the owner or previous owner of manufactured gas plant sites
which were used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas.
Manufactured gas was an inexpensive source of fuel for lighting and heating
nationwide. As a result of the gas manufacturing process, certain by-products
and waste materials, including coal-tar, were produced and may have been
accumulated at the plant sites. This was an acceptable and satisfactory process
at the time of operations. Under current environmental protection laws and
regulations, the company may be responsible for response action with respect to
such materials, if response action is necessary.
     The company identified a site in Columbus, Georgia, and along with other
responsible parties, has performed response action. The company's share of
response action costs at this site totaled approximately $1,324,000. Of this
amount, $1,275,000 was requested and approved to be recovered over a three year
period in rates which were effective November, 1992. The approved amount did
not include carrying costs on the deferred balance. The company will request
and expects approval to recover the remaining costs either in its next rate
proceeding in Georgia or as an extension of the rider.
     The company has joined with three other potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) to fund a response investigation and feasibility study of a site in
Keokuk, Iowa. The company has incurred costs totaling $129,000 and has, based
on available current information, accrued an additional $644,000 for its share
of possible response action. The company has deferred $494,000 of the accrued
amount and expects approval for recovery in its next rate proceeding in Iowa.
The company has estimated that it may incur, if certain adverse conditions are
found to exist, an additional $856,000 of response action costs at this site.
     The company owns or may be the successor in interest to the previous owner
of four additional former manufactured gas plant sites. The company is unaware
of any information which suggests that these sites give rise to a present
health or environmental risk as a result of the manufactured gas process or
that any response action will be necessary. Accordingly, the company has not
accrued any liabilities associated with these four sites.
     Pursuant to the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act (the
Act), the company is required to upgrade or remove certain underground storage
tanks (USTs) situated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 1994, the company has
identified eight USTs in this category in Tennessee and has incurred $30,000
and, based on available current information, accrued an additional $70,000 for
the upgrade or removal of these USTs. The company has estimated that it may
incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist, additional costs of up
to $380,000 to bring the sites into compliance with the Act. On October 4,
1994, the Tennessee Public Service Commission granted the company permission to
defer, until its next rate case, all costs incurred in connection with state
and federally mandated environmental control requirements. In addition, the
company may be able to recover a portion of the corrective action costs from
the State of Tennessee Trust Fund for all of the UST sites in Tennessee.
     The company has identified three USTs in Virginia and has, based on
available current information, accrued and deferred for recovery $23,000 as of
December 31, 1994, for the closure of these sites. The company has estimated
that it may incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist, additional
costs of up to $202,000 in responding to these sites. The company expects
recovery of any costs incurred related to the closure of these sites.
     The company has reviewed and commented on a proposed Consent Order from
the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) regarding mercury
contamination at gas pipeline sites. The KDHE has identified the need to
investigate gas industry activities which utilize mercury equipment in Kansas.
The company is cooperating with the KDHE in preparing a Consent Order and a
Work Plan for responding to mercury contamination at any site which is
identified as exceeding the KDHE's established acceptable concentration levels.
As of December 31, 1994, the company has identified approximately 720 meter
sites where mercury may have been used and has incurred $20,000 and, based on
available current information,

         accrued and deferred for recovery an additional $280,000 for
         the investigation of these sites. The company has estimated that it
         may incur an additional amount of up to $4,100,000 over the next seven
         years in responding to a future administration order for those sites,
         if any, that exceed the KDHE's established acceptable concentration
         levels. Based on a recent decision by the Kansas State Corporation
         Commission concerning the recovery of environmental response action
         costs incurred by another company, the company expects to be allowed
         recovery of the costs involved in the investigation and response
         action associated with the mercury meter sites in Kansas.
              Management expects that future expenditures related to response
         action at any site will be recovered through rates or insurance, or
         shared among other PRPs. Therefore, the costs of responding to these
         sites are not expected to materially affect the results of operations
         or financial condition of the company.

         GAS SUPPLY
                In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
         Orders 636, 636-A, and 636-B. These orders required interstate
         pipelines to unbundle or separate gas sales, transportation and
         storage services by the 1993-1994 winter season. The pipeline sales
         services were previously combined and sold as a single service. The
         unbundling of these services has allowed the company more flexibility 
         in selecting and managing the type of services required to provide its 
         customers with the lowest possible priced gas while maintaining 
         reliable gas supply.
                The FERC has permitted pipelines to recover from their
         customers, including the company, the prudently incurred costs of
         implementing these orders, referred to as transition costs. As of
         December 31, 1994 and 1993, based on current pipeline transition cost
         filings with the FERC, the company had accrued and deferred $6,739,000
         and $1,845,000, respectively, as its estimated share of the remaining
         liability related to these transition costs. Because there are
         pipeline requests not yet filed with the FERC, the 1994 estimate may
         differ from the final amount of future transition costs recovered from
         the company. The company has been granted permission through approved
         PGA filings or specific orders in all the states in which it operates
         to recover these transition costs from its customers. 
                The company's pipeline suppliers have liabilities to producers
         for payments under purchase contracts for quantities of gas for which
         deliveries have not been taken. Pipeline suppliers received permission
         from the FERC to recover from their customers, including the company,
         a portion of their take-or-pay liabilities. The company has been
         granted permission in all of the states in which it operates to
         recover from its customers any take-or-pay costs. Total deferred but
         unrecovered take-or-pay costs were $2,415,000 and $2,384,000 as of
         December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         ACQUISITIONS
                During the first quarter of 1995, UCG Energy purchased a 45%
         interest in certain contracts related to the gas marketing
         business of Woodward Marketing, Inc. (WMI), a Texas corporation. In
         exchange for the acquired interest, the shareholders of WMI will
         receive $5,000,000 in the company's common stock, pending regulatory
         approval, and $750,000 in cash and may, if certain earnings targets
         are met, receive an additional payment of $1,000,000 to be paid over a
         five year period. In exchange for its own gas marketing contracts and
         the acquired 45% interest in the WMI gas marketing contracts, UCG
         Energy received a 45% interest in a newly formed limited liability
         company, Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. (WMLLC). WMI received a 55%
         interest in WMLLC in exchange for its remaining 55% interest in the
         WMI gas marketing contracts. WMLLC will provide gas marketing services
         to industrial customers, municipalities and local distribution
         companies. UCG Energy will utilize equity accounting, effective
         January 1, 1995, for the acquisition.
                Effective January 1, 1995, United Cities Propane Gas of
         Tennessee, Inc. (UCPT), a wholly owned subsidiary of UCG Energy,
         purchased substantially all of the assets of Harrell Propane, Inc. for
         approximately $1,383,000. In addition, the subsidiary entered into ten
         year non-compete agreements with the prior owners for $250,000, to be
         paid over an eight year period. This acquisition added approximately
         1,300 propane customers in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee area. 
                Effective April 14, 1994, UCPT purchased all of the assets of
         Hurley's Propane Gas for approximately $938,000. In addition, the
         subsidiary entered into ten year non-compete agreements with the prior
         owners for $100,000, to be paid over a five year period. This
         acquisition added approximately 700 propane customers in the
         Morristown, Tennessee area.
                Effective March 1, 1994, the company purchased the natural gas
         system in Palmyra, Missouri from Western Resources, Inc. for
         approximately $665,000. The company also obtained a ten year
         non-compete agreement. Consideration for the agreement is contingent
         upon volumes sold to a certain industrial customer with payments made
         over a three year period, not to exceed $720,000. The system serves
         approximately 1,400 natural gas customers.

     Effective August 1, 1993, UCPT purchased the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock of High Country Propane, Inc. for $1,600,000, less liabilities
assumed of $820,000. Additionally, the subsidiary obtained a ten year 
non-compete agreement for $100,000, to be paid over a five year period.  This 
acquisition added approximately 1,400 propane customers in the Boone,
North Carolina area.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
     In November, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement No. 112 (SFAS 112), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." This statement, which the company adopted effective January 1, 1994,
requires the company to accrue any obligations which may exist to provide
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. Due to the limited nature of the postemployment benefits provided
by the company, most of which were already being accrued, the implementation of
SFAS 112 did not have a material effect on the company's results of operations
or financial condition.
     In February, 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes." The company adopted SFAS 109 in 1993 and did not
restate prior periods. Implementation of SFAS 109 required conversion to the
liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Lower income tax
rates resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 resulted in excess accumulated
deferred income taxes (ADIT) which are being amortized to reduce tax expense
for accounting and ratemaking purposes. Tax law requires that excess ADIT
related to accelerated depreciation be used to reduce tax expense over the
lives of the related assets. There is no such normalization requirement for
nonregulated excess ADIT and the related deferred tax liability was reversed in
accordance with the new statement. The cumulative increase in net income
resulting from the change in the accounting method for income taxes was
approximately $443,000, and was included in UCG Energy's net income in 1993.
     In December, 1990, the FASB issued Statement No. 106 (SFAS 106),
"Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The
company adopted the statement effective January 1, 1993. The statement requires
the company to record the expected costs of postretirement health and life
insurance benefits during the years the employees render service. This was a
change from the company's previous policy of recognizing these costs on a cash
basis. The annual cash payments for such benefits were $807,000 in 1992. Costs
related to these benefits calculated in accordance with SFAS 106 amounted to
$1,649,000 and $1,331,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The accumulated
benefit obligation of $8,894,000 existing at January 1, 1993, is being
amortized over a twenty year period as allowed by SFAS 106.
      The company has received approval to recover SFAS 106 costs in South
Carolina, Kansas, Iowa and Illinois. The Tennessee commission has approved the
recovery of these costs and is allowing the company to defer the difference
between cash payments and SFAS 106 expense until the next rate proceeding in
that state. The Virginia commission has approved the recovery of SFAS 106 costs
in rates. However, the accumulated benefit obligation will be recovered over
forty years as opposed to the twenty year amortization period allowed by SFAS
106. The Georgia and Missouri commissions did not render decisions on SFAS 106
in the company's last rate proceedings in those states. However, the Missouri
legislature has subsequently passed a statute allowing utilities to recover
SFAS 106 costs. As required by some commissions, the company has established a
trust fund to accumulate the difference between the cash payments for
postretirement benefits and SFAS 106 expense.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AUDIT
      The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently reviewing the company's
consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1993. As of
December 31, 1994, the revenue agent had not issued a report. Management does
not believe that the revenue agent's report, when issued, will contain any
adjustments that will materially affect the results of operations or financial
condition of the company.
       The IRS has reviewed the consolidated federal income tax returns of the
company for the years 1986 through 1990. The company was assessed additional
tax of $3,100,000 and interest of $1,400,000 for the periods reviewed. A
substantial amount of the tax assessments were related to items which were
timing differences. The company will be able to deduct these items in future
periods. Timing differences have no effect on the results of operations of the
company. In 1993, the company expensed the interest related to the tax
assessments.

CONTINGENCIES
       The company was named, along with 26 other defendants, in a class action,
anti-trust case filed March 5, 1993 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Tennessee, Knoxville Division (the Court). This action
involves alleged price-fixing in the 1980s in eastern Tennessee. The Court
denied the plaintiffs' class certification motions, but granted the plaintiffs
the right to pursue individual claims against

         the defendants, including the company. The Tennessee Attorney General
         also filed a motion for class certification on behalf of all
         individuals and businesses in the east Tennessee area. In February,
         1995, the company reached a settlement agreement with the Tennessee
         Attorney General, pending the Court's approval, in the amount of
         $80,000. The settlement agreement includes a provision which allows
         the company to cancel the settlement if 10% or more of the individual
         class members or business class members option out of the settlement
         class. The company has adequate reserves to cover the settlement of
         this case. However, management cannot predict the number, if any, of
         individual claims that may subsequently be filed related to this case.
         In management's opinion, the resolution of any individual claim
         subsequently filed will not have a material effect on the results of
         operations or financial condition of the company. 
                During 1994, the company discovered defects in the polyethylene
         piping installed in certain of its service areas. An independent
         laboratory is conducting a study of the matter at the request of the
         gas industry and the manufacturers. The company also continues to
         conduct its own investigation into the issue. The company is unable to
         predict the extent of the problem or the expense which will be
         incurred to repair the defective piping but anticipates recovering the
         cost from the manufacturers or through the ratemaking process as a
         normal maintenance expense. 
                The company is involved in other legal or administrative
         proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to rates
         and other matters. Although unable to predict the outcome of these
         matters, it is management's opinion that final disposition of these
         proceedings will not have a material effect on the company's results
         of operations or financial condition.

         IMPACT OF INFLATION
                The company experiences the effect of inflation primarily
         through the cost of materials, labor and related employee benefits,
         and services. Since the company can only adjust its rates to recover
         these additional costs in the utility operation through the regulatory
         process, increased costs may have a significant impact on its results
         of operations. Management continually assesses the need to file for
         rate increases in each of the states in which the company operates.
         The company has purchased gas adjustment clauses which permit any
         fluctuations in gas costs to be passed through to its customers,
         subject to prudency and/or administrative reviews by the commissions
         in the states in which the company operates.

         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         CONSOLIDATED COMMON STOCK EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS 
                The company had consolidated common stock earnings of
         $12,093,000 or $1.16 per share in 1994, a decrease of $27,000 or $0.03
         per share from 1993 earnings. Earnings of $12,120,000 or $1.19 per
         share in 1993 represented an increase of $2,016,000 or $0.12 per share
         from 1992. The increase from 1992 to 1993 can be attributed primarily
         to colder weather and rate increases granted.
                The company's annual dividend paid per share was $1.005 in
         1994. Effective with the fourth quarter of 1994, the company increased
         its quarterly dividend rate from $0.25 to $0.255 per share. This
         change increased the anticipated annual dividend rate to $1.02 per
         share.

         OPERATING MARGIN
                Although natural gas volumes decreased because of warmer
         weather in 1994 as compared to 1993, the operating margin of
         $108,016,000 in 1994 represented an increase of $1,517,000 over the
         1993 margin of $106,499,000. The increase in operating margin was a
         result of volumes sold to new residential and commercial customers;
         the additional revenues from certain interruptible customers who did
         not go off the company's system when curtailed during the first
         quarter of 1994; the rate increase effective July, 1993 in Missouri;
         and the Palmyra acquisition in March, 1994. The effect of these
         increases was partially offset by warmer weather in those states where
         rates are not weather normalized. The operating margin increased
         $7,199,000 from 1992 to 1993. The increase was due primarily to
         increased volumes sold as a result of colder weather and rate
         increases in Missouri and Kansas in 1993 and in Tennessee and Georgia
         in 1992.

         OPERATING EXPENSES
                Operations and maintenance expenses increased $382,000 from
         $56,922,000 in 1993 to $57,304,000 in 1994. Operations and maintenance
         expenses also increased from $56,288,000 in 1992 to $56,922,000 in
         1993. The additional expenses in both years were primarily due to
         normal increases in operating expenses, partially offset by a
         reduction in medical expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense
         increased $830,000 in 1994 and $1,416,000 in 1993 from the prior year
         periods primarily due to additional plant in service.

INTEREST
      Interest expense decreased from $15,048,000 in 1993 to $14,087,000 in
1994. Interest on long-term debt decreased $405,000 due to the retirement of
long-term debt. Other interest charges decreased $556,000 primarily because of
the 1993 assessment of interest related to the settlement of the Internal
Revenue Service Audit for the years 1986 through 1990, partially offset by
increased interest on short-term debt during 1994.
      Interest on long-term debt increased $1,023,000 in 1993 from 1992 due to
interest on Series U and V First Mortgage Bonds issued in 1992, partially
offset by the retirement of other long-term debt. Other interest charges
increased $1,326,000 in 1993 primarily because of the assessment of interest
related to the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service Audit.

SUBSIDIARY OPERATIONS
      Subsidiary operations contributed 35.4%, 35.0% and 42.0% of the company's
common stock earnings in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The following is a
discussion of the results of operations of the company's subsidiaries, UCG
Energy Corporation and United Cities Gas Storage Company.

UCG ENERGY CORPORATION
      Revenues decreased from $38,909,000 in 1993 to $38,383,000 in 1994
primarily due to a decrease in gas brokerage sales to municipalities,
industrial and other customers and secondarily, a decrease in the sale of
energy-related products in the Utility Services Division. This decrease was
partially offset by an increase in revenues in the Propane Division generated
by additional wholesale volumes sold as well as additional volumes sold
resulting from the acquisitions of Hurley's Propane Gas in April, 1994, and
High Country Propane, Inc. in August, 1993. The Rental Division had a moderate
decrease in revenues due to lower rental rates on certain rental units in
service.
      Revenues increased from $32,483,000 in 1992 to $38,909,000 in 1993
primarily due to an increase in gas brokerage sales to municipalities,
industrial and other customers by the Utility Services Division. The Rental
Division had a moderate increase in revenues on additional rental units placed
into service. Revenues in the Propane Division increased as a result of
additional volumes sold due to colder weather and the acquisition of High
Country Propane, Inc., as well as increased prices on volumes sold.
      Operating expenses decreased from $28,784,000 in 1993 to $27,986,000 in
1994. This $798,000 decrease can largely be attributed to the decrease in the
cost of sales as a result of reduced sales in the Utility Services Division.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cost of sales in the
Propane Division on additional wholesale volumes sold, as well as additional
volumes sold due to the acquisitions of Hurley's Propane Gas and High Country
Propane, Inc. Operating expenses increased from $22,360,000 in 1992 to 
$28,784,000 in 1993. This increase was generally due to the cost of additional
gas brokerage sales in the Utility Services Division. The increase in 
operating expenses in the Propane Division was a combination of additional 
volumes sold, an increase in the wholesale cost of those volumes and the 
acquisition of High Country Propane, Inc.
      Interest expense decreased from $1,049,000 in 1993 to $773,000 in 1994.
This decrease was primarily the result of the assessment of interest related to
the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service Audit which occurred in 1993. In
addition, long-term interest expense decreased in all divisions due to the
retirement of certain long-term debt. Interest expense increased from $882,000
in 1992 to $1,049,000 in 1993 principally due to the assessment of interest
related to the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service Audit.
      A decision to discontinue the distribution of energy-related products by
the Utility Services Division was made by management in June, 1994. The
discontinuance of this activity is not expected to materially affect the
results of operations or financial condition of the company and is expected to
be completed by mid-1995.
      Net income for UCG Energy was $3,750,000, $3,775,000 and $3,681,000 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

UNITED CITIES GAS STORAGE COMPANY
      United Cities Gas Storage Company's net income increased from $468,000 in
1993 to $526,000 in 1994. The $58,000 increase was primarily a result of
increased revenues for storage services provided primarily to the utility
company, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Net income was
$468,000 in 1993 compared to $558,000 in 1992. The decrease in income from 1992
to 1993 was primarily a result of increased operating and depreciation
expenses.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION--
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United
Cities Gas Company (Cities) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company).
The operations of UCG Energy Corporation (UCG Energy) and United Cities Gas
Storage Company (UCG Storage), wholly-owned subsidiaries of Cities, shown in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, include affiliated revenues of
$13,565,000, $15,930,000, and $14,937,000 for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.
     The affiliated revenues of UCG Energy represent rental charges to Cities
for transportation equipment and office facilities and the sale of gas-related
equipment to Cities. The affiliated revenues for UCG Storage consist of charges
for natural gas storage services and natural gas sales to Cities. In
management's opinion, such intercompany charges compare favorably with terms
which Cities could obtain from other sources under comparable conditions.

SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS--
     Cities is a public utility which distributes natural gas in Tennessee,
Kansas, Georgia, Virginia, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and South Carolina. Cities
is subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory
authorities in the states in which it operates. The utility financial
statements are based on generally accepted accounting principles which give
appropriate recognition to the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies
of the various regulatory commissions.

UTILITY PLANT--
     Utility plant is stated at the historical cost of construction.Such costs
include direct construction costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and
other fringe benefits), administrative and general costs, and the estimated
cost of allowance for funds used during construction.The estimated cost of
allowance for funds is as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                                        <C>      <C>      <C>
Debt portion of the cost of funds......................................................    5.7%     5.9%     7.3%
Equity portion of the cost of funds....................................................    3.5%     2.0%     2.0%
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total..................................................................................    9.2%     7.9%     9.3%
=================================================================================================================
</TABLE>


     The debt portion of the cost of funds is reflected as a credit to "Other
interest charges" in the amounts of $183,000, $246,000 and $323,000 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively. The equity portion of the cost of funds is
reflected in "Other income (expense), net" in the amounts of $111,000, $81,000
and $92,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE--
     Depreciation is provided in the accounts based on straight-line composite
rates of 3.4%, 3.6% and 3.5% of the cost of depreciable utility plant in
service in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Cities follows the practice of charging to maintenance the cost of normal
repairs of property and the replacements and renewals of items considered to be
less than units of property. Replacements and renewals of items considered to
be units of property are charged to utility plant accounts, and units of
property replaced or retired are credited to the utility plant accounts and
charged to accumulated depreciation.

CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES AND OPERATING REVENUES--
     The company is primarily engaged in the distribution and sale of natural
and propane gas to a diverse base of residential, commercial and industrial
customers in 44 operating areas in the states of Tennessee, Kansas, Georgia,
Virginia, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, South Carolina and North Carolina.
     Cities' operating revenues are based on rates approved by the regulatory
commissions in the states in which it operates. Cities follows the practice of
accruing for services rendered but unbilled at the end of the accounting
period.
     The Georgia and Tennessee Public Service Commissions have approved the
implementation of Weather Normalization Adjustments (WNAs). The WNAs, effective
October through May each year in Georgia and November through April each year
in Tennessee, allow the company to increase the base rate portion of customers'
bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when
weather is colder than normal. The net effect of the WNAs was an increase in
revenues of $2,050,000, $324,000 and $1,038,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

REFUNDABLE OR RECOVERABLE GAS COSTS--
     Refunds from pipeline suppliers and changes in cost of gas delivered to
customers which are different from the amounts recovered through rates, are
deferred and are being refunded or recovered in accordance with procedures
approved by the state commissions.

INVENTORIES--
     Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies and gas in
storage.  Materials and supplies include merchandise and appliances and are
valued at average cost.
     Cities' liquefied natural gas and propane inventories and gas stored
underground are valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Propane owned by UCG
Energy is priced at average cost.  Gas stored underground and owned by UCG
Storage is valued on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. In accordance with 
Cities' Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses, the liquidation of a LIFO
layer would be reflected in subsequent gas adjustments in customer rates and 
does not affect the results of operations.

     The categories of current gas in storage are as follows:

==============================================================================================================
</TABLE>

EARNINGS PER SHARE--
     Primary earnings per share have been computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Fully
diluted earnings per share for 1993 and 1992 give effect to conversion of the
11 1/2% Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preference Stock. Fully diluted
earnings per share are not materially different from primary earnings per
share.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS--
     The carrying amounts of cash and temporary investments, short-term debt
and accrued interest approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of
these items. Based on the current market rates offered for similar debt of the
same maturities, the fair value of the company's long-term debt, including the
current portion, exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $5,300,000 and
$37,000,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Management believes
that the prepayment provisions of the company's first mortgage bonds do not
make it economically feasible to refinance the long-term debt at this time.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS--
     For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, the company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

RECLASSIFICATIONS--
     Certain reclassifications were made conforming prior years' financial
statements with 1994 financial statement presentation.

REGULATORY MATTERS
     Effective April 1, 1993, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued
an order stating that Cities' current authorized rates in that state be
considered interim and subject to refund pending an investigation to determine
whether Cities was earning more than its authorized rate of return and whether
the authorized rate of return at that time was appropriate.  In addition, the
commission staff alleged that Cities overcollected gross receipts tax from its
customers for the years 1988 through mid-1993. In an order issued in November,
1994, the commission reduced Cities' authorized rate of return in Virginia 
from 11.26% to 10.26%, resulting in a reduction in annual revenues of 
$218,000.  This reduction was effective April 1, 1993.  Excess revenues of 
approximately $370,000, plus interest, collected under interim rates through 
December 31, 1994, are to be refunded to Cities' customers.  In addition, the 
commission concluded that Cities had overcollected gross receipts tax from its 
customers from 1988 through mid-1993 and ordered the refund of $301,000, plus 
interest. Cities has adequate reserves to cover its liability related to the 
order.

     In 1991, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered Cities to refund
approximately $260,000 related to the reconciliation of the PGA recovery
mechanism for 1988. Cities filed an appeal with the Appellate Court of Illinois
which in September, 1992, issued a decision upholding the commission's
decision.  Cities filed an appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court which in
September, 1994, upheld the commission's and lower court's decision.  Cities
asked for rehearing of this decision which was subsequently denied.  Cities will
refund the $260,000, plus interest, beginning in 1995 and has adequate reserves
to cover its liability. 
     As a part of a settlement agreement in the 1992 rate proceeding in 
Tennessee, Cities agreed to a management audit.  The management audit report 
was issued in 1994. Management agreed with a majority of the recommendations 
made by the auditors and a number of recommendations are currently in the 
process of being implemented. Other recommendations are being evaluated and 
may be implemented in the future.  In April, 1995, Cities will report to the 
Tennessee Public Service Commission its progress in addressing the issues 
raised by the auditors.  Management does not believe that the implementation 
of the recommendations will have a material effect on the company's results 
of operations or financial condition.  
     In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Orders 
636, 636-A and 636-B.  These orders required interstate pipelines to unbundle 
or separate gas sales, transportation and storage services by the 1993-1994 
winter season.  The pipelines sales services were previously combined and sold 
as a single service.  The FERC has permitted pipelines to recover from their 
customers, including Cities, the prudently incurred costs of implementing 
these orders, referred to as transition costs.  As of December 31, 1994 and 
1993, based on current pipeline transition cost filings with the FERC, Cities 
had accrued and deferred $6,739,000 and $1,845,000, respectively, as its 
estimated share of the remaining liability related to these transition costs. 
Because there are pipeline requests not yet filed with the FERC, the 1994 
estimate may differ from the final amount of future transition costs recovered 
from Cities.  These estimated amounts are included as a liability in "Accounts 
payable for gas costs" and as a regulatory asset in "Gas costs to be billed in 
the future."  Cities has been granted permission through approved PGA filings 
or specific orders in all the states in which it operates to recover these 
transition costs from its customers. 
     Cities' pipeline suppliers have liabilities to producers for payments 
under purchase contracts for quantities of gas for which deliveries have not 
been taken.  Pipeline suppliers received permission from the FERC to recover 
from its customers, including Cities, a portion of their take-or-pay 
liabilities.  Cities has been granted permission in all of the states in which 
it operates to recover from its customers any take-or-pay costs.  Total 
deferred but unrecovered take-or-pay costs were $2,415,000 and $2,384,000 as 
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These amounts are included as a 
regulatory asset in "Gas costs to be billed in the future." 
     In 1990, Cities received an order from the Kansas State Corporation 
Commission allowing Cities to defer, pending approval in rates cases, certain
safety-related costs, depreciation on safety-related capital expenditures, and
carrying charges on the total.  As of December 31, 1991, costs totaling
$1,378,000 and $2,706,000 were deferred for the years 1991 and 1990,
respectively.  The Kansas commission approved in rates effective January, 1993,
deferral and recovery of $949,000 and $1,275,000 related to 1991 and 1990,
respectively.  Each of these amounts are being amortized over a five year
period.  The difference in the approved cost and the cost previously deferred 
was expensed in 1992. 
     In addition, in 1990 and 1992, the Missouri Public Service Commission 
issued orders allowing Cities to defer, pending approval in rate cases, 
similar safety-related costs.  In 1989 through 1992, costs of $833,000 were 
deferred. After reaching stipulated agreements in rate proceedings, Cities
discontinued deferring these costs and began amortizing $600,000 in 1992 and
$233,000 in 1993 over five year periods.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION--
     The company has a trusteed noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
which covers substantially all full-time employees.  The plan provides benefits
based on years of credited service and final average salary.  The plan assets
consist principally of marketable equity securities, corporate and government
debt securities, and deposits with insurance companies.  The company's policy is
to fund the plan in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act.
     Actuarial assumptions used for the plan are as follows:

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS--
     The company provides postretirement health care benefits and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all of the company's
employees will become eligible for those benefits if they reach the normal
retirement age while working for the company. Effective January 1, 1993, the
company made certain revisions to its postretirement benefits plan which limit
the company's contributions to the plan for employees retiring after December
31, 1997.
     In December, 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement No. 106 (SFAS 106), "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions." The company adopted the statement effective
January 1, 1993.  The statement requires the company to record the expected
costs of postretirement health and life insurance benefits during the years the
employees render service.  This was a change from the company's previous policy
of recognizing  these costs on a cash basis.  The annual cash payments for such
benefits were $807,000 in 1992. Net periodic postretirement benefit expense for
the company's plan in fiscal 1994 and 1993 consists of the following components:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        
</TABLE>

     For measurement purposes, a 12% and 15% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1994 and 1993,
respectively. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.5% over twelve
years and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To illustrate,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 1994 by $1,019,000 and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the
year ended by $83,000.
     Cities has received approval to recover SFAS 106 costs in South Carolina,
Kansas, Iowa and Illinois. The Tennessee commission has approved the recovery of
these costs and is allowing Cities to defer the difference between cash
payments and SFAS 106 expense until the next rate proceeding in that state. The
Virginia commission has approved the recovery of SFAS 106 costs in rates.
However, the accumulated benefit obligation will be recovered over forty years
as opposed to the twenty year amortization period allowed by SFAS 106. The
Georgia and Missouri commissions did not render decisions on SFAS 106 in Cities'
recent rate proceedings in those states. However, the Missouri legislature has
subsequently passed a statute allowing utilities to recover SFAS 106 costs. As
required by some commissions, Cities has established a trust fund to accumulate
the difference between the cash payments for postretirement benefits and
SFAS 106 expense.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER--
     In November, 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 112 (SFAS 112),
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." This statement, which the
company adopted effective January 1, 1994, requires the company to accrue any
obligations which may exist to provide benefits to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement. Due to the limited nature of the
postemployment benefits provided by the company, most of which were already
being accrued, the implementation of SFAS 112 did not have a material effect on
the company's results of operations or financial condition.
   The company's 401(k) savings plan allows participants to make contributions
toward retirement savings. Each participant may contribute up to 15% of
qualified compensation. For employee contributions up to 6% of the
participant's qualified compensation, the company will contribute 30% of the
employee's contribution. The company may also contribute up to an additional
20% of the employee's contribution based on certain criteria specified in the
plan.

</TABLE>

     Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the average life of
the property which gave rise to the credits.
     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently reviewing the company's
consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1991 through 1993. As of
December 31, 1994, the revenue agent had not issued a report. Management does
not believe that the revenue agent's report, when issued, will contain any
adjustments that will materially affect the results of operations or financial
condition of the company.
     The IRS has reviewed the consolidated federal income tax returns of the
company for the years 1986 through 1990. The company was assessed additional
tax of $3,100,000 and interest of $1,400,000 for the periods reviewed. A
substantial amount of the tax assessments were related to items which were
timing differences. The company will be able to deduct these items in future
periods. Timing differences have no effect on the results of operations of the
company. In 1993, the company expensed the interest related to the tax
assessments.
     In February, 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes." The company adopted SFAS 109 in 1993 and did not
restate prior periods. Implementation of SFAS 109 required conversion to the
liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Lower income tax
rates resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 resulted in excess accumulated
deferred income taxes (ADIT) which are being amortized to reduce tax expense
for accounting and ratemaking purposes. Tax law requires that excess ADIT
related to accelerated depreciation be used to reduce tax expense over the
lives of the related assets. There is no such normalization requirement for
nonregulated excess ADIT and the related deferred tax liability was reversed in
accordance with the new statement. The cumulative increase in net income
resulting from the change in the accounting method for income taxes was
approximately $443,000, and was included in UCG Energy's net income in 1993.


ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
     Cities is the owner or previous owner of manufactured gas plant sites
which were used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas.
Manufactured gas was an inexpensive source of fuel for lighting and heating
nationwide. As a result of the gas manufacturing process, certain by-products
and waste materials, including coal-tar, were produced and may have been
accumulated at the plant sites. This was an acceptable and satisfactory process
at the time of operations. Under current environmental protection laws and
regulations, Cities may be responsible for response action with respect to such
materials, if response action is necessary. 
        Cities identified a site in Columbus, Georgia, and along with other
responsible parties, has performed response action. Cities' share of response
action costs at this site totaled approximately $1,324,000. Of this amount,
$1,275,000 was requested and approved to be recovered over a three year period
in rates which were effective November, 1992. The approved amount did not
include carrying costs on the deferred balance. Cities will request and expects
approval to recover the remaining costs either in its next rate proceeding in
Georgia or as an extension of the rider. 
        Cities has joined with three other potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) to fund a response investigation and feasibility study of a site in
Keokuk, Iowa. Cities has incurred costs totaling $129,000 and has, based on
available current information, accrued an additional $644,000 for its share of
possible response action. Cities has deferred $494,000 of the accrued amount and
expects approval for recovery in its next rate proceeding in Iowa. Cities has
estimated that it may incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist,
an additional $856,000 of response action costs at this site.

        Cities owns or may be the successor in interest to the previous owner
of four additional former manufactured gas plant sites. Cities is unaware of
any information which suggests that these sites give rise to a present health
or environmental risk as a result of the manufactured gas process or that any
response action will be necessary. Accordingly, Cities has not accrued any
liabilities associated with these four sites. 
        Pursuant to the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act (the
Act), Cities is required to upgrade or remove certain underground storage tanks
(USTs) situated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 1994, Cities has identified
eight USTs in this category in Tennessee and has incurred $30,000 and, based on
available current information, accrued an additional $70,000 for the upgrade or
removal of these USTs. Cities has estimated that it may incur, if certain
adverse conditions are found to exist, additional costs of up to $380,000 to
bring the sites into compliance with the Act. On October 4, 1994, the Tennessee
Public Service Commission granted Cities permission to defer, until its next
rate case, all costs incurred in connection with state and federally mandated
environmental control requirements. In addition, Cities may be able to recover
a portion of the corrective action costs from the State of Tennessee Trust Fund
for all of the UST sites in Tennessee. 
        Cities has identified three USTs in Virginia and has, based on
available current information, accrued and deferred for recovery $23,000 as of
December 31, 1994, for the closure of these sites. Cities has estimated that it
may incur, if certain adverse conditions are found to exist, additional costs
of up to $202,000 in responding to these sites. Cities expects recovery of any
costs incurred related to the closure of these sites. 
        Cities has reviewed and commented on a proposed Consent Order from the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) regarding mercury
contamination at gas pipeline sites. The KDHE has identified the need to
investigate gas industry activities which utilize mercury equipment in Kansas.
Cities is cooperating with the KDHE in preparing a Consent Order and a Work
Plan for responding to mercury contamination at any site which is identified as
exceeding the KDHE's established acceptable concentration levels. As of
December 31, 1994, Cities has identified approximately 720 meter sites where
mercury may have been used and has incurred $20,000 and, based on available
current information, accrued and deferred for recovery an additional $280,000
for the investigation of these sites. Cities has estimated that it may incur an
additional amount of up to $4,100,000 over the next seven years in responding
to a future administrative order for those sites, if any, that exceed the
KDHE's established acceptable concentration levels. Based on a recent decision
by the Kansas State Corporation Commission concerning the recovery of
environmental response action costs incurred by another company, Cities expects
recovery of the costs involved in the investigation and response action
associated with the mercury meter sites in Kansas. 
        Management expects that future expenditures related to response action
at any site will be recovered through rates or insurance, or shared among other
PRPs. Therefore, the costs of responding to these sites are not expected to
materially affect the results of operations or financial condition of the
company.


CAPITAL STOCK

11 1/2% CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE STOCK--
     The Preference Stock was convertible to common stock at the option of the
holder at $7.00 per common share and contained a redemption feature. During
1993, 5,307 shares of the Preference Stock were converted into 75,777 shares of
common stock. Of the 6,364 shares of Preference Stock outstanding at December
31, 1992, the remaining 1,057 shares that were not converted into common stock
were redeemed at $100 per share in mid-1993.


COMMON STOCK--
     As of December 31, 1994, the company had 800,097 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the company's employee and customer stock purchase
plans, the company's dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, the
company's 401(k) savings plan, and the company's long-term stock plan of 1989.


ACQUISITIONS
     Effective April 14, 1994, United Cities Propane Gas of Tennessee, Inc.
(UCPT), a wholly owned subsidiary of UCG Energy, purchased all of the assets of
Hurley's Propane Gas for approximately $938,000. In addition, the subsidiary
entered into ten year non-compete agreements with the prior owners for
$100,000, to be paid over a five year period. This acquisition added
approximately 700 propane customers in the Morristown, Tennessee area.

     Effective March 1, 1994, the company purchased the natural gas system in
Palmyra, Missouri from Western Resources, Inc. for approximately $665,000. The
company also obtained a ten year non-compete agreement. Consideration for the
agreement is contingent upon volumes sold to a certain industrial customer with
payments made over a three year period, not to exceed $720,000. The system
serves approximately 1,400 natural gas customers.
     Effective August 1, 1993, UCPT purchased the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock of High Country Propane, Inc. for $1,600,000, less liabilities
assumed of $820,000. Additionally, the subsidiary obtained a ten year
non-compete agreement for $100,000, to be paid over a five year period. This
acquisition added approximately 1,400 propane customers in the Boone, North
Carolina area.


LONG-TERM DEBT
     The company's mortgage dated as of July 15, 1959, as amended and
supplemented, securing the first mortgage bonds issued by the company
constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of Cities' fixed property
and franchises. The company was in compliance with the requirements of its
indentures during 1994. The company's senior secured storage term notes bear
interest at a rate of 8.67% and are secured by storage plant assets. The
weighted-average interest rate of the company's other long-term debt was
approximately 7.30% at December 31, 1994. Annual maturities and sinking fund
requirements of the company's First Mortgage Bonds and other long-term debt for
the years 1995 through 1999 are $6,068,000, $8,609,000, $9,994,000, $6,994,000
and $7,119,000, respectively.


INTERIM FINANCING
     The company has arrangements with several banks which provide, through
mid-1995, a total line of credit of $84,000,000 in the form of master and
banker's acceptance notes bearing interest primarily at the lesser of the prime
rate or a negotiated rate during the term of each borrowing. Under these
arrangements at December 31, 1994 and 1993, the company had short-term debt
outstanding of $46,188,000 and $22,863,000, respectively, with a
weighted-average interest rate of 6.60% and 4.07%, respectively.


COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
     The company was named, along with 26 other defendants, in a class action,
anti-trust case filed March 5, 1993 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Tennessee, Knoxville Division (the Court). This action
involves alleged price-fixing in the 1980's in eastern Tennessee. The Court
denied the plaintiffs' class certification motions, but granted the plaintiffs
the right to pursue individual claims against the defendants, including the
company. The Tennessee Attorney General also filed a motion for class
certification on behalf of all individuals and businesses in the east Tennessee
area. In February, 1995, the company reached a settlement agreement with the
Tennessee Attorney General, pending the Court's approval, in the amount of
$80,000. The settlement agreement includes a provision which allows the company
to cancel the settlement if 10% or more of the individual class members or
business class members option out of the settlement class. The company has
adequate reserves to cover the settlement of this case. However, management
cannot predict the number, if any, of individual claims that may subsequently
be filed related to this case. In management's opinion, the resolution of any
individual claim subsequently filed will not have a material effect on the
results of operations or financial condition of the company. 
        During 1994, Cities discovered defects in the polyethylene piping
installed in certain of its service areas. Cities has notified both the
manufacturers of the defective piping and the state regulatory commissions in
such service areas. An independent laboratory is conducting a study of the
matter at the request of the gas industry and the manufacturers. Cities also
continues to conduct its own investigation into the issue. Cities is unable to
predict the extent of the problem or the expense which will be incurred to
repair the defective piping but anticipates recovering the cost from the
manufacturers or through the ratemaking process as a normal maintenance
expense. 
        The company is involved in other legal or administrative proceedings
before various courts and agencies with respect to rates and other matters.
Although unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it is management's
opinion that final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material
effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)
     During the first quarter of 1995, UCG Energy purchased a 45% interest in
certain contracts related to the gas marketing business of Woodward Marketing,
Inc. (WMI), a Texas corporation. In exchange for the acquired interest, the
shareholders of WMI will receive $5,000,000 in the company's common stock,
pending regulatory approval, and $750,000 in cash and may, if certain earnings
targets are met, receive an additional payment of $1,000,000 to be paid over a
five year period. In exchange for its own gas marketing contracts and the
acquired 45% interest in the WMI gas marketing contracts, UCG Energy received a
45% interest in a newly formed limited liability company, Woodward Marketing,
L.L.C. (WMLLC). WMI received a 55% interest in WMLLC in exchange for its
remaining 55% interest in the WMI gas marketing contracts. WMLLC will provide
gas marketing services to industrial customers, municipalities and local
distribution companies. UCG Energy will utilize equity accounting, effective
January 1, 1995, for the acquisition. 
        Effective January 1, 1995, UCPT purchased substantially all of the
assets of Harrell Propane, Inc. for approximately $1,383,000. In addition, the
subsidiary entered into ten year non-compete agreements with the prior owners
for $250,000, to be paid over an eight year period. This acquisition added
approximately 1,300 propane customers in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee area.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of United Cities Gas Company:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of United Cities Gas Company (an
Illinois corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, capital
surplus and common stock and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United
Cities Gas Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
     As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To United Cities Gas Company:

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements of United Cities Gas Company and subsidiaries
included in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February
16, 1995.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in the index
are the responsibility of the Company's management and are presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
are not part of the basic financial statements.  These schedules have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects
the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

                      ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
                                      
                               JANUARY 1, 1989
                                      
                    REVISED AND RESTATED JANUARY 1 , 1994
                                      
              (ALL CHANGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN BOLD AND ITALICS.)

SECTION 1:   PURPOSE

   The purpose of the plan is to recognize and reward key employees for their
contributions to the ongoing success of United Cities Gas Company through the
payment of INCENTIVE compensation, in addition to their base salaries, for the
achievement of financial and operating objectives during the year.

SECTION 2:   GENERAL DESCRIPTION

   Key executives and managers are selected each year for participation in the
Annual Incentive Compensation Plan.  Selection is based on the individual's
ability to have a significant impact on the performance of United Cities Gas
Company.  At the time of selection, an eligibility level and "target" incentive
award range is identified for each participant.  The targeted incentive award
range varies based on the participant's level in the organization and impact on
the company.

   Annual incentive awards will be based on performance against preestablished
performance measures. Each participant's incentive award will be based on
performance, measured by NO FEWER THAN 3 AND NO MORE THAN 6 specific
performance measures.  No incentive awards will be paid, regardless of the
performance against these performance measures, unless United Cities Gas
Company RETURN ON THE AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AT THE END OF THE PRIOR
YEAR, equals or exceeds the established THRESHOLD for the year.

   Awards will be paid in cash OR RESTRICTED STOCK BY MARCH 15, FOLLOWING the
end of the plan year.  The plan allows voluntary deferrals of cash awards to
the extent permitted under ERISA rules applicable to nonqualified deferred
compensation plans.


SECTION 3:   EFFECTIVE DATE AND PLAN YEAR

   The PLAN WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED as of January 1, 1989, WITH THE FIRST PLAN
YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1989.  A NEW "PLAN YEAR" COMMENCES EACH SUCCEEDING
JANUARY 1 THROUGH DECEMBER 31.


<PAGE>   2
                                                                               2


SECTION 4:   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

   Key employees will be selected for participation annually at the beginning
of the plan year, based on the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer.
Selection for participation in one year does not guarantee selection in
following years.  Participants will be notified OF THEIR PARTICIPATION, THEIR
INCENTIVE AWARD OPPORTUNITY (RANGE), AND THE PERFORMANCE RESULTS THAT MUST BE
ACHIEVED TO EARN AN AWARD, AS SOON AS PRACTICAL AFTER the commencement of the
plan year.  Participation in the plan shall be neither a contract for nor a
guarantee of continued employment of the participant.

   Employees hired OR PROMOTED AFTER THE BEGINNING OF A PLAN YEAR, who would
otherwise be eligible, may be eligible for participation in their year of hire
OR PROMOTION with the approval of the Chief Executive Officer.  NEW EMPLOYEES
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND EMPLOYEES PROMOTED TO OR DEMOTED FROM POSITIONS WHICH ARE
ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION, WHO ARE NOT PARTICIPANTS FOR THE FULL YEAR, WILL
RECEIVE A PRORATED AWARD BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS OF PARTICIPATION.


SECTION 5:   INCENTIVE AWARD LEVELS

   Incentive awards are expressed as a percentage of base salary AS STATED ON
JANUARY 1 OF EACH PLAN YEAR.  For each eligibility level, a target incentive
award is established.  Actual awards will vary above or below the target
awards, based on performance above or below the targeted levels.  A threshold
and maximum award are also established for each eligibility level.

   Attachment A identifies the four eligibility levels.  These LEVELS may be
increased or decreased in future plan years, with the approval of THE
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF  the Board of Directors.


SECTION 6:   PERFORMANCE MEASURES

   The performance measures used in this Plan have been defined and will be the
basis for measuring the performance of the individuals in the plan.  In
general, participants will be measured by no fewer than 3 and no more than 6
specific performance measures.  PERFORMANCE MEASURES WILL REFLECT THE OVERALL
OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANIZATION (COMPANY, DIVISION OR TOWN), AS WELL AS THE
INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE RESULT.  The total weight of the
performance measure allocated to each participant shall be 100%.  The
performance measures and their weightings may be changed on a year-to-year
basis to reflect organizational and business strategy changes.  Attachment B
illustrates the allocation and weighting of the performance measures among the
participants.

   These performance measures provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the
COMPANY'S performance results at the Corporate, Division, and Town levels.
Attachment C contains the performance measure definitions for the plan.

SECTION 7:   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

   For each performance measure, an appropriate range OF PERFORMANCE (standard)
is established.  For each level of performance, a specific incentive award is
established for that performance measure.  The key performance points are AS
FOLLOWS:

   (a)   Threshold Performance -- That minimum performance level for each
measure below which no incentive award will be earned.  Performance at this
level will earn the minimum incentive award.

   (b)   Target Performance -- That level of performance chosen by management
each year as the desired and expected level of performance, based upon the
annual budget plans and normal business conditions.  The target performance
shall be set at a challenging but realistically achievable level.  The target
incentive award is paid for performance at this level.

   (c)   Maximum Expected Performance -- That level of performance which, based
upon historical performance and management judgment, would be exceptional or
significantly beyond the expected.  Performance at and above this level will
earn the maximum incentive award.

   A portion of the incentive award will be earned for each level of
performance result achieved within this range.  Participants will be notified
of these performance standards AS SOON AS PRACTICAL AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF
THE PLAN YEAR.  ATTACHMENT D ILLUSTRATES THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE PLAN
YEAR.

   Actual performance results may be adjusted to eliminate the effect of
extraordinary items (both positive and negative) that are not reflective of the
true performance of the company.

SECTION 8:   COMPUTATION OF AWARDS

                 No incentive awards will be earned, regardless of the
         individual's performance, unless the company's RETURN ON AVERAGE
         SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AT THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR equals or exceeds
         the established THRESHOLD for the year.  THE PLAN ACTIVATION THRESHOLD
         FOR 1994 IS REACHED WHEN THE COMPANY'S RETURN ON AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS'
         EQUITY FOR 1994 EQUALS 9.75% BASED ON THE AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
         FOR THE PRIOR YEAR BY TAKING THE SUM OF THE SHAREHOLDER' EQUITY AT THE
         BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THE END OF THE YEAR AND DIVIDING BY TWO.
         IF THE THRESHOLD IS MET, COMPUTATION OF AWARDS IS BASED ON EACH
         INDIVIDUAL'S PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THE RESULTS ACHIEVED.  THE
         INCENTIVE AWARD COMPUTED FOR DIVISION PARTICIPANTS USING THE
         DIVISIONAL RETURN ON EQUITY PERFORMANCE MEASURE WILL BE MULTIPLED BY A
         MULTIPLIER BASED ON CORPORATE PERFORMANCE RESULTS.  ATTACHMENT E
         ILLUSTRATES THE COMPUTATION OF AWARDS.

                                                                               4


SECTION 9:   PAYMENT OF AWARDS

   The annual incentive awards will be determined AFTER the end of the plan 
year and paid as soon as practical, but BEFORE MARCH 15 OF THE YEAR FOLLOWING 
THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.  Awards are not considered earned or vested until 
they are paid.  Unless otherwise specified, a participant must be employed ON 
THE DATE OF PAYMENT in order to receive an incentive award.  Awards under the 
plan cannot be assigned.

   Incentive awards will be computed based on the participant's base salary AS
STATED ON JANUARY 1 of the plan year.  Incentive awards for participants hired,
PROMOTED, OR DEMOTED, after the beginning of the plan year, will be one-twelfth
of the applicable incentive compensation award for each full month of
PARTICIPATION during the year based on the participant's base salary AS STATED
ON JANUARY 1 OF THE PLAN YEAR.  EMPLOYEES HIRED OR PROMOTED BEFORE THE 15TH OF
A GIVEN MONTH WILL BE CREDITED WITH A FULL MONTH OF PARTICIPATION.  EMPLOYEES
HIRED OR PROMOTED AFTER THE 15TH WILL NOT BE CREDITED FOR PARTICIPATION DURING
THEIR MONTH OF HIRE OR PROMOTION.  EMPLOYEES DEMOTED FROM AN ELIGIBLE POSITION
BEFORE THE 15TH OF A GIVEN MONTH WILL NOT BE CREDITED WITH A FULL MONTH OF
PARTICIPATION.  EMPLOYEES DEMOTED FROM AN ELIGIBLE POSITION AFTER THE 15TH WILL
BE CREDITED FOR PARTICIPATION DURING THE MONTH OF DEMOTION.

   If a participant retires, OR becomes disabled during a plan year, THE
PARTICIPANT'S annual incentive awards will be based on one-twelfth of the
annual incentive compensation award of the applicable year for each full month
of employment during the year.  If a participant dies during a plan year, the
annual incentive award payable shall be determined by the Compensation
Committee and paid to the estate or beneficiaries of the participant.

SECTION 10:  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

   IN ANY PLAN YEAR IN WHICH THE TOTAL INCENTIVE AWARD EXCEEDS THE TARGET AWARD
LEVEL, ALL AMOUNTS ABOVE THE OVERALL TARGET LEVEL WILL BE PAID IN THE FORM OF
RESTRICTED STOCK FOR OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY (17 INDIVIDUALS IN 1994).  THE
NUMBER OF SHARES WILL BE BASED ON THE STOCK PRICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAN
YEAR (PRECEDING 30 DAY AVERAGE), AND THE RESTRICTION PERIOD WILL BE THREE
YEARS.  AT THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PERIOD, ALL RESTRICTIONS (RELATING TO
TRANSFERABILITY OF THE SHARES) WILL LAPSE SO LONG AS THE OFFICER HAS BEEN
CONTINUOUSLY EMPLOYED DURING THE THREE YEAR RESTRICTION PERIOD.  IF THE OFFICER
IS TERMINATED BY THE COMPANY OR TERMINATED DUE TO DEATH, DISABILITY OR
RETIREMENT, THE RESTRICTIONS WILL LAPSE ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION.  IF THE
OFFICER RESIGNS VOLUNTARILY OR IS TERMINATED FOR JUST CAUSE, THEIR RESTRICTED
SHARES ARE FORFEITED.  THESE RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE GRANTED UNDER THE LONG
TERM STOCK PLAN OF 1989, WHICH AUTHORIZES THE AWARD OF RESTRICTED SHARES.

SECTION 11:  VOLUNTARY DEFERRALS OF AWARDS

   A participant in the plan may choose to voluntarily defer receipt of a cash
award that is otherwise payable if the participant requesting a deferral IS
part of a select group of management and highly compensated employees as
defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Deferrals
shall be in an amount and for a term designated in a deferral agreement
executed prior to the commencement of the plan year.  Interest on deferred
amounts will be credited at the prime rate.

SECTION 12:  PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION

   The United Cities Gas Company Board of Directors reserves the right to amend
or terminate the plan at any time.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors shall administer and interpret the plan, as necessary, for fair and
equitable ongoing administration.
