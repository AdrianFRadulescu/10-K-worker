Item 1.     Business.

Development

      Winthrop  Residential  Associates III ("WRA III"), a limited  partnership,
was originally  organized under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State
of  Maryland  on June 28,  1982,  for the  purpose  of  investing,  as a limited
partner, in other limited partnerships which would develop, manage, own, operate
and otherwise deal with apartment  complexes which would be assisted by federal,
state and local government agencies ("Local Limited  Partnerships")  pursuant to
programs which would not significantly  restrict  distributions to owners or the
rates of return on investments in such complexes.  On December 15, 1982, WRA III
elected to comply with and be governed by the Maryland  Revised  Uniform Limited
Partnership  Act (the "Act") and filed its Agreement and  Certificate of Limited
Partnership (the "Partnership  Agreement") with the Maryland State Department of
Assessments and Taxation. In accordance with, and upon filing its certificate of
Limited  Partnership  pursuant to, the Act, WRA III changed its name to Winthrop
Residential Associates III, A Limited Partnership (the "Partnership").

     The General Partners of the Partnership are Two Winthrop  Properties,  Inc.
("Two   Winthrop")   and   Linnaeus-Oxford    Associates   Limited   Partnership
("Linnaeus-Oxford").  The  Initial  Limited  Partner  is WFC  Realty  Co.,  Inc.
("WFC").  Two Winthrop and WFC are Massachusetts  corporations  which are wholly
owned subsidiaries of First Winthrop Corporation ("First Winthrop"),  a Delaware
corporation,  which in turn is wholly-owned by Winthrop Financial Associates,  A
Limited   Partnership   ("WFA"),   a  Maryland   public   limited   partnership.
Linnaeus-Oxford is a Massachusetts limited partnership. The general partners are
Arthur J. Halleran, Jr. and Jonathan W. Wexler. As managing general partner, Mr.
Halleran  has   exclusive   control  over  the   management   and  operation  of
Linnaeus-Oxford. Messrs. Halleran and Wexler are Directors of First Winthrop and
Two Winthrop and, prior to December 22, 1994, Mr.  Halleran was the sole general
partner  of the  general  partner  of WFA.  Two  Winthrop  is the  Partnership's
Managing General Partner.

     On December  22, 1994,  pursuant to an  Investment  Agreement  entered into
among Nomura Asset Capital Corporation ("NACC"),  Mr. Halleran and certain other
individuals who comprise the senior  management of WFA, the general  partnership
interest in Linnaeus was transferred to W.L. Realty, L.P. ("W.L. Realty").  W.L.
Realty is a Delaware limited  partnership,  the general partner of which is A.I.
Realty  Company,  LLC  ("Realtyco").  The  equity  securities  of  Realtyco  are
currently held by certain  employees of NACC.  Such  securities are subject to a
call option agreement pursuant to which NACC may, at any time, elect to purchase
such securities for $1.00.

      The Partnership was initially  capitalized  with  contributions  totalling
$2,000 from its General Partners and $5,000 from WFC.



<PAGE>



      In late 1982, the Partnership filed a Registration  Statement on Form S-11
with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a public offering of
25,000 Units of limited  partnership  interest  ("Units") at a purchase price of
$1,000 per Unit (an aggregate of $25,000,000).  The  Registration  Statement was
declared  effective on March 8, 1983.  The offering  terminated in July 1983, at
which time subscriptions for 25,000 Units,  representing  capital  contributions
from  Investor  Limited  Partners of  $25,000,000,  had been  accepted.  Capital
contributions  net of selling  commissions,  sales and registration  costs, were
utilized to purchase  investments  in Local Limited  Partnerships  and temporary
short-term investments.

Description of Business

      The only business of the  Partnership is investing as a limited partner in
other limited  partnerships  that own, operate and otherwise deal with apartment
properties  with financing  insured by the U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban
Development  ("HUD"). The Partnership's  investment  objectives and policies are
described  at  pages  21-26  of  its  Prospectus   dated  March  11,  1983  (the
"Prospectus")  under the caption  "Investment  Objectives and  Policies,"  which
description  is attached  hereto as an exhibit and  incorporated  herein by this
reference.  The Prospectus was previously filed with the Commission  pursuant to
Rule 424(b).

Local Limited Partnerships

      The  Partnership  has completed its eleventh full year of operations.  The
Partnership   initially  acquired  equity  interests  in  the  form  of  limited
partnership  interests  in 12 Local  Limited  Partnerships  owing and  operating
apartment  properties.  The Partnership sold its interests in four Local Limited
Partnerships  owning the following  properties:  Fairfax Towers  (October 1988);
Harborside  Apartments  Phase II (February  1989); and Hunter's Ridge Apartments
Phase I and Hunter's Ridge  Apartments  Phase II (October 1991). The Partnership
lost its ownership interest in a fifth property,  Liberty Square Townhomes, when
HUD foreclosed on the Local Limited Partnership owning that property in February
1992.

     The  Partnership  reduced its interest in two Local  Limited  Partnerships,
those owning Maple Manor and The Groves, during 1988. The Partnership accepted a
proposal  of the  local  general  partner  of  Fayetteville  Apartments  Limited
Partnership  (which owns Maple  Manor) and  Savannah  River  Associates  Limited
Partnership  (which owns The  Groves)  whereby the local  general  partner  will
contribute up to $250,000 in additional capital under specific  circumstances to
prevent the mortgages secured by those properties from being assigned to HUD. In
exchange for this commitment,  the ownership interest allocations as well as the
allocation  provisions  for the  distribution  of cash from these Local  Limited
Partnerships  were amended to increase the local general partner's share from 5%
to 50%. The  partnership  agreements were amended to reflect this change as well
as  adding  a  provision   enabling  the  local  general   partner  to  use  any
distributable cash flow generated by one of these two Local Limited Partnerships
as a loan or capital  contribution  to the second Local Limited  Partnership  on
behalf of the  Partnership  and the local  general  partner if the second  Local
Limited Partnership  required additional funding. The effect of these changes on
the Partnership is to reduce the amount of cash it receives from these two Local
Limited  Partnerships.  However,  by  obtaining  a source of  funding  for up to
$250,000  of  operating  deficits,   the  threat  of  losing  the  Partnership's
investment in these two Local Limited  Partnerships through a foreclosure action
is decreased.

      The  following  table  sets  forth  certain   information   regarding  the
properties  owned  by  the  seven  Local  Limited   Partnerships  in  which  the
Partnership  has  retained  an  interest  and which  continue  to own  apartment
properties as of March 15, 1995:

Report of the  Partnership  dated  September  30,  1983,  and pages  7-27 of the
Partnership's  Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 31, 1984 under the caption
"Item 1. Business," all of which  descriptions are attached hereto as an Exhibit
and  incorporated  herein by this  reference.  The July 20, 1983  Supplement was
filed with the Commission as Post Effective Amendment No. 2 to the Partnership's
Registration  Statement on Form S-11 (Registration No. 2-81033). See also Note 4
of Notes to Financial  Statements  included as a part of this Annual  Report for
additional information concerning the properties.

Defaults

      The  Partnership  holds  limited  partnership  interests in Local  Limited
Partnerships  which own  apartment  properties,  all of which are financed  with
HUD-insured  first  mortgages.  If a Local  Limited  Partnership  defaults  on a
HUD-insured mortgage, the mortgagee can assign the defaulted mortgage to HUD and
recover  the  principal  owed  on its  first  mortgage  from  HUD.  HUD,  in its
discretion,  may then either (i)  negotiate a workout  agreement  with the Local
Limited  Partnership,  or (ii) pursue its right to transfer the ownership of the
property from the Local Limited Partnership to HUD through a foreclosure action.
The objective of a workout agreement between an owner and HUD is to secure HUD's
sanction of a plan which, over time, will cure any mortgage delinquencies. While
a workout  agreement is effective and its terms are being met, HUD agrees not to
pursue any remedies  available  to it as a result of the  default.  If the owner
does default under the terms of the workout agreement or if HUD concludes that a
property in default lacks the ability to generate sufficient revenue to cure its
default,  it may pursue its right to assume  ownership of the  property  through
foreclosure.

      Two Local  Limited  Partnerships  (owning  Autumn Chase and Clear  Creek),
which  were   previously  in  default,   currently  have   Provisional   Workout
Arrangements  in effect  with  HUD.  The  Partnership  also  holds an  ownership
interest in a Local Limited Partnership (owning Dunhaven Apartments,  Section 2,
Phase 2) which is currently in default on its mortgage obligation.

      The  Local  Limited  Partnership  owning  Autumn  Chase  defaulted  on its
mortgage in November  1989 and the mortgage was assigned to HUD in 1990.  In May
1991, the Local Limited Partnership negotiated a one-year workout agreement with
HUD and has subsequently obtained additional workout agreements, the most recent
agreement expiring in April 2000. The terms of the most recent agreement require
that in addition to payments for a service charge and real estate taxes, 110.89%
of the accruing  interest on the outstanding  loan be paid initially.  The Local
Limited Partnership met the terms of the agreement throughout 1994.

      The Local Limited Partnership owning Clear Creek defaulted on its mortgage
in May 1988 and the mortgage  was assigned to HUD in July 1988.  The property is
currently  operating  under a  one-year  workout  agreement  with HUD which will
expire in July 1995.  The terms of the  agreement  require  that, in addition to
payments for a service charge and real estate taxes,  approximately  130% of the
accruing  interest on the outstanding loan be paid currently.  The Local Limited
Partnership met the terms of the agreement throughout 1994.



<PAGE>



      The Local  Limited  Partnership  Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section 2, Phase 2
defaulted  on its  mortgage  obligation  in June 1994.  The  mortgage  is in the
process of being assigned to HUD.


Reserves

      The Partnership  originally set aside approximately  $580,000 as operating
reserves from the proceeds of the original  offering.  The Partnership has added
funds to these  reserves from its cash flow from the Local Limited  Partnerships
and from a portion of the sale  proceeds of Fairfax  Towers and its  interest in
Harborside  Apartments  Phase II, Hunter's Ridge Phase I and Hunters Ridge Phase
II.  Such  funds have been  invested  in  short-term  taxable  money-market  and
government  instruments.  To  date,  $291,489  has  been  contributed  from  the
operating  reserve  to assist  the Local  Limited  Partnerships  with  operating
deficits. All advances made to the Local Limited Partnerships have been recorded
as capital contributions to the Local Limited  Partnerships.  However, the Local
Limited  Partnerships  have  recorded  only a portion of the advances as capital
contributions  and the  remaining  amount as loans.  In addition,  in 1994,  the
Partnership  utilized  $753,609 of these  reserves to fund a portion of the cash
distribution to the Investor Limited Partners.  As of December 31, 1994 there is
approximately $2,046,000 remaining in the operating reserves.

Employees

      The  Partnership  does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the Partnership by the Managing General Partner, and agents retained by it.

Item 2.     Properties.

      Other than the limited  partnership  interests  set forth in Item 1 above,
the Partnership does not own any property.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings.   None.

Item 4.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.   None.

                                                      PART II

Item 5.  Market  for the  Registrant's  Common  Stock and  Related  Stockholders
     Matters.

      The Registrant is a partnership and thus has no common stock.  There is no
active market for the Units.  Trading in the Units is sporadic and occurs solely
through private transactions.

      As of December 31, 1994, there were 2,225 holders of the Units.

     The  Partnership  Agreement  requires  that  if the  Partnership  has  Cash
Available  for  Distribution  it be  distributed  quarterly  to the  Partners in
specified  proportions.  The  Partnership  Agreement  defines Cash Available for
Distribution as Cash Flow less cash  designated by the Managing  General Partner
to be held for  restoration  or creation of  reserves.  Cash Flow,  in turn,  is
defined as cash derived from the Local Limited  Partnerships (but excluding sale
or refinancing proceeds) and all cash derived from Partnership operations,  less
cash used to pay  operating  expenses  of the  Partnership.  For the years ended
December  31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  cash  distributions  paid or accrued to the
Limited Partners as a group were $1,000,000 each year.

     Item 7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
          Results of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Reserves

     As of March 15, 1995, the Partnership  retained an equity interest in seven
Local  Limited  Partnerships.  The  Partnership  follows  the  equity  method of
accounting for these interests and ecognizes its  proportionate  share of income
and  losses  incurred  by  the  Local  Limited  Partnerships.   Generally,   the
Partnership's equity in losses in the Local Limited  Partnerships  decrease over
time due to two factors;  although in 1990 and 1992, the Partnership's equity in
losses  increased  over the  previous  years'.  Losses  attributable  to a Local
Limited  Partnership  are  not  recognized  if  those  losses  would  cause  the
Partnership's  investment  account for that Local Limited  Partnership to become
negative  since the  Partnership  has no obligation  to fund them. In 1990,  the
equity in losses  increased  due to a  revaluation  of the value of Clear Creek,
which  accelerated  the  recognition  of losses to the  extent of its  remaining
investment  account.  In 1992, the equity in losses increased due to an increase
in vacancy and operating  expenses at The Groves.  In 1993, the equity in losses
decreased because The Groves' remaining investment account was not sufficient to
recognize  all 1993  losses from the Local  Limited  Partnership.  In 1994,  the
equity in losses  decreased since the only losses  recognized by the Partnership
were from Maple Manor. For fiscal 1994,  $357,648 of the Partnership's  share of
losses from the Local Limited Partnerships were not recognized since the related
investments  had been fully written off.  Cumulatively  through 1994, a total of
$4,479,983  of the  Partnership's  equity  in  losses  from  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships has been deferred.

      The equity method of  accounting  is used solely for  financial  reporting
purposes;  all losses continue to be recognized for tax purposes. The tax losses
of the Partnership will decrease over time because the advantages of accelerated
depreciation taken by the Local Limited Partnerships are greatest in the earlier
years. Also, the deductions for mortgage interest expense will steadily decrease
as the mortgage principals are amortized.

      The  Partnership  requires  cash to pay  its  general  and  administrative
expenses  or to make  advances  to any of the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  the
Managing  General  Partner  deems to be in the  Partnership's  best  interest to
preserve  its  ownership  interest.  To date,  all cash  requirements  have been
satisfied  by  interest  income  earned  on  short-term   investments  and  cash
distributed  to  the  Partnership  by the  Local  Limited  Partnerships.  If the
Partnership funds any operating deficits,  it will use monies from its operating
reserves.  As of December 31, 1994, the Partnership  held operating  reserves of
approximately  $2,046,000  which  is  expected  to be  sufficient  to  fund  any
anticipated  deficits.  The  Managing  General  Partner's  current  policy is to
maintain a reserve balance sufficient to provide, at a minimum,  interest income
in an  amount  equal to the  Partnership's  annual  general  and  administrative
expenses.   Therefore,   a  lack  of  cash  distributed  by  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  to the  Partnership  in the future will not deplete the  reserves,
though it may restrict the Partnership from making distributions to the Investor
Limited Partners.

      The Partnership  has reserves  which, in principal,  could be used to make
advances to the Local Limited  Partnerships.  However,  the Partnership does not
intend to make advances to fund any future  operating  deficits  incurred by the
Local Limited  Partnerships,  but retains its prerogative to exercise a business
judgement to reverse  this  position if  circumstances  warrant a change in this
policy.  Moreover,  the  Partnership  is not obligated to provide any additional
funds to the Local Limited  Partnerships to fund operating deficits.  If a Local
Limited  Partnership  sustains  continuing  operating  deficits and had no other
source  of  funding,  it is  likely  that the  Local  Limited  Partnership  will
eventually  default on its mortgage  obligation  and risk a  foreclosure  on its
property by the lender. If a foreclosure were to occur, the Local


<PAGE>



Limited  Partnership would lose its investment in the property and would incur a
tax  liability due to the  recapture of tax benefits  taken in prior years.  The
Partnership  as an owner of the Local  Limited  Partnership,  would  share these
consequences  in  proportion  to its  ownership  interest  in the Local  Limited
Partnership.

Results of Operations

      A number of the  properties  owned by the Local  Limited  Partnerships  in
which the Partnership has invested have operated at a deficit for many years due
to their  location in areas with weak  economies  or overbuilt  rental  markets.
Economic and competitive  forces also impede properties  operating at break even
or better to improve their  financial  operating  results,  that is, to generate
increasing net cash flow in each subsequent  year after  operating  expenses and
financial obligations.  As markets deteriorated during the mid-1980's, the Local
Limited  Partnerships  experiencing  financial  difficulties  sought alternative
sources of funding to cover  operating  deficits.  In some  cases,  these  Local
Limited  Partnerships  secured  additional  funding from their general partners.
From 1985 through 1988, the  Partnership  did provide some funding to five Local
Limited  Partnerships  to preserve its ownership  interest in those  properties.
However,  as it became  apparent  that the  recovery of these  markets  would be
prolonged  and  that the  Partnership's  resources  were  limited,  funding  was
discontinued. Consequently, some Local Limited Partnerships incurring continuing
deficits  ceased making full debt service  payments,  putting the mortgages into
default,  and instead began negotiating with lenders for mortgage  modifications
to reduce debt service payments to a level property operations could support.

      Three Local Limited  Partnerships,  owning  Autumn Chase,  Clear Creek and
Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section  2,  Phase 2 have  defaulted  on  their  mortgage
obligations.  Autumn Chase is currently  operating  under a Provisional  Workout
Arrangement  which is effective  from July 1, 1994 through  April 30, 2000.  The
terms of the agreement  require  minimum  monthly  payments  equal to 110.89% of
accruing  interest  as well as  payments  for a service  charge and real  estate
taxes. The two previous workout agreements which expired in April 1994 and April
1993  required  minimum  monthly  debt service  payments  equal to 100% and 85%,
respectively,  of the  accruing  interest  as well as a service  charge and real
estate tax payments.  Autumn Chase has met the minimum debt service requirements
in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Due to the financial condition of Autumn Chase, however,
no cash  distributions  have been made to the Partnership in 1993 or 1994 and no
cash distribution will be made to the Partnership in 1995.

      Clear Creek is currently operating under a Provisional Workout Arrangement
which is effective  from August 1, 1994 through July 31, 1995.  The terms of the
agreement  require  minimum  monthly  payments  equal to  approximately  130% of
accruing  interest  as well as  payments  for a service  charge and real  estate
taxes. The two previous workout  agreements which expired in July 1994 and April
1995  required  minimum  monthly debt service  payments  equal to 110% and 100%,
respectively,  of the  accruing  interest  as well as a service  charge and real
estate tax payments.  Clear Creek has met the minimum debt service  requirements
in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Due to the financial condition of Clear Creek,  however,
no cash


<PAGE>



distributions  have  been  made to the  Partnership  in 1993 or 1994 and no cash
distribution will be made to the Partnership in 1995.

      The Local Limited Partnership owning Dunhaven Apartments, Section 2, Phase
2 defaulted  on its  mortgage  obligation  in June 1994.  The mortgage is in the
process of being assigned to HUD. Due to Dunhaven's financial situation, no cash
distribution will be made to the Partnership in 1995 from 1994 operations. While
Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section  2,  Phase 2 was able to meet  its  debt  service
payments  in 1993 and 1992  through  funding by the local  general  partner  and
Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section  2,  Phase  1, no  cash  was  distributed  to the
Partnership from 1993 or 1992 operations.

      The four properties owned by the remaining Local Limited  Partnerships met
their financial  obligations in 1994.  Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section 2, Phase 1
incurred an operating  deficit,  Maple Manor operated at break even, and Village
Square and The Groves generated varying amounts of operating cash flow. Dunhaven
Apartments,  Section  2,  Phase 1  incurred  a slight  deficit in 1994 which was
funded  by cash  reserves.  Accordingly,  no cash  distribution  was made to the
Partnership in 1994. While Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section 2, Phase 1 was able to
generate  a small  amount of cash flow in 1993 and 1992,  no cash  distributions
were made to the Partnership.

      Village Square generated substantial operating cash flow in 1994 and it is
anticipated  that a cash  distribution  will be made to the  Partnership in 1995
from the 1994 cash  flow.  The  Partnership  received  cash  distributions  from
Village Square of $263,298 in 1994 and $246,843 in 1993 from cash flow generated
by Village Square in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

      Maple  Manor  operated at break even in 1994 and will not be making a cash
distribution to the Partnership in 1995. In 1993 and 1992, Maple Manor generated
positive  cash flow, a portion of which was used to make a capital  contribution
to The Groves.

      The Groves  generated  positive  cash flow in 1994,  however,  will not be
making a cash  distribution  to the  Partnership.  In 1993 and 1992,  The Groves
operated at a deficit.  The improved operations are due, in part, to a reduction
in repair and  maintenance  expenditures.  An aggressive  repair and maintenance
program   began  in  1992  which  was  aimed  at   increasing   the   property's
competitiveness.  This program was completed 1993, resulting in lower repair and
maintenance expenditures for 1994.

      The  Local  Limited  Partnerships'  objectives  are to  improve  operating
results  for all  properties  and to continue  to operate  under  HUD-sanctioned
workout  agreements for those  properties  that are in default on their mortgage
obligations until any delinquencies are cured. The Partnership  believes that as
long as the Local Limited  Partnerships which own properties in default continue
to negotiate with HUD to work out their  financial  difficulties,  the threat of
foreclosure is mitigated.  Moreover,  any workout agreement entered into between
HUD and the Local Limited  Partnerships will have no affect on the Partnership's
ability to deduct  mortgage  interest  expense unless HUD agrees to forgive such
interest  indebtedness.  As of  March  15,  1995,  none  of  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships had agreements with HUD which would forgive accrued interest.


<PAGE>




      The results of  operations  for future years may differ from those in 1994
as a result  of many  factors.  One will be the  ability  of the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  which currently have  provisional  workout  agreements with HUD to
extend  those  agreements  until all  mortgage  delinquencies  have been  cured.
Another  factor  will be the  ability of the Local  Limited  Partnership  owning
Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section 2 Phase 1 to  operate  at break  even or  better.
Another  factor will be the ability of each Local  Limited  Partnership  to deal
with the  consequences  of changing  economic  conditions  that affect  property
operations.  The Partnership's  investment in Local Limited  Partnerships owning
rental  real  estate is subject to the risk  involved  with the  management  and
ownership of rental real estate.  Vacancy  levels,  rental payment  defaults and
operating  expenses are all dependent on general and local economic  conditions.
Shifts in the  economy  could  result in  differing  operating  results for each
individual Local Limited  Partnership.  In these markets,  operating  results in
future  years may  depend on the  properties'  ability to  maintain  competitive
rental rates while using its available  resources to fund necessary  repairs and
replacements.

      The Partnership's  plan is to work with the Local Limited  Partnerships to
maintain  ownership of and seek workout agreements with HUD for those properties
in default on their mortgage. Although the Partnership has no ability to force a
sale of properties owned by the Local Limited Partnerships, the Partnership will
also work with the Local Limited  Partnerships to investigate sale opportunities
for those  properties  generating  positive  cash flow and will continue to work
with the Local Limited Partnerships to improve the financial  performance of all
the properties.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATES III, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL
ASSOCIATES  III, A LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP (a Maryland  limited  partnership) as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of operations, changes in
partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the responsibility of the Partnership's General Partners. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statements  of certain  Local  Limited
Partnerships,  the  investments  in  which  are  reflected  in the  accompanying
financial statements using the equity method of accounting and have been written
down to zero (see Note 2). Those statements were audited by other auditors whose
reports have been furnished to us and our opinion,  insofar as it relates to the
amounts  included for those Local Limited  Partnerships,  is based solely on the
reports of the other auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that our  audits  and the  reports  of  other  auditors  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  based on our audits and the  reports  of other  auditors,  the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL  ASSOCIATES  III,  A LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations,
changes in  partners'  capital and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31,  1994,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III, listed in the index to the
financial statements,  is the responsibility of WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL  ASSOCIATES
III, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP management and is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission's  rules and is not a required part
of the basic  financial  statements.  This  schedule  has been  subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion,  fairly  states in all material  respects,  the  financial  data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1994

1.   ORGANIZATION

Winthrop  Residential  Associates III, a Limited Partnership (the "Partnership")
was organized on June 28, 1982 under the Uniform Limited  Partnership Act of the
State of  Maryland  to  invest  in  limited  partnerships  (the  "Local  Limited
Partnerships") which develop,  manage,  operate and otherwise deal in government
assisted apartment complexes that do not significantly restrict distributions to
owners or the rate of return on investments in such properties.  On December 15,
l982,  the  Partnership  elected to comply with and be governed by the  Maryland
Revised  Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act. The  Partnership  will terminate on
December 31, 2003, or sooner,  in accordance  with the terms of the  Partnership
Agreement.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial  Statements - The financial statements of the Partnership are prepared
on the accrual basis of accounting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of a mutual fund
that  invests  in  treasury  bills  and  repurchase   agreements  with  original
maturities of three months or less.  Cash  equivalents  are valued at cost which
approximates market value.

Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for  federal,  state or local income
taxes in the financial statements of the Partnership.  The Partners are required
to report on their  individual  tax  returns  their  allocable  share of income,
gains, losses, deductions and credits of the Partnership.  The Partnership files
its tax returns on the  accrual  basis.  On May 6, l983,  the  Internal  Revenue
Service  issued  a  ruling  that  the  Partnership  should  be  classified  as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes.

Investments  in Local Limited  Partnerships - The  Partnership  accounts for its
investment in each Local Limited Partnership using the equity method.  Under the
equity method of accounting,  the  investment  cost  (including  amounts paid or
accrued)  is  subsequently  adjusted  by the  Partnership's  share of the  Local
Limited  Partnership's  results of operations and by  distributions  received or
accrued.  Equity in the loss of Local Limited  Partnerships is not recognized to
the extent  that the  investment  balance  would  become  negative  because  the
Partnership has no obligation to fund these losses.

Distributions  to  Partners  -  Cash   distributions   from  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  (Cash Flow) are included in the  computation of the  Partnership's
Cash Available for Distribution in the quarter received.  As provided for in the
Partnership  Agreement,  quarterly  distributions  are  payable to the  Partners
within 60 days after the end of the quarter,  exclusive of sales proceeds.  From
July 1, 1987 through  December 31, 1990,  all cash flow,  excluding  Fairfax and
Harborside sale proceeds, was retained by the Partnership and added to operating
reserves.  In 1991,  the  Partnership  began to  distribute  cash on a quarterly
basis.   The  total  amount   distributed  or  accrued  in  1994  and  1993  was
approximately $1,081,300 for each year.

3.   TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

Two Winthrop Properties, Inc. ("Two Winthrop"), the Managing General Partner, is
a wholly owned  subsidiary of First  Winthrop  Corporation  ("First  Winthrop"),
which in turn is  wholly  owned by  Winthrop  Financial  Associates,  A  Limited
Partnership  ("WFA").  Linnaeus Oxford Associates,  the other General Partner of
the  Partnership,  is a limited  partnership of which some general  partners are
partners  of WFA.  WFA and its  affiliates  manage or  advise a large  number of
partnerships  organized  to  own  or  operate  real  estate  as  well  as  other
investments, or to invest in other limited partnerships that own or operate real
estate or other  investments.  WFA has formed  directly  or through  affiliates,
additional  partnerships  or other  entities,  both public and private,  some of
which may have the same investment objectives as the Partnership.

At December  31,  1994,  a  subsidiary  of First  Winthrop  remains a comanaging
general partner in a Local Limited Partnership.



<PAGE>



The General  Partners are entitled to 7.5% of Cash  Available for  Distribution.
For 1994, 1993 and 1992, the General  Partners had been accrued or received cash
distributions of approximately $81,100 for each year.

During the liquidation stage of the Partnership,  the General Partners and their
affiliates  are  entitled  to receive  certain  distributions,  subordinated  to
specified   minimum  returns  to  the  Limited  Partners  as  described  in  the
Partnership Agreement.

4.   INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

As of  December  31,  1994,  the  Partnership  has  limited  partnership  equity
interests in seven Local Limited Partnerships that own fully operating apartment
complexes.  These Local Limited Partnerships have outstanding mortgages totaling
$21,363,052, which are secured by the Local Limited Partnerships' real property,
security interests, liens and endorsements common to first mortgage loans.

Since inception,  the Partnership has made additional investments of $291,489 in
several Local Limited Partnerships,  $154,382 of which has been accounted for as
operating  deficit  advances and $137,107 as capital  contributions by the Local
Limited Partnerships. Additional investments in 1993 were $16,500. There were no
additional investments in 1994.

During 1988,  the  Partnership  entered into  agreements  with the local General
Partner of the Savannah River  Associates  Limited  Partnership and Fayetteville
Apartments.  The  agreement  stipulates  that the  local  General  Partner  will
contribute  additional  capital  in the  aggregate  of  $250,000,  to  avoid  an
assignment  of  the  mortgages  by the  mortgage  lender  to  HUD.  There  is no
obligation on the part of the General Partner to make any contribution  when, in
the exercise of reasonable  business  judgment,  it is determined that it is not
reasonably  likely that the partners  will realize a return on their  investment
sufficient to justify making such  contribution.  In exchange for this agreement
to  fund  additional  capital,   the  Partnership's   interest  in  the  sharing
arrangements of profit, losses, cash flow and residuals has been reduced.

The investments in Local Limited  Partnerships  balances as of December 31, 1994
and 1993 are as follows:

5.         TAXABLE INCOME

The Partnership's  taxable income for 1994 differs from net income for financial
reporting purposes primarily due to accounting differences in the recognition of
construction  period costs,  calculation of  depreciation  incurred by the Local
Limited  Partnerships,  and losses not recognizable under the equity method. The
taxable income for 1994 is as follows:

6.      LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

During  1992,  the  general   partner  of  Liberty  Square  Town  homes  Limited
Partnership,  in which the Partnership owns a limited partnership interest,  was
notified  that the United  States  Department  of Housing and Urban  Development
(HUD) foreclosed on its mortgage in February 1992. The Partnership's  investment
in Liberty Square was zero at the time of foreclosure,  and it has no obligation
to fund any liabilities related to Liberty Square Limited Partnership.

Two Local Limited Partnerships,  owning Autumn Chase and Clear Creek, which have
been in default since 1989, secured  Provisional  Workout  Arrangements with HUD
during 1994. The workout  arrangements are effecitve through April 2000 and July
1995, respectively.

The Local Limited  Partnership owning Dunhaven  Apartments,  Section 2, Phase 2,
defaulted  on its  mortgage  obligation  in June 1994.  The  mortgage  is in the
process of being assigned to HUD by the mortgager.

The  Partnership  is unable to  determine  at this time if these  Local  Limited
Partnerships will be able to meet their financing requirements during the coming
year. The  Partnership  is not obligated to fund operating  deficits or mortgage
loans of these Local Limited Partnerships.  The Partnership's investment balance
in these Local Limited Partnerships is zero at December 31, 1994.

                          Independent Auditors' Report


To the Partners
Autumn Chase, Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Autumn Chase, Ltd. (a limited
partnership)  as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,  and the related  statements  of
operations, partners' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended.

These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those  stands  require  taht we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As  discussed  in Note B, the mortgage is in default as of the date of the audit
and could result in foreclosure.  Foreclosure by HUD would seriously  impair the
partnership's  ability  to  continue  as a  going  concern  and to  realize  its
investment  in  assets  through  future  successful  operations.  The  financial
statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

Because of the significance of the uncertainty about the  partnership's  ability
to continue as a going concern, as discussed in the preceding paragraph,  we are
unable  to  express,  and we do not  express,  an  opinion  on  these  financial
statements.

                          Independent Auditor's Report



To the Partners
Clear Creek LTD.
(A Limited Partneship)

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheet of Clear Creek LTD., Project No.
114-35215  PM (a limited  partnership),  as of December 31, 1994 and the related
statements of income,  changes in partners' equity,  and cash flows for the year
then  ended.   These  financial   statements  are  the   responsibility  of  the
Partnership's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

It is the partnership's policy to prepare its financial statements in the format
prescribed  by the  Consolidated  Audit Guide for Audits of HUD Programs  issued
July 1993.  The formats for the  financial  statements  prescribed by that Guide
differ  somewhat  from  those  prescribed  by  generally   accepted   accounting
principles.

We conducted the audit in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards
and Government  Auditing  Standards,  issued by the  Comptroller  General of the
United States.  Those standards  require that the audit be planned and performed
to obtain reasonable asurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements referred to above,  present fairly in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Clear Creek LTD. at December
31, 1994 and the results of its operations, changes in partners' equity and cash
flows for the year then ended in confomrtiy with generally  accepted  accounting
principles,  except for the format differences explained in the second paragraph
above,  applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year. Our audit
was  conducted  for the  purpose of  forming  an opinion on the basic  financial
statement stake nas a whole. The supporting  information  included in the report
(shown on pages 14 to 32) is presented  for the purpose of  additional  analysis
and is not a required part of the basic financial  statements of HUD Project No.
114-35215PM. Such information has been subjected to the same auditing procedures
applied  in the  examination  of the  basic  financial  statements  and,  in our
opinion,  is  presented  fairly in all  mateiral  respects  in  relation  to the
financial statements taken as a whole.

The  accompanying   financial   statements  have  been  prepared   assuming  the
partnership will continue as a going concern.  In lieu of foreclosure because of
mortgage payment  delinquencies,  the Department of House and Urban  Develompent
has  agreed  to  a  "Provisional  Workout  Agreement".   The  necessity  of  the
"Provisional   Workout   Agreement"  has  raised  substantial  doubt  about  the
partnership's   ability  to  continue  as  a  going   concern.   Under   certain
circumstances  (as  described  in Note  2) HUD may  foreclose  the  property  in
satisfaction  of the outstanding  debt. The financial  statements do not include
any  adjustments   that  might  result  from  the  outcome  of  any  foreclosure
proceedings.

                          Walkint Limited Partnership
Baltimore,  Maryland

         Re: .....Dunhaven Apartments - Section II - Phase II
         ......................HUD Project Number 052-35831 PM

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Walkint Limited  Partnership
as of December  31,  1993,  and the  related  statements  of income,  changes in
partners'  capital,  and cash flows for the years then  ended.  These  financial
statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  partnership's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and Government  Auditing  Standards,  issued by the  Comptroller  General of the
United  States.  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of Walkint Limited Partnership as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its changes
in partners'  capital and its cash flows for the years then ended in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
partnership  will continue as a going concern.  The partnership is in default on
its  mortgage  note at December  31, 1994 and the note can be  foreclosed.  This
condition raises  substantial doubt about the partnership's  ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our audit was  conducted  for the  purpose  of  forming  an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplementary information included in
the report  (shown on pages 13 through  22) is  presented  for the  purposes  of
additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements
of Walkint  Limited  Partnership.  Such  information  has been  subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial  statements and,
in our opinion,  is fairly  stated in all  material  respects in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.
