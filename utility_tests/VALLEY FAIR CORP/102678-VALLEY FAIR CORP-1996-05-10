                              PART I

Item 1 - Business

     (a)  General Development of Business.

     The Valley Fair Corporation ("Valley Fair") was incorporated under the laws
of the state of Delaware on June 13, 1955. The Valley Fair Corporation  together
with its subsidiary,  L. F. Widmann, Inc.  (collectively called the "Registrant"
or the  "Corporation")  is engaged in the business of operating  retail discount
stores and variety stores.

     During its fiscal year ended  January 28, 1996,  ("1996  fiscal  year") the
Corporation  continued to operate two discount  department stores in New Jersey.
In  addition,  the  Corporation  presently  operates,  through its wholly  owned
subsidiary,  L.F. Widmann, Inc., 127 retail locations,  including 67 departments
in stores controlled by its "Parent", Schottenstein Stores Corporation.

     (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments.

     The Corporation's operations consist of a single line of business.

     (c)  Narrative Description of Business.

     The  Corporation  currently  operates  through a  combination  of owned and
licensed departments, two "full line" discount department stores, under the name
"Valley  Fair",  in the State of New Jersey.  The stores sell soft goods such as
men's and women's clothing,  hard goods such as hardware,  stationery and health
and beauty aids, as well as grocery items in a full line supermarket situated at
one of the store locations.  Each store is free-standing  and offers an in-depth
selection of nationally advertised brand products.

     Through its wholly owned subsidiary,  L. F. Widmann,  Inc., the Corporation
currently operates 127 retail health and beauty aid variety stores, including 67
licensed  departments in Value City Department  Stores  controlled by its parent
Schottenstein Stores Corporation.  The stores sell non-prescription  proprietary
drugs,  tobacco  and  other  sundries  (including  greeting  cards,  stationery,
electronics,  toys and small  appliances),  cosmetics  and hair  goods and other
products.

     The merchandise consists mostly of nationally advertised brand products, as
well as private label merchandise.

     During  the last  three  years no  single  class of  similar  products  has
accounted for ten percent of the Corporation's revenues.

     The Corporation does not own any patents, trademarks,  licenses, franchises
or concessions,  other than licenses to operate  departments in two stores owned
by others. Those licenses are not material to the Corporation's operations.
<PAGE>
     The Corporation  purchases from its suppliers on normal trade credit terms.
The Corporation sells at retail for cash and accepts certain charge cards.

     Because of the retail nature of the Corporation's  business, the Company is
not dependent upon a single  customer or a few customers and no single  customer
accounts  for 10  percent  or more of the  Corporation's  sales.  Likewise,  the
Corporation does not have a significant backlog of orders.

     The  Corporation  is not  materially  affected by  federal,  state or local
regulations  relating to the  discharge of  materials  into the  environment  or
otherwise  relating to the  protection of the  environment.  During the last few
fiscal  years  adequate  heating  and  cooling  was  available  at  all  of  the
Corporation's  locations.  The  Corporation is not engaged in any  manufacturing
operations, so processing fuels are not required.

     The  Corporation's  operations  are not  generally  seasonal  except for an
increase in sales during the Christmas season.

     The Corporation  operates in geographical  areas in which retail operations
are highly competitive.  Competition is based upon price, quality, selection and
service.

     The  Corporation   competes  directly  with  several  types  of  retailers,
including full line department stores,  discount  department  stores,  specialty
shops, discount houses,  supermarkets,  pharmacies,  and variety stores. Many of
the  Corporation's  direct  competitors are national or regional chains and have
greater financial resources than the Corporation.  Due to the number and variety
of competitors, the Corporation is unable to determine its competitive position.

     The Corporation's discount department store operations employ approximately
250 persons, of whom approximately 150 are employed full time. Substantially all
of  such  employees  are  unionized  except  for  supervisory   personnel.   The
Corporation  considers  its labor  relations  to be  satisfactory.  Widmann  has
approximately  440 employees of whom  approximately  330 are employed full time.
Except for  approximately 90 warehouse  personnel,  Widmann's  employees are not
unionized. Widmann considers its labor relations to be satisfactory.

     The Corporation does not have sales to customers in foreign countries.

Item 2 - Properties

     Registrant's two discount  department  stores are operated at free standing
facilities.  These units are one story buildings and information concerning each

     Widmann  leases  space at 124  locations  at which it  operates  health and
beauty aid variety  stores,  in similar  cities and towns in central and western
Pennsylvania,   Ohio,  New  Jersey,  Tennessee,   Michigan,  Kentucky,  Indiana,
Virginia,  West  Virginia,  Maryland,  Delaware,  and New York.  The size of the
leased  properties  generally  range  from 800 to 8,000  square  feet,  with the
average size being  approximately  3,000 square feet.  These  leases,  including
renewal option periods,  expire on dates ranging from April 1996 through January
31, 2025.

     In  1980,  Widmann  purchased  5.54  acres  of land in the  Clinton  County
Industrial Park,  located in McElhattan,  Pennsylvania.  Originally,  a building
containing 43,000 square feet was constructed,  and subsequently it was expanded
by an additional  30,000 square feet. It is currently in use as headquarters and
distribution center.

     In addition, L. F. Widmann, Inc. owns the following store locations:

          426  Bellefonte Avenue, Lock Haven, Pa.
          Seventh Street and Huron Ave., Renovo, Pa.

Item 5 - Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related Security
         Holder Matters

     The   Corporation's   Common   Stock   is   traded   principally   in   the
over-the-counter market.

     Effective May 7, 1984 the Board of Directors  approved that the Corporation
reduce the  number of  authorized  shares of common  stock  from  20,000,000  to
666,666 and  increase  the par value per share of its common stock from $.01 per
share to $.30 per share. In connection therewith, the Corporation converted each
outstanding share of common stock of $.01 par value per share into one-thirtieth
(1/30th)  of a share of common  stock of $.30 par value  per  share.  Fractional
shares were not issued. Instead the Corporation paid cash for fractional shares,
based on market value of $.625 per share for the former share.

     The table below represents the high and low bid price for the Corporation's
Common Stock during the quarters of fiscal 1996 and 1995. These prices represent
quotations between dealers in securities,  and do not include commissions and do
not necessarily represent actual transactions.

         1996            High Bid            Low Bid
         ----            --------            -------

     Fourth Quarter       26.00               26.00

     No dividends were paid in the reporting  period.  Long term debt agreements
that expire May 8, 1996,  include certain  restrictive  covenants  which,  among
other things,  prohibit the  Corporation  from  declaring any dividends  (except
stock dividends).

     The  number of holders of record of the  Corporation's  Common  Stock as of
January 28, 1996 was 1,164.

Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
         Results of Operations

     The  following   discussion   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 1996 VS. 1995

     The  consolidated  statements  of  income  for  fiscal  1996  and  1995 are
comprised  of 52  week  periods.  Net  sales  decreased  $2,624,000,  or 3.7% to
$68,035,000 in fiscal 1996. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable
to increased  competition,  while adverse  economic  uncertainties  continued to
affect consumer buying  patterns.  Competitive  factors continue to affect sales
growth and are being  evaluated  and  addressed  through  emphasis  on  customer
service and promotional  activities.  Management continues to monitor individual
store locations for their  contributions to the overall company profit plan (See
Liquidity  and Capital  Resources).  Tenant  license  revenue was  approximately
$59,000 (1.2%) more than the prior fiscal year.

     Gross profit as a percentage  of sales was 31.4% in fiscal 1996 as compared
to 30.4% for fiscal 1995, resulting from an increase of promotional  merchandise
purchased at favorable and liquidated values and an improvement in the estimates
used to allocate overhead to warehouse inventory.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses decreased by 1.3% in fiscal
1996 as  compared  to a 4% increase in fiscal  1995.  The  $330,000  decrease in
fiscal 1996 was primarily the result of decreased  depreciation  and payroll tax
expense.  The decrease in  depreciation  expense was a result of assets becoming
fully  depreciated.  The  decrease  in  payroll  tax  expense  was a result of a
reduction  in  the  unemployment   compensation  rate.   Selling,   general  and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 1% in fiscal 1996
compared to fiscal 1995 (i.e. 37.1% in fiscal 1996 versus 36.1% in fiscal 1995).

     Interest expense in fiscal 1996 increased  approximately  $168,000 compared
to fiscal 1995, a 20% increase.  The increase in expense is  attributable  to an
increase in the  borrowings  outstanding  during  1996,  along with higher rates
during 1996.

     The effective tax rate for fiscal 1996 was 98% compared to (160%) in fiscal
1995.  A  further  analysis  of these  changes  can be found in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.
<PAGE>
FISCAL 1995 VS. 1994

     The  consolidated  statements  of  income  for  fiscal  1995  and  1994 are
comprised of 52 week periods. Net sales increased $782,000, or 1% to $70,659,000
in fiscal 1995.  The  increase in net sales was  partially  attributable  to the
addition of 1 new store.  Sales of new store  openings  (net of  closings)  were
approximately  $326,000.  Same store sales increased a modest $456,000 in fiscal
1995,  as new stores  opened in the prior year  matured,  with  competition  and
economic  uncertainties  continuing  to effect  consumer  buying  patterns.  The
Company expects same store sales to increase  modestly as the economy  improves.
Competitive  factors continue to affect sales growth and are being evaluated and
addressed  through  emphasis on customer  service  and  promotional  activities.
Management   continues  to  monitor   individual   store   locations  for  their
contributions  to the overall  company profit plan.  Tenant license  revenue was
approximately  $250,000  (5.4%) more than the prior fiscal  year,  which was the
result of the expansion and addition of tenant departments.

     Gross profit as a percentage  of sales was 30.4% in fiscal 1995 as compared
to 31.4% for fiscal 1994,  resulting from a significant  decrease of promotional
merchandise purchased at favorable and liquidated values.

     Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased by 4.0% and 9.1% in
fiscal 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The  $973,000  increase in fiscal 1995 was
primarily  the result of  increased  salaries  and  employee  benefits.  Several
factors  contributed to the increase in salaries and benefits including salaries
associated with new store openings,  additional supervisory positions as well as
annual  pay  increases.  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  as  a
percentage  of net sales  increased  .9% in fiscal 1995  compared to fiscal 1994
(i.e. 36.1% for fiscal 1995 versus 35.2% in fiscal 1994).

     Interest expense in fiscal 1995 increased  approximately  $135,000 compared
to  fiscal  1994,  a 19%  increase.  The  increase  in  expense  is  principally
attributable to higher rates during 1995.

     The effective tax rate for fiscal 1995 was (160%) compared to 44% in fiscal
1994.  A  further  analysis  of these  changes  can be found in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.
<PAGE>
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

     As of January 28, 1996, the Company's cash and cash equivalent  balance was
$3,609,000. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash available from
operations  and available  borrowings  from bank  agreements.  During 1995,  the
Company  entered  into a revolving  credit  agreement  with a new bank.  Working
capital  amounted to  $14,710,000 at January 28, 1996 compared to $14,845,000 at
January 29, 1995, a decrease of $135,000.  The current ratio at January 28, 1996
and January 29, 1995 was 2 to 1.

     In March 1996,  the Company  decided to close 16 of its  unprofitable  L.F.
Widmann,  Inc. stores. As a result of these closings,  the Company anticipates a
$835,000 charge to operations in the first quarter of fiscal 1997. Approximately
76% of the  charges  represents  the  expected  loss on the  liquidation  of the
inventories at these locations.

     The Company  believes that its fiscal 1996 working  capital needs,  capital
expenditures  and debt  repayments  can be funded from  operations and available
credit lines.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     The Company adopted a new accounting  standard for  disclosures  about fair
value of financial  instruments  (FAS 107) in fiscal 1996. This new standard did
not affect the financial position of the Company.

     As discussed more fully in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company adopted a new accounting standard for income taxes (SFAS 109) in the
first quarter of fiscal 1994. This new standard did not significantly impact the
financial statements of the Company.

     The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) has  established  a new
accounting  standard relating to the accounting for the impairment of long-lived
assets (FAS 121). FAS 121 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1995. It is anticipated that this new standard will not affect the financial
position of the Company.

INFLATION

     Although not significant, inflation continues to cause increases in product
and  occupancy  costs.  The effects of these cost  increases  are  minimized  by
increased selling prices and operating efficiencies.

Little Ferry, New Jersey


    We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of The Valley
Fair  Corporation  (a  subsidiary  of  Schottenstein   Stores  Corporation)  and
subsidiary  as of  January  28,  1996 and  January  29,  1995,  and the  related
consolidated statements of income,  stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the
years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion,  the 1996 and 1995  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of The Valley
Fair Corporation and subsidiary as of January 28, 1996 and January 29, 1995, and

                   THE VALLEY FAIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   A.  Reporting Entity and Nature of Business

       The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of The Valley
   Fair Corporation (Valley Fair) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, L.F. Widmann,
   Inc.  (Widmann),  collectively  referred to as "The  Company".  All  material
   intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The majority
   of  the  Company's  stock  (93%)  is  controlled  by   Schottenstein   Stores
   Corporation and affiliated companies (the Parent).

       Valley  Fair  currently  operates,  through  a  combination  of owned and
   licensed  departments,  two discount  stores in the state of New Jersey.  The
   stores sell apparel,  shoes, hard goods, e.g., hardware,  stationery,  health
   and beauty  aids,  as well as food items in a  full-line  supermarket  at one
   location.

       Widmann currently  operates and licenses 127 retail health and beauty aid
   stores  primarily  in  Pennsylvania  and  also in 11 other  Mid-Atlantic  and
   Mid-Western  States.  The stores  sell  non-prescription  proprietary  drugs,
   tobacco,  greeting cards,  stationery,  electronics,  toys, small appliances,
   cosmetics, hair care products and other household items.

       The  Company,  excluding  licensed  departments,  is in  one  segment  of
   business - retail sales to the general public.

       The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday  closest to January 31. The
   fiscal years ended  January 28,  1996,  January 29, 1995 and January 30, 1994
   contained 52 weeks.

   B.  Estimates

       The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
   accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management to make  estimates and
   assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions  affect the reported amounts of
   assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
   the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
   expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
   estimates.

   C.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

       The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
   maturity of three months or less to be cash  equivalents.  Approximately  49%
   and 37% of cash and cash  equivalents  as of January 28, 1996 and January 29,
   1995,  respectively,  were held in bankers acceptances.  Substantially all of
   the remaining cash and cash  equivalents were maintained in accounts with two
   banks.
<PAGE>
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 D.   Merchandise Inventories

      Merchandise  inventories  are  valued  at the  lower  of  cost  (first-in,
 first-out basis) or market  determined by the retail inventory method for store
 inventories and an average cost method for the warehouse inventory.

      During 1996, the Company improved the estimates used to allocate  overhead
 to warehouse inventory.  As a result of this change, overhead cost allocated to
 inventory was approximately $340,000 greater than if the old estimates had been
 used.

 E.   Property and Equipment

      Depreciation  is provided by the  straight-line  method over the estimated
useful lives of assets.

      Maintenance  and  repairs  which are not  considered  to extend the useful
 lives  of  assets  are  charged  to  operations  as  incurred.   Additions  and
 improvements are capitalized.  Upon sale or retirement,  the cost of assets and
 related  allowances  are removed from the accounts and any  resulting  gains or
 losses are included in other income (expense).

 F.   Store Opening and Closing Costs

      Expenditures  of a non-capital  nature  incurred prior to the opening of a
 new store are charged to operations  as incurred.  Costs of closing a store are
 expensed in the year in which the store is closed.

 G.   Income Taxes

      Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions  reported in
 the financial  statements and consist of taxes currently due and deferred taxes
 relating to temporary differences.  The primary differences are in the basis of
 property and equipment and deferred  compensation  between financial and income
 tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax
 return  consequences  of those  differences,  which  will  either be taxable or
 deductible when the assets and  liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred
 taxes  also are  recognized  for  operating  losses  and tax  credits  that are
 available to offset future Federal and state taxable income. (See also Note 8.)

 H.   Reclassifications

      Certain  reclassifications  have been made to the 1995 and 1994  financial
  statements in order to conform to 1996 presentations.
<PAGE>
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 I.   Net Income Per Common Share

      Net  income  per  common  share has been  computed  based on the  weighted
 average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods.

Note 2 - Transactions with Affiliates

 Valley Fair has entered into license  agreements for tenant departments with an
affiliated company of its Parent. The consolidated  statements of income include
rental  income  earned  from  these  licenses  with   affiliated   companies  of
approximately $2,347,000 in 1996, $2,312,000 in 1995 and $2,243,000 in 1994.

 Widmann's  has entered into  agreements  to lease  tenant  retail space from an
affiliated  company of Schottenstein  Stores  Corporation.  Rents are based on a
percentage  of  sales.   The  related  rental  expense  (Note  7)  incurred  was
approximately $2,195,000 in 1996, $2,329,000 in 1995, and $2,498,000 in 1994. In
addition,  Widmann is  charged  approximately  2.9% of sales in those  stores as
reimbursement for certain store operating expenses.

 The  accounts  receivable  and  payable -  affiliate  are a result of the above
transactions.

 The Company was charged $125,000 per year in 1996, 1995, and 1994 by the Parent
for certain administrative services provided.

Note 9 - Retirement and Savings Plan

   The  Company  has  a  defined  contribution   retirement  plan  which  covers
substantially  all of its  employees.  The Plan is a cash  deferred  arrangement
described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k). The Company's contribution to
the Plan was $100,000 each in 1996, 1995, and 1994.

   The Plan provides that  employees of the Company may elect to defer a certain
portion of their  compensation and contribute to the Plan. The Corporation makes
discretionary contributions as prescribed by the Plan.

Note 10 - Contingencies

   The Company is a defendant in various legal actions and claims arising in the
ordinary  course of business.  After taking into  consideration  legal counsel's
evaluation  of such actions,  management is of the opinion that such  litigation
and claims will be resolved without  material effect on the Company's  financial
condition or will be covered by the Company's liability insurance.

Note 11 - Financial Instruments

   The  Company has several  financial  instruments,  none of which are held for
trading  purposes.  The Company  estimates  that the fair value of all financial
instruments at December 31, 1995, does not differ  materially from the aggregate
carrying  values  of its  financial  instruments  recorded  in the  accompanying
balance  sheet.  The fair value amounts have been estimated by the Company using
available   market   information   and  appropriate   valuation   methodologies.
Considerable  judgement is required in  interpreting  market data to develop the
estimates of fair value and,  accordingly,  the  estimates  are not  necessarily
indicative  of the amounts that the Company  could  realize in a current  market
exchange.

Note 12 - Subsequent Event

   In March 1996, the Company decided to close 16  unprofitable  Widmann stores.
As a  result  of  these  closings,  the  Company  expects  to have a  charge  to
operations of  approximately  $835,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1997. This
charge includes  approximately $635,000 of anticipated writedowns in inventories
to liquidation value.

Item 9 - Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
         Financial Disclosure

   In  December  1994,  the  Corporation  terminated  KPMG Peat  Marwick  LLP as
independent  auditors for the  Corporation for the fiscal year ended January 29,
1995 and engaged Alpern, Rosenthal & Company.

     The  independent  auditor's  report  on  the  financial  statements  of the
Corporation  for fiscal 1994 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer as
to  uncertainty,  audit scope or accounting  principles.  The decision to change
accountants was approved by the Board of Directors.

   In connection  with the fiscal year ended January 30, 1994 and the subsequent
interim period through  December 15, 1994,  there was no disagreement  with KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices,  financial
statement disclosure, or audit scope or procedures which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction  of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP,  would have caused KPMG Peat Marwick LLP
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report.
