Item 1.  Business

       USAA Real Estate Income Investments I Limited Partnership
(the "Partnership") is a limited partnership formed in August
1984, under the  California Revised Limited Partnership Act.  The
Partnership has two primary business purposes:  (i) to purchase
qualified income producing real properties; and (ii) to make
participating first mortgage loans on qualified income producing
properties.  To the extent possible (i) all acquisitions of real
property will be made for cash (no acquisition indebtedness will
be incurred) and (ii) participating first mortgage loans will
earn fixed interest and will contain participation rights in the
underlying property's cash flow and net proceeds of sale or
refinancing and other items, or both.  

       Defined terms contained herein shall have the meaning set
forth in the Glossary contained in the Partnership Prospectus
dated November 16, 1984, filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) attached
as Exhibit 99.a, and incorporated herein by this reference.

       The Partnership sold $27,305,000 in Units of Limited
Partnership Interests (54,610 Units at $500 per Unit) from the
commencement of the offering of Units on or about January 15,
1985, through the completion of the offering on May 30, 1985. 
Limited Partners are not required to make any additional capital
contributions.

       Proceeds available to the Partnership for investment were
used to acquire Volusia Point Shopping Center in 1985.  In 1986,
the Partnership acquired one property (the Systech building,
formerly called Computer Associates Office Building) and funded
one first mortgage loan (Plaza on the Lake).  Remaining offering
proceeds were used to repay the mortgage indebtedness on the
Systech building upon its maturity in 1988.  See "Item 2. 
Properties".

       Competitive conditions for the Partnership's properties
in 1995 were as follows:  

       Volusia Point Shopping Center, located in Daytona Beach,
Florida is in the northwestern portion of Volusia County, at the
corner of U.S. Highway 92 (Volusia Avenue) and Bill Francis
Boulevard.  The shopping center is across the street from Volusia
Mall and the Daytona International Speedway, allowing the retail
tenants to take advantage of the significant volume of traffic
that is attracted to the area.  In the past, the Volusia County
and Daytona Beach economy was based primarily on tourism and
industry, although an increase in recent years in medical and
trade services has resulted in continued growth.  Occupancy at
Volusia Point decreased steadily throughout 1995 to 88% at year
end, compared to an average of 95% in the surrounding retail
market.  Lease rates of competitive retail centers during the
fourth quarter of 1995 were between $8.00 and $14.50 gross per
square foot, compared to $10.00 to $11.00 at Volusia Point.

<PAGE>
       The Systech building located, in San Diego, California,
was vacated in August 1993 upon lease expiration of the prior
single tenant, and remained vacant throughout 1994 during
building renovations and improvements for the new tenant, the
Systech Corporation.  The Systech Corporation occupied 42,890
square feet of the building beginning February 1995, and is
scheduled to begin paying rent on the remaining 10,204 square
feet of the building in March 1996.  During the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1993, the Partnership recorded rental
income of approximately $414,000 and $856,000, respectively, from
two major tenants at this property.  This income represented 37%
and 55% of total rental income of the Partnership for 1995 and
1993, respectively.

       Due to the configuration of the Systech building, it
competes in both the research and development (R&D) and office
markets of the Sorrento Valley submarket of San Diego.  By the
end of 1995, occupancy in the San Diego office market increased
2% to approximately 88% and the R & D market occupancy averaged
90%.

       Plaza on the Lake, located in Austin, Texas, is the
underlying asset for the mortgage loan funded by the Partnership. 
On January 31, 1996, per the terms of the loan documents, the
Partnership received the full principal balance of the mortgage
loan from the borrower.  

       See "Item 2 Properties" for further information
pertaining to the status of the Partnership's properties.

       The Partnership has no employees; it has, however,
entered into an Advisory Agreement with USAA Real Estate Company
(the "Advisor"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital
Corporation, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United
Services Automobile Association ("USAA").  The Advisor is
responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the
Partnership. 
                    
       The General Partner of the Partnership is USAA Investors
I, Inc. (the "General Partner"), a Texas corporation and a
subsidiary of the Advisor.  The General Partner has the general
responsibility for management of the Partnership's business and
oversees the activities of the Advisor.

PART II

Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Limited Partnership Units
         and Related Security Holder Matters

       There is no established public trading market for the
Limited Partnership Units ("the Units"), and it is not
anticipated that a public market will develop.  Upon request,
Real Estate Limited Partnership Investor Services, a department
in USAA Real Estate Company, may assist a Limited Partner
desiring to transfer his Units.  The purchase price for the Units
upon resale and all other terms of a resale transaction are
subject to negotiations between the buyer and the seller.  The
limited market for the Units may adversely affect the value of
the Units. 

       As of December 31, 1995, there were 6,374 Limited
Partners of the Partnership, owning an aggregate of 54,610 Units.

       During the year ended December 31, 1995, quarterly
distributions totaling $873,760 and $8,826 were distributed to
the Limited Partners and the General Partner, respectively, for a
total of $882,586 in cash distributions.  The return of capital
portion of 1995 distributions was $232,975 and $2,354 for the
Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively. 

       During the year ended December 31, 1994, quarterly
distributions totaling $873,760 and $8,825 were distributed to
the Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively, for a
total of $882,585 in cash distributions.  The return of capital
portion of 1994 distributions was $442,071 and $4,465 for the
Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively.

       Future cash distributions to Limited Partners are
currently anticipated.  As a result of the reduced cash flow of
the Partnership that will result subsequent to the repayment of
the mortgage loan receivable in January 1996 and distribution to
the Limited Partners of the proceeds, net of any reserves,
quarterly distributions to Partners will be decreased beginning
in the first quarter of 1996.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At December 31, 1995, the Partnership had cash of $23,003 and
temporary investments of $343,834.  The Partnership's cash
equivalents decreased during 1995 as it paid for building and
tenant improvements and lease commissions at the Systech building
and paid quarterly distributions to the Partners.

Accounts receivable consisted primarily of amounts due from
tenants at Volusia Point.  Deferred charges and other assets
consisted of lease commissions, and deferred rent which resulted
from recognition of income as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.  Accounts payable included amounts due to
affiliates for management fees and reimbursable expenses.

On January 31, 1996, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage
loan agreement between USAA Real Estate Income Investments I
Limited Partnership, as lender, and USAA Real Estate Company, as
borrower, the principal balance of the $5,440,000 mortgage loan
receivable was received by the Partnership and the underlying
note paid in full.  During the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, the Partnership recorded interest income on the
mortgage loan receivable of $612,757, $605,535 and $604,295,
respectively.

During 1995, the Partnership distributed $873,760 in cash to
Limited Partners and $8,826 to the General Partner. 
Distributions were unchanged from amounts paid in 1994. 
Quarterly distributions to Partners will be decreased beginning
in the first quarter of 1996 due to the loss of interest income
that was generated from the mortgage loan receivable.  Management
evaluates reserves and the availability of funds for distribution
to the partners on a continuing basis based on anticipated
leasing activity and cash flows available from the Partnership
investments.

The lease between the Partnership and the Systech Corporation
commenced in March 1995.  The initial lease term is for five
years with a three year renewal option at prevailing market
rental rates.  Systech Corporation occupied 42,890 square feet of
the Systech building in February 1995 with rent commencing March
1995, and is scheduled to begin paying rent on the remaining
10,204 square feet of the building in March 1996.  The final
phase of the tenant improvements of $84,400 for the remainder of
the building has been deferred.  The rental rate per square foot
for Systech Corporation is lower than the rental rate for the
previous tenant and reflects current rental market conditions in
the area surrounding the property.  In January 1996, in addition
to rent, the tenant began paying property operating expenses
which exceed those of 1995, the base year.

<PAGE>
Future liquidity is expected to result from cash generated from
operations of the properties and ultimately through the sale of
such properties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1995, income was generated from rental income on the properties,
interest income and participation income earned on the mortgage
loan, and interest income earned on the funds invested in
temporary investments.  As the Systech building was vacant from
August 1993 through January 1995, the only income generated by
that property during that time period was the final settlement
received in the fourth quarter of 1994 from the prior tenant.

Expenses incurred during the same periods were associated with
the operations of the Partnership's properties and various other
costs required for the administration of the Partnership.

Net income was higher in 1995 than in 1994 primarily due to the
March 1995 commencement of the lease at the Systech building. 
The resulting increase in rental revenue was partially offset by
an increase in depreciation expense for the improvements at the
Systech building.  The increase in net income in 1994 from 1993
was primarily the result of the investment property write-down of
the Systech building in 1993.  Notwithstanding the investment
property write-down, net income decreased in 1994 from 1993 as a
result of the August 1993 expiration of the previous single-tenant 
lease at the Systech building.  The Systech building
remained vacant throughout 1994 during successful re-tenanting
efforts.  Occupancy at Volusia Point decreased from 93% at
December 31, 1994 to 88% one year later, with a consistent
decrease in rental revenue and reimbursable operating expenses.  

The majority of the increase in direct expenses for the year
ended December 31, 1995 from the prior year was attributable to
the increase in operating expenses at the Systech building that
coincided with the increase in occupancy, and the increase in
depreciation expense that resulted from the addition of building
and tenant improvements at that property.  Direct expenses were
lower for the year ended December 31, 1994 than in the prior year
as a result of the decrease in property management fees at the
Systech building, and the decrease in depreciation that resulted
from the investment property write-down of the Systech building
in September 1993.  These decreases in expense were offset by a
decrease in tenant reimbursement of expenses at the same
property.

Participation income from the mortgage loan increased in each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995 due to
increased gross revenues at Plaza on the Lake, the property
underlying the mortgage loan receivable.  Interest income on
funds held for investment were lower for the year ended December
31, 1995 than for the prior year due to the decrease in cash held
by the Partnership.  Interest income increased slightly from 1993
to 1994 due to higher cash balances as reserves were maintained.

<PAGE>
General and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent
for the three years ended December 31, 1995.  The majority of the
increase in expenses in 1994 from 1993 was due to an increase in
legal charges associated with the lease negotiations at the
Systech building, and settlement proceedings at Volusia Point and
with the former tenant of the Systech building.  Also
contributing to the increase in these expenses from 1993 to 1994
was the increase in the Partnership's postage charges.  Although
general and administrative expenses were stable overall from 1994
to 1995, there was an increase in lease commission amortization
expense which was offset by a decrease in legal expenses.

The Partnership's management fee is based on cash flow from
operations of the Partnership adjusted for cash reserves and
fluctuated accordingly.  The decrease in the management fee for
the year ended December 31, 1994 from the prior year was a result
of the August 1993 lease expiration at the Systech building and
the increase in reserves for future property improvements.  The
increase in the management fee for 1995 was consistent with the
increase in rental revenue at the Systech building.

INFLATION

An increase in inflation could affect the Partnership's
investments through increases in the costs of operating and
maintaining the properties acquired and in various administrative
costs of Partnership operation.  The adverse effect inflation may
have on operating expenses would be offset to some extent by
increases in rental rates charged tenants at the Partnership's
properties.  If high occupancy levels are maintained at the
properties, increases in rental income should offset increasing
property operating expenses with a minimal effect on operating
income.

                       LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993

1.       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         USAA Real Estate Income Investments I Limited Partnership is
         engaged solely in the business of real estate investment,
         therefore, presentation of information about industry
         segments is not applicable.  The General Partner, USAA
         Investors I, Inc., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Real
         Estate Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA
         Capital Corporation, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
         United Services Automobile Association (USAA).

         At December 31, 1995, the Partnership owned a shopping
         center located in Daytona Beach, Florida, an office building
         located in San Diego, California and a first mortgage loan
         on a property located in Austin, Texas.  The Partnership's
         revenue is subject to changes in the economic environments
         of these areas.

         Rental properties are valued at cost.  The carrying amount
         of a property is not changed for temporary fluctuations in
         value unless the carrying value is believed to be
         permanently impaired.  In 1995, the Partnership adopted the
         provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
         No. 121, "Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and
         for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of," (Statement 121). 
         Statement 121 provides guidance for determining impairment
         of long-lived assets utilizing undiscounted future cash
         flows.  Based on the provisions of Statement 121, the
         Partnership's long-lived assets, real estate and
         improvements are not considered impaired.  The adoption of
         this Statement had no financial statement impact.
         
         For purposes of the statements of cash flows, all highly
         liquid marketable securities that have a maturity at
         purchase of three months or less and money market mutual
         funds are considered to be cash equivalents.  

         Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
         properties using the straight-line method.  The estimated
         lives of the buildings and improvements are 30 years (19 -
         39 years for Federal income tax purposes).

         Rental income is recognized under the operating method,
         whereby aggregate rentals are reported as income on the
         straight-line basis over the life of the lease.  Rental
         income recognized was $65,461 and $68,669 more than the
         amount due per the lease agreements for the years ended
         December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, and $105,164 less
         than the amount due per the lease agreements for the year
         ended December 31, 1993.

<PAGE>
         No provision or credit for income taxes has been made as the
         liability for such taxes is that of the Partners rather than
         the Partnership.  The Partnership files its tax return on an
         accrual basis.

         For financial reporting purposes, net income (loss) is
         allocated 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the Limited
         Partners.  Net income (loss) per limited partnership unit is
         based upon the limited partnership units outstanding at the
         end of the period and the net income (loss) allocated to the
         Limited Partners.

         Cash distributions per limited partnership unit were $16.00
         during 1995 and 1994 and $20.00 during 1993 and were based
         on the limited partnership units outstanding at each quarter
         end and the cash distributions allocated to Limited
         Partners.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
         generally accepted accounting principles requires management
         to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
         contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
         financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
         and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results
         could differ from those estimates.
 
2.       Partnership Agreement

         Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, all net
         cash flow shall be distributed in the ratio of 1% to the
         General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners within 60
         days after the close of each fiscal quarter.  Generally, net
         taxable income or losses not arising from the sale or
         refinancing of properties of the Partnership are allocated
         99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner. 

         Residual proceeds are allocated first to the Limited
         Partners until the Limited Partners shall receive an amount
         equal to their adjusted capital contributions plus an amount
         which when added to all prior distributions to Limited
         Partners equals a 9% per annum cumulative return on their
         adjusted capital contributions; second, to all Partners, in
         an amount equal to their respective positive capital account
         balances to the extent such balances exceed the amounts
         provided for in the preceding clauses; third, in the case of
         any sale of a property, a real estate brokerage commission
         to the Advisor as provided in the Partnership Agreement; and
         fourth, the balance, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to
         the General Partner.

         Generally, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
         credit from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited
         Partners and 1% to the General Partner.  Net taxable gain or
         loss from the sale or other disposition of a property shall
         be allocated as described in the Partnership Agreement.

3.       Rental Properties

         Rental properties at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                          1995            1994

           depreciation               (5,455,502)      (5,071,846)
                                     $10,438,578       10,420,520

4.       Provision for Investment Property Write-down

         The Systech building, located in San Diego, California was
         vacant from September 1993 through February 1995 due to the
         expiration of the single-tenant lease in August 1993.  The
         economic slowdown in Southern California resulted in low
         rental rates and a weak market for rental space.  In
         addition, substantial expenditures for tenant improvements
         and lease commissions were made to re-lease the property.  

         Under generally accepted accounting principles, the
         Partnership provides for a permanent impairment of value on a
         property when it becomes probable that the property cannot
         recover its cost basis, reduced by depreciation, during its
         expected holding period.  Through detailed analysis, a
         permanent impairment of value is estimated by comparing
         depreciated cost to market value, which is determined by the
         expected sales price of the building and internal
         computations.  Any loss in value deemed permanent is
         recognized as a write-down in the value of that property. 
         Through this method of analysis, in 1993, the Systech
         building was determined to have sustained a permanent
         impairment of value and an investment property write-down of
         $6,500,000 was recorded at September 30, 1993.  

5.       Mortgage Loan Receivable from Affiliate

         On January 31, 1986, the Partnership funded a first mortgage
         loan in the amount of $5,440,000 with interest at 10% due
         January 31, 1996 to Plaza on the Lake Investors, Ltd.  In
         addition to the interest income, the Partnership received
         3.2% of the gross revenues of the property through year six
         and 3.84% in years seven through ten.  The Partnership earned
         $68,757, $61,535 and $60,295 in participation income for the
         years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  

         The terms of the mortgage loan agreement allowed for the
         Partnership to receive a prepayment penalty in the event the
         note was prepaid.  USAA Real Estate Company, the parent of
         the General Partner, held a second mortgage note on Plaza on
         the Lake.  On February 9, 1987, as allowed in the loan
         documents, upon default of the borrower, USAA Real Estate 

<PAGE>
         Company accepted a deed on the property effective January 1,
         1987, and replaced Plaza on the Lake Investors, Ltd. as the
         borrower on the first lien held by the Partnership.  All
         terms and conditions contained in the original documents
         remained as originally written.

         On January 31, 1996, in accordance with the terms of the
         mortgage loan agreement between USAA Real Estate Income
         Investments I Limited Partnership and USAA Real Estate
         Company, the principal balance of the $5,440,000 mortgage
         loan receivable was received by the Partnership and the
         underlying note paid in full.

         During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the
         Partnership recorded interest income on the mortgage loan
         receivable of $612,757, $605,535 and $604,295, respectively.

         The following is summarized financial information for the
         years ended December 31 for Plaza on the Lake, the underlying
         property of the mortgage loan receivable.

         (1)  A provision for investment property write-down of
              $1,000,000 was recorded in 1993.

6.       Minimum Future Rentals

         Operating leases with tenants have remaining terms from one
         to thirteen years. Minimum future rentals are cash payments
         to be received under non-cancelable leases over the lease
         terms and do not necessarily represent rental income under
         generally accepted accounting principles.  Rental income
         reported in the Statements of Operations is recognized under
         the operating method, whereby aggregate rentals are reported
         as income on the straight-line basis over the life of the
         lease.  Approximate minimum future rentals are as follows:

                         1996            $ 1,209,000
                         1997              1,221,000
                         1998              1,242,000
                         1999              1,196,000
                         2000                394,000

         estate brokerage commissions of up to 1% of the aggregate
         selling prices of properties sold, management fees of up to
         4% of gross revenues from operations or 9% of the
         Partnership's adjusted cash flow, and an annual mortgage
         servicing fee of up to 1/4 of 1% of amounts funded by the
         Partnership in mortgage loans which are serviced by the
         Advisor.

         Through January 1995, a portion of the Partnership's working
         capital reserve and other available funds were invested in

9.       Major Customer Information

         During the years ended December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1993,
         the Partnership recorded rental income of approximately $414,000
         and $856,000, respectively, from two major tenants in the
         computer industry.  This income represented approximately 37%
         and 55% of total rental income for 1995 and 1993, respectively.

10.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
         payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximates
         fair value because of the short-term nature of these
         instruments.
               
         The fair value of the mortgage loan receivable at December 31,
         1995 was $5,440,000, its face value, due to the short-term to
         maturity of January 31, 1996.  The fair value of the mortgage
         loan receivable was approximately $5,426,860 at December 31,
         1994, and was estimated by discounting the future cash flows
         using interest rates being offered at that time for mortgage
         loans with similar characteristics and maturities.

includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USAA

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 

1.       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         Pursuant to the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin
         No. 71, a registrant is to file separate audited financial
         statements for a property which is the underlying asset of a
         mortgage loan when the balance of the mortgage loan is
         greater than or equal to 20% of the registrant's total
         assets.  In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X,
         financial statements are to be filed for the same periods
         and dates as the audited financial statements of the
         registrant.  These separate financial statements are
         required to be audited only for those fiscal years for which
         the 20% test is met.

         Plaza on the Lake, a three-story office building in Austin,
         Texas, became a wholly-owned property of USAA Real Estate
         Company effective January 1, 1987.  USAA Real Estate Company
         originally held a second mortgage on this property until the
         default of the borrower on February 9, 1987, at which time
         USAA Real Estate Company accepted a deed to the property and
         replaced the borrower on the first lien held by USAA Real
         Estate Income Investments I Limited Partnership.

         The rental property is valued at cost less provisions for
         investment property write-down.  See note 3.

         In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
         issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
         "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and
         Assets to be Disposed Of" (FAS No. 121).  The statement,
         which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
         15, 1995, requires that an entity evaluate long-lived assets
         and certain other identifiable intangible assets for
         impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
         indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be
         recoverable.  An impairment loss meeting the recognition
         criteria is to be measured as the amount by which the
         carrying amount for financial reporting purposes exceeds the
         fair value of the asset.

         Generally, for properties to be held and used, FAS No. 121
         would require recognition of an impairment loss if the
         undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of
         the asset.  Based on management's current estimates of the
         undiscounted future cash flows of Plaza on the Lake, the
         cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the property.  The
         cash flows ultimately realized may be more or less than the
         amounts used in this analysis.  USAA Real Estate Company
         plans to adopt FAS No. 121 in 1996 and does not expect the
         adoption of the statement to have a material effect, if any,
         on Plaza on the Lake's financial position or results of
         operations.
<PAGE>
         Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of
         the property using the straight-line method.  The estimated
         life of the building and improvements is 45 years.  

         Rental income is recognized under the operating method,
         whereby aggregate rentals are reported as income on the
         straight-line basis over the life of the lease.  Rental
         income recognized was $86,821, $117,672 and $102,588 more
         than the amount due per the lease agreements for the years
         ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

         No provision for income taxes has been made because the
         property is not a separate taxable entity.

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
         generally accepted accounting principles requires management
         to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
         contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
         financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
         and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results
         could differ from those estimates.

2.       Rental Property

         Rental property at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                             1995            1994

         Building and Improvements      $ 8,966,658       8,837,734
         Land                             2,007,473       2,007,473
                                         10,974,131      10,845,207
         Less accumulated depreciation   (3,314,238)     (3,142,604)
                                        $ 7,659,893       7,702,603

3.       Provision for Investment Property Write-down

         Under generally accepted accounting principles, USAA Real
         Estate Company provides for a permanent impairment of value
         on a property when it becomes probable that the property
         cannot recover its cost basis, reduced by depreciation,
         during its expected holding period.  Through detailed
         analysis, a permanent impairment of value is estimated by
         comparing a property's depreciated cost to its market value,
         which is estimated based on the expected sales price of the
         property, or internal computations.  Any loss in value
         deemed permanent is recognized as a write-down in value of
         that property.  In 1993, USAA Real Estate Company determined
         that Plaza on the Lake had sustained a permanent impairment
         of value.  An investment property write-down of $1,000,000
         was recorded in 1993. 

<PAGE>
4.       Minimum Future Rentals

         Operating leases with tenants have remaining terms from one
         to five years.  Minimum future rentals are cash payments to
         be received under non-cancelable leases over the lease terms
         and do not necessarily represent rental income under
         generally accepted accounting principles.  Rental income
         reported in the Statements of Operations is recognized under
         the operating method, whereby aggregate rentals are reported
         as income on the straight-line basis over the life of the
         lease.  Approximate minimum future rentals are as follows:

                                       1996            $1,650,000
                                       1997             1,553,000
                                       1998             1,138,000
                                       1999             1,142,000
                                       2000               189,000
                                       Thereafter              --
                                                       $5,672,000

5.       Mortgage Payable

         On February 9, 1987, as allowed in the loan documents, upon
         default of the borrower, USAA Real Estate Company accepted a
         deed on the property effective January 1, 1987, and replaced
         Plaza on the Lake Investors, Ltd. as the borrower on the
         first lien held by the USAA Real Estate Income Investments I
         Limited Partnership.  This mortgage loan was in the amount
         of $5,440,000 with interest at 10% due monthly.

         In addition to the interest income, the Partnership received
         3.2% of the gross revenues of the property through year six
         and received 3.84% of the gross revenues of the property in
         years seven through ten.  Interest expense included $68,757,
         $61,535 and $60,295 relating to the lender's participation
         in gross revenues for the years ended 1995, 1994 and 1993,
         respectively.  Total interest payments in 1995, 1994 and
         1993 were $609,732, $607,729 and $603,918, respectively. 
         The carrying value of the mortgage payable approximates fair
         value at December 31, 1995 due to the short term to maturity
         of January 31, 1996.

         On January 31, 1996, in accordance with the terms of the
         mortgage loan agreement between USAA Real Estate Company, as
         borrower, and USAA Real Estate Income Investments I Limited
         Partnership, as lender, the principal balance of the
         $5,440,000 mortgage loan payable was paid by the borrower
         and the underlying note paid in full.

6.       Major Customer Information

         During each of the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
         1993, approximately $542,000, $535,000 and $535,000 of
         rental income was recorded from a single tenant in the
         telecommunications industry which represented approximately
         35%, 35% and 36% of total rental income, respectively.

<PAGE>
         During the year ended December 31, 1995, $282,000 and
         $172,000 of rental income was recorded from two other
         tenants at Plaza on the Lake, representing approximately 18%
         and 11% of total rental income, respectively.
  
         At December 31, 1995, Plaza on the Lake had $175,130, net of
         allowance of $664,912, of deferred rent and a $39,795 note
         receivable due from a tenant in the telecommunications
         industry.

7.       Economic Dependency

         Plaza on the Lake has incurred net losses of $77,393,
         $274,968 and $1,469,807 for the years ended December 31,
         1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Cash deficits generated
         by the property are being funded by USAA Real Estate
         Company.  USAA Real Estate Company intends to continue
         funding the property's operating and capital requirements
         through cash contributions.

                   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDER
USAA REAL ESTATE COMPANY:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Plaza on
the Lake as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
statements of operations and owner's equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1995.  In connection with our audits of the financial statements,
we also have audited the financial statement schedules as listed
in Item 14(d) of Form 10-K.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Property's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Plaza on the Lake as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

(1)  The Partnership will commit not less than 85% of the gross
     proceeds of this offering to Investment in Properties. (See
     "Glossary".)

(2)  The Partnership will provide USAA Investment Management
     Company with a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 2%
     of the gross proceeds of the offering to cover expenses
     incurred in connection with the formation of the Partnership
     and the offering and sale of the Units.  Further, the General
     Partner and its Affiliates will be reimbursed by the
     Partnership for: (i) the actual cost to the General Partner,
     the Advisor or their Affiliates of goods and materials used
     for or by the Partnership and obtained from entities which are
     not affiliated with the General Partner, or Advisor, (ii)
     salaries and related salary expenses for certain services
     which could be performed directly for the Partnership by
     independent parties (subject to certain limitations set forth
     in the Partnership Agreement), and (iii) the cost of
     Partnership reports and communications to Limited Partners. 
     No reimbursement under (ii) or (iii) above is permitted for
     services for which the General Partner or any of its
     Affiliates receives a separate fee.  The following items are
     excluded from the allowable reimbursement: (i) salaries,
     fringe benefits, travel expenses and other administrative
     items incurred or allocated to persons controlling the General
     Partner, the Advisor, or their Affiliates and (ii) any
     overhead expenses of the General Partner, the Advisor or its
     Affiliates, such as rent, depreciation, utilities, capital
     equipment and other administrative items.  The Partnership's
     annual report to Limited Partners will include a breakdown of
     reimbursements made to the General Partner, the Advisor, and
     their Affiliates.  Reimbursements for expenses will be made to
     the General Partner, Advisor and their Affiliates regardless
     of whether any distributions are made to the Limited Partners.

(3)  The set-up and custodial fee to be paid by the Sales Agent to
     the Bank is a one-time fee.  Any further annual custodial or
     maintenance fee charged by the Bank for IRAs set up by it must
     be paid directly by the IRA participant.

(4)  The Advisor or its Affiliates (other than the Partnership or
     the General Partner) will receive Loan Origination and
     Commitment Fees from borrowers and prospective borrowers as
     compensation for its services in connection with the
     Partnership's receipt of loan applications and issuance of
     commitments to make Mortgage Loans, subject to the limitations
     described below.  The total amount of such Loan Origination
     and Commitment Fees to be paid by borrowers plus the total
     Acquisition Fees paid by the Partnership to the Advisor or its
     Affiliates will not exceed 4% of the Gross Proceeds of the
     offering or a maximum of $1,000,000 (subject to increase to
     $1,150,000 if the Additional Rights Units described under Plan
     of Distribution are fully exercised by the General Partner),
     which is equivalent to approximately 4.2% of the proceeds of
     the offering net of selling commissions.  Any Loan Origination
     and Commitment Fees paid by borrowers or prospective borrowers 

<PAGE>
     in excess of 4% of the Gross Proceeds of the offering will be
     remitted by the Advisor to the Partnership.  Such excess fees
     will be retained by the Partnership to make additional
     Partnership investments or for Reserves.  If the Partnership
     uses mortgage principal repayments (which do not constitute
     Residual Proceeds) to make additional Mortgage Loans or to
     purchase additional Real Property, the Advisor or its
     affiliates may receive additional Loan Origination or
     Commitment Fees, subject, however, to the restriction that the
     Advisor and such Affiliates may not receive such additional
     fees if the aggregate of all Acquisition Fees and Loan
     Origination and Commitment Fees, including the additional
     fees, exceeds 4% of the Gross Proceeds of the offering.  To
     the extent that borrowers and prospective borrowers pay Loan
     Origination and Commitment Fees to the Advisor or such
     Affiliates, the effect will be to increase the aggregate cost
     to borrowers of the combined interest, fees and other charges
     payable on Mortgage Loans made by the Partnership.  To the
     extent the payment of such fees reduces the fixed interest
     rates or additional interest based on cash flow, sales
     proceeds or other amounts which borrowers would otherwise be
     willing to pay on a Mortgage Loan, such fees (although paid by
     the borrowers) may be borne economically by the Partnership.

(5)  It is presently anticipated that properties securing Mortgage
     Loans made by the Partnership will be managed by unaffiliated
     management firms.  Neither USAA, the General Partner, the
     Advisor, nor any Affiliate of any of them is currently engaged
     in providing property management services to unrelated
     parties.  However, USAA, the General Partner, the Advisor, or
     Affiliates, may in the future enter the property management
     business.  If that were to occur the services of such
     affiliated management company would likely be used by the
     General Partner to manage its properties and might also be
     used by a borrower under a Mortgage Loan to manage the
     property securing such loan.  However, if such an affiliate
     management company if formed and its services used by the
     General Partner, the Advisor or a borrower, its compensation
     for such services will be limited to the lesser of the
     competitive fee for similar services in the same geographic
     area or (i) 6% of gross revenues from each industrial and
     commercial property if leasing and related services are
     performed; (ii) 3% of gross revenues from each industrial and
     commercial property if no leasing and retners' positive Capital 
     Accounts to zero.  However, in no event will the General Partner 
     be allocated less than 1% of Taxable Income or Tax Loss from a 
     sale or refinancing, mortgage foreclosure or sale.

<PAGE>
     Taxable Income, tax-exempt income and Tax Losses with respect
to the period after the first admission of investors as Limited
Partners and prior to the termination of the offering will be
apportioned among Limited Partners based upon a weighted average
which takes account of the number of days that each Limited Partner
was admitted as a Limited Partner.  After all Limited Partners have
been admitted Taxable Income and Tax Losses will be apportioned
among Limited Partners in the ratio of the number of the Units
owned by each of them on the last day of each calendar quarter to
the total number of Units.  Such Taxable Income would include any
amount taxable as ordinary income because of "recapture" gain, as
well as any capital gain.

     Taxable Income or Tax Losses from current operations for any
year will be allocated between a transferor and transferee based
upon the number of quarterly periods that each was recognized as
the Holder of a Unit, without regard to whether Partnership
operations during particular quarterly periods of such year
produced profits or losses or cash distributions.  Residual
Proceeds, if any, arising from the sale or refinancing of a
property or mortgage repayment, foreclosure or sale will be
distributed, and all related Taxable Income or Tax Losses will be
allocated, to the persons recognized as Holders of the Units on the
date on which the particular event occurred.  For this purpose
transfers will be recognized as of the date specified by the
transferor and the transferee in the instrument of assignment or,
if no date is specified, the date of the last acknowledgment of
such instrument.

     The share of Taxable Income and Tax Losses allocable to the
General Partner, in relation to the share of Taxable Income and Tax
Losses allocable to the Limited Partners, is disproportionate based
upon their Capital Contributions to the Partnership.

     PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTING.  In order to carry out provisions of
the Partnership Agreement giving Limited Partners the right to a
cumulative return of their original Capital Contributions before
any Residual Proceeds are distributed to the General Partner,
separate records will be kept by the Partnership showing, for each
partner, his original Capital Contribution and his Adjusted Capital
Contribution.  The Adjusted Capital Contribution of each Partner
will basically represent his original Capital Contribution reduced
by the cumulative amount of all cash distributions made to him of
Residual Proceeds.  (Adjusted Capital Contributions will not be
reduced by reason of any distributions of Net Cash Flow and will
bear no relation to tax basis for the Units.)

     In addition, in order to give effect to the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement governing the treatment of Residual Proceeds,
as summarized above, separate records will also be kept showing a
Capital Account for each Partner.  Initially, the Capital Account
of each partner will be the amount of his original Capital
Contribution.  The Capital Account of each Partner will be reduced
to the extent of Tax Losses and other deductions allocated and Net 

<PAGE>
Cash Flow distributed to such Partner, but increased to the extent
of Taxable Income and any tax-exempt income allocated to each
Partner.  Reductions of a Limited Partner's Capital Account in this
manner need not affect his preferential right to a return of his
Capital Contribution out of Residual Proceeds.

     The Partnership will apply to the Service for permission to
use a fiscal year beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of
each year.  If the Service does not authorize the Partnership to
use such a fiscal year, the Partnership shall use a calendar year
as its fiscal year.
