ITEM     1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS


GENERAL

     Vishay Intertechnology,  Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
"Vishay" or the "Company") is a leading international  manufacturer and supplier
of  passive  electronic  components,   particularly  resistors,  capacitors  and
inductors,  offering  its  customers  "one-stop"  access  to  one  of  the  most
comprehensive  passive  electronic  component  lines of any  manufacturer in the
United  States  or  Europe.   Passive  electronic   components,   together  with
semiconductors  (integrated  circuits),  which the Company does not produce, are
the primary elements of every electronic circuit.  The Company  manufactures one
of the  broadest  lines of surface  mount  devices,  a fast  growing  format for
passive electronic  components that is being increasingly demanded by customers.
In addition,  the Company  continues to produce  components  in the  traditional
leaded form.  Components  manufactured  by the Company are used in virtually all
types   of   electronic    products,    including   those   in   the   computer,
telecommunications,  military/aerospace,  instrument,  automotive,  medical  and
consumer electronics industries.

     Since  early  1985,  the  Company  has  pursued a  business  strategy  that
principally consists of the following elements: (i) expansion within the passive
electronic  components  industry,  primarily  through the  acquisition  of other
manufacturers  with  established  positions in major  markets,  reputations  for
product  quality and  reliability  and product  lines with which the Company has
substantial  marketing  and  technical  expertise;  (ii)  reduction  of selling,
general and  administrative  expenses  through the integration or elimination of
redundant  sales  offices and  administrative  functions at acquired  companies;
(iii)  achievement of significant  production  cost savings through the transfer
and expansion of manufacturing  operations to regions,  such as Israel,  Mexico,
Portugal and the Czech  Republic,  where the Company can take advantage of lower
labor costs and available  tax and other  government-sponsored  incentives;  and
(iv) maintaining  significant  production  facilities in those regions where the
Company  markets the bulk of its products in order to enhance  customer  service
and responsiveness.

     As a result of this  strategy,  the Company  has grown  during the past ten
years from a small  manufacturer of precision  resistors and strain gages to one
of the world's  largest  manufacturers  and suppliers of a broad line of passive
electronic components.  During this period, its revenues have increased from $57
million for fiscal year 1985 to $1.2  billion  for the year ended  December  31,
1995, while net profits have increased from $7.9 million to $92.7 million.




<PAGE>




     The Company's  major  acquisitions  have included  Dale  Electronics,  Inc.
(United States, Mexico and the United Kingdom) in 1985, Draloric Electronic GmbH
(Germany  and the United  Kingdom)  in 1987,  Sfernice  S.A.  (France)  in 1988,
Sprague  Electric  Company  ("Sprague")  (United  States  and  France)  in 1992,
Roederstein GmbH  ("Roederstein")  (Germany,  Portugal and the United States) in
1993, and Vitramon,  Incorporated  ("Vitramon") (United States,  France, Germany
and the United  Kingdom) in 1994.  In January 1995,  the Company  acquired a 49%
equity  interest in Nikkohm  Co.,  Ltd.,  a Japanese  manufacturer  of thin film
resistors and resistor  networks.  Nikkohm had sales of approximately $5 million
in 1995. This  acquisition is intended to facilitate the Company's access to the
Japanese electronics market.

     The Company currently operates as three separate business units: (i) Vishay
Electronic  Components,  North  America and Asia,  which is comprised of Dale, a
manufacturer and supplier of resistors, the Vishay Resistive Systems Unit, which
primarily  manufactures  high  performance foil resistors and thin film resistor
networks;  Sprague,  which primarily  manufactures tantalum capacitors;  and the
U.S. operations of Vitramon,  which manufacture  multi-layer ceramic chip (MLCC)
capacitors;  (ii) Vishay Electronic  Components,  Europe,  which is comprised of
Draloric/Roederstein,  German-based manufacturers and suppliers of resistors and
capacitors in Europe, which includes the German operations of Vitramon;  Vishay,
S.A., a resistor  producer in France,  which  includes the French  operations of
Vitramon;  and Vishay  Components  (UK),  a  manufacturer  and  supplier  of the
Company's products in the United Kingdom,  which includes the U.K. operations of
Vitramon;  and (iii) Measurements  Group, Inc., which produces resistive sensors
and other stress measuring devices in the United States.

     Vishay was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1962 and  maintains  its principal
executive offices at 63 Lincoln Highway, Malvern,  Pennsylvania 19355-2120.  The
telephone number is (610) 644-1300.


PRODUCTS

     Vishay designs, manufactures and markets electronic components that cover a
wide range of products and technologies. The products primarily consist of fixed
resistors,  tantalum,  multi- layer ceramic chip  ("MLCC") and film  capacitors,
and, to a lesser extent,  inductors,  aluminum and specialty ceramic capacitors,
transformers,  potentiometers,  plasma  displays  and  thermistors.  The Company
offers most of its product  types in the  increasingly  demanded  surface  mount
device form and in the traditional  leaded device form. The Company  believes it
produces one of the broadest lines of passive  electronic  components  available
from any single manufacturer.

     Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to
adjust and regulate levels of voltage and

                                       -2-



<PAGE>



current.  They  vary  widely in  precision  and cost,  and are  manufactured  in
numerous  materials  and  forms.  Resistive  components  may be either  fixed or
variable,  the distinction being whether the resistance is adjustable (variable)
or not  (fixed).  Resistors  can  also  be used as  measuring  devices,  such as
Vishay's  resistive  sensors.  Resistive  sensors  or  strain  gages are used in
experimental  stress  analysis  systems as well as in transducers for electronic
measurement loads (scales), acceleration and fluid pressure.

     Vishay  manufactures  virtually  all  types  of  fixed  resistors,  both in
discrete and network  forms.  These  resistors are produced for virtually  every
segment of the resistive  product  market,  from  resistors  used in the highest
quality precision  instruments for which the performance of the resistors is the
most important  requirement,  to resistors for which price is the most important
factor.

     Capacitors perform energy storage,  frequency control, timing and filtering
functions in most types of electronic equipment. The more important applications
for  capacitors  are (i)  electronic  filtering for linear and  switching  power
supplies,  (ii)  decoupling  and  bypass of  electronic  signals  or  integrated
circuits  and  circuit  boards,   and  (iii)  frequency   control,   timing  and
conditioning  of  electronic  signals for a broad range of applications.  The
Company's  capacitor  products primarily consist of solid tantalum surface mount
chip capacitors, solid tantalum leaded capacitors, wet/foil tantalum capacitors,
MLCC capacitors, and film capacitors. Each capacitor product has unique physical
and  electrical  performance  characteristics  that make each type of  capacitor
useful for specific  applications.  Tantalum and MLCC  capacitors  are generally
used in conjunction  with integrated  circuits in applications  requiring low to
medium  capacitance values  ("capacitance"  being the measure of the capacitor's
ability to store energy). The tantalum capacitor is the smallest and most stable
type  of  capacitor  for  its  range  of  capacitance  and is  best  suited  for
applications requiring medium capacitance values. MLCC capacitors,  on the other
hand, are more  cost-effective  for  applications  requiring  lower  capacitance
values.  The Company's  MLCC  capacitors are known for their  particularly  high
reliability.  Management  believes  that surface  mounted MLCC chip  capacitors,
tantalum chip  capacitors,  and thick film resistor chips  represent the fastest
growing segments of the passive electronic component industry.

     The Company  believes it has taken  advantage  of the growth of the surface
mount  component  market and is an industry  leader in designing  and  marketing
surface mount  devices.  The Company also believes that in the United States and
Europe it is a market leader in the  development  and production of a wide range
of these  devices,  including  thick film chip  resistors,  thick film  resistor
networks and arrays, metal film leadless resistors (MELFs), molded tantalum chip
capacitors, coated tantalum chip capacitors, film capacitors,

                                       -3-



<PAGE>



multi-layer  ceramic  chip  capacitors,  thin  film  chip  resistors,  thin film
networks,  wirewound chip resistors, power strip resistors, bulk metal foil chip
resistors,  current  sensing chips,  chip  inductors,  chip  transformers,  chip
trimmers  and NTC chip  thermistors.  The  Company  also  provides  a number  of
component  packaging  styles to  facilitate  automated  product  assembly by its
customers.  The Company's position in the surface mount market has been enhanced
by the  acquisition  of  Vitramon,  since  substantially  all of  Vitramon  MLCC
products utilize surface mount  technology.  Surface mount devices adhere to the
surface of a circuit  board rather than being secured by leads that pass through
holes  to the  back  side  of the  board.  Surface  mounting  provides  distinct
advantages over through-hole mounting. For example,  surface mounting allows the
placement of more components on a circuit board, which is particularly desirable
for a growing number of  manufacturers  who require greater  miniaturization  in
products such as hand held computers and cellular  telephones.  Surface mounting
also facilitates  automation,  resulting in lower production costs for equipment
manufacturers than those associated with leaded devices.


MARKETS

     The   Company's   products  are  sold   primarily  to  original   equipment
manufacturers  ("OEMs"), OEM subcontractors that assemble printed circuit boards
and  independent  distributors  that maintain  large  inventories  of electronic
components  for resale to OEMs.  Its products  are used in, among other  things,
virtually  every  type of product  containing  electronic  circuitry,  including
computer-related products, telecommunications, measuring instruments, industrial
equipment,  automotive  applications,  process  control  systems,  military  and
aerospace applications, consumer electronics, medical instruments and scales.

     For the year ended  December 31, 1995,  39% of the  Company's net sales was
attributable  to  customers  in the  United  States,  while  the  remainder  was
attributable to sales primarily in Europe.

     In  the  United   States,   products  are  marketed   through   independent
manufacturers'  representatives,  who are  compensated  solely  on a  commission
basis, by the Company's own sales personnel and by independent distributors. The
Company has regional  sales  personnel in several  North  American  locations to
provide   technical   and   sales   support   for   independent   manufacturers'
representatives  throughout the United States,  Mexico and Canada.  In addition,
the Company uses independent distributors to resell its products.  Outside North
America,  products are sold to customers in Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil and other European and Pacific Rim
countries   through   Company   sales   offices,    independent   manufacturers'
representatives  and distributors.  In order to better serve its customers,  the
Company

                                       -4-



<PAGE>



maintains  production  facilities  in those regions where it markets the bulk of
its products,  such as the U.S.,  Germany,  France and the U.K. In addition,  to
maximize  production  efficiencies,  the Company seeks  whenever  practicable to
establish  manufacturing  facilities in those regions,  such as Israel,  Mexico,
Portugal  and the Czech  Republic,  where it can take  advantage  of lower labor
costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.

     The Company undertakes to have its products incorporated into the design of
electronic  equipment at the research and prototype  stages.  Vishay employs its
own staff of  application  and  field  engineers  who work  with its  customers,
independent  manufacturers'  representatives and distributors to solve technical
problems and develop products to meet specific needs.

     The  Company  has  qualified   certain   products  under  various  military
specifications,  approved and monitored by the United States Defense  Electronic
Supply Center  ("DESC"),  and under certain  European  military  specifications.
Classification  levels  have been  established  by DESC  based  upon the rate of
failure of products to meet  specifications  (the  "Classification  Level").  In
order  to  maintain  the  Classification  Level  of a  product,  tests  must  be
continuously performed, and the results of these tests must be reported to DESC.
If the product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable  Classification
Level,  the product's  classification  may be reduced to a less stringent level.
Various United States  manufacturing  facilities  from time to time experience a
product  Classification  Level modification.  During the time that such level is
reduced for any  specific  product,  net sales and  earnings  derived  from such
product may be adversely affected.

     The Company is undertaking to have the quality systems at most of its major
manufacturing  facilities  approved  under  the ISO 9000  international  quality
control  standard.  ISO 9000 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards
developed by the International Standards Organization.  Several of the Company's
manufacturing  operations have already received ISO 9000 approval and others are
actively pursuing such approval.

     Vishay's  largest  customers  vary from year to year,  and no customer  has
long-term commitments to purchase products of the Company. No customer accounted
for more than 10% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 1995.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Many of the  Company's  products  and  manufacturing  processes  have  been
invented,  designed  and  developed by Company  engineers  and  scientists.  The
Company  maintains  strategically  located  design  centers  where  proximity to
customers enables it to more easily satisfy the needs of the local market. These
design centers are located in the United States (Connecticut, Maine,

                                       -5-



<PAGE>



Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania), in Germany (Selb, Landshut, Pfafenberg,
Backnang),  in France (Nice, Tours, Evry) and Israel. The Company also maintains
separate  research and development  staffs and promotes  separate  programs at a
number of its production facilities to develop new products and new applications
of existing products, and to improve product and manufacturing techniques.  This
decentralized  system encourages  individual  product  development at individual
manufacturing   facilities  that   occasionally   have   applications  at  other
facilities.  Company  research and development  costs were  approximately  $10.4
million for 1995, $7.2 million for 1994 and $7.1 million for 1993. These amounts
do not include substantial  expenditures for product development and the design,
development and  manufacturing  of machinery and equipment for new processes and
for cost reduction measures. See "Competition".


SOURCES OF SUPPLIES

     Although  most  materials   incorporated  in  the  Company's  products  are
available from a number of sources, certain materials (particularly tantalum and
palladium) are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers.

     Tantalum,  a metal,  is the principal  material used in the  manufacture of
tantalum  capacitor  products.  It is purchased in powder form  primarily  under
annual contracts with domestic  suppliers at prices that are subject to periodic
adjustment.  The  Company is a major  consumer of the  world's  annual  tantalum
production.  There are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore
into capacitor grade tantalum  powder.  Although the Company believes that there
is  currently a surplus of tantalum  ore  reserves  and a  sufficient  number of
tantalum  processors  relative  to  foreseeable  demand,  and that the  tantalum
required by the Company has generally been available in sufficient quantities to
meet requirements, the limited number of tantalum powder suppliers could lead to
increases in tantalum  prices that the Company may not be able to pass on to its
customers.

     Palladium is primarily purchased on the spot and forward markets, depending
on market  conditions.  Palladium is  considered  a commodity  and is subject to
price  volatility.  The  price  of  palladium  has  fluctuated  in the  range of
approximately $104 to $130 per troy ounce during the last three years.  Although
palladium is currently  found in South Africa and Russia,  the Company  believes
that there are a sufficient  number of domestic and foreign suppliers from which
the Company can  purchase  palladium.  However,  an inability on the part of the
Company to pass on increases in palladium  costs to its customers  could have an
adverse effect on the margins of those products using the metal.

INVENTORY AND BACKLOG

     Although Vishay manufactures  standardized  products, a substantial portion
of its products are produced to meet customer specifications.  The Company does,
however,  maintain an inventory of resistors  and other  components.  Backlog of
outstanding orders for the Company's products was $339.2 million, $305.7 million
and $198.4  million,  respectively,  at December  31, 1995,  1994 and 1993.  The
increase in backlog at December 31, 1994 as compared  with 1993 is  attributable
in large  part to the  acquisition  of  Vitramon.  The  increase  in  backlog at
December  31, 1995  reflects an  increase  in demand for the  Company's  surface
mounted components,  particularly MLCC capacitors, tantalum capacitors and thick
film resistor chips.  Such demand was particularly  strong during the first half
of 1995.  Since the last fiscal quarter of 1995,  and continuing  into the first
quarter of 1996, the Company has  experienced an overall  slowdown in demand for
its  products.  The  Company  believes  this may be  primarily  a result  of the
unusually  large build up of Vishay  components  in its  customers'  inventories
during the first half of 1995.

     The Company, however, still continues to experience capacity constraints in
some of the above-mentioned  products. The Company anticipates that the increase
in its  plant  manufacturing  space  in  Israel  over the  next 12  months  will
alleviate these constraints. In any event, the current backlog is expected to be
filled  during  the next  twelve  months.  Most of the  orders in the  Company's
backlog  may be  cancelled  by its  customers,  in whole  or in  part,  although
sometimes  subject to penalty.  To date,  however,  cancellations  have not been
significant.


COMPETITION

     The Company faces strong competition in its various product lines from both
domestic and foreign  manufacturers  that produce  products  using  technologies
similar to those of the Company.  The Company's  main  competitors  for tantalum
capacitors are KEMET, AVX and NEC; for MLCC  capacitors,  competitors are KEMET,
AVX,  Murata and TDK. For thick film chip  resistors,  competitors are ROHM, Koa
and Yageo. For wirewound and metal film resistors, competitors are IRC, ROHM and
Ohmite.

     The  Company's   competitive  position  depends  on  its  product  quality,
know-how,  proprietary  data,  marketing and service  capabilities  and business
reputation,  as well as on price.  In respect of  certain of its  products,  the
Company competes on the basis of its marketing and distribution  network,  which
provides a high level of  customer  service.  For  example,  the  Company  works
closely  with its  customers  to have its  components  incorporated  into  their
electronic  equipment at the early stages of design and production and maintains
redundant  production  sites for most of its products to ensure an uninterrupted
supply of products. Further,

                                       -7-



<PAGE>



the  Company has  established  a National  Accounts  Management  Program,  which
provides the Company's largest customers with one national account executive who
can cut across  Vishay  business  unit lines for sales,  marketing  and contract
coordination.  In  addition,  the  breadth of the  Company's  product  offerings
enables the Company to strengthen its market position by providing its customers
with "one-stop" access to one of the broadest  selections of passive  electronic
components available from a direct manufacturing source.

     A number of the Company's  customers are contractors or  subcontractors  on
various  United States and foreign  government  contracts.  Under certain United
States  Government  contracts,  retroactive  adjustments can be made to contract
prices affecting the profit margin on such contracts.  The Company believes that
its profits are not excessive and,  accordingly,  no provision has been made for
any such adjustment.

     Although  the  Company  has  numerous  United  States and  foreign  patents
covering  certain of its products and  manufacturing  processes,  no  particular
patent is considered material to the business of the Company.


MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

     The  Company   strives  to  balance  the  location  of  its   manufacturing
facilities.  In order to  better  serve its  customers,  the  Company  maintains
production  facilities  in  those  regions  where  it  markets  the  bulk of its
products,  such as the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. To
maximize  production  efficiencies,  the Company seeks  whenever  practicable to
establish  manufacturing  facilities  in  countries,  such  as  Israel,  Mexico,
Portugal and the Czech Republic,  where it can take advantage of lower labor and
tax costs and, in the case of Israel,  to take  advantage of various  government
incentives, including grants and tax relief.

     At December  31,  1995,  approximately  40% of the  Company's  identifiable
assets were  located in the United  States,  approximately  42% were  located in
Europe,  approximately  17% were located in Israel and approximately 1% in other
regions.  In the United States, the Company's main manufacturing  facilities are
located  in  Nebraska,  South  Dakota,  North  Carolina,  Pennsylvania,   Maine,
Connecticut,  Virginia, New Hampshire and Florida. In Europe, the Company's main
manufacturing facilities are located in Selb, Landshut and Backnang, Germany and
Nice and Tours,  France.  In Israel,  manufacturing  facilities  are  located in
Holon,  Dimona  and  rented  facilities  in Migdal  Ha-emek.  The  Company  also
maintains major manufacturing  facilities in Juarez,  Mexico;  Toronto,  Canada;
Porto,  Portugal;  and the Czech  Republic.  Recently,  the Company has invested
substantial  resources to increase  capacity and to maximize  automation  in its
plants, which it believes will further reduce production costs.

     To address the increasing demand for its products and in order to lower its
costs,  the  Company  has  expanded,  and  plans  to  continue  to  expand,  its
manufacturing  operations  in Israel,  where it benefits  from the  government's
employment and tax incentive  programs  designed to increase  employment,  lower
wage rates and a  highly-skilled  labor  force,  all of which  have  contributed
substantially to the growth and profitability of the Company.

     Under the terms of the  Israeli  government's  incentive  programs,  once a
project is  approved,  the  recipient is eligible to receive the benefits of the
related grants for the life of the project,  so long as the recipient  continues
to meet preset  eligibility  standards.  None of the Company's approved projects
has ever been  cancelled  or  modified  and the  Company  has  already  received
approval for a majority of the projects  contemplated by its capital expenditure
program.  However, from time to time, the government has considered scaling back
or discontinuing these programs. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
Israeli  government will continue to offer new incentive programs or that, if it
does,  the Company will continue to be eligible to take  advantage of them.  The
Company might be materially  adversely affected if these incentive programs were
no longer  available to the Company for new projects.  In addition,  the Company
might be  materially  adversely  affected  if  hostilities  were to occur in the
Middle East that interfere with the Company's operations in Israel. The Company,
however,  has  never  experienced  any  material  interruption  in  its  Israeli
operations in its 26 years of production  there, in spite of several Middle East
crises,  including wars. For the year ended December 31, 1995, sales of products
manufactured  in Israel  accounted  for  approximately  17% of the Company's net
sales.

     Due to a shift in  manufacturing  emphasis  to  higher  automation  and the
relocation of some production to regions with lower labor costs, portions of the
Company's  work force and certain  facilities  may not be fully  utilized in the
future. As a result,  the Company may incur significant costs in connection with
work force  reductions and the closing of additional  manufacturing  facilities.
See "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

ENVIRONMENT

     The  Company's  manufacturing  operations  are subject to various  federal,
state and local laws  restricting  discharge of materials into the  environment.
The Company is not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings which would
require  curtailment  of its  operations.  However,  the  Company is involved in
various legal actions  concerning state government  enforcement  proceedings and
various dump site  cleanups.  These  actions may result in fines and/or  cleanup
expenses.  The Company  believes that any fine or cleanup  expense,  if imposed,
would not be material.  The Company continually expends funds to ensure that its
facilities comply with

                                       -9-



<PAGE>



applicable  environmental  regulations.  The  Company has nearly  completed  its
undertaking  to  comply  with  new  environmental  regulations  relating  to the
elimination of  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs) and ozone depleting substances (ODS)
and other anticipated compliances with the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. The
Company anticipates that it will undertake capital expenditures of approximately
$4,000,000 in fiscal 1996 for general  environmental  compliance and enhancement
programs.  The Company has been named a Potentially  Responsible  Party (PRP) at
seven  Superfund  sites.  The  Company  has  settled  three of these for minimal
amounts  and does not  expect  the  others to be  material.  While  the  Company
believes that it is in material  compliance with applicable  environmental laws,
it cannot  accurately  predict  future  developments  or have  knowledge of past
occurrences on sites currently  occupied by the Company.  Moreover,  the risk of
environmental  liability and remediation  costs is inherent in the nature of the
Company's  business  and,  therefore,  there can be no assurance  that  material
environmental costs, including remediation costs will not arise in the future.

     With  each  acquisition,  the  Company  undertakes  to  identify  potential
environmental  concerns  and to  minimize  the  environmental  matters it may be
required  to  address.  In  addition,   the  Company  establishes  reserves  for
specifically  identified  potential  environmental   liabilities.   The  Company
believes that the reserves it has  established are adequate.  Nevertheless,  the
Company  often   unavoidably   inherits   certain   pre-existing   environmental
liabilities,  generally  based on successor  liability  doctrines.  Although the
Company  has never been  involved  in any  environmental  matter  that has had a
material  adverse  impact on its overall  operations,  there can be no assurance
that in connection  with any past or future  acquisition the Company will not be
obligated to address  environmental  matters that could have a material  adverse
impact on its operations.


EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1995,  the Company  employed  approximately  17,900 full
time  employees of whom  approximately  11,000 were  located  outside the United
States.  The Company hires few employees on a part time basis.  While various of
the Company's foreign employees are members of trade unions, a de minimus number
of the  Company's  employees  located in the  United  States is  represented  by
unions.  The  Company  believes  that its  relationship  with its  employees  is
excellent.  However,  no assurance can be given that if the Company continues to
restructure  its  operations in response to changing  economic  conditions  that
labor unrest or strikes (especially at European facilities) will not occur.

complete  construction of a 250,000 square foot plant in Migdal Ha-emek,  Israel
and a 270,000 square foot facility in Beersheba, Israel in 1996.


ITEM 3.                             LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company from time to time is involved in routine litigation  incidental
to its business.  Management believes that such matters,  either individually or
in the  aggregate,  should not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
business or financial condition.

ITEM 5.  MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  STOCK AND  RELATED  SECURITY  HOLDER
         MATTERS

     The Company's  Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock  Exchange under
the symbol VSH. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for
the Company's Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange  Composite
Tape for the quarterly  periods within the 1995 and 1994 fiscal years indicated.
Stock prices have been restated to reflect stock dividends and stock splits. The
Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its capital  stock.  Its policy
is to retain  earnings to support the growth of the  Company's  business and the
Company does not intend to change this policy at the present  time. In addition,
the Company is  restricted  from paying  cash  dividends  under the terms of the
Company's  revolving  credit  and  term  loan  agreements  (see  Note  5 to  the
consolidated  financial  statements).  Holders of record of the Company's Common
Stock totalled approximately 1,668 at March 18, 1996.

     On November  27, 1995,  the Company  commenced a stock  repurchase  program
pursuant to which the Company was  authorized to repurchase up to 750,000 shares
of its Common  Stock for an  aggregate  amount not to exceed  $30  million.  The
purchases of Common Stock by the Company under the  repurchase  program are made
in accordance  with the rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission and at
the  discretion  of  management.  As  of  December  31,  1995  the  Company  had
repurchased 110,000 shares at an approximate cost of $3,578,000.  No repurchases
were made in 1993 or 1994.

     In addition, at March 18, 1996 the Company had outstanding 7,222,035 shares
of Class B Common  Stock par value $.10 per share (the "Class B Stock")  each of
which  entitles  the holder to ten  votes.  The Class B Stock  generally  is not
transferable  and there is no  market  for  those  shares.  The Class B Stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder, into Common Stock on a share for share
basis.  Substantially all such Class B Stock is beneficially  owned by Dr. Felix
Zandman,  and a revocable  trust for the benefit of Mr.  Alfred P.  Slaner.  Dr.
Felix  Zandman is an executive  officer and director of the Company.  Mr. Slaner
and  his  wife,  Luella  B.  Slaner,  are  Trustees  of the  Slaner  Trust,  and
accordingly,  Mrs. Slaner, a Vishay director, may also be deemed beneficially to
own such shares.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS


INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

     The Company's sales and net income have increased significantly in the past
several  years  primarily  as a  result  of  its  acquisitions.  Following  each
acquisition,  the Company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution
and operating  synergies among its businesses.  This implementation is reflected
in an increase in the  Company's  sales and in the decline in selling,  general,
and administrative expenses as a percentage of the Company's sales.

     From  mid-1990  through  the end of 1993,  sales  of most of the  Company's
products were  adversely  affected by the worldwide  slowdown in the  electronic
components  industry,  which reflected general  recessionary trends in all major
industrialized  countries.  In  addition,  sales to  defense-related  industries
declined  from the end of the first  quarter of 1991  until the  second  half of
1993.  Despite this slowdown,  Vishay  realized record net earnings in each year
throughout this period.  This was a result of its  acquisitions and focus on the
bottom-line, including the implementation of operating efficiencies.

     In 1995,  the Company's  growth was fueled not only by its  acquisition  of
Vitramon,  but  also by the  dramatic  expansion  in the  electronic  components
industry.  This  resulted in Vishay's  record net  earnings of $92.7  million in
1995. Since early 1994, demand for most passive  electronic  components has been
extremely  strong  and,  in the  case of  certain  products  (such  as  tantalum
capacitors),  has exceeded available supply, resulting in increased backlogs and
favorable pricing. During the last quarter of 1995 and into the first quarter of
1996 the  Company  has  experienced  an  overall  softening  in  demand  for its
products,  resulting in a decrease in backlogs. The Company believes this may be
primarily a result of the unusually  large build up of Vishay  components in its
customers' inventories during the first half of 1995. The Company believes it is
too early to discern whether this slowdown is indicative of a longer term trend;
the Company, however, will continue to closely monitor its orders and backlog.

     The Company's  strategy  includes  transferring  some of its  manufacturing
operations  from  countries  with high  labor  costs and tax rates  (such as the
United  States,  France and Germany) to Israel,  Mexico,  Portugal and the Czech
Republic in order to benefit  from lower labor costs and, in the case of Israel,
to take advantage of various government incentives,  including government grants
and tax incentives.  Management  believes that the Company is well positioned to
reduce  its  costs in the  event of a decline  in  demand  by  accelerating  the
transfer of  production to countries  with lower labor costs and more  favorable
tax environments.

     The Company  realizes 51% of its revenues  outside the United States.  As a
result,  fluctuations in currency  exchange rates can  significantly  affect the
Company's reported sales and to a lesser extent earnings.  Currency fluctuations
impact  the  Company's  net  sales  and  other  income  statement  amounts,   as
denominated  in U.S.  dollars,  including  other income as it relates to foreign
exchange gains or losses. Generally, in order to minimize the effect of currency
fluctuations on profits,  the Company endeavors to (i) borrow money in the local
currencies  and markets where it conducts  business,  and (ii) minimize the time
for settling  intercompany  transactions.  The Company does not purchase foreign
currency  exchange  contracts or other  derivative  instruments to hedge foreign
currency exposures.

     As a result of the  increased  production  by the  Company's  operations in
Israel over the past several years,  the low tax rates in Israel (as compared to
the statutory  rates in the United States) have had the effect of increasing the
Company's  net  earnings.  The more  favorable  Israeli tax rates are applied to
specific approved projects and normally continue to be available for a period of
ten years or, if the investment in the project is over $20 million, for a period
of 15  years,  which  has been the case for most of the  Company's  projects  in
Israel since 1994. New projects are continually being  introduced.  In addition,
the Israeli  government offers certain incentive programs in the form of grants
designed to increase  employment in Israel.  Future  grants and other  incentive
programs offered to the Company by the Israeli  government will likely depend on
the Company's  continuing to increase  capital  investment and the number of the
Company's employees in Israel.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

     Net sales for the year ended  December 31, 1995 increased  $236,579,000  or
23.9% from the prior year.  The  increase  reflects  the strong  performance  of
Vitramon,  acquired July 1, 1994,  and Vishay's  other surface mount  components
businesses.  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 includes $87,753,000
of net sales relating to Vitramon for the first six months of 1995.

     The weakening of the U.S.  dollar against  foreign  currencies for the year
ended  December 31, 1995 in comparison to the prior year resulted in an increase
in reported sales of $57,128,000.

     Net sales, exclusive of foreign currency fluctuations, increased 18.2% over
the prior  year.  Net sales,  exclusive  of foreign  currency  fluctuations  and
Vitramon sales for the first six months, increased 9.3% over the prior year. Net
bookings  for the year ended  December  31, 1995  increased  7.8% over the prior
year.

     Income  statement  captions as a percentage  of sales and the effective tax
rates were as follows:

     Costs of products sold for the year ended December 31, 1995 were 73.7%,  of
net sales, as compared to 75.7% for the prior year. The factors  contributing to
this decrease  included:  (i) the effect of the Mexican peso devaluation,  which
contributed  approximately  $4,100,000  to gross profit for 1995,  (ii) the fact
that gross  profits  for  Vitramon  were higher than  Vishay's  other  operating
companies,  (iii) Israeli  government  grants of $13,243,000  for the year ended
December 31, 1995, as compared to  $10,999,000  for the prior year,  and (iv) an
increase in  production in Israel where labor costs are lower than in most other
regions in which Vishay manufactures.  The increase in Israeli government grants
resulted from a significant increase in the Company's  manufacturing  operations
in Israel.  Deferred income at December 31, 1995 relating to Israeli  government
grants was $30,849,000.

     Selling,  general, and administrative expenses, for the year ended December
31,  1995 were  13.0% of net sales,  as  compared  to 13.9% for the prior  year.
Management continues to explore additional cost-saving opportunities.

     Restructuring  expenses of $4,200,000  in 1995 resulted from  downsizing of
some of the Company's  European  operations and represent  employee  termination
benefits covering  approximately 276 technical,  production,  administrative and
support employees  located  primarily in France and Germany.  This downsizing is
expected to be completed by the end of 1996. At December 31, 1995, $3,370,000 of
restructuring costs are included in accrued expenses.

     Interest costs increased by $4,664,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995
over the prior  year as a result of an  increase  in  average  debt  outstanding
resulting  from the  acquisition  of  Vitramon  in July  1994 and  purchases  of
property and equipment.

     The  effective  tax rate for the year  ended  December  31,  1995 was 24.6%
compared to 20.5% for the prior  year.  The higher  effective  tax rate for 1995
reflects increased earnings in higher tax rate countries.

     The effect of low tax rates in Israel (as compared to the statutory rate in
the United States) has been to increase net

earnings by $19,183,000  and  $15,291,000  for the years ended December 31, 1995
and 1994,  respectively.  The  Israeli  tax effect was more  pronounced  in 1995
primarily as a result of  increased  earnings  for the Israeli  operations  as a
result of increased production.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 COMPARED TO
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

     Net sales for the year ended  December 31, 1994 increased  $131,565,000  or
15.4% over the prior year. The increase  reflects the acquisition of Vitramon in
July 1994.  Net sales of  Vitramon  were  $72,139,000  for the six months  ended
December 31, 1994, an increase of 29.4% over the  comparable  1993 period (prior
to its acquisition by the Company). Net sales, exclusive of Vitramon, during the
year ended  December 31, 1994  increased by  $59,426,000  or 6.9% over 1993. The
weakening of the U.S. dollar against  foreign  currencies in 1994 resulted in an
increase in reported sales of $7,208,000 over 1993.

     Net sales,  exclusive  of Vitramon  and foreign  currency  effects,  in the
United  States and Europe  increased  6.1% over the prior  year.  Net  bookings,
exclusive of  Vitramon,  for 1994  increased  by 15.5% over the prior year.  Net
bookings of Vitramon,  for the six months ended December 31, 1994,  increased by
34.5%  over the  comparable  period  of 1993  (prior to its  acquisition  by the
Company).

     Costs of products  sold for the year ended  December 31, 1994 were 75.7% of
net sales as  compared  with 77.5% for the prior  year.  The  principal  factors
contributing  to this decrease  were: (i) the fact that gross profit margins for
Vitramon are higher than those for Vishay's other operating  companies,  (ii) an
increase  of  $7,575,000  or 221% in the  amount of  Israeli  government  grants
recognized  as a reduction of costs of products sold in 1994 over the prior year
and (iii) a significant  increase in production in Israel, where labor costs are
generally lower than in other regions in which Vishay manufactures. The increase
in  Israeli  government  grants  resulted  primarily  from  an  increase  in the
Company's work force and capital investment in Israel.

     Selling,  general, and administrative  expenses for the year ended December
31,  1994 and 1993 were  13.9% of net  sales.  Management  continues  to explore
additional cost saving opportunities.

     Restructuring  charges of $6,659,000  for the year ended  December 31, 1993
consist  primarily  of  severance  costs  related to the  Company's  decision to
downsize  its  European  operations,  primarily  in  France,  as a result of the
European business climate. These costs were paid in 1994.


                                      -20-


                                                                                

<PAGE>



     Income from unusual  items of  $7,221,000  for the year ended  December 31,
1993 represents  proceeds  received for business  interruption  insurance claims
principally related to operations in Dimona, Israel.

     Interest costs increased by $4,145,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994
as a result of increased  rates and increased debt incurred for the  acquisition
of Vitramon.

     The  effective  tax rate for the year  ended  December  31,  1994 was 20.5%
compared to 16.2% for the prior year. The effective tax rate for 1993, exclusive
of the effect of nontaxable  insurance proceeds,  was 18.6%. The higher tax rate
for 1994 reflects the inclusion of Vitramon earnings in higher tax locations.

     The effect of the low tax rates in Israel was to increase  net  earnings by
$15,291,000  and  $11,644,000  for the years ended  December  31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The Company's average income tax rate in Israel was approximately
4% for both 1994 and 1993. The Israeli pre tax grants  recognized by the Company
were  $10,999,000 and $3,424,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

     Effective  January 1, 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred  method to the liability  method required by FASB
Statement  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes." The  cumulative  effect of
adopting  Statement  109 as of  January  1, 1993 was to  increase  net income by
$1,427,000.  Application  of the new  income  tax rules  also  decreased  pretax
earnings by $2,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 because of increased
depreciation expense as a result of Statement 109's requirement to report assets
acquired in prior business combinations at their pre-tax amounts.

     The Company also adopted FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement  Benefits Other Than  Pensions,"  effective  January 1, 1993. The
Company has elected to recognize  the  transition  obligation  on a  prospective
basis  over a  twenty-year  period.  In  1993,  the  new  standard  resulted  in
additional annual net periodic postretirement benefit costs of $1,200,000 before
taxes,  and  $792,000  after  taxes,  or $0.02 per share.  Prior year  financial
statements were not restated to apply the new standard.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Cash flows from  operations were  $115,511,000  for the year ended December
31,  1995  compared  to  $46,467,000  for the prior  year.  Included in net cash
provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively,  are  $16,402,000  and  $16,587,000  of  cash  payments  made  for
liabilities  assumed in connection with acquisitions.  Net purchases of property
and equipment for the year ended December 31, 1995 were $165,699,000

                                      -21-


                                                                                

<PAGE>



compared to $91,571,000 in the prior year. This increase  reflects the Company's
on going  program to purchase  additional  equipment  to meet  growing  customer
demand for surface mount components.  Net cash provided by financing  activities
of $41,732,000  includes  $230,279,000  of proceeds from a common stock offering
completed in September  1995, and used to prepay bank  indebtedness.  Additional
borrowings  were used  primarily  to  finance  the  additions  to  property  and
equipment.

     The Company has established accruals relating to the Vitramon  acquisition,
of which  $12,327,000  remains at December 31, 1995.  These accruals,  which are
included in other accrued expenses and other liabilities, will not affect future
earnings but will require cash expenditures.

     On June 27,  1995,  the Company  amended its bank  credit  facilities.  The
amendment  increased the Company's  domestic  revolving  credit facility by $100
million,  extended  the  maturity  of its  domestic  and  Deutsche  Mark  ("DM")
denominated  revolving  credit  facilities  and gave the  Company  the  right to
increase its domestic revolving credit facility by an additional $100 million by
prepaying its  outstanding  non amortizing  term loan on or before
July 1, 1996.

     See Note 5 to the Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  elsewhere
herein for  additional  information  with respect to Vishay's  loan  agreements,
long-term debt and available short- term credit lines.

     The Company's  financial  condition at December 31, 1995 is strong,  with a
current ratio of 2.8 to 1. The Company's  ratio of long-term  debt (less current
portion) to stockholders'  equity was .25 to 1 at December 31, 1995 and .71 to 1
at December 31, 1994.

     The Company's  capital  expenditures for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994  and  1993  were  $165.7   million,   $91.6  million  and  $79.4   million,
respectively.  Planned  capital  expenditures of  approximately  $200 million in
fiscal 1996 relate  principally to  construction of new facilities in Israel and
the purchase of equipment to increase  capacity and maximize  automation  in the
Company's plants.

     Management  believes  that  the  Company's  available  sources  of  credit,
together with cash expected to be generated from operations,  will be sufficient
to satisfy the Company's  anticipated  financing  needs for working  capital and
capital expenditures during the next twelve months.

INFLATION

     Normally,  inflation  has not had a  significant  impact  on the  Company's
operations.   The  Company's  products  are  not  generally  sold  on  long-term
contracts. Consequently, selling prices, to the

                         Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Stockholders
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.


We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Vishay
Intertechnology,  Inc.  as of  December  31,  1995  and  1994,  and the  related
consolidated statements of operations,  cash flows, and stockholders' equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material   respects,   the  consolidated   financial   position  of  Vishay
Intertechnology,  Inc.  at  December  31,  1995 and 1994,  and the  consolidated
results of its  operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As  discussed in the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  in 1993 the
Company  changed  its  methods  of  accounting  for  income  taxes  (Note 4) and
postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 9).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1995



Vishay  Intertechnology,  Inc.  is  a  leading  international  manufacturer  and
supplier of passive electronic components,  particularly  resistors,  capacitors
and inductors,  offering its customers  access to one of the most  comprehensive
passive  electronic  component lines of any manufacturer in the United States or
Europe. Passive electronic components,  together with semiconductors (integrated
circuits),  which the Company  does not  produce,  are the  primary  elements of
electronic  circuits.  Components  manufactured  by  the  Company  are  used  in
virtually all types of  electronic  products,  including  those in the computer,
telecommunications,  military/aerospace,  instrument,  automotive,  medical  and
consumer electronics industries.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated  financial statements of Vishay  Intertechnology,  Inc. include
the  accounts of the  Company and its  subsidiaries,  after  elimination  of all
significant intercompany transactions, accounts, and profits.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

INVENTORIES

Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower of  cost,  determined  by the  first-in,
first-out method, or market.

DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is computed  principally by the straight-line method based upon the
estimated  useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation  of capital lease assets is
included in total depreciation expense.

                                                                              12

Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1995



Depreciation  expense was $60,155,000,  $51,301,000,  and  $43,493,000,  for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.


                                                                              13

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS

The estimated cost to complete  construction in progress at December 31, 1995 is
$67,440,000.

GOODWILL

Goodwill,  representing  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  net  assets  of
businesses acquired,  is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
Accumulated amortization amounted to $23,737,000 and $17,966,000 at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.  The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at the
operating unit level by an analysis of operating  results and  consideration  of
other significant events or changes in the business environment. If an operating
unit  has  current  operating  losses  and  based  upon  projections  there is a
likelihood  that such operating  losses will continue,  the Company will measure
impairment  on the  basis  of  undiscounted  expected  future  cash  flows  from
operations before interest for the remaining amortization period.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

For  purposes of the  Statement  of Cash Flows,  the  Company  considers  demand
deposits and all highly liquid  investments  with  maturities of three months or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

The amount charged to expense aggregated $10,430,000, $7,205,000, and $7,097,000
for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The Company
spends additional amounts for the development of machinery and equipment for new
processes and for cost reduction measures.

GRANTS

                                                                              14

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)






Grants received from governments by certain foreign  subsidiaries,  primarily in
Israel,  are recognized as income in accordance with the purpose of the specific
contract  and in the period in which the  related  expense is  incurred.  Grants
received from the government of Israel and recognized as a reduction of costs of
products sold were $13,243,000,  $10,999,000, and $3,424,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

                                                                              15

GRANTS (CONTINUED)

Grants  receivable of $20,585,000  and $16,674,000 are included in other current
assets at December  31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Deferred  grant income of
$30,849,000  and  $11,111,000  is included in other  liabilities at December 31,
1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The grants are subject to  conditions,  including
maintaining  specified  levels  of  employment  for  periods  up to  ten  years.
Noncompliance with such conditions could result in repayment of grants, however,
management expects that the Company will comply with all terms and conditions of
grants.

SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS

All numbers of common  shares and per share  amounts have been  adjusted to give
retroactive effect to a 2-for-1 stock split distributed on June 16, 1995.

Earnings  per share is based on the  weighted  average  number of common  shares
outstanding  during the period. No material dilution of earnings per share would
result if it was assumed that all  outstanding  stock  options  were  exercised.
Earnings per share amounts for all periods  presented  reflect the 2-for-1 stock
split and 5% stock dividends paid on March 31, 1995, June 13, 1994, and June 11,
1993.  Earnings  per share for the year ended  December  31,  1995  reflect  the
weighted effect of the issuance of 5,750,000 shares of Common Stock in September
1995.  Earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 reflect
the  weighted  effect of the  issuance of  5,576,000  shares of Common  Stock in
August 1994.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT PENDING ADOPTION

In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
of  Long-Lived  Assets  and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of,"  which
requires  impairment  losses  to  be  recorded  on  long-lived  assets  used  in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the  undiscounted  cash
flows  estimated  to be  generated  by those  assets  are less than the  assets'
carrying  amounts.  Statement 121 also  addresses the  accounting for long-lived
assets that are expected to be disposed of. The Company will adopt Statement 121
in the first  quarter  of 1996 and,  based on  current  circumstances,  does not
believe the effect of adoption will be material.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting for income taxes (Note 4)
and postretirement benefits other than pensions (Note 9).

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain  prior-year  amounts have been  reclassified to conform with the current
presentation.

2. ACQUISITIONS

In July 1994,  the  Company  purchased  all of the  capital  stock of  Vitramon,
Incorporated  and  Vitramon  Limited,   U.K.   (collectively,   "Vitramon")  for
$184,000,000 in cash.  Vitramon is a leading producer of multilayer ceramic chip
capacitors with manufacturing facilities primarily in the United States, France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom. In connection with the acquisition of Vitramon,
the Company  borrowed an aggregate  of  $200,000,000  from a group of banks,  of
which  $100,000,000  was a bridge facility that was  subsequently  paid off with
proceeds from an equity offering completed in August 1994 and $100,000,000 was a
nonamortizing term loan of which $50,000,000 remains outstanding at December 31,
1995.

During January 1993,  Vishay  exercised its option to purchase the remaining 81%
of the  outstanding  share  capital of  Roederstein  GmbH, a passive  electronic
components  manufacturer  with  headquarters  in Germany for 4,050,000  Deutsche
Marks  ("DM")  ($2,502,000)  pursuant  to a 1992  option  agreement.  Vishay had
acquired  its  initial  19%  interest  in  Roederstein  in 1992  for DM  950,000
($577,000).

The  acquisitions   have  been  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method  of
accounting. The operating results of Vitramon and Roederstein have been included
in the  Company's  consolidated  results  of  operations  from  July 1, 1994 and
January 1, 1993, respectively.  Excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired  (Vitramon--$104,582,000;  Roederstein--$46,355,000) is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over forty years.

                                                                              17

2. ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)

Had the Vitramon  acquisition  been made at the beginning of 1993, the Company's
pro forma  unaudited  results  would have been (in  thousands,  except per share
amounts):

Earnings per share                            $1.23           $1.00


The unaudited pro forma  results are not  necessarily  indicative of the results
that would have been attained had the  acquisition  occurred at the beginning of
1993 or of results which may occur in the future.

3. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE AND UNUSUAL ITEMS

Restructuring  expenses of $4,200,000 in 1995 result from  downsizing of some of
the Company's  European  operations  and represent  employee  termination  costs
covering approximately 276 technical,  production,  administrative,  and support
employees located  primarily in France and Germany.  This downsizing is expected
to be  complete  by the  end of  1996.  At  December  31,  1995,  $3,370,000  of
restructuring costs are included in accrued expenses.

Restructuring expenses of $6,659,000 recorded in 1993 related to a downsizing of
some of the Company's  European  operations which was completed in 1994.  Income
from unusual items of $7,221,000 for 1993  represents  insurance  recoveries for
business interruption insurance claims.

4. INCOME TAXES

Effective  January 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its method of  accounting  for
income taxes from the deferred  method to the liability  method required by FASB
Statement  No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes." The  cumulative  effect of
adopting  Statement  109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase  net  earnings by
$1,427,000, or $.03 per share.



                                                                              19

4. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

At December 31, 1995, the Company has net operating loss  carryforwards  for tax
purposes  of  approximately   $115,805,000  in  Germany  (no  expiration  date),
$12,154,000  in France  (expire  December 31, 2000),  and $5,518,000 in Portugal
(expire  December 31, 1999).  Approximately  $86,893,000 of the  carryforward in
Germany,  and  $5,211,000  of the  carryforward  in Portugal,  resulted from the
Company's  acquisition  of  Roederstein.  For financial  reporting  purposes,  a
valuation  allowance of $45,700,000  has been  recognized to offset deferred tax
assets  related  to foreign  net  operating  loss  carryforwards.  In 1995,  tax
benefits recognized through reductions of the valuation allowance had the effect
of reducing  goodwill of acquired  companies by  $6,752,000.  If additional  tax
benefits are recognized in the future through further reduction of the valuation
allowance,  $37,461,000  of such  benefits will reduce  goodwill.  The valuation
allowance decreased from December 31, 1994 by $2,937,000 due to the tax benefits
recognized  offset by  foreign  currency  translation  which  had the  effect of
increasing the deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards.

At December 31,  1995,  no  provision  has been made for U.S.  federal and state
income  taxes on  approximately  $280,538,000  of  foreign  earnings  which  are
expected to be reinvested  indefinitely.  Upon distribution of those earnings in
the form of dividends or otherwise,  the Company would be subject to U.S. income
taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and  withholding  taxes
payable  to the  various  foreign  countries.  Determination  of the  amount  of
unrecognized  deferred U.S. income tax liability is not  practicable  because of
the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Income taxes paid were  $30,272,000,  $11,125,000,  and $6,933,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.



                                                                              24

As of December 31, 1995,  five  facilities  were  available  under the Company's
amended and restated  Revolving Credit and Term Loan and Deutsche Mark Revolving

until  December  31,  2000.  The  Company  has the right to  request up to three
one-year  renewals  thereafter.  Interest is based on DM market rates plus .30%.
The Company is required to pay a  commitment  fee equal to 1/8% per annum on the
average  unused line.  The second DM facility is a DM  51,516,000  ($35,775,000)
term loan. Interest is based on DM market rates plus .43%. Principal payments of
DM 37,000,000 and 14,516,000  ($25,694,000 and $10,081,000) are due on or before
December 31, 1996 and 1997,  respectively.  Additional principal payments may be
required based on excess cash flow as defined in the agreement.

and must comply with other  covenants,  including  the  maintenance  of specific
ratios. The Company is in compliance with the restrictions and limitations under
the terms of loan agreements, as amended.

credit  lines of  $30,254,000  and  $28,800,000  at December  31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

Borrowings under  short-term  credit lines and the payments due in 1996 relating
to the  nonamortizing  term  loan  are  classified  as  long-term  based  on the
Company's  intention  and ability to refinance  the  obligations  on a long-term
basis.

required  based  on  excess  cash  flow,  are  as  follows:   1996--$37,821,000;
1997--$26,112,000;  1998--$20,577,000;  1999--$20,912,000;   2000--$160,514,000;
thereafter--$495,000.

At December 31,  1995,  the Company has  committed  and  uncommitted  short-term
credit lines with various U.S. and foreign banks  aggregating  $153,370,000,  of
which  $100,942,000 was unused. The weighted average interest rate on short-term
borrowings  outstanding  as of  December  31, 1995 and 1994 was 6.31% and 6.03%,
respectively.

Interest paid was $29,459,000,  $24,150,000, and $20,587,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

8. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

The  Company   maintains   various   defined   benefit  pension  plans  covering
substantially all full-time U.S.  employees.  The benefits under these plans are
based  on  the  employees'  compensation  during  all  years  of  participation.
Participants in these plans, other than U.S. employees of Vitramon, are required
to contribute an amount based on annual earnings.  The Company's  funding policy
is to  contribute  annually  amounts that satisfy the funding  standard  account
requirements  of ERISA.  The assets of these  plans are  invested  primarily  in
mutual funds and guaranteed  investment contracts issued by an insurance company
and a bank.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)






Total rental expense under  operating  leases was  $9,984,000,  $8,871,000,  and
$7,528,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

Future  minimum lease  payments for  operating  leases with initial or remaining
noncancelable   lease   terms  in   excess   of  one   year   are  as   follows:
1996--$6,242,000;    1997--$4,446,000;    1998--$3,115,000;    1999--$2,082,000;
2000--$1,868,000; thereafter--$7,204,000.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist principally of accounts
receivable.  Concentrations  of credit  risk with  respect  to  receivables  are
limited due to the  Company's  large  number of customers  and their  dispersion
across many countries and industries. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company
had no significant  concentrations  of credit risk. The amounts  reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash  equivalents  and for  short-term  and long-term
debt approximate fair value.


                                                                              36

12. CURRENT VULNERABILITY DUE TO CERTAIN CONCENTRATIONS

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

Although most  materials  incorporated  in the Company's  products are available
from  a  number  of  sources,   certain  materials  (particularly  tantalum  and
palladium)  are available  only from a relatively  limited  number of suppliers.
Tantalum, a metal, is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum
capacitor  products.  It is  purchased  in powder form  primarily  under  annual
contracts  with  domestic  suppliers  at prices  that are  subject  to  periodic
adjustment.  The  Company is a major  consumer of the  world's  annual  tantalum
production.  There are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore
into capacitor grade tantalum  powder.  Although the Company believes that there
is  currently a surplus of tantalum  ore  reserves  and a  sufficient  number of
tantalum  processors  relative  to  foreseeable  demand,  and that the  tantalum
required by the Company has generally been available in sufficient quantities to
meet requirements, the limited number of tantalum powder suppliers could lead to
increases in tantalum  prices that the Company may not be able to pass on to its
customers.  Palladium  is primarily  purchased on the spot and forward  markets,
depending  on market  conditions.  Palladium is  considered  a commodity  and is
subject to price  volatility.  Although  palladium is  currently  found in South
Africa and Russia,  the Company  believes that there are a sufficient  number of
domestic and foreign  suppliers  from which the Company can purchase  palladium.
However,  an  inability  on the  part of the  Company  to pass on  increases  in
palladium  costs to its customers could have an adverse effect on the margins of
those products using the metal.

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

To address  the  increasing  demand for its  products  and in order to lower its
costs,  the  Company  has  expanded,  and  plans  to  continue  to  expand,  its
manufacturing  operations in Israel in order to take advantage of that country's
lower wage rates,  highly skilled labor force,  government-sponsored  grants, as
well  as  various  tax  abatement   programs.   These  incentive  programs  have
contributed  substantially to the growth and  profitability of the Company.  The
Company might be materially and adversely  affected if these incentive  programs
were no longer  available to the Company or if hostilities  were to occur in the
Middle East that materially interfere with the Company's operations in Israel.



                                                                              37
