PART II  -  RULES 12b-25(b) AND (c)

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or 
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the 
following should be completed.  (Check box if appropriate):


     | (a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this form 
     |     could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense; 
     | (b) The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report on 
     |     Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 11-K, Form N-SAR, or portion thereof, 
 [X] |     will be filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the 
     |     prescribed due date; or the subject quarterly report or transition 
     |     report on Form 10-Q, or portion thereof, will be filed on or before 
     |     the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date; and 
     | (c) The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 
     |     12b-25(c) has been attached if applicable.


PART III  -  NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, Form 20-F, 
Form 11-K, Form N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof, could not 
be filed within the prescribed time period.

B.B. Walker Company (the "Registrant") is currently renegotiating certain 
financial covenants of its revolving credit and term loan agreement with 
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Bank").  Renegotiation of these covenants is 
necessary for completion of the Registrant's financial statements for the 
fiscal year ended October 28, 1995 and the rendering of an opinion by the 
Registrant's independent auditors.  Although the Registrant and the Bank have 
orally agreed to the principal terms of the renegotiated covenants, 
documenting these agreements in the form of amendments to the loan agreements 
has proven to be extremely time-consuming because of the complexity of the 
lending arrangement and the demand of additional information by the Bank.  The 
Registrant has attempted to complete the process of filing the annual report 
on Form 10-K within the prescribed time period but has been unable to do so.  
Registrant expects to be able to complete and file its Form 10-K by 
February 9, 1996.

PART IV  -  OTHER INFORMATION

(1) Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this 
    notification

   John R. Whitener               Controller               (910) 625-1380
   ----------------               ----------              ----------------
         Name                       Title                 Telephone Number


(2) Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 
    or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or 
    Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 during 
    the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that 
    the registrant was required to file such reports) been 
    filed?  If answer is no, identify report(s):  N/A           [X] Yes  [] No
                                                 -----


(3) Is it anticipated that any significant change in results 
    of operations from the corresponding period for the last 
    fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements 
    to be included in the subject report or portion thereof?    [X] Yes  [] No


If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively and 
quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why a reasonable 
estimate of the results cannot be made.

The Registrant anticipates reporting a net loss of $1,244,465, or $.72 per 
share, for the fiscal year ended October 28, 1995 compared to net income of 
$474,478, or $.26 per share, for the fiscal year ended October 29, 1994.  The 
change of $1,718,000 can be attributed primarily to lower sales volume in 1995 
compared to 1994.  The Registrant's net sales in 1995 were $43,452,854 
compared to net sales of $51,148,327 in 1994.  Retailers were slow to turn 
their inventories as the market was soft, and therefore orders to restock 
inventory were not as strong as the prior years.  In addition, the reduction 
in demand impacted the ability of the Company to operate its plants 
efficiently resulting in unfavorable manufacturing variances. Another factor 
was significant competition which led to aggressive pricing and dating terms 
that eroded the Company's margins.  Finally, rising interest rates, larger 
average outstanding balances and additional long-term debt resulted in 
significant increases in interest expense.  These higher expenses were 
partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses.
