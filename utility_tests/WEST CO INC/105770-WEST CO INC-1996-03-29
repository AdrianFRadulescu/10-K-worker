                    --------

                                     The Company
                                     -----------
          The West Company, Incorporated is engaged in one industry segment
          - the design, development, manufacture and marketing of stoppers,
          closures,  containers, medical  device components  and assemblies
          made from  elastomers, metal  and  plastic that  meet the  unique
          filling,  sealing, dispensing  and delivery  needs of  the health
          care and  consumer products markets.   The Company  also provides
          contract packaging  and contract manufacturing  services to these
          markets in the United States  and Puerto Rico.  In addition,  the
          Company  manufactures related packaging machinery.  The Company's
          products include pharmaceutical  packaging components  (stoppers,
          seals,  caps,  containers  and  dropper  bulbs),  components  for
          medical devices  (parts for  syringes  and components  for  blood
          sampling and analysis devices  and for intravenous administration
          sets) and packaging components for consumer products.  

          The Company was incorporated  in 1923.  The executive  offices of
          the  Company are  located  at  101  Gordon  Drive,  PO  Box  645,
          Lionville, Pennsylvania   19341-0645, approximately 35 miles from
          Philadelphia.  The  telephone number at  the Company's  executive
          offices  is 610-594-2900.   As  used herein,  the term  "Company"
          includes  The West  Company,  Incorporated and  its  consolidated
          subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates.

               Principal Products -Pharmaceutical Packaging Components
               --------------------------------------------------------
          The Company manufactures a broad line of pharmaceutical  stoppers
          from natural  rubber  and  a  variety  of  synthetic  elastomers.
          Several hundred proprietary formulations of these substances  are
          molded  into a range of  stopper sizes used  in packaging serums,
          vaccines,  antibiotics,  anesthetics,  intravenous solutions  and
          other  drugs.    Most  formulae  are  specially  designed  to  be
          compatible with drugs so that the drugs will remain effective and
          unchanged during storage.  The Company's rubber laboratories  not
          only   develop   formulations,  but   also   conduct  preliminary
          compatibility tests  on customers' new  drugs, and in  the United
          States file  formulation  information  with  the  Food  and  Drug
          Administration to assist its customers' new drug applications.

          A broad line of  aluminum seals which securely hold  the stoppers
          on glass or  plastic containers is  manufactured by the  Company.
          The  Company also makes  a wide variety  of seals  lined with its
          specially formulated  rubber discs or other  materials.  Aluminum
          seals  include  closures  with  tamper-evident  tabs  or  plastic
          FlipOff^R buttons  which must  be removed before the  drug can  be
          withdrawn.   The Company  also  designs, manufactures  and  sells
          capping  machines for  use with  Company-designed metal  caps and
          seals and other packaging equipment.

                                                                          3



          The  majority  of  pharmaceutical-packaging components  currently
          manufactured by  the Company  are  used in  packaging  injectable
          drugs.  Included in  this category of products are  syringe parts
          used by pharmaceutical  manufacturers to package  their drugs  in
          pre-filled unit-dose disposable syringes.  

          Products used in  the packaging of  non-injectable drugs  include
          rubber  dropper  bulbs, plastic  contraceptive drug  packages and
          child-resistant and tamper-evident plastic closures.  The Company
          also manufactures and  markets a range of Counter  Cap^R products.
          These devices are  plastic child resistant caps  that advance, or
          count,  every time  a  bottle of  oral  medication is  opened  or
          closed,    thereby    promoting   compliance    with   medication
          instructions.    In addition, the  Company manufactures injection
          blow-molded plastic bottles and containers for the pharmaceutical
          industry. 


          In January  1992, the  Company entered  into  a partnership  with
          Schott Corporation  to  continue  the  glass  vial,  ampoule  and
          cartridge manufacturing  operations formerly  carried  on by  the
          Company  at its Cleona, Pennsylvania site.  In September 1995 the
          Company sold its 40% partnership interest to Schott Corporation.

          In January 1994,  the Company acquired Senetics,  Inc., a Boulder
          Colorado company  specializing in the  development of  innovative
          closure  and delivery  systems for the  oral and  inhalation drug
          delivery markets.  The purchase price of the acquisition was
          $3 million.  Additional amounts are due  based on license fees or
          royalty income and/or direct  sales of the product  until January
          5, 1999.

          The Company's  German holding  company,  The West  Company  GmbH,
          acquired Schubert  Seals A/S,  a  Danish manufacturer  of  rubber
          components  and metal seals servicing the European pharmaceutical
          industry.  A 51% ownership interest was acquired in May  1994 and
          the remainder in December 1995.  The purchase price totaled DK 71
          million  ($12 million  at  exchange rates  at  the dates  of  the
          acquisitions).

                 Principal Products - Components for Medical Devices
                 ----------------------------------------------------
          The Company manufactures rubber and plastic components for  empty
          disposable syringes.  Typical  components include plungers,  hubs
          and  needle  covers  which  are  assembled  into  finished  empty
          disposable syringes by the Company's customers.

          Blood-sampling  system components  manufactured  by  the  Company
          include vacuum tube stoppers and needle valves.  The Company also
          makes a number  of specialized rubber and plastic  components for
          blood analyzing systems.

          Also  included  in  this category  are  Company-manufactured  and
          Company-purchased   components   assembled   into   drug-transfer
          devices.

          The Company also manufactures and sells disposable infant nursers
          and individual nurser components to infant formula manufacturers.


                                 Principal Products 
               Packaging Components for the Consumer Products Industries
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          The  Company  manufactures  a  wide  range  of  plastic  threaded
          closures for the personal-care industry, mainly for such products
          as cosmetics and  toiletries. The Company  offers many  different
          standard  threaded closure designs in  a wide range  of sizes and
          colors, in  addition to closures designed  for specific customers
          and specialty packaging.   The Company  also manufactures  custom
          and stock plastic containers for personal-care products.

          The  Company manufactures  a  variety  of custom-designed  and/or
          proprietary   plastic closures, some of which are tamper evident,
          for food and beverage processors.


                                  Principal Services
                    Contract Packaging and Contract Manufacturing
                  --------------------------------------------------

          In  April   1995,  the  Company  purchased   Paco  Pharmaceutical
          Services, Inc.  ("Paco") for $52.4 million.  Paco with facilities
          in  Lakewood,  New Jersey  and  Canovanas,  Puerto Rico  provides
          contract  manufacturing  and   contract  packaging  services   to
          pharmaceutical and personal-care consumer companies.

          Paco's contract manufacturing services capability covers liquids,
          creams, ointments, powders and  semi-solids.  These manufacturing
          capabilities  are offered to pharmaceutical, personal health care
          and consumer products companies which supply the product  formula
          and  specifications  and  the  majority  of  the  necessary   raw
          materials.  Typical  products manufactured by  Paco are  headache
          and cold  medications, hair care products,  lotions, oral hygiene
          products  and  deodorants.    These  manufactured  products   are
          packaged  by Paco in bottles,  pouches or tubes  depending on the
          nature of the product and the customers' requirements.

          Paco also  manufactures  sterile ophthalmic  products  consisting
          primarily   of  contact  lens   solutions  for  major  ophthalmic
          companies and  manufactures and sells metaprotirenol,  a hospital
          unit-dose product used for inhalation therapy.

          Paco's contract-packaging  services include the  design, assembly
          and filling  of a  broad variety of  packages, including  blister
          packages (a plastic  bubble with a foil backing), bottles, tubes,
          laminated and other flexible pouches or strip packages,  aluminum


          <PAGE> 
                                                                          5

          and plastic liquid cup  containers, paperboard specialty packages
          and innovative tamper evident and child-resistant packages.   The
          type of  package depends  on the  requirements  of the  customer.
          Blister packaging or  bottles typically are used  for tablets and
          capsules  while aluminum  or plastic  cups, pouches,  bottles and
          tubes  are used for liquids,  creams, ointments and  powder.  The
          products  to be  inserted  in the  package  are supplied  by  the
          customer in  bulk.  They are  inserted in the package  of choice,
          labeled, boxed and shipped back to the customer.

                                    Order Backlog
                                    --------------
          Product orders  on hand at  December 31, 1995  were approximately
          $108 million, compared with approximately $99  million at the end
          of  1994.  Orders  on hand include those  placed by customers for
          manufacture over  a  period of  time  according to  a  customer's
          schedule or  upon  confirmation  by the  customer.    Orders  are
          generally considered  firm when goods are  manufactured or orders
          are  confirmed.   The Company  also has  contractual arrangements
          with a number  of its  customers, and products  covered by  these
          contracts are  included in the  Company's backlog only  as orders
          are received from those customers.

          Paco's  twelve-month  backlog  of  unfilled customer  orders  was
          approximately $20  million  at December  31,  1995.   Backlog  is
          defined  at Paco  as orders  written and  included  in production
          schedules during the next  12 months.  Such orders  generally may
          be cancelled by the customer without penalty.

                                    Raw Materials
                                    --------------
          The  Company uses three basic raw materials in the manufacture of
          its products: rubber, aluminum and plastic.  Approximately 25% of
          the   total  rubber  used  by  the  Company  is  natural  rubber,
          substantially  all  of which  is  imported  from  Sri  Lanka  and
          Malaysia.   Plastic resins and  aluminum are purchased  as needed
          from  several sources.   The Company has  been receiving adequate
          supplies  of raw materials to  meet its production  needs, and it
          foresees no significant availability problems in the near future.
          However, the political stability and seasonal  weather conditions
          of  countries  which supply  natural  rubber  are  significant
          factors in  the continuing supply  of this commodity.   Synthetic
          elastomers and plastics  currently purchased by  the Company  are
          made  from petroleum  derivatives, the  cost and  availability of
          which are dependent on the supply of petroleum feedstocks.  Also,
          the Company is dependent  on sole sources of supply  with respect
          to certain  other  raw  material  ingredients  in  older  product
          formulations.  In the event the supplier discontinues production,
          the Company  may be required  to stockpile these  materials until
          new formulations are qualified with customers.  

          The Company  is pursuing  a supply chain  management strategy  of
          aligning with  vertically integrated suppliers that control their
          own feedstocks.  This will result in reducing the number  of raw



          <PAGE>                                                           6

          materials  suppliers.  In  some cases, the  Company will purchase
          raw materials from a single source.  This strategy is expected to
          assure quality,  secure supply  and reduce  costs.   However,  it
          could result in risks to the Company's supply  lines in the event
          of a supplier production problem.  These risks will be managed by
          selecting suppliers with backup plans and fail-safe mechanisms as
          part of their operating standards.

          Paco's  customers supply  the bulk  of raw  materials as  part of
          their contractual agreements.  Items that Paco  purchases for the
          accounts of customers include preformed plastic tubes and bottles
          and  other packaging materials.   Paco uses a  variety of vendors
          and is not dependent on any single source of supply.


                         Laboratory, Research and Engineering
                        -------------------------------------
          Pharmaceutical   packaging  components   must   meet  the   rigid
          specifications set by the pharmaceutical industry relating to the
          function of the package, material compatibility, and freedom from
          chemical and  physical contamination.   Rubber formulations  that
          involve  contact  with  injectable  pharmaceutical  products  are
          required to pass  shelf-life tests extending  from six months  to
          three years. New  rubber compounds  must be tested  to show  that
          they  do not  cause precipitation  in  the customer's  product or
          affect  its potency, sterility,  effectiveness, color or clarity.
          In  addition, in  the  United States  the  Food and  Drug  Admin-
          istration  may  review  and  inspect  certain  of  the  Company's
          facilities   for  adequacy   of   methods   and  procedures   and
          qualifications of technical personnel.

          The Company  maintains  its  own  laboratories  for  testing  raw
          materials and  finished goods  to  assure adherence  to  customer
          specifications and to safeguard the quality of its products.  The
          Company also  uses its  laboratory  facilities for  research  and
          development  of new  rubber and  thermoplastic compounds  and for
          testing and evaluating new products and materials.

          The Company  maintains engineering staffs responsible for product
          and  tooling   design  and  testing   and  for  the   design  and
          construction of  processing equipment.  In addition,  a corporate
          product  research department  develops  new packaging  and device
          concepts for identified market needs.

          Research,  development  and   engineering  expenditures  for  the
          creation  and  application  of  new  and  improved  products  and
          processes were approximately $12 million in 1995, $12 million  in
          1994  and   $11.4  million  in   1993.       Approximately  140
          professional employees were engaged full time in such activity in
          1995.

                                                                          7

          As of December  31, 1995,  the Company and  its subsidiaries  had
          5,210 full-time equivalent employees.


                                 Patents and Licenses
                                ---------------------
          The patents owned by  the Company and its subsidiaries  have been
          valuable in establishing  the Company's market  share and in  the
          growth of the Company's business and may  continue to be of value
          in  the future, especially  in view  of the  Company's continuing
          development of  its own proprietary products.   Nevertheless, the
          Company  does not  consider its  business or  its earnings  to be
          materially dependent upon any single patent or patent right.

                                   Major Customers
                                  -----------------
          The    Company   serves   major   pharmaceutical   and   hospital
          supply/medical  device companies,  many  of  which  have  several
          divisions with separate purchasing responsibilities.  The Company
          also sells to many of the leading manufacturers of  personal-care
          products.  The Company distributes its products primarily through
          its  own sales force but  also uses regional  distributors in the
          United States and Asia/Pacific.

          Becton Dickinson  and Company ("B-D") accounted for approximately
          11% of the  Company's consolidated net sales during the Company's
          last  fiscal  year.   The  principal  products  sold  to B-D  are
          components  made  of  rubber,  metal and  plastic  used  in B-D's
          disposable syringes and blood sampling and analysis devices.  B-D
          has manufactured a  portion of  its own rubber  components for  a
          number of  years.  The Company expects to continue as a major B-D
          supplier.

          Excluding  B-D,  the next  ten  largest  customers accounted  for
          approximately 29%  of the  Company's  consolidated net  sales  in
          1995, and no one of these customers accounted for more than 6% of
          1995 consolidated net sales.

                                     Competition
                                     ------------
          The Company competes  with several companies,  some of which  are
          larger  than   the  Company,  across   its  major  pharmaceutical
          packaging component  and medical device component  product lines.
          In addition, many  companies worldwide compete  with the  Company
          for  business  related  to  specific  product  lines.    However,
          although there are no industry statistics available, the  Company
          believes  that  it  supplies  a  major  portion  of  the domestic
          industry  requirements   for  pharmaceutical  rubber   and  metal
          packaging components, and has a significant share of the European
          market  for these components.   Because of the  special nature of
          these products, competition is based primarily on product  design
          and performance,  although total cost is  becoming more important
          as  healthcare  markets  worldwide  face  increasing  government
          controls and pressure to control overall costs.

                                                                          8

          The  Company is one of the leading domestic producers of threaded
          plastic closures, although there are numerous competitors in  the
          field of plastics.

          In addition, some of  the Company's customers also  manufacture a
          portion of their own plastic and rubber components. 

          The  contract packaging  and  manufacturing  service industry  is
          highly  competitive.   The  Company  believes  that its  contract
          packaging   services  subsidiary,   Paco,  competes   with  three
          significant  companies, only  one of which  is larger  than Paco.
          For contract  manufacturing  services, Paco  competes  with  four
          major competitors and several smaller regional companies; several
          of  these competitors  are larger  than Paco.   In  addition most
          domestic pharmaceutical companies maintain in-house manufacturing
          and packaging capabilities  and at times will offer  their excess
          capacity to manufacture  or package on  a contract basis  other
          manufacturers' products.   However, most large pharmaceutical and
          personal health care companies have traditionally  made extensive
          use of contract packagers and manufacturers during times of  peak
          demand,  during  the  introduction  of  a  new  product  and  for
          production of samples and special product promotions.

                   Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
                 ---------------------------------------------------
          The  Company  does not  believe that  it  will have  any material
          expenditures relating  to environmental matters other  than those
          discussed in the Note "Commitments and Contingencies" of Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements  of the 1995  Annual Report  to
          Shareholders, incorporated by reference herein.

          Paco's  contract  packaging   and  manufacturing  processes   and
          services are subject to the Good Manufacturing Practice standards
          applicable  to  the  pharmaceutical   industry.    The  Company's
          packaging and manufacturing services are subject to the  Federal,
          Food,  Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act,  the  Comprehensive  Drug  Abuse
          Prevention  and  Control  Act  of  1970  and  various  rules  and
          regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the
          United States  Department of Treasury, the Bureau of Narcotics of
          the  United States  Department of  Justice, the  Drug Enforcement
          Agency and state narcotic regulatory agencies.  Paco is regularly
          subjected  to   testing  and  inspection  of   its  products  and
          facilities by representatives of various Federal agencies.

          In addition,  the Company comes  under the regulation  of various
          state and municipal  health agencies in  jurisdictions where  the
          Company has facilities.

                                                                          9

          The  Company believes  that its  international business  does not
          involve a  substantially greater business risk  than its domestic
          business.   However, economic and competitive factors vary in the
          countries in which the  Company's international subsidiaries  and
          affiliates do business.  The future growth and performance of the
          Company's international subsidiaries and affiliates are dependent
          on these  factors and  the political stability  of the  countries
          where they do business.

          The  Company's financial  condition and  results are  impacted by
          fluctuations in  exchange rate  markets  (See Notes  "Summary  of
          Significant  Accounting Policies -  "Foreign Currency" and "Other
          Income (Expense)"  of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements
          of the 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated herein by
          reference).    Hedging  by  the  Company  of  these exposures  is
          discussed in  the Note  "Debt"  and in  the Note  "Fair Value  of
          Financial  Instruments"  of   Notes  to  Consolidated   Financial
          Statements   of   the   1995  Annual   Report   to  Shareholders,
          incorporated herein by reference.     


          Item 2.   Properties
                    -----------
          The Company maintains thirteen manufacturing plants and two  mold
          and  die   production  facilities  in  the   United  States,  two
          manufacturing  plants  in   Puerto  Rico,  and  a  total  of  ten
          manufacturing plants and one mold  and die production facility in
          Germany,   England,  France,   Denmark,  Argentina,   Brazil  and
          Singapore.  

          The Company's executive  offices, U.S.  research and  development
          center  and pilot  plant  are located  in  a leased  facility  at
          Lionville, Pennsylvania,  about 35 miles from  Philadelphia.  All
          other  Company   facilities  are   used  for   manufacturing  and
          distribution, and facilities in Eschweiler, Germany and  Boulder,
          Colorado are also used for research and development activities.  

          The manufacturing facilities of the  Company are well-maintained,
          are operating generally  on a  two or three-shift  basis and  are
          adequate for the Company's present needs.

          The  principal facilities in the United  States and Puerto Rico, 
          are as follows:

          -  Approximately  1,036,000  square  feet of  owned  and  996,000
             square  feet of  leased  space  in Pennsylvania,  New  Jersey,
             Florida, Colorado, Nebraska, North Carolina and Puerto Rico. 


          The principal international facilities are as follows:

          -  Approximately 300,000 square feet  of owned space  and 145,000
             square  feet of leased space in Germany,  England, Denmark and
             France.

            Of the aforementioned currently owned facilities, approximately
          464,000  square  feet  are  subject to  mortgages  to  secure the
          Company's real estate  mortgage notes.   See the  Note "Debt"  of
          Notes  to Consolidated  Financial Statements  of the  1995 Annual
          Report to Shareholders, which information is  incorporated herein

             Sales  office  facilities  in  separate  locations  are leased
          under short-term arrangements.

             The Company also holds  for sale 106,100 square feet of former
          manufacturing facility space in the United States.

                                                                       11

          Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.
                    -----------------
          A. Wayne, New Jersey
             ------------------
          The  Company is a party  to an Administrative  Consent Order with
          the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the "DEP")
          under  which  the Company  is required  to  submit and  perform a
          cleanup plan for property formerly owned by the Company in Wayne,
          New Jersey.  The present owner  of the property, who is currently
          in  bankruptcy, has  agreed pursuant  to a  litigation settlement
          between  him  and  the  Company  to  provide  a   Declaration  of
          Environmental  Restriction required  by the  DEP to  complete the
          cleanup  pursuant  to  the  Administrative Consent  Order.    The
          settlement agreement also provides that the Company will complete
          the ongoing monitoring requirements of the cleanup  plan and will
          complete the  closure of   a plastic waste  disposal area  on the
          property subject  to the DEP's  requirements for closure  under a
          revised closure plan.  The settlement agreement is pending before
          the Bankruptcy Court,  which must  approve it  before it  becomes
          effective.

          B. OCAP Litigation
             ---------------

          On March  30, 1992, OCAP Acquisition Corp.  ("OCAP") commenced an
          action in the  Supreme Court of the State of  New York, County of
          New York, against  Paco, certain  of its subsidiaries  and R.  P.
          Scherer  Corporation ("Scherer"),  Paco's former  parent company,
          (collectively, the  "defendants"), arising out of the termination
          of an  Asset  Purchase Agreement  dated  February 21,  1992  (the
          "Purchase Agreement")  between OCAP and the  defendants providing
          for the purchase of substantially all the assets of Paco.  On May
          15, 1992, OCAP served an amended verified complaint (the "Amended
          Complaint"), asserting  causes of  action for breach  of contract
          and  breach  of  the implied  covenant  of  good  faith and  fair
          dealing, arising out of defendants' March 25, 1992 termination of
          the  Purchase  Agreement, as  well  as two  additional  causes of
          action that  were subsequently dismissed  by order of  the court.
          The Amended Complaint  seeks $75 million in actual  damages, $100
          million  in punitive damages, as well as OCAP's attorney fees and
          other  litigation expenses,  costs and disbursements  incurred in
          bringing  this  action.    Scherer has  asserted  a  counterclaim
          against OCAP for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of
          good faith and fair dealing arising out of the termination of the
          Purchase Agreement.   Discovery  with respect  to the  action has
          been  completed and a trial date of  March 21, 1996 has been set.
          Based upon  the investigation conducted  by the Company  to date,
          the  Company believes that this action lacks merit and intends to
          defend  against it vigorously.  In the opinion of management, the
          ultimate  outcome of  this litigation  will not  have a  material
          adverse effect on the Company's business or financial condition.

          Scherer  has agreed  to  indemnify Paco  against any  liabilities
          (including fees  and expenses incurred  after March 31,  1992) it
          may have as a result of this litigation matter.

          The  information  called for  by  this  Item is  incorporated  by

          of the 1995 Annual Report to Shareholders.
          
          Subsequent Event
          ----------------
          On March 28, 1996, the Company approved a plan to restructure its
          global manufacturing operations.  The plan provides for the closing
          or substantial downsizing of six manufacturing facilities and an
          approximate 5% reduction of its workforce.  As part of the plan
          the Company will withdraw from its machinery systems business,
          which accounted for less than 1% of 1995 net sales.  Implementation
          of  the restructuring  plan  will  begin  immediately  and be 
          substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 1997.

          The total estimated net charge related to these planned actions 
          is $15 million, net of $6.5 million of income tax benefits.
          Approximately one-third of the net charge relates to reduction
          in personnel and covers severance pay and other benefits to be
          provided to terminated employees.  The remaining accrued net
          charge relates to facility close down costs and to the reduction
          to net realizable value of related equipment and facilities.
          As a result of this net charge, the Company will report a net 
          loss for the quarter ending March 31, 1996.

          These actions are intended to position the Company to better 
          meet the demands of the rapidly changing healthcare market.
          Specifically the plan will create focused, more efficient 
          factories and will enable the Company to shift production to 
          lower-cost locations.  These moves are made possible by the 
          increasing willingness of our customers to accept the Company's 
          products from alternate and multiple locations.
         
          These actions are components of an overall strategy that includes
          offering customers enhanced technical capabilities and product
          offerings to enable the Company to preserve its leadership
          position in its core business.

          Subsequent Event
          ----------------
          On March 28, 1996, the Company approved a major restructuring plan
          which includes the closing or substantial downsizing of  six 
          manufacturing facilities, disposition of related excess equipment
          and properties and an approximate 5% reduction of the workforce.
          The total estimated charge related to these planned actions is
          $15 million, net of $6.5 million of income tax benefits, and will
          be accrued in the first quarter of 1996.  Approximately one-third 
          of the net charge relates to reduction in personnel, including 
          manufacturing and staff positions, and covers severance pay and 
          other benefits to be provided to terminated employees.  The 
          remaining accrued net charge relates to facility close down costs 
          and to the reduction to estimated net realizable value of the 
          carrying value of equipment and facilities made excess by the 
          restructuring plan.  The restructuring activities will be 
          substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 1997.

 under the SERP as in effect when the Participant attained age 65 (assuming

 without taking the Code Limits into account, reduced by the offet provided
 in paragraph 4.

                    3. Consideration.      In   consideration   of   your

             agreement not to compete contained in  paragraph 2, commencing
             on the date  on which you  are no longer employed by the Company
             (the "Exit Date") and until  the end  of the  Restrictive
             Period, the  Company will pay you,  on a biweekly basis, an
             amount  equal to your base salary during the twelve-month
             period prior to the Exit Date, less normal  deductions.  During
             the period from  the Exit  Date until  the  end of  the 
             Restrictive Period,  the Company  will  also continue  on  your

             offered  to  active employees, provided you make any required
             contributions with respect to  each such plan.   Notwithstanding
             the foregoing, if the  Company terminates your employment  
             for "cause", the  Company  shall not  be obligated  to make such
             payments  or provide  such benefits.    Termination shall be
             deemed  for cause  if you  are  terminated for  dishonesty,
             disloyalty, willful misconduct, gross negligence, theft, 
             conviction of a crime,  drunkenness, unethical business conduct,
             refusal to perform your duties  or a  breach of this  Agreement.
             Your obligations   under   Section   2  hereof   shall continue
             notwithstanding  termination of  your employment  for cause.
             The   foregoing   description  of   termination   for  cause
             notwithstanding,  you  or  the  Company  may  terminate your
             employment  relationship at any  time, for  cause or  for no
             reason at all. 

                    4. Enforcement.   You  acknowledge that  a  breach of
                    --------------
             this Agreement will cause the  Company immediate and
             irreparable  harm for which the  Company's remedies at law
             (such as money damages) will be  inadequate.   The  Company 
            
             <PAGE>
             shall  have  the  right, in addition  to  any other  rights it 
             may  have, to  obtain an injunction to  restrain any  breach or
             threatened  breach of this Agreement.  Should  any provision of
             this  Agreement be  adjudged to  any extent  invalid by any 
             competent tribunal, that  provision  will  be  deemed  modified 
             to the  extent necessary  to make it enforceable.   The Company
             may contact any person with  or for whom you work after my
             employment by the Company  ends and may  send that  person a copy
             of this Agreement.

                    5. Binding Effect.   Your undertakings hereunder will
                       --------------   
             bind you and your heirs  and  legal  representatives regardless
             of  (a)  the duration of your  employment by the Company,  (b)
             any change in your duties  or the  nature of your  employment,
             (c)  the reasons for  manner of  termination of your  employment,
             and (d) the amount of your compensation.

                    6. Representations   by   Employee.      You   hereby
                       -------------------------------
             represent that you have read and  fully understand  your
             duties and  obligations as  set forth herein and that such 
             duties and obligations would not unduly restrict or curtail
             your legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood following any 
             termination of your employment with the Company, whether for
             cause or otherwise.

                    7. Waivers.   The  waiver by the Company  of a breach
                       -------  
             or threatened breach of  any provision of this Agreement by you
             shall not operate or  be construed  as a  waiver of  any 
             subsequent  breach or threatened  breach by you unless and to
             the extent that such waiver is explicitly set forth in a 
             writing delivered by the Company to you.

          FINANCIAL REVIEW
          --------------------
           The Company operates in one industry segment: manufacturing  and
          marketing  specialized products  that satisfy the unique filling,
          sealing,  dispensing and  delivery  needs of  the healthcare  and
          consumer products industries.  Over 85% of the Company's revenues
          are generated by the healthcare markets.  The  Company's products
          include stoppers, closures, containers, medical device components
          and  assemblies made  from elastomers,  metal and  plastic.   The
          Company   also   provides   contract   packaging   and   contract
          manufacturing   services   and  manufactures   related  packaging
          machinery.

           The following  is management's  discussion and  analysis of  the
          Company's operating  results for  the three years  ended December
          31, 1995 and  its financial  position as of  year-end 1995.   The
          information  should be  read  in conjunction  with the  financial
          statements  and accompanying  notes  appearing elsewhere  in this
          report.

          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          ---------------------
           The Company's  1995 net income was  $28.7 million,  or $1.73 per
          share,  compared with net income  of $27.3 million,  or $1.70 per
          share, in 1994 and  $23.5 million, or  $1.48 per share, in  1993.
          In  1993, the Company  standardized December 31  as the reporting
          year end for all consolidated subsidiaries.  This change required
          all international subsidiaries to report December 1993 results in
          the  reporting year 1993, resulting in the inclusion of 13 months
          of operating results in 1993 for these subsidiaries.  This change
          added approximately $.01 per share to 1993 earnings compared with
          1994.   In  1993, the Company  adopted Statement of  Financial
          Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  109, which changed the Company's
          accounting  for  income  taxes  to  the  liability method.    The
          cumulative  impact of this method of income tax accounting was to
          reduce deferred tax liabilities  recorded as of January 1,  1993,
          adding $.06 per share to 1993 net income.

               In 1995,  the Company acquired Paco Pharmaceutical Services,
          Inc. (Paco),  a provider  of contract manufacturing  and contract
          packaging   services  to  pharmaceutical  and  consumer  products
          companies in the United States and Puerto Rico.  Paco's operating
          results have been  consolidated since May 1, 1995.   In 1994, the
          Company acquired  a 51% ownership interest in  Schubert Seals A/S
          (Schubert), a Danish manufacturer of metal seals for the European
          pharmaceutical  industry,  and  its operating  results  have been
          consolidated since June 1,  1994.  In December 1995,  the Company
          purchased  the  remaining  49%  minority  interest  in  Schubert.
          Senetics  Inc., a  domestic  company specializing  in  innovative
          closure  systems for oral and  inhalation drug delivery, was also
          acquired  early in  1994.   The terms  of these  transactions are
          described  in the  Note "Acquisitions  and Investments" to
          the Consolidated Financial Statements.

          <PAGE>
          NET SALES
          ----------

               Net  sales were $412.9 million  in 1995, an  increase of 13%
          compared  with net  sales in 1994  of $365.1 million.   The sales
          increase reflects  the acquisition of Paco  and stronger European
          currencies which increased reported  U.S. dollar sales amounts by
          $10.6 million.  Excluding these two items, consolidated net sales
          were slightly lower compared with 1994.

               Excluding  the impact  of stronger  international currencies
          versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  the  Company's  1995 net  sales  from
          products used by the  healthcare industry worldwide were slightly
          lower compared with 1994  sales levels.  Government and  consumer
          pressure  to cut  healthcare  costs has  limited  the ability  to
          increase prices and has caused more  customers to use alternative
          packaging  components, which are lower priced.   In 1995, product
          sales  to international  healthcare  markets  increased, but  net
          sales  to   domestic  markets  declined.     The  improvement  in
          international  healthcare market  sales was  attributable to  the
          following:  inclusion  of  a  full year  of  Schubert's  sales in
          consolidated  results  compared with  seven  months  in 1994,  an
          increase  in  demand  and  higher  prices  in  European  markets,
          continued  market penetration  in the  Asia/ Pacific  region, and
          stronger  demand and higher prices in markets in South America in
          the  first half of 1995.  Domestic sales suffered, despite volume
          equal to  1994,  due  to  lower  demand  for  certain  high-value
          packaging  components,  customer elimination  of  certain product
          lines and the more competitive environment. 

               Paco's   contract   packaging  and   contract manufacturing
          services  to both  pharmaceutical  and  consumer companies  added
          $38.9  million  to  1995  net  sales.     As  a  result  of   the
          consolidation of many pharmaceutical and medical device companies
          and the pressure to  reduce costs, the demand for  these contract
          services is expected to grow.

               Consumer  products sales  rose 4%  in 1995.   This  increase
          reflects  demand  for  Spout-Pak^R   used  on  gable  carton  juice
          containers   manufactured  by   International  Paper   Company.  
          Machinery  sales   declined  to  almost  half   1994  levels,  as
          customers'  capital investment  programs were suspended  as newly
          merged   pharmaceutical   companies  combined   their  production
          capacities.

               In 1994, net sales  increased by 5%, or $16.4  million, over
          1993 levels, including $2.3 million  due to stronger European and
          Asia/Pacific currencies.   December  1992 sales  of international
          subsidiaries  totalling  $8.8  million  were  included  in  1993;
          excluding this extra month of sales would increase the year-over-
          year  sales  increase  to $25.2  million,  or  7%.   Measured  at
          constant currency exchange rates, product sales to the healthcare
          industry increased in 1994 by 5% over the comparable 12 months of
          1993.    Increased  healthcare  sales were  generated  by  market
          penetration  in  the  Asia/Pacific region  and  acquisitions  and
          volume increases  in European  and  domestic healthcare  markets.
          Schubert and Senetics, both acquired in 1994,  added $8.4 million
          to total  sales.  The  volume increases  were the  result of  new

                                          2
          <PAGE>

          product offerings and increased  demand.  The sales in  both U.S.
          and European markets were negatively impacted by price reductions
          on  certain products due  to government and  consumer pressure to
          reduce  healthcare costs and  by competition.   Demand in Brazil
          for healthcare products increased in the last half of 1994, but
          sales in South  America were  lower compared to  1993.  Sales  to
          consumer products markets rose 18% in  1994 reflecting demand for
          Spout-Pak^R   and  the  Safety  SQUEASE^R  product  manufactured  
          for Procter & Gamble's  Scope^R  and Aleve^R  products.   
          Machinery sales were  also   $2.4  million  higher,  following   
          1993  delays  in customers' capital spending programs.

          GROSS PROFIT
          -------------
               The consolidated gross  margin in 1995 was  28.6%, and gross
          profit  was  $118.2  million.    The   gross  margin  reflects  a
          significant  decline from the 32.1% margin  realized in 1994, and
          resulted  in an increase  in gross profit  of less than  1%.  The
          reduced gross margin, in  part, reflects the lower-margin service
          operations  provided by  Paco, which  reduced consolidated  gross
          margins more than one  percentage point.  The Company  is working
          to   increase   Paco's  margin   through   automation,  increased
          throughput and  pricing that reflects  current cost levels.   The
          remaining  margin reduction reflects  higher raw  material costs,
          higher wage costs primarily  in South America and  a lower-margin
          product mix.   In addition,  labor and overhead  costs at  plants
          prepared to  support customers' launches of  several new products
          were only  partially recovered  from these customers.   Customers
          have  either significantly  delayed or,  in two  cases, cancelled
          these  new product launches.   Finally, the  Company has incurred
          higher start-up costs as  a result of shifting production  to new
          manufacturing sites to create centers of manufacturing excellence
          as  part of a program to consolidate global manufacturing.  These
          factors  were  evident in  a 4%  reduction  in gross  profit from
          healthcare  product  sales.    Despite  these  factors  margins
          increased  on European and  Asia/Pacific sales due  to volume and
          price  increases, but  domestic and  South America  sales margins
          declined.  

               Future  results   are  difficult  to  predict   due  to  the
          transformation  in  our  healthcare  markets.   We  believe  that
          pressure to  decrease healthcare costs and  increased competitive
          activity will continue to impact the Company's margins.  However,
          we  are evaluating our operations with the intent of being better
          able  to  respond to  these  cost  pressures in  1996.   We  will
          continue to  focus on delivering earnings  growth and shareholder
          value.

               Gross profit  on consumer  product sales was  slightly lower
          than 1994, due to a lower-margin product mix, increased  material
          costs  which were  passed through  to customers on  a prospective
          basis,  and higher  equipment repair  costs.   The low  machinery
          sales  volume in 1995 resulted in an operating loss compared with
          a  positive contribution in 1994, when sales were double the 1995
          level.

               The  Company  continued to  invest  in  the installation  of
          Manufacturing Resource Planning  Systems (MRPII) and training  in
          Total Quality Management (TQM) techniques, which began in 1992.  

                                          3
          <PAGE>

          MRPII is  an information  management system that  integrates data
          related  to sales  forecasts, production  scheduling, purchasing,
          inventory control  and  capacity requirements  planning.    MRPII
          installation  will continue,  including  installations  at  newly
          acquired  subsidiaries.   Under  TQM,  employees  work in  multi-
          disciplined teams to resolve business  and process problems.  All
          of  the  Company's  employees are  trained  in  basic TQM  tools.
          Beginning  in  1996,  TQM  training  will  address improvements
          in  administrative   processes,  in   addition  to production
          processes.   The continued benefits  of these programs
          are expected to  be evident in greater  efficiencies and customer
          satisfaction.

               The  gross margin  in 1994  was 32.1%  and gross  profit was
          $117.2  million, an 11% increase  over 1993.   The improvement in
          the  gross  margin of  1.9  percentage points  over  1993's gross
          margin was the  result, in  part, of higher  sales volume, but  a
          significant portion  of  the increase  reflects  the use  of  TQM
          techniques, MRPII systems and new technologies, which combined to
          improve productivity,  yields and logistics.   These factors were
          evident in a 7% increase  in gross profit earned on sales  to 
          healthcare  markets, with  higher contributions  generated from
          sales  to  all markets  served.   Margins  increased on  sales to
          domestic  and  South  America  markets,  while  Asia/Pacific  and
          European market sales generated margins comparable to 1993.

               Gross  profit on  consumer products  market sales  more than
          doubled   in  1994  compared  with   1993.    This  reflects  the
          significant increase in  volume, the  higher value-added  product
          sales  made possible  through  the  elimination  of  small-volume
          customers and  less profitable product lines  begun several years
          ago, and  the productivity  improvements generated  through MRPII
          systems  and  use of  TQM techniques.    Gross profit  related to
          machinery  operations  increased primarily due  to the volume  of
          orders and higher sales in the year.

          EXPENSES
          ---------
               Selling, general and administrative expenses  totalled $69.9
          million  in 1995  compared  with $70.1  million  in 1994.    This
          decrease  represented  a reduction  of  .4%,  and these  expenses
          represented  16.9% of  net  sales compared  with  19.2% in  1994.
          However, selling, general and administrative expenses include the
          expenses of acquired  companies  (Paco's expenses  for the  eight
          months from May 1, 1995 and Schubert's expenses for an additional
          five  months  in 1995  versus 1994)  and  the impact  of stronger
          international  currencies.   Eliminating  these increases,  which
          approximate  $5.5  million,  would  improve   the  year-over-year
          reduction in expenses to 8.3%.  This significantly lower level of
          expenses   primarily   reflects   absence  of   incentive   bonus
          compensation because the Company did  not meet the 1995 financial
          goals  established for payout  and significantly  lower severance
          costs in 1995.  Excluding the impact of bonus and  severance cost
          differences  would result in spending that was virtually equal to
          1994  measured  at constant  exchange  rates  for the  comparable
          operating units.   Productivity improvements due  to training and
          systems  development  have offset  the inflationary  increases in
          wages and benefits, other outside service costs and supplies.

                                          4

               Selling,  general and  administrative expenses  increased by
          $6.1 million in 1994, or 10%,  over 1993 levels.  The increase is
          attributable, in part, to $2.8 million of  higher severance costs
          related to a global management reorganization and to productivity
          improvements.   The  global reorganization  established worldwide
          functional responsibilities that had  previously been carried out
          on a regional  basis, thereby increasing  management efficiencies
          and improving service to the  Company's multi-national customers.
          The organization was changed in anticipation of the year-end 1994
          buyout of the minority owners of five European subsidiaries.  The
          increase also  reflects $1.1 million  of rent and  other expenses
          related  to the  Company's new  headquarters facility,  which was
          occupied  in September  1993,  consolidation of  $1.7 million  of
          expenses of acquired companies as well as higher costs related to
          self-insured claims  and outside service costs  and exchange rate
          differences.

               Transactions  included in the  other income/expense category
          netted  to $1.5  million  of income  in  1995 compared  with  net
          expenses  totalling $1.7 million in 1994 and $.5 million in 1993.
          Included  in this  item are  foreign currency  translation losses
          totalling $.8 million in 1995 compared with $2.3 million and $5.4
          million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These translation losses
          are driven mainly  by high  inflation in Brazil,  which has  been
          significantly  reduced since  mid-1994  as a  result of  Brazil's
          economic  plan designed  to  reduce inflation  and stabilize  the
          currency.  Also included  are foreign exchange transaction losses
          of $.6  million in 1995, $.5  million in 1994 and  $.2 million in
          1993.  The higher transaction losses in 1995 and 1994 were caused
          generally  by   realignment  of  European  currencies.    Foreign
          exchange losses  are offset by interest income  in 1995 totalling
          $2 million and  were  offset, in  part,  in 1994  and  1993 by
          interest  income   totalling  $1.2  million   and  $2.3  million,
          respectively.  Historically interest  income was generated mainly
          in  Brazil,  but has  been declining  since  mid-1994 due  to the
          economic program  which reduced  interest rates in  that country.
          Cash balances in other regions have grown in recent years and the
          interest income  has offset, in part, the decline in Brazil.  Net
          losses on real estate and  investment sales totalled $.2  million
          in  1995 and  $.5 million  in 1994  compared with  gains of  $1.4
          million in 1993 from  sales of the Company's former  headquarters
          and research center and its ownership of Tri/West Systems, Inc.

          INTEREST
          ---------
               Interest  costs totalled $7.8 million  in 1995 and were more
          than  double  the levels  of the  previous  two years.   Interest
          capitalized  as part of  the cost  of capital  asset acquisitions
          also  doubled  to  $.5 million  in  1995  compared  with the  two
          previous  years.    This  increase  in  interest  costs  reflects
          financing  related  to  the  acquisition of  Paco  in  1995,  the
          November 1994  acquisition of  the  minority  ownerships in  five
          European  subsidiaries  and  in   Schubert,  and  investments  in
          DanBioSyst UK Ltd.

               The  average  consolidated  debt  levels  increased  by  $65
          million in 1995, and interest rates also were higher in the United
          States.

               In 1994, interest expense attributable  to the consolidation
          of companies acquired in 1994, mainly attributable to capitalized
          leases,  concealed a  reduction  in 1994  interest expense  from
          1993.   The reduction was attributable to  lower average domestic
          debt  levels and lower average interest rates on debt of European
          subsidiaries.


          INCOME TAXES
          -------------
               The effective tax rate on  consolidated income was 32.8% for
          1995.   Two  factors  were the  primary cause  of  the low  rate.
          First, the  Company changed its tax accounting  method for Puerto
          Rico  operations  in  accordance  with a  U.S.  Internal  Revenue
          Service Procedure released late  in 1994.  The change  related to
          the calculation of transfer  pricing and applied retroactively as
          well  as  prospectively.   The  impact of  the tax  change
          resulted in a 3.3  percentage point decline in the  effective tax
          rate.   Second, the Company  recorded the benefit  of tax credits
          which  were assured  realization, reducing  the tax  rate by  1.7
          percentage  points.  These  benefits were  offset somewhat  by an
          increase in  the statutory  tax  rate in  France, which  required
          adjustment of deferred tax balances which increased the effective
          rate by .6 of a percentage point.  Excluding the impacts of these
          adjustments associated  with prior year  tax accruals, the
          tax rate would have been approximately 36%.

               The effective tax  rate in  1994 was 31.8%  versus 38.2%  in
          1993.  The low tax rate in 1994 reflects the one-time impact of a
          net  refund of foreign taxes paid by subsidiaries in prior years.
          The  refund  was  triggered by  the  payment  of  dividends.   In
          addition, foreign tax loss carryforwards were assured realization
          due to  the tax consolidation of  several operating subsidiaries,
          thereby  reducing the  tax asset  valuation allowance  previously
          recorded on these potential tax benefits.  The  transactions were
          made possible  by the  acquisition of the  minority ownerships  in
          these subsidiaries at year-end 1994.  Finally, the 1994 effective
          income  tax  rate   declined  due  to  lower   state  income  tax
          liabilities  and due to the higher proportion of earnings  being
          generated in lower tax jurisdictions.

          MINORITY INTERESTS AND EQUITY IN AFFILIATES
          -------------------------------------------

               Minority  interests in net  income of  subsidiaries totalled
          $.8  million  in  1995,  and  related  only  to  Schubert  and  a
          subsidiary  in  Spain.    Late  in  1995, the  remaining minority
          interest in Schubert was purchased.  The large change in minority
          interests compared to 1994's $1.9 million reflects the late  1994
          acquisition  of  the   minority  ownerships   in  five   European
          subsidiaries.  These  acquisitions also are the  major reason for
          the  change  in minority  interests in  the 1994  comparison with
          1993.  

               Income from investments in affiliated companies increased to
          $.9 million from  $.5 million  in 1994.   The increase  reflected
          higher sales  and  improved margins  for  Daikyo Seiko,  Ltd.,  a
          Japanese  company in which the  Company owns a  25% equity stake.

                                          6
          <PAGE>

          This  increase  was offset,  in part,  by  lower results  for the
          Schott  West Pharmaceutical  Glass Company  in which  the Company
          held  a 40% partnership  interest through September  30, 1995, at
          which  point the  Company  sold its  interest.   Results  of  the
          Company's investment  in affiliates in Mexico  were flat compared
          with 1994 as the impact  of a better than 50% devaluation  of the
          Mexican peso and the  resulting translation loss on  net monetary
          assets offset operating income.

               Income from affiliates decreased in 1994 to half of the 1993
          level.   The  reduction  reflected the  translation  loss on  net
          monetary  assets of the Company's affiliates in Mexico due to the
          initial devaluation of  the Mexican peso  in late December  1994.
          Offsetting these  losses, in part, was a continued improvement in
          the glass manufacturing operations of  Schott West Pharmaceutical
          Glass  Company.   Operating results of  the Company's affiliates
          in  Japan and Mexico were lower in  1994 due to lower margins and
          sales.


          FINANCIAL POSITION
          --------------------
          The Company's financial  position continues to  be strong.   Cash
          flow from operations totalled $46.1 million.  Working  capital at
          December 31, 1995  totalled $86.6  million,  a ratio  of  current
          assets to current liabilities  of 2.4 to 1,  and includes a  cash
          balance  of $17.4 million.  Debt to total invested capital (total
          debt,  minority interests  and  shareholders'  equity)  was  31%,
          despite  a near  doubling of the  outstanding debt  balances from
          year-end 1994  levels.  The  Company believes that  its financial
          position  and  current  capitalization  indicate  an  ability  to
          finance substantial future growth.

               The increase in  working capital reflects the  consolidation
          of  Paco  and the  early 1995  long-term  financing of  the final
          installment on the 1994 acquisition  of the minority interests in
          five   European  subsidiaries  and   maturing  debt  instruments.
          Accounts receivable balances, excluding Paco, declined from year-
          end  1994 levels  mainly because  the December sales  levels were
          lower  in  1995.   Inventories  were  higher primarily  in  South
          America  and  Europe reflecting  lower than  anticipated December
          sales levels.  Better production planning systems have  aided the
          control of  inventories.   Implementation at additional  sites in
          1996  will  provide  further opportunities  to  reduce  inventory
          levels. 

               The  cash   flow  from  operations  of   $46.1  million  was
          supplemented  by $4.2 million of  cash received from  the sale of
          the  Company's  interest  in  Schott  West  Pharmaceutical  Glass
          Company and a small division of Schubert.   These funds were more
          than  adequate  to  cover  $32.9  million  of  1995  fixed  asset
          acquisitions and  tooling advances to customers  and $8.1 million
          of dividends  to shareholders  ($.49 per  share).  The  remaining
          cash flow from operations,  in addition to net new  borrowings of
          $49.2 million and available cash,  was used to cover  acquisition
          payments  for Paco,  the  minority-ownership  interests  in  five

                                          7
          <PAGE>

          European  subsidiaries  and   Schubert  and  an  additional   10%
          ownership investment in DanBioSyst UK Ltd.  Cash from exercise of
          employee stock  options totalled  $2.8 million.   The outstanding
          debt  balance was  $114.3 million at  December 31,  1995 compared
          with $57.8 million at year-end 1994. 

               In July 1995, the Company entered into a new loan agreement,
          providing for debt facilities  totalling up to $85 million.   The
          agreement encompasses two revolving credit facilities.  The first
          facility provides for borrowings up to $30 million and has a term
          of  364 days,  renewable  at the  lender's  option.   The  second
          facility provides for borrowings up to $55 million and has a term
          of five years.   At year-end 1995, the Company had  $23.3 million
          outstanding  under the  364-day  facility and  nothing under  the
          five-year  facility.   In  addition, unused short-term committed 
          credit facilities  totalling $10.8  million and unused  long-term
          credit  facilities totalling  $6.1 million  at December  31, 1995
          were available to subsidiaries. 

               The increase  in assets related  to the acquisition  of Paco
          and  the Schubert  minority interest  reduced the  asset turnover
          ratio  to .94 for 1995.   Return on  average shareholders' equity
          was 11.9% for 1995.

          1996 REQUIREMENTS
          ------------------
               Cash requirements for capital projects in 1996 are estimated
          at  $36  million.   These projects  focus  on cost  reduction and
          quality improvements through technology upgrades  and product and
          process standardization.   New  product tooling is  also planned.
          Acquisition  and implementation  of  new  information  management
          systems will continue as will maintenance and improvements to the
          existing production capacity.

               In accordance with the Company's foreign exchange management
          policy, the adverse consequences resulting  from foreign currency
          exposure are mitigated by engaging in certain hedging activities.
          Foreign exchange forward contracts  are used to minimize exposure
          related to foreign currency  transactions and commitments for raw
          material purchases.   The  "Fair Value of  Financial Instruments"
          Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements explains the impact
          of  such  hedges  on  the Company's  results  of  operations  and
          financial position.   Although none were  outstanding at year-end
          1995, the Company  has in the past also entered into currency and
          interest rate swap  agreements to minimize risk to  interest rate
          changes and currency movements on certain significant borrowings.


               Cash   requirements   for  remedial   activity   related  to
          environmental cleanup  are not expected  to exceed $1  million in
          1996.    In  1995,  payments  related  to  environmental  cleanup
          totalled  $.7 million.     All of the payments  made in 1995 were
          covered  by  the estimated  liability  recorded  in prior  years,
          although additional  liability totalling $.5  million was accrued
          in  1995 because  of  changes in  the  extent of  future  cleanup
          activities required.   The Company has been  indemnified by other
          financially responsible parties against future  government claims
          relating to groundwater contamination at a Puerto Rico site,  and

                                          8
          <PAGE>

          no  additional amounts  have been  accrued with  respect  to this
          site.

               In  1996,  in addition  to  cash flow  from  operations, the
          Company expects  to receive  proceeds from employee  stock option
          exercises although options expiring  in 1996 are not significant.
          Management believes  these  sources  of  cash,  available  credit
          facilities  and  the  Company's  current  capitalization  provide
          sufficient flexibility to meet future cash flow requirements.

          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except
          share and per share data)

          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
          BASIS OF PRESENTATION:  The  financial statements are prepared in
          conformity with generally  accepted accounting principles  in the
          United  States.   These  principles  require  management to  make
          estimates  and assumptions  that affect  the reported  amounts of
          assets  and   liabilities  and  revenue  and   expenses  and  the
          disclosure of contingencies in  the financial statements.  Actual
          amounts realized may differ from these estimates.

          PRINCIPLES   OF   CONSOLIDATION:   The   consolidated   financial
          statements  include   the  accounts   of  the  Company   and  all
          significant majority-owned  subsidiaries.  For years ending prior
          to 1993, international subsidiaries are included  in consolidated
          financial statements  based on  fiscal years ending  November 30.
          In 1993, international subsidiaries are included in  consolidated
          financial statements  based on the  13 months ended  December 31.
          The inclusion of  the additional  month in 1993  added $8,100  to
          revenues,  $2,100 to  gross profit  and net  income per  share of
          approximately  $.01.    Material  intercompany  transactions  and
          accounts are eliminated in  consolidation.  An affiliated company
          reports  on the  basis  of  a  fiscal  year  ending  October  31.
          Investments in  affiliated companies in  which ownership  exceeds
          20% are accounted for on the equity method.

          STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS: Cash flows from operating activities are
          reported under the indirect method; cash equivalents include time
          deposits,  certificates of  deposit  and all  highly liquid  debt
          instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

          INVENTORIES:  Inventories  are valued  at  the lower  of  cost or
          market. The cost of  inventories located in the United  States is
          determined on  the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method,  except for
          the  cost of  inventories of  Paco Pharmaceutical  Services, Inc.
          (Paco),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary, which  is determined  on the
          first-in,  first-out  (FIFO) method.    The  cost of  inventories
          located outside  the United  States is determined  principally on
          the average cost method.

          FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Foreign currency transaction  gains
          and  losses  and translation  gains  and  losses of  subsidiaries
          operating  in  high-inflation  economies  are  recognized in  the
          determination  of  net   income.  Foreign  currency   translation
          adjustments  of  other   subsidiaries  and  affiliates  operating
          outside the United States are accumulated as a separate component
          of shareholders' equity.

          FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The Company  uses interest rate swaps and
          forward exchange  contracts  to minimize  the  economic  exposure
          related  to  fluctuating  interest and  foreign  exchange  rates.
          Amounts  to be  paid or  received under  interest rate  swaps are
          accrued  as  interest expense.   Gains  and  losses on  hedges of
          existing assets and liabilities are recognized monthly and offset
          gains and losses on the underlying transaction.  Gains and losses
          related  to firm  commitments, primarily  raw  material purchases

                                          17
          <PAGE>

          including local  needs in foreign subsidiaries,  are deferred and
          recognized as part of the underlying transaction.

          MARKETABLE  SECURITIES:   The Company  adopted the  provisions of
          Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No. 115,
          Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,
          on January 1, 1995.  Under SFAS No. 115, existing debt securities
          are classified  as held-to-maturity.  These  debt securities have
          an  aggregate value, measured  at amortized cost  at December 31,
          1995, of $900 and mature within one year of purchase.

          PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Property, plant and equipment are
          carried at  cost. Maintenance and minor repairs  and renewals are
          charged  to  expense as   incurred.  Upon  sale or  retirement of
          depreciable   assets,   costs   and   related   depreciation  are
          eliminated,   and  gains   or  losses   are  recognized   in  the
          determination of net income.

          DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION: For financial reporting purposes,
          depreciation is computed principally  on the straight-line method
          over the estimated useful  lives of the assets, or  the remaining
          term  of  the  lease  if  shorter.    For  income  tax  purposes,
          depreciation is computed using  accelerated methods. Goodwill  is
          being amortized on the  straight-line method over periods ranging
          from  15  to 40  years.   The  Company continually  evaluates the
          appropriateness of  the remaining  estimated useful life  and the
          carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.  Carrying
          values in excess  of undiscounted estimates of related cash flows
          are expensed when such determination is made. 

          RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT:  Research, development and  engineering
          expenditures for  the creation and application of new or improved
          products and  processes, which  amounted to $12,000,  $12,000 and
          $11,400 in 1995,  1994 and  1993, respectively,  are expensed  as
          incurred.

          ENVIRONMENTAL  REMEDIATION AND  COMPLIANCE COSTS:   Environmental
          remediation costs  are accrued when  such costs are  probable and
          reasonable estimates  are determinable.   Cost estimates  are not
          discounted  and include  investigation,  cleanup  and  monitoring
          activities; such  estimates are adjusted, if  necessary, based on
          additional  findings.  In general, environmental compliance costs
          are  expensed.     Environmental  compliance  costs  at   current
          operating sites  are capitalized, if  they increase the  value of
          the property and/or prevent environmental hazards from occurring.


          INCOME  TAXES:   Beginning in 1993, the Company adopted Statement
          of Financial Accounting Standards  (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for
          Income Taxes, which provides  that income taxes be accounted  for
          under the liability method.  Under the liability method, deferred
          income  taxes are  recognized by  applying enacted  statutory tax
          rates,  applicable  to  future years,  to  temporary  differences
          between  the tax bases and financial statement carrying values of
          the  Company's assets  and  liabilities.    Financial  statements
          prior to 1993  were not  restated, and the  cumulative effect  of
          adopting  SFAS  No.  109  is reported  in  the  1993 Consolidated
          Statement of Income net of applicable minority interests.

               United  States  income  taxes  and   withholding  taxes  are
          accrued on the portion  of earnings of international subsidiaries
          and affiliates (which qualify as  joint ventures) intended to  be
          remitted to the parent company.    

          NET  INCOME  PER SHARE:  Net income  per  share is  based  on the
          weighted  average number  of shares  of Common  Stock outstanding
          during each period. Common Stock equivalents are not material.

          OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

          ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
           On April  27,  1995, the  Company completed  its acquisition  of
          Paco,  a  company  providing  contract  packaging   and  contract
          manufacturing services  to   pharmaceutical  and consumer products  
          companies  in  the United  States  and Puerto  Rico.  Paco
          was  a public  company  traded over-the-counter,  and the  merger
          followed  the completion of a  cash tender offer  for Paco common
          stock  at $12.25 per share, for a total consideration of $52,400.
          The purchase was financed  using available cash of $22,400  and a
          long-term credit facility of $30,000.  The excess of the purchase
          price  over the net assets acquired of $22,900 is being amortized
          over 30 years.  Paco has been consolidated since May 1, 1995.

          On December 18, 1995, the Company acquired the remaining minority
          ownership  interest in  Schubert Seals  A/S (Schubert),  a Danish
          manufacturer  of metal seals and related  products mainly for the
          pharmaceutical industry.   The initial 51%  ownership interest in
          Schubert was acquired  on May 20, 1994.   The purchase price  for
          these acquisitions was DK40,000 ($7,200), and DK31,000 ($4,800 at
          May 20, 1994), respectively, and  were financed through new  debt
          facilities.   Schubert has been consolidated since  June 1, 1994.
          The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired for
          this subsidiary  approximates $8,400 and is  being amortized over
          40 years.

           On  November  30,  1994,  the  Company  acquired  the  remaining
          minority   ownership  interests   in  five   European  subsidiary
          companies. The total purchase price for the minority interests in
          these subsidiaries  was DM45,000 ($28,800 at  November 30, 1994).
          The  cash  portion  of   the  purchase  price  totalled  DM30,000

                                          19

          ($19,300)  of  which DM4,500  ($2,900)  was paid  at  closing and
          DM25,500  ($16,400)   on  January 2,  1995;  the balance  of  the
          consideration,  DM15,000 ($9,500), was  paid through  delivery of
          363,214 shares of  the Company's  Common Stock at  closing.   The
          excess  of the  purchase price  over minority  interests acquired
          approximates $16,800 and is being amortized over 40 years. 
           All of these acquisitions are being  accounted for as purchases.
          The following table  presents selected financial information  for
          the  years  ended December  31,  1995 and  1994  on  a pro  forma
          (unaudited)  basis  assuming  the  acquisitions  noted above  had
          occurred on January 1, 1995 and 1994:

               In 1994, the  Company acquired Senetics, Inc.  (Senetics), a
          company specializing  in the  development of innovative  delivery
          technologies for  oral and inhalation drug  delivery markets, and
          acquired  in  each of  the years  1995  and 1994  a 10%-ownership
          interest  in  DanBioSyst  UK  Ltd.,  a  company  specializing  in
          noninvasive drug  delivery methods.  The  total consideration for
          these  acquisitions was $2,500 in 1995 and $5,600 in 1994, all of
          which was paid in cash.  The acquisition of Senetics is accounted
          for  as a purchase, and  the company has  been consolidated since
          January 1, 1994.   Additional consideration may  be due depending
          on sales of  Senetics' products  through January 5,  1999.   Such
          additional consideration will be accounted for as goodwill.

               At December  31, 1995, subsidiaries  had operating  tax loss
          carryovers of $13,800,  which will be available  to apply against
          the future taxable  income of such  subsidiaries.  The  carryover
          periods  expire beginning with $200 in  1996 and continue through
          2009.   A valuation allowance  has been recognized  to offset the
          related  deferred   tax  asset  to  the   extent  realization  is
          uncertain.

               At   December    31,   1995,   undistributed   earnings   of
          international subsidiaries,  on which deferred income  taxes have
          not  been provided,  amounted to  $64,500.   It is  the Company's
          intention   to   reinvest  undistributed   earnings   of  foreign
          subsidiaries,  and it is not practicable  to determine the amount
          of  income  or withholding  tax that  would  be payable  upon the
          remittance of those earnings.  Such earnings would become taxable
          upon  the sale or liquidation of foreign subsidiaries or upon the
          remittance of dividends.  Tax credits that would become available
          upon distribution of such earnings could reduce income taxes then
          payable at the United  States statutory rate. As of  December 31,
          1995, the Company had available  foreign tax credit carryovers of
          approximately  $600 expiring  in 1996  through 1999.  A valuation
          allowance has been recognized to offset the related  deferred tax
          asset to the extent realization is uncertain.

          Included above  are inventories located in the United States that
          are valued on the LIFO basis, amounting to $14,900 and $16,200 at
          December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, which are approximately
          $9,400 and $8,000, respectively, lower than replacement value. 

          The  Company uses three basic raw materials in the manufacture of
          its products: rubber, aluminum and plastic.  Approximately 25% of
          the  total rubber used  is natural  rubber, substantially  all of
          which is imported  from Sri  Lanka and Malaysia.   The  political
          stability and seasonal weather  conditions of these countries are
          significant factors  in the continuing supply  of this commodity.
          Synthetic  elastomers   and  plastics  are  made  from  petroleum
          derivatives, the cost and availability of which are  dependent on
          the supply of petroleum feedstocks to the Company's suppliers.

          Unremitted   income   of   affiliated   companies   included   in
          consolidated retained  earnings amounted  to  $9,800, $9,100  and
          $8,900  at  December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.

          Daikyo Seiko, Ltd.  classifies its debt and  equity securities in
          one of two categories, trading or available-for-sale, and carries
          them  at  fair value.   Unrealized  holding  gains and  losses on
          trading securities are included  in earnings.  Unrealized holding
          gains  and losses, net of  the related tax  effect, on available-
          for-sale securities  are excluded from earnings  and are reported
          as part  of shareholders' equity  until realized.   The Company's
          equity  in  these  unrealized  gains  and  losses  increased  the
          Company's shareholders' equity by $300 at December 31, 1995.

          DEBT
          Short-Term:  At  December 31,  1995,  the  Company had  available
          unused  short-term lines  of  credit amounting  to $17,500;  fees

          <PAGE>

          ranging up to 1/8% per annum  are payable on these available credit
          lines.  Short-term debt  of $20,200 under a credit line  has been
          classified as long-term because of the Company's  intent to renew
          the  borrowing  using  an available  long-term  revolving  credit
          facility.  Notes payable in  the amounts of $8,300 and  $2,700 at
          December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively, are payable within one
          year and bear  interest at  a weighted-average  interest rate  of
          7.4%.

          (a) The  proceeds  of  industrial revenue  bonds  that  were  not
          required  for  the  respective  construction  projects have  been
          invested by the Company.  Use of these excess funds  and earnings
          thereon  is restricted  to servicing the  debt. The  aggregate of
          unexpended proceeds  and earnings thereon of  $1,400 is reflected
          as a reduction of the principal outstanding on the bonds.
             
          (b) Real estate, machinery and equipment with a carrying value of
          $17,000 at December 31, 1995 are pledged as collateral. 

            A  revolving  credit facility  provides  for  borrowings up  to
          $55,000 through August 2000 at a floating rate based on LIBOR.  A
          commitment fee  ranging up to 3/20  % per annum is  payable on the
          unused  amount.   A  subsidiary  has  long-term  line  of  credit
          providing up  to FF 30,000 ($6,100)  at a floating rate  based on
          PIBOR  plus 2/5 %  and a commitment fee  of  3/10  % is payable per
          annum.    No  amounts  are  outstanding  under  this facility  at
          December 31, 1995.

           At December  31 1995, $4,300 of  Paco's subordinated debentures,
          at par value, were outstanding.  The  subordinated debentures are
          reflected in the balance sheet net of a $1,300 discount, which is

                                          26

          being  amortized through  the maturity  date of  the subordinated
          debentures, March 1, 2007.  The holders have the right to convert
          such   subordinated   debentures   into   cash   for  an   amount
          approximating 50% of the par value of the subordinated debentures
          converted.  Interest is payable semiannually.

               Long-term  debt maturing  in the  years  following 1996  is:
          $11,700  in 1997, $700  in 1998, $25,100  in 1999  and $36,800 in
          2000.

               Certain  of the  financing agreements,  among other  things,
          require  the maintenance  of  certain working  capital,  interest
          coverage  and debt-to-  capitalization  ratios  and tangible  net
          worth;  restrict the  sale of  assets; and  limit the  payment of
          dividends.  At December 31, 1995, under the most restrictive debt
          agreement, retained earnings free of restriction were $19,300.
                     
               Interest  costs incurred  during 1995,  1994  and 1993  were
          $7,800, $3,500 and  $3,400, respectively, of which $500, $200 and
          $300,  respectively, were  capitalized  as part  of  the cost  of
          acquiring certain assets.

               To  finance  and hedge  a portion  of  the 1986  purchase of
          ownership interests in certain European subsidiaries, the Company
          entered into  a currency and  interest rate swap  agreement which
          matured early in 1995. Under the agreement, the Company exchanged
          $7,200 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1/8% for DM20,000 ($12,900 
          at maturity) bearing interest at 7.5%.  A swap agreement expired 
          in 1994 under which the Company agreed  to  swap  $2,700  bearing
          interest  at  LIBOR  for  DM5,000 ($2,800  at  maturity)  bearing
          interest  at  6.33%.  The  net  interest  expense  recognized  in
          connection with these agreements  was $100 in 1995, $600  in 1994
          and $800 in 1993.

               Principal and/or interest amounts  due under swap agreements
          are presented in the financial statements on a net basis.


          FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

          Methods  used to  estimate the  fair market  values of  the above
          listed  financial instruments  are  as follows:    cash and  cash
          equivalents  are  estimated at  carrying values  that approximate
          market,  due to the short maturity  of cash equivalents.  Debt is

          <PAGE>

          estimated  based  on current  market  quotes  for instruments  of
          similar maturity.  Interest rate  swaps (see preceding Debt Note)
          and  forward  exchange rate  contracts  are  valued at  published
          market prices, market prices of comparable instruments or quotes.
               Forward  exchange  contracts  are used  only  to  hedge  raw
          material  purchase  commitments and  foreign-currency-denominated
          receivables and payables.   At  December 31, 1995  and 1994,  the
          Company had forward exchange  rate contracts that totalled $4,100
          and $14,200, respectively.   Forward exchange contracts  totalling
          $4,100  relate to  raw material  purchases denominated  in German
          marks, French francs and British pounds sterling; these contracts
          expire  monthly  through September  30,  1996.   Gains/losses  on
          contracts used  to hedge raw material purchases  are deferred and
          will adjust the cost of such inventory.

          BENEFIT PLANS
          Pension Plans: The Company and certain domestic and international
          subsidiaries sponsor  defined benefit  pension plans.  The United
          States  plans  cover  substantially  all  domestic  employees and
          members of the Company's  Board of Directors. The plans  call for
          benefits to be paid to eligible participants  at retirement based
          on  compensation  rates  near  retirement  and/or  on  length  of
          service.  Contributions  to  the  United  States  employee  plans
          reflect  investment   performance   of  plan   assets,   benefits
          attributed to employees' service to date  and service expected in
          the  future. Assets of the  United States employee  plans and one
          international  subsidiary plan  consist primarily  of common  and
          preferred  stocks, investment-grade  corporate bonds,  and United
          States  government  obligations;  other international  subsidiary
          plans and the plan for directors are not funded.

          The discount rates used were 7% for 1995 and 8.25%  for 1994; the

          decreasing  to 5.5% by 2007.   Increasing the  assumed trend rate
          for healthcare costs by  one percentage point would result  in an
          accrued  obligation of  $14,500 at  December 31,  1995 for  these
          retirement benefits and an  increase of $100 in the  related 1995
          expense.

          Other:  The Company provides certain postemployment benefits for

          of Financial Accounting Standards  No. 112, Employer's Accounting
          for Postemployment  Benefits, requires these costs  to be accrued
          over  the  employee's   active  service   period  under   certain
          circumstances or at the date of the event triggering the benefit.

          The Company  adopted this  accounting practice  in 1993, and  the
          impact was insignificant. 
               The Company  also  sponsors a  defined contribution  savings
          plan  for salaried  and certain  hourly United  States employees.
          Company  contributions are  equal  to 50%  of each  participant's
          contribution up to  6% of their base  compensation. Total expense
          under the  plan in 1995, 1994  and 1993 was $900,  $800 and $800,
          respectively.

          The Company's Shareholders Rights  Plan entitles a shareholder to
          purchase 1/1000  of a share of  a newly designated series  of the
          Company's Preferred Stock at a price of $75.00 with each Right. A
          Right  becomes  exercisable  if  a  person  or  group  (acquiror)
          acquires 15% or more  of the Common  Stock or commences a  tender
          offer that would result in the acquiror owning 18% or more of the
          Common Stock.  After  the Rights  become exercisable  and in  the
          event  the  Company is  involved in  a  merger or  other business
          combination, sale of 50% or more of its  assets or earning power,
          or if  an acquiror purchases 18%  or more of the  Common Stock or
          engages in  self-dealing transactions,  a Right will  entitle its
          holder to purchase common stock of the surviving company having a
          market  value twice the exercise  price of the  Right. The Rights
          may be redeemed  by the Company  at $.001 per  Right at any  time
          before  certain events  occur. Two  Rights are  attached to  each
          share  of Common Stock, and such rights will not trade separately
          unless they become exercisable. All Rights expire on January  15,
          2000.
               In  1992, the  Company made  an offering  under an  employee
          stock purchase plan, which provides for the sale of the Company's
          Common Stock to substantially all employees at 85% of fair market
          value.  An employee's purchases  were limited annually  to 10% of
          base compensation. The offer, which expired on December 31, 1995,
          has been extended to December 31,  1997.  Shares are purchased in
          the open market, or Treasury shares are used.

          STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
          The Company has a  long-term incentive plan for officers  and key
          management  employees of  the Company  and its  subsidiaries that
          provides  for the grant through  March 8, 1998  of stock options,
          stock   appreciation   rights,   restricted   stock   awards  and
          performance awards. A maximum of 2,125,000 shares of Common Stock 
          or stock equivalents are available for issue under this plan of 
          which 213,800 shares are available  as of December 31, 1995  for 
          future grant. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the 
          terms and conditions  of  grants, except that the exercise price 
          of certain options cannot be less than 100% of the fair market 
          value of the  stock on  the date  of grant, no  stock options or 
          stock appreciation  rights  can  be  exercised during  the  six  
          months immediately following the  date of grant,  and all stock  
          options and  stock appreciation rights must expire no later than 
          10 years after the date of grant.  
               Option  activity under  this  plan  during the  three  years

          Under  the Company's management  incentive plan, participants are
          paid cash bonuses on the  attainment of certain financial  goals.
          The bonuses awarded totalled $2,100 for 1994 and $2,000 for 1993.
          In  1993,  bonus participants  were  offered  the opportunity  to
          purchase Common  Stock with up to 25%  of their cash bonus award.
          Beginning  in 1994, bonus participants are required to use 25% of
          their cash bonus, after certain adjustments for taxes payable, to
          purchase Common  Stock  of the  Company  at current  fair  market
          value.   Bonus participants  are given  a restricted stock  award
          equal to one share for each four shares of Common Stock purchased
          with bonus  awards.  These stock  awards vest at the  end of four
          years provided that the participant has not made a  disqualifying
          disposition  of  the stock  purchased.   In  1995, 1994  and 1993
          restricted stock awards for 3,300  shares, 3,000 shares and 1,900
          shares, respectively, were  granted, and  in 1995  and 1994,  200
          shares   and   500    shares,   respectively,   were   forfeited.
          Compensation expense is being  recognized over the vesting period
          based on the fair market value of Common Stock on the award date:
          $25.31 per share in 1995, $24.94 per share in 1994 and $20.81 per
          share in 1993.

          for  the  purchase of  equipment  and raw  materials  amounted to
          $9,800, all of which is due to be paid in 1996.  
               The Company has accrued the  estimated cost of environmental
          compliance expenses related to soil  or groundwater contamination
          at  current and  former manufacturing  facilities.   The ultimate
          cost  to be  incurred  by  the Company  and  the  timing of  such
          payments  cannot   be  fully  determined.     However,  based  on
          consultants' estimates of the  costs of remediation in accordance
          with applicable regulatory requirements, the Company believes the
          accrued liability of $1,500 at December 31, 1995 is sufficient to
          cover the future costs  of these remedial actions, which  will be
          carried out  over the next two  to three years.   The Company has
          not  anticipated any  possible recovery  from insurance  or other
          sources.

               On March 30,  1992, OCAP Acquisition Corp.  (OCAP) commenced
          an action in  the Supreme Court of the State  of New York, County
          of New York, against  Paco, certain of its subsidiaries  and R.P.
          Scherer    Corporation    (Scherer)    Paco's    former    parent

          company,(collectively,   the  defendants),  arising  out  of  the
          termination  of an  Asset Purchase  Agreement dated  February 21,
          1992  (the Purchase  Agreement) between  OCAP and  the defendants
          providing  for the  purchase of substantially  all the  assets of
          Paco.  On May 15, 1992, OCAP served an amended verified complaint
          (the Amended Complaint), asserting causes of action for breach of
          contract and breach  of the  implied covenant of  good faith  and
          fair  dealing,   arising  out  of  defendants'   March  25,  1992
          termination  of the Purchase Agreement, as well as two additional
          causes of action that were subsequently dismissed by order of the
          court.  The Amended  Complaint seeks $75,000  in  actual damages,
          $100,000 in punitive damages, as well as OCAP's attorney fees and
          other litigation  expenses, costs  and disbursements  incurred in
          bringing  this  action.    Scherer has  asserted  a  counterclaim
          against OCAP for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of
          good faith and fair dealing arising out of the termination of the
          Purchase Agreement.   Discovery with  respect to  the action  has
          been completed and a trial  date of March 21, 1996 has  been set.
          Based upon the  investigation conducted by  the Company to  date,
          the  Company believes that this action lacks merit and intends to
          defend  against it vigorously.  In the opinion of management, the
          ultimate outcome  of this  litigation  will not  have a  material
          adverse effect on the Company's business or financial condition.

               Scherer   has  agreed   to   indemnify   Paco  against   any
          liabilities (including fees and expenses incurred after March 31,
          1992) it may have as a result of this litigation matter.

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

          TO  THE SHAREHOLDERS  AND  THE BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS OF  THE  WEST
          COMPANY, INCORPORATED:

               We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
          of The West Company, Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December
          31, 1995  and 1994,  and the related  consolidated statements  of
          income,  shareholders' equity,  and cash  flows for  each  of the
          three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  1995.  These
          financial  statements are  the  responsibility of  the  Company's
          management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  these
          financial statements based on our audits.
               We  conducted  our  audits  in   accordance  with  generally
          accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
          and  perform  the  audit  to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about
          whether   the  financial   statements   are   free  of   material
          misstatement.  An  audit includes  examining,  on  a test  basis,
          evidence supporting the amounts  and disclosures in the financial
          statements. An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
          principles used and significant  estimates made by management, as
          well as  evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
          We believe that  our audits  provide a reasonable  basis for  our
          opinion.
               In our  opinion, the financial statements  referred to above
          present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  consolidated
          financial  position  of   The  West  Company,   Incorporated  and
          Subsidiaries  as  of   December  31,  1995  and   1994,  and  the
          consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
          each of the three years in the period ended December  31, 1995 in
          conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
               As  discussed  in  the  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting
          Policies  Note  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the
          Company  changed its  method  of accounting  for income  taxes in
          1993.

          REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

               The  Company's management is responsible for the integrity,
          reliability  and  objectivity   of  publicly  reported  financial
          information.   Management believes that the  financial statements
          as of  the year  ended December  31, 1995  have been  prepared in
          conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and that
          information presented  in this  Annual Report is  consistent with
          those  statements.    In  preparing  the   financial  statements,
          management   makes  informed   judgements  and   estimates  where
          necessary, with appropriate consideration given to materiality.

               In  meeting  its   responsibility  for  preparing  financial
          statements, management maintains a system  of internal accounting
          controls over financial reporting  including the safeguard of its
          assets  against  unauthorized  acquisition, use  or  disposition.
          This  system is  designed  to provide  reasonable assurance  that
          assets  are   safeguarded  and  transactions   are  executed   in
          accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly,
          allowing for preparation of reliable financial statements.  There
          are  inherent limitations  in the  effectiveness of  all internal
          control systems.  The  design of the Company's system  recognizes
          that errors  or irregularities may  occur and that  estimates and
          judgements are required to assess the  relative cost and expected
          benefits of the controls.  Management believes that the Company's
          accounting controls  provide reasonable assurance that  errors or
          irregularities that could be material to the financial statements
          are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.

               The independent  accountants are  appointed by the  Board of
          Directors, with the  approval of  the shareholders.   As part  of
          their engagement, the independent accountants audit the Company's
          financial statements,  express their opinion thereon,  and review
          and evaluate selected systems, accounting procedures and internal
          controls to the  extent they consider necessary to  support their
          report.
