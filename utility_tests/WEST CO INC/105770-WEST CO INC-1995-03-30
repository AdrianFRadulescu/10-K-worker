PART I

Item l.           Business
                  --------

                                  The Company
                                  -----------
The West Company, Incorporated is engaged in one industry segment - the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of stoppers, closures, containers,
medical device components and assemblies made from elastomers, metal, glass and
plastic that meet the unique filling, sealing, dispensing and delivery needs of
the health care and consumer products markets. The Company also manufactures
related packaging machinery. The Company's products include pharmaceutical-
packaging components (stoppers, seals, caps, containers and dropper bulbs),
components for medical devices (parts for syringes and components for blood
sampling and analysis devices and for intravenous administration sets) and
packaging components for consumer products.

The Company was incorporated in 1923. The executive offices of the Company are
located at 101 Gordon Drive, PO Box 645, Lionville, Pennsylvania 19341-0645,
approximately 35 miles from Philadelphia. The telephone number at the Company's
executive offices is 610-594-2900. As used herein, the term "Company" includes
The West Company, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the
context otherwise indicates.

            Principal Products -Pharmaceutical Packaging Components
            --------------------------------------------------------
The Company manufactures a broad line of pharmaceutical stoppers from natural
rubber and a variety of synthetic elastomers. Several hundred proprietary
formulations of these substances are molded into a range of stopper sizes used
in packaging serums, vaccines, antibiotics, anesthetics, intravenous solutions
and other drugs. Most formulae are specially designed to be compatible with
drugs so that the drugs will remain effective and unchanged during storage. The
Company's rubber laboratories not only develop formulations, but also conduct
preliminary compatibility tests on customers' new drugs, and in the United
States file formulation information with the Food and Drug Administration to
assist its customers' new drug applications.

A broad line of aluminum seals which securely hold the stoppers on glass or
plastic containers is manufactured by the Company. The Company also makes a wide
variety of seals lined with its specially formulated rubber discs or other
materials. Aluminum seals include closures with tamper-evident tabs or plastic
FlipOffR buttons which must be removed before the drug can be withdrawn. The
Company also designs, manufactures and sells capping machines for use with
Company-designed metal caps and seals and other packaging equipment.

<PAGE>

The majority of pharmaceutical-packaging components currently manufactured by
the Company are used in packaging injectable drugs. Included in this category of
products are syringe parts used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to package their
drugs in pre-filled unit-dose disposable syringes.

Products used in the packaging of non-injectable drugs include rubber dropper
bulbs, plastic contraceptive drug packages and child-resistant and
tamper-evident plastic closures. The Company also manufactures and markets a
range of Counter CapR products. These devices are plastic child resistant caps
that advance, or count, every time a bottle of oral medication is opened or
closed, thereby promoting compliance with medication instructions. In addition,
the Company manufactures injection blow-molded plastic bottles and containers
for the pharmaceutical industry.


In January 1992, the Company entered into a partnership with Schott Corporation
to continue the glass vial, ampoule and cartridge manufacturing operations
formerly carried on by the Company at its Cleona, Pennsylvania site. The
partnership, Schott West Pharmaceutical Glass Company, is owned 60% by Schott
Corporation
and 40% by the Company.

In January 1994, the Company acquired Senetics, Inc., a Boulder Colorado company
specializing in the development of innovative closure and delivery systems for
the oral and inhalation drug delivery markets.

In May 1994, the Company acquired a 51% interest in Schubert Seals A/S, a Danish
manufacturer of rubber components and metal seals servicing the European
pharmaceutical industry.

              Principal Products - Components for Medical Devices
              ----------------------------------------------------
The Company manufactures rubber and plastic components for empty disposable
syringes. Typical components include plungers, hubs and needle covers which are
assembled into finished empty disposable syringes by the Company's customers.

Blood-sampling system components manufactured by the Company include vacuum tube
stoppers and needle valves. The Company also makes a number of specialized
rubber and plastic components for blood analyzing systems.

Also included in this category are Company-manufactured and Company-purchased
components assembled into drug-transfer devices.

The Company also manufactures and sells disposable infant nursers and individual
nurser components to infant formula manufacturers.


<PAGE>
                               Principal Products
           Packaging Components for the Consumer Products Industries
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
The Company manufactures a wide range of plastic threaded closures for the
personal-care industry, mainly for such products as cosmetics and toiletries.
The Company offers many different standard threaded closure designs in a wide
range of sizes and colors, in addition to closures designed for specific
customers and specialty packaging. The Company also manufactures custom and
stock plastic containers for personal-care products.

The Company manufactures a variety of custom-designed and proprietary plastic
closures, some of which are tamper evident, for distillers and food and beverage
processors.

                                 Order Backlog
                                 --------------
Orders on hand at December 31, 1994 were approximately $99 million, compared
with approximately $90 million at the end of 1993. Orders on hand include those
placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to a
customer's schedule or upon confirmation by the customer. Orders are generally
considered firm when goods are manufactured or orders are confirmed. The Company
also has contractual arrangements with a number of its customers, and products
covered by these contracts are included in the Company's backlog only as orders
are received from those customers.

                                 Raw Materials
                                 --------------
The Company uses four basic raw materials in the manufacture of its products:
rubber, aluminum, plastic and glass. Approximately 25% of the total rubber used
by the Company is natural rubber, substantially all of which is imported from
Sri Lanka and Malaysia. Plastics and aluminum are purchased as needed from
several sources. The Company has been receiving adequate supplies of raw
materials to meet its production needs, and it foresees no significant
availability problems in the near future. However, the political stability and
seasonal weather conditions of countries which supply natural rubber may be
significant factors in the continuing supply of this commodity. Synthetic
elastomers and plastics currently purchased by the Company are made from
petroleum derivatives, the cost and availability of which are dependent on the
supply of petroleum feedstocks. Also, the Company is dependent on sole sources
of supply with respect to certain other raw material ingredients in older
product formulations. In the event the supplier discontinues production the
Company may be required to stockpile these materials until new formulations are
qualified with customers.

The Company is pursuing a supply chain management strategy of aligning with
vertically integrated suppliers that control their own feed stocks. This will
result in reducing the number of raw materials suppliers. In some cases, the
Company will purchase raw


<PAGE>
materials from a single source. this strategy is expected to assure quality,
secure supply and reduce costs. However, it could result in risks to the
Company's supply lines in the event of a supplier production problem. These
risks will be managed by selecting suppliers with backup plans and fail-safe
mechanisms as part of their operating standards.

                      Laboratory, Research and Engineering
                     -------------------------------------
Pharmaceutical packaging components must meet the rigid specifications set by
the pharmaceutical industry relating to the function of the package, material
compatibility, and freedom from chemical and physical contamination. Rubber
formulations that involve contact with injectable pharmaceutical products are
required to pass shelf-life tests extending from six months to three years. New
rubber compounds must be tested to show that they do not cause precipitation in
the customer's product or affect its potency, sterility, effectiveness, color or
clarity. In addition, in the United States the Food and Drug Administration may
review and inspect certain of the Company's facilities for adequacy of methods
and procedures and qualifications of technical personnel.

The Company maintains its own laboratories for testing raw materials and
finished goods to assure adherence to customer specifications and to safeguard
the quality of its products. The Company also uses its laboratory facilities for
research and development of new rubber and thermoplastic compounds and for
testing and evaluating new products and materials.

The Company maintains engineering staffs responsible for product and tooling
design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment.
In addition, a corporate product research department develops new packaging and
device concepts for identified market needs.

Research, development and engineering expenditures for the creation and
application of new and improved products and processes were approximately
$12,000,000 in 1994, $11,400,000 in 1993 and $11,100,000 in 1992. Approximately
140 professional employees were engaged full time in such activity in 1994.


                                   Employees
                                   ----------
As of December 31, 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries had 3,680 full-time
employees.

                              Patents and Licenses
                             ---------------------
The patents owned by the Company have been valuable in establishing the
Company's market share and in the growth of the Company's business and may
continue to be of value in the future, especially in view of the Company's
continuing development of its own

<PAGE>
proprietary products. Nevertheless, the Company does not consider its business
or its earnings to be materially dependent upon any single patent or patent
right.

The Company also has an agreement with Daikyo Seiko, Ltd., a Japanese company in
which the Company has a 25% ownership position, relating to the sharing and
cross-licensing of certain technology.

                                Major Customers
                               -----------------
The Company serves major pharmaceutical and hospital supply/medical device
companies, many of which have several divisions with separate purchasing
responsibilities. The Company also sells to many of the leading manufacturers of
personal-care products. The Company distributes its products primarily through
its own sales force and also through regional distributors in the United States
and Asia/Pacific.

Becton Dickinson and Company ("B-D") accounted for approximately 11% of the
Company's consolidated net sales during the Company's last fiscal year. The
principal products sold to B-D are components made of rubber, metal and plastic
used in their disposable syringes and blood sampling and analysis devices. B-D
has manufactured a portion of its own rubber components for a number of years.
The Company expects to continue as a major B-D supplier.

Excluding B-D, the next ten largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of
the Company's consolidated net sales in 1994, and no one of these customers
accounted for more than 6% of 1994 consolidated net sales.

                                  Competition
                                  ------------
The Company competes with several companies, some of which are larger than the
Company, across its major pharmaceutical packaging component and medical device
component product lines. In addition, many companies worldwide compete with the
Company for business related to specific product lines. However, although there
are no industry statistics available, the Company believes that it supplies a
major portion of the domestic industry requirements for pharmaceutical rubber
and metal packaging components, and has a significant share of the European
market for these components. Because of the special nature of these products,
competition is based primarily on product design and performance, although total
cost is becoming more important as health care markets worldwide face increasing
government controls and pressure to control overall costs.

The Company is one of the leading domestic producers of threaded plastic
closures, although there are numerous competitors in the field of plastics.


<PAGE>
In addition, some of the Company's customers also manufacture a portion of their
own plastic, rubber and glass components.

                             Environmental Matters
                            ------------------------
The Company does not believe that it will have any material expenditures
relating to environmental matters other than those discussed in the Note
"Commitments and Contingencies" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of
the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated by reference herein.

                                 International
                                ---------------
The Note "Affiliated Companies" and the Note "Industry Segment and
Operations by Geographic Area" of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders are
incorporated herein by reference.

The Company believes that its international business does not involve a
substantially greater business risk than its domestic business. However,
economic and competitive factors vary in the countries in which the Company's
international subsidiaries and affiliates do business. The future growth and
performance of the Company's international subsidiaries and affiliates are
dependent on these factors and the political stability of the countries where
they do business.

The Company's financial condition and results are impacted by fluctuations in
exchange rate markets (See Notes "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -
Foreign Currency" and "Other Income (Expense)" of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated
herein by reference). Hedging by the Company of these exposures is discussed in
the Note "Debt" and in the Note "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders,
incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.           Legal Proceedings.
                  -----------------
A.    Wayne, New Jersey
      ------------------
The Company is a party to an Administrative Consent Order with the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) under which the Company is required
to submit and perform a cleanup plan for property formerly owned by the Company
in Wayne, New Jersey. The DEP has approved the Company's plan which permits a
plastic waste- disposal area to be capped and to remain in place, subject to
placing a use restriction on that portion of the property, and subject to the
DEP's further determination of the extent to which groundwater monitoring will
be required. The present owner of the property has thus far declined to provide
the use restriction and the Company has initiated legal action against him to
compel him to provide the use restriction. The DEP has not yet taken final
action with respect to any further remedial steps such as ground water
monitoring which may be required as part of the cleanup plan.

See the Note "Commitments and Contingencies" of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is

include  for  purposes  of this  Article IV the giving of  testimony  or similar
involvement) or is threatened to be made a party to any  threatened,  pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative,  by  reason of the fact  that he is or was a  director,  officer,
employee  or agent of the  Company or is or was  serving  at the  request of the
Company  as a  director,  officer,  employee  or agent of  another  corporation,
partnership,  joint venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  including an employee

officer, employee or agent under this Article IV, including the duty to advance
expenses, shall be a contract between the Company and such person, and no

before such modification or repeal.

incurred in defending an action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Article
IV shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
indemnified person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized
in this Article IV or otherwise.

Section 3.  Indemnification Not Exclusive.
------------------------------------------ The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided by this Article IV shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other right to which one indemnified may be entitled under any agreement, vote
of shareholders or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as
to action in another capacity while holding that office, and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any such person.

between

Pharma-Gummi Wimmer West GmbH, Eschweiler (company)

and

Mr. Ulf C. Tychsen, born on 4. October 1944

The company will grant to Mr. Tychsen company pension benefits subject to the
following provisions:

ss. 1 Old-age pension

1.       Upon reaching the normal retirement age, Mr. Tychsen shall
         receive an old-age pension payable throughout his entire life
         after.

2.       The normal retirement age shall be the completed 65th year of
         life.

3.       The annual old-age pension benefits shall be determined on the
         basis of his pensionable income and the pensionable period of
         service.

4.       The pensionable income shall be the basic gross annual salary
         Mr. Tychsen has last received.  If Mr. Tychsen has not
         received an annual salary, the pensionable income shall be 13
         basic gross monthly salaries.  Not pensionable are e.g.
         bonuses, holiday salary, voluntary payments, asset-forming
         contributions etc..

<PAGE>

Page 2 Pension Agreement Ulf C. Tychsen

5.       The pensionable period of service shall be full years and months of
         active employment since joining the company, but not more than 40
         completed years of service.

6.       The annual pension shall amount for every year of service to

         a)    0.5% of the pensionable income not exceeding the ceiling
               of the social security insurance and

         b)    1.5 % of the pensionable exceeding this ceiling,

         c)    The pension resulting from a) and b) altogether with gross
               pensions resulting from the national insurance scheme shall
               not exceed 75 % of the pensionable income.  A state
               pension, altered by an equalization of pensions in case of
               a divorce, will be considered as if such an equalization
               had not taken place.

7.       Upon reaching the early retirement age according to the social security
         insurance Mr. Tychsen will have the right to receive early old-age
         pension determined according to para.6. The early old-age pension shall
         be reduced by 0.5 % for each month preceding the normal retirement age.

8.       In the case that Mr. Tychsen leaves the company before
         reaching the early retirement age vested benefits according to
         Art.  1. Para. 1 of the Corporate Pension Law (BetrAVG) will
         be maintained.

ss. 2 Disability pension

1.       Mr. Tychsen shall receive a disability pension, if he ceases
         his activities for the company because of occupational
         disability or loss of his capability to earn his living as
         defined by the provisions governing the social insurance.

2.       The annual disability pension shall be determined in line with
         the same principles as applicable for the annual old-age
         pension, i. e. according to Art. 1 Paras. 4 to 6. However, in
         addition to the pensionable years of service actually worked
         by Mr. Tychsen, those years of service shall be considered as
         pensionable in the meaning of Art. 1 Para. 5 as well, which he
         could have worked until the completion of his 55th year of
         life.

<PAGE>

Page 3 Pension Agreement Ulf C. Tychsen

3 .      The claim to a disability pension shall exist only for as long
         as the conditions of disability are met.  The decision of the
         Social Security Insurance Institution shall be evidence for
         the occurrence of the disability.  Mr. Tychsen is obliged to
         indicate any change in the statement of the Social Security
         Insurance Institution regarding the disability.  If the
         disability continues until the retirement age in accordance
         with Art. 1. Para. 2 is reached, Mr. Tychsen shall receive as
         from this date a live-long old-age pension in the amount of
         the disability pension.

ss. 3 Widow's pension

1.       The spouse of Mr. Tychsen shall receive a life-long widow's
         pension after his death if the marriage took place before a
         pensionable event within the meaning of Art. 1 Paras. 1 and 7,
         Art. 2 Para. 1, and if it lasted until the time of his death.
         Widow's pension will not be granted if the marriage took place
         during the last 6 months before Mr. Tychsen has died.

2.       Should Mr. Tychsen die after a pensionable event within the
         meaning of Art.  1. Paras. 1 and 7, Art. 2 Para. 1, the
         widow's pension shall amount to 60 % of the pension which he
         last
         received.  Should Mr. Tychsen die before a pensionable event,
         the widow's pension shall amount to 60 % of the pension which
         he would last have received if at the time of his death he had
         become disabled within the meaning of Art. 2 Para. 1.

3.       Notwithstanding Para. 2, the following is applicable if the
         spouse is more than 15 full years younger than Mr. Tychsen:
         for each full year which exceeds this age difference of 15
         full years, the widow's pension will be reduced by 1
         percentage point.

4.       The widow's pension shall be cancelled upon expiration of the
         month during which the widow has married again.

ss. 4 Equalization of pensions

1.    If pension payments arising from the relinquished right of the
      pension beneficiary are to be paid directly by the company to
      the equalization beneficiary, and these payments are subject to
      taxes and social insurance fees (i.e. health insurance fees),
      then the pension beneficiary is responsible for paying these
      taxes and insurance fees.  Other agreements between the pension
      beneficiary and the equalization beneficiary resp. decisions by
      the family court can only be taken into account at the time when

<PAGE>

      they are known to the company in original or in publicly
      certified form.

<PAGE>

Page 4 Pension Agreement Ulf C. Tychsen

2.    After the death of the pension beneficiary, the equalization
      beneficiary can, in the case of an extended equalization along
      the lines of obligation law, demand an equalization pension from
      the company only in the amount in which he or she would receive
      a survivor's pension if the marriage had continued until the
      death of the pension beneficiary.  If several other claims are
      to be equalized along the lines of obligation law, then the
      company is only required to pay the equalization pension to the
      extent to which this claim stands in relation to all other
      existing claims to pension equalizations along the lines of
      obligation law.

3 .      A survivor's pension paid to the widow or the widower of the
      pension beneficiary is to be reduced by the amount arrived at
      according to the equalization pension ascertained and paid
      according to Para. 2. The reduction will also occur and continue
      to occur after the death of the equalization beneficiary.
      Sentence no. 2 is not valid if the company has, along the line
      of Para. 2, paid payments that do not exceed the amount of two
      years' worth of the payment period.  If the company has paid
      such payments, then these payments are to be deducted from the
      company's outstanding pension obligations to the survivor.

ss. 5 Orphan's pension

1.    Mr. Tychsen shall be granted an orphan's pension for his
      children.

2.    The orphan's pension shall be paid up to the 18th year of life of the
      children. As long as the orphan is still undertaking education (school or
      profession) the orphan's pension will continue to be paid until the
      completed 27th year of life.

3.    Should Mr. Tychsen die after a pensionable event within the
      meaning of Art. 1 Paras.  1. and 7, Art. 2 Para. 1, the orphan's
      pension shall amount to 20%, the full orphan's pension to 40 %
      of the pension which Mr. Tychsen last received.  Should Mr.
      Tychsen die before a pensionable event, the orphan's pension
      shall amount to 20%, the full orphan's pension to 40% of the
      pension Mr. Tychsen would last have received if at the time of
      his death he had become disabled as defined by Art. 2 Para. 1.

<PAGE>

Page 5 Pension Agreement Ulf C. Tychsen

ss. 6 Coincidence of benefits

The total of the widow's pension, orphan's pensions plus equalization payments
shall not exceed 100 % of the pension which was last received by Mr. Tychsen or
would have been received by him, if at the time of his death he had become
disabled as defined by Art. 1 Para. 1. If they do indeed exceed this base
pension, then the survivor's pensions will each be reduced by the same
percentage as the percentage in which they altogether were in excess of the
above mentioned base pension.

ss. 7 Payment

The pension benefits shall be paid to the beneficiaries monthly, in twelve equal
installments payable at the end of the month after deduction of the taxes and
dues (e.g. taxes to be withheld, contributions to the legal health insurance of
the pensioner) . The first payment shall be made for the month subsequent to the
event giving rise to the pension, but at the earliest as of the date on which
the compensations and subsequent compensations or temporary allowances in
connection with the employment contract cease. The last payment shall be made
for the month during which the conditions for the payment of the pension have
ceased to exist or the pension beneficiary dies.

ss. 8 Adjustment

The company is obliged according to Art, 16 of the Corporate Pension Law
(BetrAVG) to review an adjustment of pensions and to decide at equitable
discretion; especially the concerns of the pensioner and the economic situation
of the company have to be taken into account.

ss. 9 Restraint on disposal

The claims for pensions under this pension agreement may neither be pledged nor
assigned or used as collateral for loans. If they are pledged, assigned or used
as collateral all the same, this shall be ineffective as regards the company.

ss. 10 Proviso

The company reserves the right to reduce or cease the benefits
under this pension agreement, if

<PAGE>

Page 6 Pension Agreement Ulf C. Tychsen

a)    the legal, especially the fiscal treatment of the allocations
      which are made or have been made for the scheduled financing
      of the pension payments has changed so significantly that the
      maintenance of the promised benefits is no longer acceptable,
      or

b)    the pension beneficiary commits acts which contravene in a
      gross manner the principle of good faith or would give grounds
      for dismissal without notice.

ss. 11 Reinsurance

1.    The company shall have the right to have its obligations under this
      agreement reinsured in part or in whole by a life insurance contract
      concluded in respect of the life of Mr.Tychsen. All claims under such a
      contract shall be attributable exclusively to the company.

2.    For the case that the company decides to conclude such an insurance
      contract, Mr. Tychsen shall undertake to furnish all required data, and
      especially to undergo a medical checkup upon request of the insurance
      company, to submit the required records and to agree to the conclusion of
      the insurance contract.

ss. 12 Concluding provisions

1.    Modifications of and amendments to this pension agreement
      shall be made in writing.

2     . If certain provisions of this agreement are or become ineffective, or if
      any regulation is omitted in this agreement, they shall not affect the
      effectiveness of the other provisions. In the case mentioned in clause 1
      the parties to the agreement shall agree on a valid provision or on a
      provision compensating the omission.

3.    With conclusion of this pension agreement all previous
      pensions promises, orally or in written, become invalid.

4.    Place of performance for all claims under this agreement is
      Eschweiler.

Mr. Ulf Christian Tychsen
Farmisener Landstr. 28b

2000 Hamburg 67

Dear Mr. Tychsen,

I am enclosing the Contract of Employment and the Employment Agreement agreed
with you and would like to confirm once more the conditions not contained in
these contracts.

         The target bonus under the "TWC Incentive Bonus Plan 1992" will be 50%
         in your case. You will receive a guaranteed bonus of at least 20% of
         your basic salary by 31.12.1993.

         As already mentioned you can select a car of your choice up to a value
         of DM 70,000.-- inclusive of VAT. I would be grateful if, in view of
         long delivery periods, you could specify your choice as soon as
         possible.

         Consideration is being given at present to a plan to take out pension
         insurance on behalf of managerial staff or to grant corresponding
         pension concessions. In the event of such a general solution not being
         realised, we hereby guarantee you that in your case a special agreement
         will be reached for you which, upon your reaching the age of
         retirement, will provide you with a pension which will amount to 20% of
         your basic salary as it stands at that time. A prerequisite herefor,
         however, is a ten year period of employment.

         We will provide you with a company-owned apartment which you can use
         free of charge for one year.

         You are entitled to participate in the "TWC Inc. Non-Qualified
         Stock Option". 8,000 shares will be set aside for you.  Please
         sign and return the attached agreement also.

         Should you not avail of your car for weekend trips home, we will
         provide you with a fly-and-save ticket during your first year.

We look forward to hearing from you and remain

Yours sincerely

                             CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT

Dear Mr. Tychsen,

The following agreements are agreed in relation to your employment.

ss. 1 Position
------------
You shall be employed at managerial level in our company from 01.01.1993. It
shall be possible for the contract to commence at an earlier date. It is
intended to appoint you to the position of Managing Director. We reserve the
right to assign other appropriate managerial duties to you if required for
operational reasons.

You undertake to devote your full working capacity to the service of the
Company. The assumption of any ancillary profitable employment shall require the
express prior written agreement of the Management. This shall also apply for
involvement in other companies and for involvement in the supervisory organs of
other companies.

The period of employment shall commence on date of entry.

ss. 2 Remuneration
----------------

1.
As remuneration for your employment you shall receive a monthly salary of DM
21,000.-- gross (in words: twenty-one thousand German Marks), payable at the end
of each month. Payment for overtime required shall be regarded as having been
made on payment of the agreed remuneration.

2 .
In addition to your monthly remuneration you shall receive the following by way
of voluntary social welfare benefits:

-        a Christmas bonus equivalent to a 13th month's salary;

-        holiday money equivalent at present to the amount of DM 33.--
         gross per day of holidays to which you are entitled;

-        contributions to employees' savings schemes in accordance with the
         terms of the respectively valid Employees' Savings Scheme Act currently
         amounting to DM 78.-- gross per month.

Assignment of or pledging salary payments shall not be admissible without the
consent of the Company.

<PAGE>

ss.3 Payment of Salary in the Event of Illness or Death
------------------------------------------------------
1.
In the event of non-culpable inability to work as a result of an accident or
illness you shall initially continue to receive your salary in accordance with
ss. 2 (1) for six weeks. Thereafter for a period of 6 months you shall receive
an allowance in addition to the cash payment provided by your legal health
insurance fund or provident association which, together with such sickness
benefit, shall be equivalent to the amount of your net payments under ss. 2 (1)
. In the case of private health insurance the daily sick benefit agreed with the
private health insurance company shall apply as a basis for calculating the
allowance, at least, however, a fictitious daily sickness benefit, which would
have been paid by the competent insurer under the legal health insurance scheme
in the event of compulsory health insurance.

Appropriate evidence of any sickness benefit allowances received must be
provided.

You shall assign to the Company any claims for compensation against
third-parties to which you are entitled in connection with the occurrence of
your inability to work to the amount of the allowance paid, and/or you shall
refund to the Company any payments made by third-parties subsequently in
relation thereto.

2 .
In the event of your death your surviving dependents (widow, dependent children)
shall continue to receive your salary as under ss. 2 (1) for a period of three
months, commencing with the end of the month during which the death occurred.
The Company shall be entitled to pay the benefit to any of the named persons
without any liability to the other surviving dependents.

ss.  4 Fringe Benefits
-----------------
1.
For the duration of the employment relationship the Company shall supply you
with an appropriate intermediate-sized car, which may also be used for private
journeys. Running and maintenance costs shall be borne by the Company. The
employee shall assume responsibility for paying tax on this benefit in kind
arising out of private use.

2 .
The Company shall take out an accident insurance policy in your favor:
 in the event of death:        DM 200,000.--
 in the event of invalidity:   DM 400,000.--

The insurance shall expire on the date of your departure from the Company's
services.

<PAGE>

3.
During business trips you shall be insured against the loss of your luggage up
to a maximum sum of DM 10,000.-- under a group insurance policy which does not
name the parties covered individually. in the case of business trips abroad
there is also an additional foreign health insurance which also includes return
transportation to Germany if required for medical reasons.

ss. 5 Holidays
------------
According to the regulations currently applicable, you are entitled to 30
working days annual holidays. In the event of your entering and leaving the
Company during the year the holidays shall be calculated pro rata temporis.

ss. 6 Term of Contract and Termination
------------------------------------
This Contract shall be concluded for an indefinite period. The employment
relationship can be terminated by either party under observance of a period of
notice of 6 months to the end of each half-year. An extension of the periods of
notice as a result of legal provisions shall apply for both contractual
partners. Notification of termination must be submitted in writing. The Company
shall be entitled to suspend you on full pay following the issuing of notice.
The employment relationship shall cease, without any special notice being
required, on expiry of the month in which you complete your 65th yearlife.

The right to immediate termination for an important reason (ss. 626 BGB) remains
unaffected (BGB = German Civil Code).

ss. 7 Secrecy
---------
1.
You undertake to maintain secrecy regarding all business matters, in particular
trade secrets, knowledge of which was acquired by you during your employment.
The obligation to observe secrecy extends to all the trade secrets of
third-parties which the latter have made accessible to the Company subject to
the proviso that they be handled as business and/or manufacturing secrets.

You also assume this obligation on the part of the Company as your own personal
obligation both to the same extent and for the same term.

Insofar as legally admissible, the obligation to observe secrecy shall continue
to apply after termination of the employment relationship. Upon leaving the
Company you also undertake to return to the Company all the documentation in
your possession which related to your activities within the framework of the
employment relationship.

2.
Publications and lectures regarding materials, of which you

<PAGE>

gained knowledge during your service or which are within the scope of your
duties, shall require the prior consent of the Management.

ss. 8 Final Provisions
--------------------
1.
No agreements were made apart from this Contract. Alterations of and amendments
to this Contract must be made in writing in order to be valid.

2 .
The Parties are agreed that, in accordance with ss. 26 of the Federal Data
Protection Act (BDSG), data regarding your person shall be stored for the
purposes of efficient operations. According to the same Act (ss.5 BDGS) you may
only process, make known, render accessible or otherwise use protected data
relating to persons in order to fulfil a specific function. Breaches of this act
are punishable according to ss. 41 BDSG, among others. The signature attached to
this Contract shall also apply as a declaration of consent to this obligation.

3 .
Should individual provisions of this Contract be or become invalid, this shall
not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. An appropriate provision
which approximates most closely to the economic objective being strived for by
both parties shall be agreed in place of the invalid provisions or for the
purpose of filling possible loopholes in the contract.

4 .
In the event of being appointed Managing Director, this Contract of Employment
shall be suspended for the duration of the validity of the Employment Agreement
of the Managing Director.

We hope that you will be happy with our Company and we wish you lots of success
in your work.

Yours sincerely
Pharma-Gummi Wimmer West GmbH

                                    Preamble
                                    --------

On (April 2], 1992, Mr.Tychsen and the Company entered into an employment

employment with the Company.

Both parties hereto wish to specify the extent to which Mr. Tychsen is by
operation of law barred from engaging in any competitive activity during his
employment with the Company.

In view of the crucial importance of the proprietary information made accessible
to Mr. Tychsen by the Company, both parties hereto agree that Mr. Tychsen should
be subject to a reasonable non-competition covenant after the termination of his
employment relationship with the Company.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree on the following amendment to the
Agreement:

1.       General Non-Competition Covenant
         ---------------------------------
1.1      During the term of his employment with the Company, Mr.
         Tychsen will not assume any job, work or assignment in the
         same business and territory in which the Company or an
         affiliate of the Company is active (the "Company's
         Business") , regardless whether such activities are actual
         or potential pursuant to the Company's Articles of
         Incorporation (Satzung). This restriction includes without
         limitation

         (a)    any acquisition or holding of interests in any enterprise which
                is engaged in the Company's Business ("Competitor"), either
                directly or indirectly or by way of sub-participation
                (Unterbeteiligung) or as silent partner (Stille Beteiligung),

         (b)    the performance of services for any Competitor or an affiliate
                of any Competitor, either as employee, consultant, counsel, or
                member of any board, regardless whether such services are
                remunerated or not, and

         (c)    any self-employed competing activity.

         The term "affiliate" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in ss.15
         of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).

<PAGE>

         For the purposes of this clause, the territory in which the Company or
         affiliates of the Company are active shall be Europe (including Russia
         and Turkey) and North America.

1.2      The non-competition covenant shall not prevent Mr. Tychsen
         from acquiring or holding shares of stock or other
         securities traded on any recognized stock exchange, provided
         that (a) such interest does not give Mr. Tychsen any
         influence on the management of a Competitor and (b) the
         interest does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the
         outstanding securities.. This clause shall, furthermore, not
         apply to any job, work or assignment assumed by Mr. Tychsen
         in the interest and with the consent of the Company.

2 .  Post-Employment Non-Competition Covenant
     -----------------------------------------

2.1      For a period of one (1) year following the termination (Beendigung),
         for whatever reason, of the employment relationship with the Company,
         Mr. Tychsen may not engage in any competing activity as defined in
         Section 1 hereof.

2. 2     For the term of this post-employment non-competition
         covenant, the Company shall pay to Mr. Tychsen a
         Compensation (Karenzentschadigung) in the amount of twelve
         (12) times the last monthly gross salary pursuant toss.2 (l)
         of the Agreement, but not less than the amount payable under
         ss. 74b(2), (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) . The
         Compensation shall be paid in bi-monthly installments at the
         end of each two-months period after the day of the
         termination in accordance with the pertinent tax and social
         security laws, provided, however, that Mr. Tychsen discloses
         to the Company all requisite information about his income
         from other professional activities prior to the maturity of
         the installment.

3.       Penalty Clause
         ---------------
         Notwithstanding any other rights of the Company, in each case of
         violation of the foregoing non-competition covenants Mr. Tychsen shall
         be liable to the Company for a contractual penalty (Vertragsstrafe) in
         the amount of six (6) times the last monthly gross salary pursuant to
         ss. 2(l) of the Agreement. In case of a continuous violation, the
         Company shall be entitled to the full contractual penalty for every
         month, or part of a month, during which Mr. Tychsen is in violation of
         the non-competition covenant. For the enforcement of this contractual
         penalty clause, the Company shall not be required to establish any
         actual damages.

<PAGE>

4.       Termination
         -----------
         Notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Agreement, the company
         may terminate the Agreement for cause in accordance with ss. 626 of the
         German Civil Code (BGB) if Mr. Tychsen violates the non-competition
         covenant pursuant to Section 1 hereof.

5.       Final Provisions
         ----------------

5.1      Sections ss.ss. 60, 61 and 74 to 75d of the German Commercial Code
         (HGB) shall apply to the extent not validly altered by the foregoing
         provisions.

5.2      The Agreement and this Addendum have been drawn up in the
         English language.

5.3      To the extent not affected by this Addendum, the terms and
         provisions of the Agreement remain binding and enforceable.

5.4      The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any
         provision in this Addendum shall not affect the validity,
         legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions.  The
         invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be
         replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision
         reflecting as closely as possible the economic intention
         pursued by the parties with the former provision.  The same
         shall apply to issues the parties intended but failed to
         address.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
--------------------
   The Company operates in one industry segment: manufacturing and marketing
specialized products that satisfy the unique filling, sealing, dispensing and
delivery needs of the health care and consumer products industries. Over 85% of
the Company's revenues are generated by the health care market. The Company's
products include stoppers, closures, containers, medical device components and
assemblies made from elastomers, metal, plastic and glass. The Company also
manufacturers related packaging machinery.

   The following is management's discussion and analysis of the Company's
operating results for the three years ended December 31, 1994 and its financial
position as of year-end 1994. The information should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this
report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------
   The Company's 1994 net income was $27.3 million, or $1.70 per share, compared
with net income of $23.5 million, or $1.48 per share, in 1993 and $19.7 million,
or $1.26 per share, in 1992. In 1993, the Company standardized December 31 as
the reporting year end for all consolidated subsidiaries. This change required
all international subsidiaries to report December 1993 results in the reporting
year 1993, resulting in the inclusion of 13 months of operating results in 1993
for these subsidiaries. Also in 1993 the Company lengthened the life of certain
production equipment, which reduced depreciation expense. The depreciable life
of this equipment now corresponds to its historical pattern of use and more
closely matches industry practice. These two changes added approximately $.07
per share to 1993 earnings compared with 1992 and about $.01 per share to 1993
earnings compared with 1994. In 1993, the Company also adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, which changed the Company's
accounting for income taxes to the liability method. The cumulative impact of
this method of income tax accounting was to reduce deferred tax liabilities
recorded as of January 1, 1993, adding $.06 per share to 1993 net income.

NET SALES
----------
   Net sales were $365.1 million in 1994, an increase of 5% compared with
reported sales in 1993, which included $8.8 million of international
subsidiaries' sales attributable to December 1992 operations. Adjusting for that
extra month would improve the annual sales increase to 7%. This improvement
reflects increased sales to international health care markets, including the
acquisition of a subsidiary in Europe, and increased domestic consumer product
demand.

   Increased health care market sales were generated by continued market
penetration in the Asia/Pacific region, acquisitions and volume increases in
European and domestic health care markets. The volume increases were the result
of new product offerings by customers and increased demand. Acquisitions during
1994 included Senetics, Inc., a domestic company specializing in innovative
closure systems for oral and inhalation drug delivery, and a 51%

                                       1

<PAGE>

interest in Schubert Seals A/S, a Danish manufacturer of metal seals for the
European pharmaceutical industry. The acquired companies added $8.4 million to
1994 sales. Sales in domestic and European markets have been negatively impacted
by price reductions on certain products due to government and consumer pressure
to reduce health care costs and by competition. The weaker U.S. dollar compared
with European and Asia/Pacific currencies added $2.3 million to reported 1994
sales amounts. Demand in Brazil for health care products increased during the
later part of year as a result of that country's economic plan, which has
stabilized the currency, but sales in South American health care markets were
lower for the year. Measured at consistent currency exchange rates, health care
sales increased by 5% over the comparable 12 months of 1993.

   Domestic consumer products sales rose 18% in 1994. This increase reflects
primarily the increased demand for Spout-Pak(R) for gable carton juice
containers manufactured by International Paper Company and for the SAFETY
SQUEASE TM product manufactured for The Procter & Gamble Company's Scope(R) and
Aleve(R) products. Also machinery sales increased by $2.4 million, returning to
1992 levels, following 1993 delays in customers' capital spending programs.

   In 1993, net sales increased by 3%, or $10.5 million, over 1992 levels.
Compared with 1992, this reported sales increase was reduced by $10.6 million
because of translation rate differences caused by the stronger U.S. dollar, but
increased by $8.1 million due to the inclusion of December 1993 operating
results of international subsidiaries. The inclusion of that additional month's
results in 1993 standardized the reporting year end for all consolidated
entities. Taking these two factors into account shows that worldwide health care
market sales grew at more than 5% in 1993. The growth was evident in all markets
served and came mainly from additional value-added products and services.
Especially notable was market penetration in the Asia/Pacific region. Sales to
consumer products markets declined by 8% compared with 1992, reflecting the
combined impact of product and customer rationalization and delays in customers'
new product market introductions. Sales of machinery declined in 1993 by $3
million as health care reform proposals caused customers to delay their capital
spending programs.

GROSS PROFIT
------------
   The consolidated gross margin improved in 1994 to 31.8%, and gross profit
grew to $116.1 million, an 11% increase over 1993. This 1.8 percentage point
improvement in the gross margin compared with 1993 was the result, in part, of
higher sales volume, but a significant portion of the increase reflects the use
of Total Quality Management Technique, Manufacturing Resource Planning systems
and new technologies, which combined to improve productivity, yields and
logistics. These factors were evident in a 8% increase in the gross profit
earned on sales to the health care markets, with higher contributions generated
from sales to all market regions served. Margin increases in domestic and South
American operations improved significantly, while Asia/Pacific and European
markets generated margins comparable to 1993.

                                       2

<PAGE>

   Gross profit on consumer products market sales more than doubled in 1994
compared with 1993. This reflects the significant increase in volume, the higher
value-added product sales made possible through the product rationalization
programs begun several years ago and the productivity improvements generated
through the programs discussed above. Gross profit related to machinery
operations increased primarily due to the volume of orders and higher sales in
the year.

   The Company began installing Manufacturing Resource Planning systems in 1993.
In addition, more than 90% of the Company's employees have been trained in Total
Quality Management principles during 1993 and 1994. The remaining employees,
most of whom are located at international manufacturing facilities, will be
trained in 1995. The intent of these initiatives is to make the Company more
responsive to customer requirements and to improve shareholder value. The
continued benefits of these programs are expected to be evident in greater
efficiencies and customer satisfaction.

   The gross margin in 1993 was 30%, and gross profit was $104.6 million, an 8%
increase over 1992. The gross margin was 1.4 percentage points higher than in
1992. The reduction in depreciation expense caused by the extension of the
useful life of certain production equipment was responsible for a .5 percentage
point increase in the 1993 margin. The remaining improvement reflected the
higher sales of value-added products, the benefits of restructuring activities
and the Total Quality Management and Manufacturing Resource Planning initiatives
begun in 1993. Gross profit on health care industry sales increased 7%,
reflecting these factors. Margins improved in all regions served except Europe.
European operations were adversely impacted by turbulent foreign exchange
markets, recession in Germany, and the closing of a low-cost manufacturing
facility in Serbia due to the United Nations embargo. Consumer products markets
generated a lower gross profit in 1993 due to a volume decline, although
mitigated by cost-savings programs. Consumer products operations continued to
focus on leading consumer products manufacturers, such as Procter & Gamble and
International Paper, and their need for innovative packaging systems that result
in value-added products. New product introduction delays by such companies
impacted 1993 negatively. Machinery operations achieved a higher gross margin on
1993 sales, although gross profit was down 15% due to lower volume.

EXPENSES
--------
   Selling, general and administrative expenses have absorbed a higher
percentage of the sales dollar in each of the past three years. These expenses,
as a percentage of sales, were 18.9% in 1994, 18.2% in 1993 and 16.9% in 1992.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $5.5 million in 1994,
or 9%, over 1993 levels. The increase is attributable in part to severance costs
related to a global reorganization and to productivity improvements. The
reorganization established global functional responsibilities and anticipated
the year-end 1994 buyout of the minority owners of five European subsidiaries.
The increase also reflects rent and other expenses related to the Company's new
headquarters facility, which became occupied in

                                       3

<PAGE>

September 1993; consolidation of expenses of acquired companies; higher costs
related to self-insured claims and outside service costs; and exchange rate
differences. Training and systems development will continue to improve
productivity and reduce costs.

   The increase in 1993 selling, general and administrative expenses was 11%,
amounting to a $6.4 million increase over 1992. Outside service costs, including
training and systems development, and the move to the new corporate headquarters
facility were the primary causes of the increase.

   Other expenses, net, in 1994 totaled $1.7 million compared with $.5 million
in 1993 and $.9 million in 1992. Included in this item are foreign currency
losses totaling $2.3 million, $5.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These
translation losses are driven by the high inflation in Brazil, which has been
significantly reduced since mid-1994 as a result of Brazil's economic plan
designed to reduce inflation and stabilize the currency. Also included are
foreign currency transaction losses of $.5 million in 1994, $.2 million in 1993
and $.5 million in 1992. The higher transaction losses in 1994 and 1992 were due
primarily to the realignment of European currencies. Foreign exchange losses are
offset in part by interest income totaling $1.2 million, $2.3 million, and $2.9
million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Interest income was generated
mainly in Brazil and has been reduced in 1994 due to the economic program that
reduced interest rates and in 1993 due to reduced cash balances. Increased cash
balances in other geographic areas have produced interest income, which
partially offset the Brazilian reduction in 1994. In 1994, losses on real estate
totaled $.5 million compared with $1.4 million of gains in 1993 from the
Company's sale of its former headquarters and research center facilities and its
ownership interest in Tri/West Systems, Inc.

INTEREST
---------
   Interest costs totaled $3.5 million in 1994, $3.4 million in 1993 and $4.1
million in 1992. Interest capitalized as a part of capital asset acquisitions
was approximately the same in each of the three years. Interest expense
attributable to the consolidation of companies acquired in 1994, mainly
attributable to capitalized leases, masked the further reduction in 1994
interest expense. This reduction was attributable to lower average domestic debt
levels and lower average interest rates on European debt. In 1993, the lower
interest costs resulted from an approximate $13 million decline in average debt
levels during the year. Average interest rates were also lower in 1993 compared
with 1992; however, the net cost of interest rate swaps increased.

INCOME TAXES
-------------
The Company adopted the liability method of income tax accounting beginning in
1993 as mandated by SFAS No. 109 requirements. The effective tax rate in 1994
was 31.8% versus 38.2% in 1993. The unusually low 1994 tax rate reflects the
one-time impact of a net refund of foreign taxes paid by subsidiaries in prior
years. The refund was triggered by the payment of dividends. In addition,

                                       4

<PAGE>

foreign tax loss carryforwards were assured realization due to the tax
consolidation of several operating subsidiaries, thereby reducing the tax asset
valuation allowance previously recorded on these potential tax benefits. The
transactions were made possible by the acquisition of the minority ownership in
these subsidiaries at year-end 1994. Finally, the 1994 effective income tax rate
declined due to lower state income tax liabilities and due to the higher
proportion of earnings being generated in lower-tax jurisdictions.

   The 1993 effective tax rate of 38.2% represented a 2.9 percentage point drop
in the effective tax rate compared with 1992. The decline in the effective tax
rate resulted from the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit issue, the
larger proportion of earnings generated in low-tax countries and a significant
reduction in the effective tax rate in Brazil. The 1993 decrease in the
statutory tax rate in Germany and lower state taxes offset the impact of the
increase in the U.S. federal tax rate. Because these tax rate changes largely
offset each other, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 did not have a material impact
on the 1993 tax provision.

   The tax provision in 1992 was determined using previously accepted income tax
accounting principles, and deferred taxes were provided on the differences in
income for financial reporting and tax return purposes. At 41.1%, the 1992
effective tax rate reflected the mix of earnings, with higher-taxed European and
Latin American earnings offset in part by lower-taxed operations in Singapore
and Puerto Rico. The resulting effective rate was 3.2 percentage points above
the rate on domestic operations.

MINORITY INTERESTS AND EQUITY IN AFFILIATES
-------------------------------------------
Minority interests increased to $1.9 million in 1994 compared with $1.7 million
in 1993 and 1992. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of a majority
interest in Schubert Seals A/S in mid- 1994. The increase was offset in part by
the November 30, 1994 acquisition of the remaining minority ownership in five
European subsidiaries.

Income from affiliates decreased in 1994 to half of the 1993 level. The
reduction reflects the translation loss on net monetary assets of the Company's
affiliates in Mexico due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso in late
December. Offsetting these losses in part was continued improvement in the glass
manufacturing operations of Schott West Pharmaceutical Glass Company in which
the Company holds a 40% interest. After losses in 1992, this joint venture
produced near breakeven results in 1993, and in 1994 has produced profits. The
turnaround resulted from the technical expertise of the Company's joint venture
partner, which improved product quality and increased productivity. Sales
increased in each of the past three years. Operating results of the Company's
affiliates in Japan and Mexico were lower in both 1994 and 1993 due to lower
margins and sales.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING METHODS
------------------------------
The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 beginning in 1993. Prior financial statements
were not restated, and the cumulative impact to January 1, 1993 of applying SFAS
No. 109 principles was a $1.1 million reduction in the deferred tax liabilities
reported at December 31, 1992. This cumulative impact was reported separately in
the 1993 income statement, net of minority interest.

The Company also adopted SFAS No. 112, Employer's Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits. This accounting standard covers all types of benefit plans provided to
former or inactive employees and requires recognition of a liability under
certain circumstances during employees' active service or when an employee is
terminated. This accounting change did not have any significant impact on 1993
operating results.

FINANCIAL POSITION
--------------------
The Company's financial position continues to be strong. Working capital totaled
$50.4 million at December 31, 1994, with a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of 1.6:1. That year-end level was reduced significantly by the
liability to the former minority owners of five European subsidiaries for the
final installment of the acquisition price, which was paid in early 1995.
Receivable balances were higher at year-end 1994 as a function of a much
stronger December sales period. Inventory levels, excluding inventories of
companies acquired in 1994, were close to year end 1993 positions. Better
production planning systems have aided the control of inventories while assuring
customer needs can be met. Implementation of these systems at additional
manufacturing sites is expected to further reduce inventory requirements.

Cash from operating activities totaled $49.8 million in 1994. In addition, the
Company sold three former manufacturing properties, generating additional cash
of $3.4 million. These available funds more than covered cash requirements in
1994 including $27.1 million of capital expenditures, $7.2 million of dividends
to shareholders ($.45 per share) and $13.9 million of cash payments for 1994
acquisitions. Cash from exercise of employee stock options totaled $3.4 million.
New debt increased the debt to invested capital (total debt, minority interests
and shareholders' equity) ratio to 20.1%. Debt stood at $57.8 million at
year-end 1994 compared with $32.3 million at year-end 1993. Cash balances also
increased $22 million from December 31, 1993, and totaled $27.2 million at
December 31, 1994. The increase in assets noted above decreased the asset
turnover ratio to 1.04. Return on shareholders' equity was 13.2% equal to 1993.

1995 REQUIREMENTS
------------------
On January 2, 1995, the remaining 25.5 million deutsche marks due for the
acquisition of the minority owners' interests in five European subsidiaries was
paid using available cash and new debt facilities. Cash requirements for capital
projects in 1995 are estimated at $44 million. These projects focus on new
product tooling, cost reduction and quality improvements through

                                       6

technological upgrades. Acquisition and implementation of new information
management systems will continue as will maintenance and improvements to the
existing production capacity. The 1986 currency and interest rate swap agreement
covering a DM20 million liability and a $7.2 million receivable expired early in
1995. The excess liability was funded with available cash and new debt
facilities. Cash requirements for remedial activity related to environmental
cleanup are not expected to exceed $1 million in 1995. In 1994, payments related
to environmental cleanup totaled $.8 million. Included in these payments are
amounts paid by the Company to perform testing and remedial work in Puerto Rico.
These payments complete the Company's obligation under a settlement agreement
with other potentially responsible parties signed in 1993 related to this site.
The Company has been indemnified by other financially responsible parties
against future government claims relating to groundwater contamination at the
site. All of the payments made in 1994 were covered by the estimated liability
recorded in prior years.

In 1995, in addition to cash flow from operations, the Company expects proceeds
from sale of stock arising from the exercise expiring employee stock options to
generate proceeds of $3.1 million. Management believes that this cash, available
credit facilities ($30 million short-term and DM35 million long-term at year-end
1994) and the Company's current capitalization provide sufficient flexibility to
meet cash flow requirements in the future.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share and per share data)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all significant majority-owned subsidiaries. For
years ending prior to 1993, international subsidiaries are included in
consolidated financial statements based on fiscal years ending November 30. In
1993, international subsidiaries are included in consolidated financial
statements based on the 13 months ended December 31. The inclusion of the
additional month in 1993 added $8,100 to revenues, $2,100 to gross profit and
net income per share of approximately $.01. Material intercompany transactions
and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. An affiliated company reports on
the basis of the fiscal year ending October 31. Investments in affiliated
companies in which ownership exceeds 20% are accounted for on the equity method.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS: Cash flows from operating activities are reported under
the indirect method; cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of
deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three
months or less.

INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of
inventories located in the United States is determined on the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method; the cost of inventories located outside the United States is
determined principally on the average cost method.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Foreign currency transaction gains and losses and
translation gains and losses of subsidiaries operating in high-inflation
economies are recognized in the determination of net income. Foreign currency
translation adjustments of other subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside
the United States are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Maintenance and minor repairs and renewals are charged to expense as
incurred. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, costs and related
depreciation are eliminated, and gains or losses are recognized in the
determination of net income.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION: For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is
computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets. For income tax purposes, depreciation is computed using
accelerated methods. Goodwill is being amortized on the straight-line method
over periods ranging from 30 to 40 years.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research, development and engineering expenditures for
the creation and application of new or improved products and processes, which
amounted to $12,000, $11,400 and $11,100 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively,
are expensed as incurred.

INCOME TAXES:   Beginning in 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
provides that income taxes be accounted for under the liability method.
Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying
enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to temporary

                                       15

<PAGE>

differences between the tax bases and financial statement carrying values of the
Company's assets and liabilities. Prior-year financial statements have not been
restated. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 is reported in the 1993
Consolidated Statement of Income net of applicable minority interests. In 1992,
the provision for deferred income taxes is applicable to timing differences
between taxable income and income for financial reporting purposes.
         United States income taxes and withholding taxes are accrued on the
portion of earnings of international subsidiaries and affiliates (which qualify
as joint ventures) intended to be remitted to the parent company.

NET INCOME PER SHARE: Net income per share is based on the weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each period. Common Stock
equivalents are not material.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)
Other income (expense) includes the following:

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
On November 30, 1994, the Company acquired the remaining minority ownership
interests in five European subsidiary companies. The total purchase price for
the minority interests in these subsidiaries was DM45,000. The cash portion of
the purchase price totaled DM30,000 of which DM4,500 was paid at closing and
DM25,500 on January 2, 1995; the balance of the consideration, DM15,000, was
paid through delivery of 363,214 shares of the Company's Common Stock at
closing.
 On May, 20, 1994, the Company acquired a 51% ownership interest in Schubert
Seals A/S, a Danish manufacturer of metal seals and related products mainly for
the pharmaceutical industry. The total purchase was 31,000 kroner. The cash
portion of the purchase price for these acquisitions was financed principally
using new debt facilities. The acquisitions are being accounted for as
purchases, and Schubert Seals A/S has been consolidated from June 1, 1994. The
excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired and minority interests
acquired approximates $20,000 and is being amortized over 40 years.
 The following table presents selected financial information for the years ended
December 31, 1994 and 1993 on a pro forma (unaudited) basis assuming the
acquisitions noted above had occurred on January 1, 1994 and 1993:

         In 1994, the Company acquired Senetics, Inc., a company specializing in
the development of innovative delivery technologies for oral and inhalation drug
delivery markets and a 10% ownership interest in DANBIOSYST UK LIMITED, a
company specializing in noninvasive drug delivery methods. The total
consideration for these acquisitions was $5,600, all of which was paid in cash.
The acquisition of Senetics is being accounted for as a purchase, and the
company has been consolidated since the beginning of the year. Additional
consideration may be due depending on the sales of Senetics' products and other
conditions during the period from acquisition to January 5, 1999. Such
additional consideration would be accounted for as goodwill. Pro forma results
of the Senetics acquisition, assuming it had been made at beginning of 1993,
would not be materially different from the results reported.

         At December 31, 1994, subsidiaries had operating tax loss carryovers of
$8,700, which will be available to apply against the future taxable income of
such subsidiaries. The carryover periods expire beginning with $500 in 1995 and
continue through 1998. A valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the
related deferred tax asset to the extent realization is uncertain.
         At December 31, 1994, unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries, on which deferred income taxes have not been provided, amounted to
$51,000. Tax credits that would become available upon distribution of such
earnings could reduce income taxes then payable at the United States statutory
rate. As of December 31, 1994, the Company had available foreign tax credit
carryovers of approximately $1,900 expiring in 1995 through 1999. A valuation
allowance has been recognized to offset the related deferred tax asset to the

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed the estimated life of its
elastomer molds and dies to six and four years, respectively, from three years.
The change allocates this equipment cost to better reflect expectations of
production service and is more consistent with industry practice. The effect of
the change was to reduce depreciation expense by $1,800 and increase net income
by $.06 per share in 1993.

(a) The proceeds of industrial revenue bonds that were not required for the
respective construction projects have been invested by the Company. Use of these
excess funds and earnings thereon is restricted to servicing the debt. The
aggregate of unexpended proceeds and earnings thereon of $1,300 is reflected as
a reduction of the principal outstanding on the bonds. (b) Real estate,
machinery and equipment with a carrying value of $22,000 at December 31, 1994
are pledged as collateral.

    Long-term debt maturing in the years following 1995 is: $6,000 in 1996,
$11,600 in 1997, $600 in 1998 and $700 in 1999.
    Certain of the financing agreements, among other things, require the
maintenance of certain working capital, interest coverage and debt to
capitalization ratios and tangible net worth; restrict the sale of assets; and
limit the payment of dividends. At December 31, 1994, under the most restrictive
debt agreement, retained earnings free of restriction were $67,000.
    Interest costs incurred during 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $3,500, $3,400 and
$4,100, respectively, of which $200, $300 and $200, respectively, were
capitalized as part of the cost of acquiring certain assets.
    To finance and hedge a portion of the 1986 purchase of ownership interests
in certain European subsidiaries, the Company entered into a currency and
interest rate swap agreement which matured early in 1995. Under the agreement,
the Company exchanged $7,200 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1/8% for DM20,000
bearing interest at 7.5%. A swap agreement expired in 1994 under which the
Company agreed to swap $2,700 bearing interest at LIBOR for DM5,000 bearing
interest at 6.33%.
    Principal and/or interest amounts due under swap agreements are presented in
the financial statements on a net basis.

Methods used to estimate the fair market values of the above listed financial
instrument are as follows: cash and cash equivalents are estimated at carrying
values that approximate market, due to the short-maturity of cash equivalents.
Debt is estimated based on current market quotes for instruments of similar
maturity. Interest rate swaps (see preceding Debt

                                       22

Note) and forward exchange rate contracts are valued at published market prices,
market prices of comparable instruments or quotes.
         Forward exchange contracts are used only to hedge raw material purchase
commitments and foreign-currency-denominated loans. At December 31, 1994, the
Company had $14,200 of forward exchange rate contracts to buy various foreign
currencies in 1995. Gains/losses on contracts used to hedge raw material
purchases are deferred and will adjust the cost of such inventory.

BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION PLANS: The Company and certain international subsidiaries sponsor
defined benefit pension plans. The United States plans cover substantially all
domestic employees and members of the Company's Board of Directors. The plans
call for benefits to be paid to eligible participants at retirement based on
compensation rates near retirement and/or on length of service. Contributions to
the United States employee plans reflect investment performance of plan assets,
benefits attributed to employees' service to date and service expected in the
future. Assets of the United States employee plans and one international
subsidiary plan consist primarily of common and preferred stocks,
investment-grade corporate bonds, guaranteed insurance contracts and United
States government obligations; other international subsidiary plans and the plan
for directors are not funded.
         Total pension expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 includes the following:

The discount rates used were 8.25% for 1994 and 7% for 1993; the health care
cost trend was 14% in 1994 and 1993, decreasing to 5.5% by 2007. Increasing the
assumed trend rate for health care costs by one percentage point would result in
an accrued obligation of $12,200 at December 31, 1994 for these retirement
benefits and an increase of $100 in the related 1994 expense.

OTHER
The Company provides certain postemployment benefits for terminated and disabled
employees, including severance pay, disability-related benefits and health care
benefits. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employer's
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, requires these costs to be accrued over
the employee's active service period under certain circumstances or at the date
of the event triggering the benefit. The Company adopted this accounting
practice in 1993, and the impact was insignificant.
         The Company also sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for
salaried and certain hourly United States employees. Company contributions are
equal to 50% of each participant's contribution up to 6% of their base
compensation. Total expense under the plan in 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $800, $800
and $600, respectively.

CAPITAL STOCK
The Company has 3,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized, none of which
has been issued.
         Through December 31, 1994, the Company has acquired 1,113,900 shares of
its Common Stock under a repurchase program covering up to 1,600,000 shares
announced in 1989. Purchases (sales) of Common Stock held in treasury during
the three years ended December 31, 1994 are as follows:

The Company's Shareholders Rights Plan entitles a shareholder to purchase 1/1000
of a share of a newly designated series of the Company's Preferred Stock at a
price of $75.00 with each Right. A Right becomes exercisable if a person or
group ("acquiror") acquires 15% or more of the Common Stock or commences a
tender offer that would result in the acquiror owning 18% or more of the Common
Stock. After the Rights become exercisable and in the event the Company is
involved in a merger or other business combination, sale of 50% or more of its
assets or earning power, or if an acquiror purchases 18% or more of the Common
Stock or engages in self-dealing transactions, a Right will entitle its holder
to purchase common stock of the surviving company having a market value twice
the exercise price of the Right. The Rights may be redeemed by the Company at
$.001 per Right at any time before certain events occur. Two Rights are attached
to each share of Common Stock, and such rights will not trade separately unless
they become exercisable. All Rights expire on January 15, 2000.
         In 1990, the Company made an offering under an employee stock purchase
plan, which provides for the sale of the Company's Common Stock to substantially
all employees at 85% of fair market value. An employee's purchases are limited
annually to 10% of base compensation. The original offer expired on December 31,
1991, but was extended to December 31, 1995. Shares are purchased in the open
market, or Treasury shares are used.

STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The Company has a long-term incentive plan for officers and key management
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries that provides for the grant
through March 8, 1998 of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock awards and performance awards. A maximum of 2,125,000 shares of Common
Stock or stock equivalents are available for issue under this plan of which
568,600 shares are available at December 31, 1994 for future grant. A committee
of the Board of Directors determines the terms and conditions of grants, except
that the exercise price of certain options cannot be less than 100% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant, no stock options or stock
appreciation rights can be exercised during the six months immediately following
the date of grant and all stock options and stock appreciation rights must
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant. All outstanding stock
option grants expire five years from date of grant.
         Option activity under this plan during the three years ended December
31, 1994 is summarized below:

Under the Company's management incentive plan, participants are paid cash
bonuses on the attainment of certain financial goals. In 1993, bonus
participants were offered the opportunity to purchase Common Stock with up to
25% of their cash bonus award. Beginning in 1994, bonus participants are
required to use 25% of their cash bonus, after certain adjustments for taxes
payable, to purchase Common Stock of the Company at current fair market value.
Bonus participants are given a restricted stock award equal to one share for
each four shares of Common Stock purchased bonus awards. These stock awards vest
at the end of four years provided that the participant has not made a
disqualifying disposition of the stock purchased. In 1994 and 1993, restricted
stock awards for 3,000 shares and 1,900 shares, respectively, were granted, and
in 1994, 500 shares were forfeited. Compensation expense is being recognized
over the vesting period based on the fair market value of Common Stock on the
award date: $24.94 per share in 1994 and $20.81 per share in 1993.
         An executive stock compensation plan, which expired in 1989, provided
for the granting to key employees of shares without payment to the Company or
incentive stock options. Grants were at the discretion of a committee of the
Board of Directors, subject to certain conditions as to exercise price and time
period. Option activity under this plan for the year ended December 31, 1992 is

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At December 31, 1994, the Company was obligated under various operating lease
agreements with terms ranging from one month to 20 years. Rental expense in
1994, 1993 and 1992 was $5,000, $4,000 and $2,300, respectively. Minimum rentals
for noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of
one year are: 1995--$5,100; 1996--$4,700; 1997--$4,300; 1998--$4,000;
1999--$3,800 and thereafter $55,000.
         At December 31, 1994, outstanding contractual commitments for the
purchase of equipment and raw materials amounted to $13,300, all of which is due
to be paid in 1995.
         The Company has accrued the estimated cost of environmental compliance
expenses related to current and former manufacturing facilities. The ultimate
cost to be incurred by the Company cannot be fully determined; however, based on
information currently available, the Company believes the accrued liability is
sufficient to cover the future costs of required remedial actions.
         The Company guarantees 40% of the debt of Schott West Pharmaceutical
Glass Company under a $5,000 line of credit, of which $4,400 was outstanding at
December 31, 1994.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND OPERATIONS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA The West Company and its
affiliated companies operate in one industry segment. The Company develops,
manufactures and markets stoppers, closures, containers, medical device
components and assemblies made from elastomers, metal, plastic and glass for the
health care and consumer products markets. The Company also manufactures related
packaging machinery. Total sales include sales to one customer of approximately
$40,200, $41,900 and $38,800 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Operating
information and identifiable assets by geographic area of manufacture are shown

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE WEST COMPANY,
INCORPORATED:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The West
Company, Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The
West Company, Incorporated and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
         As discussed in the summary of Significant Accounting Policies Note to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income taxes in 1993.
