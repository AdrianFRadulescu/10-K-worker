To Our Shareholders:

     Vitronics Corporation experienced record sales and earnings for the year
ended December 31, 1995.  We thank all our customers, stockholders, employees
and vendors for their cooperation and efforts in making 1995 a very successful
year.  We expect to continue to enhance shareholder value by continuing the
growth and profitability trend that we have experienced in the past two years.

     Our 1995 sales picture improved by 36% over 1994.  Our 1995 bookings
picture also improved 34% over 1994.  Again, recaptured market share accounted
for a significant portion of this increase.  Our 1995 gross margin percentage
improved to 41% from 36% in 1994.  Again, controlling expenses and aggressive
material cost reduction were the focus of our attention during 1995 and will
continue to be in 1996.

     In late February 1996, at the Nepcon West show, a major trade show for our
industry, we introduced the SELECTSeries/TM/ a new line of reflow ovens.
These new systems will offer improved functionality and performance which
strengthens Vitronics' leadership position in the surface mount industry. The
new family of ovens, which include MagnaTherm/TM/, AcroTherm/TM/,
RadianTherm/TM/, and IsoTherm/TM/, have been designed with our expertise in
modularity and will provide our customers with unequaled opportunity to match
technical requirements with system size, configuration, capability and cost.

     Sales for the year ended December 31, 1995 were $23,525,000 compared to
$17,346,000 for 1994, an increase of 36%.  Bookings for the year ended December
31, 1995 were $23,783,000 compared to $17,802,000 for 1994 an increase of 34%.
Backlog at December 31, 1995 was $2,847,000 compared to $2,589,000 at
December 31, 1994.

     Vitronics has positioned itself to be the reflow soldering leader for the
surface mount industry.  We have presented many technical papers at a variety of
trade shows, technical meetings and seminars during 1995.  We continue to
recapture market share by presenting technical information to key customers and
actively working with them to improve their reflow capabilities.  Our philosophy
of quality and service continue to be the dominant theme that we carry forward
to our customers.
<PAGE>
 
     Our financial growth in 1995 was financed through internally generated
funds.  Our cash balance of $2,825,000 increased significantly during the year
and is the direct result of collection of our receivables and continued emphasis
on inventory flow into the company.  We also arranged a $500,000 working capital
line of credit with First National Bank of Portsmouth.

     Our Balance Sheet has improved significantly during 1995. The Subordinated
Convertible Debenture of $1,200,000 was converted into 2,400,000 shares of
common stock in August 1995, and 1,920,000 of the newly issued shares were
immediately distributed to the public through an underwritten secondary public
offering completed on August 17, 1995. Costs of $249,000 relating to the S-3
Registration Statement and conversion of the Subordinated Convertible Debenture
were written off during 1995.

     Patent litigation costs of $308,000 were incurred in our patent lawsuit
against Conceptronic during 1995.  The jury found in favor of the defendant.  We
have filed an appeal and if successful, will review our options with regard to
continuing the lawsuit to the next step.  The process will take approximately
1-1 1/2 years.

     As we progress into the second half of the 90's, we feel confident in the
direction of Vitronics.  We thank all of our stockholders, employees, customers
and vendors for your support and appreciate your continued support as we
approach the new millennium.

                             VITRONICS CORPORATION

                                     PART I
                                        
Item 1.   Business

  Vitronics Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in Massachusetts on
April 21, 1981.  The Company is engaged in designing, engineering, manufacturing
and marketing state-of-the-art thermal processing systems for soldering surface
mount devices to printed circuit boards and cleaning of the finished assembly.
The Company's customers are captive and contract manufacturers of medium to high
reliability printed circuit boards.


Current Products:

  The Company produces several lines of solder reflow ovens used primarily in
the final step of attachment of surface mounted devices to printed circuit
boards.  Using similar technology, the Company has also produced systems for
attaching hybrid circuits to ceramic substrates and for curing epoxies and
adhesives used in bonding applications by the electronics industries.

  The solder reflow products fall into five broad categories, each available in
a range of sizes and price levels to accommodate the throughput and space
requirements of the circuit board manufacturer.


     --The SMR UNITHERM reflow series--high production rate, fully featured,
       infrared/forced convection reflow ovens.

     --The SMR IsoTherm reflow series--low to medium production rate,
       infrared/forced convection reflow ovens with basic features.

     --The SMD reflow series--high production rate, infrared, natural convection
       reflow ovens.

     --The GP/MP series--low volume, benchtop, infrared, natural convection
       reflow ovens.

     --The SELECTSeries--high production rate, fully featured, infrared/forced
       convection reflow ovens.

 
  In the first quarter of 1996, the Company introduced its SELECTSeries line of
surface mount reflow ovens.   Over the next six months Vitronics plans to
produce three new families of ovens.  Building upon Vitronics' expertise in
modularity, MagnaTherm, AcroTherm and RadianTherm have been designed to provide
customers with the unequaled opportunity to match technical requirements with
system size, configuration, capability and cost.  Available in air, nitrogen or
field-retrofittable nitrogen models, management believes the SELECTSeries will
establish a new benchmark in surface mount reflow.  Although Vitronics already
offers the broadest choice of ovens available, these three new oven families,
combined with UNITHERM and IsoTherm, will give the customer an even wider
selection.


  Soldering remains the preferred method of permanently attaching hybrid and
semiconductor packages, microprocessors, resistors, capacitors and other common
electronic components to the surfaces of printed circuit boards. Substrate/
component assemblies treated with a coating of solder paste are placed onto the
conveyer system, which transports them at a constant rate through a heated
tunnel consisting of one or more individually heated and controlled zones. Heat
is transferred at a precisely controlled rate to the assemblies by means of
convection and radiation until the solder melts and flows between the component
leads and the circuit board. Rapid cooling ensures the formation of the desired
solder joints. This thermal process is also applicable to the production of a
variety of electronic component packages, including ceramic hybrids,
semiconductors, Ball Grid Array and glass/epoxy circuits.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
  The Company's SMR series reflow soldering systems incorporate a heater and
cell design with the benefits of high efficiency, forced-convection heat
transfer, in addition to a background of infrared radiation.  A unique feature
of this cell is the individual zone exhaust which removes solder paste fumes as
they are generated.  Patent applications are pending worldwide covering the
unique features of the SMR series reflow soldering systems.  The UNITHERM
version incorporates multiple heating cells both above and below the conveyor.
The economical IsoTherm version, introduced in 1994, employs heater cells only
above the conveyor.  In both versions, product heating is accomplished with high
velocity heated gas that is distributed with optimal flow uniformity across the
entire heating area supported by a background of infrared emission from the
heated surfaces.  A second generation UNITHERM series introduced in 1994, offers
advanced features including controlled exhaust heater, auto chain lubrication,
variable tunnel aperture, and fume capture, for full automation.  The Company
continues to produce its original SMD reflow systems for selected customers and
applications.

  In addition to reflow ovens, the Company markets a line of aqueous and semi-
aqueous circuit board cleaners.  These cleaners offer the printed circuit board
industry environmentally safe, yet cost effective, cleaning methods.  The semi-
aqueous cleaners are designed to remove both rosin-based and water soluble
organic fluxes using non-CFC (chlorofluorocarbon)  biodegradable solvents for
environmental safety.  The systems will operate both on-line or off-line with a
variable speed conveyor system facilitating the interface with any in-line
soldering system.  The first model, introduced by the Company in 1990, is known
as the ENVIROCLEAN 3000, a semi-aqueous cleaning system which incorporates an
integrated emulsion module with a decanter/separator and enhanced cleaning and
drying capabilities.  The Company's Aquapro product is an aqueous cleaning
system designed to clean high density surface mount assemblies.


Product Applications:

  Printed Circuit Board Systems--The trend in the printed circuit board (PCB)
segment of the electronics industry is the attachment of surface mount
electronic components and devices to PCBs.  The Company's solder reflow systems
are well suited to this task because of unique forced convection/infrared
heating cells and process gas management systems.  The wide range of oven sizes
and features helps to accommodate the satisfaction of virtually all market
requirements.  The Company's cleaning systems used for the removal of flux
residues from finished assemblies are not harmful to the environment due to the
use of non-CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) solvents.  Specifically, the ENVIROCLEAN and
AQUAPRO cleaning products use either semi-aqueous or aqueous cleaning
technology.  In both cases, the residues from the cleaning process may be
disposed of in the environment with no substantial long- term harm.  The aqueous
cleaner uses only water or water with a small amount of common saponifier.
Furthermore, the semi-aqueous terpenes are biodegradable.  This is in direct
contrast to previous cleaning technologies that utilize organic solvents known
commonly as CFCs.  CFCs are both toxic and ozone depleting.


Product Options and Enhancements:

  Nitrogen Atmosphere--This option gives an inert atmosphere with tight control
of oxygen levels (below 20 parts per million), which gives the process engineer
the ability to accommodate new assembly materials and processes.

  Controlled Convection/Infrared--This option allows the process engineer
increased thermal stability and uniformity throughout the reflow cycle, thus
increasing production yields.

  32 Loop Controller--A 32 loop proportional controller with integral and
differential control has been developed and integrated into the SMD and UNITHERM
series ovens.  The 32 loop reduces cost on the larger ovens and adds versatility
of control.

  Rail/Chain Conveyor Transport System--This option allows routine double-sided
surface mount soldering without the necessity of fixturing as is necessary with
standard belt conveyors.  This is made possible by allowing two edges

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
of a board to rest on pins which protrude from two moving chains that ride
through adjustable rails. A key benefit of this edge rail system is the 10 to 30
percent increase in processing speed relative to the belt system.

  Enhanced Cooling--This option provides additional cooling capacity within the
process tunnel to reduce both solder liquidous times and finished product
temperatures for product handling requirements.


Products and Processes Under Development:

  Thermal Process Management--The Company continues to research methods and
products that improve the process integrity, automation and efficiency of its
thermal methodology.

  Product Range--The Company continues to broaden its product range to address
even larger segments of the printed circuit market.


Research and Development:

  During the year ending December 31, 1995, the Company expended $1,363,000 or
6% of its net sales on research and development.  Such expenditures were
$1,010,000 or 6% of net sales in 1994 and $860,000 or 7% of net sales in 1993.
All of the Company's existing products have been designed and developed by the
Company or its subsidiaries.


Markets:

  The primary market for the Company's products is the electronics industry,
where the systems are used in the production of printed circuit boards, ceramic
hybrids, semiconductor packages, and glass/epoxy circuits.  Additional
applications of the Company's products within the electronics industry include:
circuit board drying, BGA fabrication, epoxy curing, hybrid solder reflow,
polymer curing, and thick film drying.

  Segments of the electronics industry served by the Company's products are:
computers and peripheral office equipment, test and measurement equipment,
telecommunications equipment, automotive electronics, consumer electronics,
medical electronics, and contract assembly.


Materials:

  The Company continues to produce in-house all of its thermal source emitters
and cells.  The Company currently has one source for its microprocessor which is
used to interface the onboard computer with the machine in the Command Control
system.  Management believes that this microprocessor could be produced in-house
or obtained from another source.  The Company has developed a new microprocessor
for its IsoTherm machines.  Work is currently being done to upgrade the
microprocessor for use on the UNITHERM product line.  This new microprocessor
will enable the Company to develop an alternative source for its microprocessor.
The other components being used in the assembly of systems produced by the
Company are purchased from original equipment manufacturers, electronic supply
firms and others.  The Company has no reason to believe that it cannot continue
to obtain such components, or suitable substitutes, as required.


Patents and Trademarks:

  The Company was issued a United States patent in January 1986 covering the
multi-zone thermal processing systems produced by the Company.  A second patent
was issued in July 1986, on the source emitter panel produced by the Company.
Other patents cover the process for mounting surface mount devices to printed
circuit boards 

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
through the use of solder reflow, and an improved source emitter panel. The
Company has also filed foreign patent applications corresponding to the
foregoing United States patents where it has been deemed advisable. Several of
these foreign applications have been granted. The Company believes that the
patents on the ENVIROCLEAN product line and UNITHERM product line theoretically
strengthen its competitive position by enhancing marketability of these product
lines, and by serving as a barrier to new competitors in the field who could
otherwise develop similar technology.

  With respect to the ENVIROCLEAN product line, the Company utilizes semi-
aqueous cleaning agents known as hydrocarbons.  These compounds have a low flash
point which may create a hazard with hot circuit boards.  The Company has a
patent on a fire-retardant system and on various interlock systems which reduce
the risk of fire/heat damage and enable safer utilization of the hydrocarbons in
the Company's cleaning systems.  The Company also has a patent on a unique
oscillating spray nozzle system that is devised for the water systems.   The
Company has three issued U.S. Patents and several pending applications worldwide
covering various aspects of the semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaning systems.

  With respect to the UNITHERM product line, the patents cover both the heater
technology and the individual zone exhausts.   The Company has an issued U.S.
Patent, as well as additional pending patent applications in the U.S. and
worldwide, covering its UNITHERM product line.

  The Company at present does not license any of its technology to any
competitors or other non-affiliated entities.

  The Company has U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for the trademark
VITRONICS, as well as a U.S. trademark registration for the VITRONICS LOGO,
UNITHERM and ENVIROCLEAN.  The Company also uses unregistered trademarks for
IsoTherm, VITROSENSE, Natural Convection/Infrared, Controlled
Convection/Infrared, VITRO-FOIL, VITRO-CLEAN, AcroTherm, RadianTherm,
MagnaTherm, Tops, Polar Cooling and SELECTSeries.

  The Company's marketing and sales program includes:  paid advertising, new
product announcements in industrial and commercial publications, direct mail
campaigns, technical articles, trade show exhibits, personal contacts and
trained sales representatives in the U.S., Canada, Southeast Asia, Europe, South
America, India and Israel.

  The Company has 10 persons employed in its sales and marketing department,
including one person in both the West Coast and Central Regions, and two persons
in its U.K. direct sales organization.  The Company also utilizes 22 independent
sales representative organizations located in the United States and Canada, and
25 independent distributor organizations overseas.

  During 1995, one of the Company's customers accounted for 12% of net sales
($2,886,000) while another customer accounted for 10% ($2,451,000).  During
1994, one of the Company's customers accounted for 15% of net sales
($2,544,000).  None of the Company's customers accounted for 10% or more of its
net sales in 1993.  The Company has no contracts that are subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of any government agency or unit.  The Company's business is not
seasonal in any material respect.

  OEM Supply Relationships--The Company has formed supply relationships with a
number of "Pick and Place" original equipment manufacturers.  "Pick and place"
is the term used to describe the automated technology used to place components
on PCBs prior to attachment and soldering.  In each of these relationships, the
Company's solder reflow systems are purchased by the OEM and resold as a package
with pick and place equipment as part of an in-line assembly system.


Backlog:

  On December 31, 1995, the Company had purchase orders reflecting a backlog of
$2,847,000 as compared to a December 31, 1994 backlog of $2,589,000.  The
backlog has increased as a result of the increased bookings activity seen during
the year.  All of the backlog at December 31, 1995 is expected to be shipped
within the next six months.  At present, most of its customers pay the Company
within 40 to 60 days of billing.


Competition:

  Solder Reflow Systems--Both domestically and internationally, the Company
confronts competition from three primary competitors in the solder reflow
systems market.  In addition, there are three lesser competitors selling systems
primarily in the United States' domestic market.  In Europe, the Company
competes with companies based in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.  The
Japanese market is dominated by three Japanese manufacturers that have focused
almost exclusively on that market.  Asia (excluding Japan) has a mix of
competitors, none of which have significant market share on a worldwide basis.
Management of the Company believes that product performance, reliability and
cost of operation are the chief competitive factors in the market for solder
reflow products.  The Company believes that its UNITHERM product line permits
the Company to retain a substantial market share in the solder reflow
marketplace.

  The Company's solder reflow systems may also face competition from the
development of electrically conductive adhesives designed to eliminate the need
to solder components to PCBs.  At this point in the development of conductive
adhesives, management believes that even if the adhesives are technologically
successful, they will require heat treatment or curing, and therefore they will
continue to represent a market for the Company's solder reflow technology.  The
potential impact on the Company's semi-aqueous system business is uncertain, and
this business could be jeopardized.

  Semi-Aqueous Cleaning Systems--The Company is in strong competition with three
primary competitors that manufacture semi-aqueous cleaning systems.  Competition
is based on both price and performance consideration.  Due to the relatively
large base of potential customers who have previously purchased the Company's
solder reflow systems, and the fact that the Company's semi-aqueous system was
the first such system to gain market acceptance,

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
the Company believes it is favorably positioned to take advantage of any
potential rise in demand for environmentally friendly semi-aqueous cleaning
systems.

  The Company's semi-aqueous cleaning technology, unlike the technology employed
by its three main competitors, utilizes a spray technique as opposed to an
immersion process.  The Company believes that its spray technique is more
advanced and also gives the Company a cost advantage over its competitors.

  The Company's semi-aqueous cleaning systems, which have been fully developed,
also face competition from the growing acceptance and utilization of "no clean"
solder pastes which produce minimal flux residue, thus reducing and potentially
eliminating the need for post-assembly PCB cleaning, and the emergence of
electrically-conductive adhesives.  There can be no assurance that the
technology necessary to make and effectively use "no clean" solder pastes which
meet high reliability standards will not be developed.  In this event, the
market for semi-aqueous cleaning systems could be substantially reduced.


Environmental Compliance:

  Due to the nature of the Company's products, it has not been materially
affected by environmental laws.  Management does not expect its capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position to be materially affected in the
future.


Employees:

  As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed 128 full-time persons.


Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales:

  During the year ended December 31, 1995, approximately $11,902,000 or 51% of
the Company's sales were foreign sales, primarily to European and Southeast
Asian companies.  During the year ending December 31, 1994, approximately
$7,912,000 or 46% of the Company's sales were foreign sales, and $7,436,000 or
58% for the year ending December 31, 1993, were foreign sales.  Other
information concerning foreign sales for the last three fiscal years is
presented in Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Item 2.   Properties

  The executive offices and principal place of business of the Company are
located at 1 Forbes Road, Newmarket Industrial Park, Newmarket, New Hampshire.
The Company leases two buildings, one 23,990 square foot facility for
administration and manufacturing, and one 9,400 square foot facility used
exclusively as a stockroom.  The 23,990 square foot facility has a lease which
expires in February 1999, and the 9,400 square foot facility has a lease which
expires in January 1997.  The Company has the option to purchase the 23,990
square foot property at the end of the lease period for $1,100,000.  The
interior layout and leasehold improvements  to the 23,990 square foot facility
were constructed to the Company's specifications for its use of the facilities.

  The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Vitronics Europe Limited ("VEL"),
leases a 15,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution facility in Plymouth,
England.  This lease expires in December 1998.

  The Company believes that its current facilities are adequate for 1996
operations.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

  The Company is currently involved in a patent litigation suit against a
competitor, Conceptronic, Inc.  The Company commenced the suit in November 1991,
seeking an injunction and damages against Conceptronic for infringement of an
apparatus patent and a method patent, both of which are owned by the Company and
cover certain aspects of its solder reflow systems.  The trial regarding this
dispute commenced on July 25, 1995 in the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire.  On August 16, 1995, the Court directed a verdict of
non-infringement in favor of Conceptronic on the method patent, while the jury
rendered a verdict of non-infringement in favor of Conceptronic on the apparatus
patent.  The Company does not expect the jury's verdict to have a negative
impact upon the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  The
Company has appealed the directed verdict on the method patent.  The Company is
unable to predict the outcome of this appeal process, but does not believe that
an adverse decision, however unlikely in the Company's view, will have a
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operation.
The Company intends to pursue all of its legal rights and remedies in connection
with this litigation, and believes that a favorable outcome may result in
certain licensing opportunities for the Company which could have a positive
impact on its financial condition and results of operations in the future.


Item 4.   Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

  Sales were $23,525,000 in 1995, an increase of 36% from $17,346,000 in 1994,
and $12,778,000 in 1993.  Bookings for 1995 increased 34% to $23,783,000 from
$17,802,000 in 1994.  Bookings for 1993 were $11,893,000.  The Company's backlog
was $2,847,000 at December 31, 1995 versus $2,589,000 at December 31, 1994.  The
increase was a result of a turnaround in the electronics industry, an increased
demand for the Company's products, and a recapture of market share lost in 1991
through 1993.  During 1994, sales of semi-aqueous cleaners were very slow, while
sales of aqueous cleaners had slightly more activity.  Despite the total
elimination of CFC production in 1995, the expected increased revenue from these
products has not yet materialized as expected and there can be no assurance that
these revenues will materialize.

  Revenues from Asia decreased in 1994 by approximately $1 million, as compared
to 1993, due principally to the introduction of the UNITHERM product in Asia in
the first quarter of 1993.  The product was scheduled for introduction in 1992,
and the resulting delay led to higher sales in 1993.

  In 1995, gross profit percentage increased to 41% from 36% in 1994, primarily
due to significantly higher volume of sales, decreased material costs and
increased labor productivity, which was partially offset by increased
discounting.  Steps were taken in the fourth quarter of 1993 to consolidate
manufacturing operations into one building in New Hampshire.  This resulted in
substantial savings in 1994.  Gross profit percentage in 1993 was 28%.  The
Company increased its inventory reserves from $367,000 at the end of 1994 to
$760,000 at the end of 1995.  Such increases were principally related to the
Company's production process and product line changes.  As the Company made
changes in designs and processes, certain existing inventories were affected.
This change necessitated the rework of certain inventory items and the
obsolescence of other items.  The Company increased its reserves for
obsolescence in recognition of these events.

  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 1995 to $5,525,000
from $4,072,000 in 1994, an increase of 36%.  However, as a percentage of sales,
selling, general administrative expenses remained at 23% in 1995 from 23% in
1994.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,338,000, or 26% of
net sales in 1993.  The increase in actual spending is partially a result of the
increased sales volume which resulted in higher commission and marketing
expenses and increased staffing levels.  The Company also incurred costs of
approximately $249,000 relating to the Registration Statement filed on Form S-3
and conversion of the Subordinated Convertible Debenture.  The Company also
incurred approximately $109,000 of due diligence expenses relating to a
potential acquisition.  After completion of the due diligence, the Board of
Directors decided not to pursue this acquisition. The Company incurred
advertising costs of $219,000 in 1995, $176,000 in 1994, and $147,000 in 1993.

  Research and development expenses increased 35% to $1,363,000 in 1995 from
$1,010,000 in 1994.  The increase was a result of increased headcount as the
Company accelerated the introduction of new products and enhanced features
during the year.  Research and development expenses were $860,000 in 1993.

  In 1993, the Company incurred $420,000 of non-recurring charges.  The Company
wrote off restructuring charges of $290,000 relating to the consolidation of
manufacturing from two buildings into one building and the payment of severance
costs.  The Company wrote off $130,000 of goodwill relating to the Gram
Corporation acquisition in 1988.  During 1993 the Company's revenues from the
product line were diminishing and as such the asset had no value.  Revenues from
the Gram product line were approximately $1,700,000 in 1992 and had decreased to
approximately $500,000 in 1993.  The Company also believed that future sales of
this product would continue to decrease.  The Company also wrote off $90,000
relating to a prior year foreign tax credit which was determined to be
unrealizable by the Company.  This credit was for the Company's United Kingdom
subsidiary, which had losses in 1991, 1992 and 1993.

  Costs relating to the Company's patent infringement lawsuit against
Conceptronic were $308,000 for 1995, $330,000 for 1994, and $127,000 for 1993.
With the conclusion of the Conceptronic trial in August 1995, and a verdict
rendered for the defendant, the Company does not anticipate that additional
costs relating to the appeal process will be significant until such time as an
appeal may be granted, which will be approximately 1 - 1 1/2 years from the
date the appeal was filed.

                                       10

  The Company had net non-operating expenses of $132,000 in 1995 compared to
$171,000 in 1994 and $105,000 for 1993.  The Company, as part of a planned
program to generate cash, sold a number of its demo machines, in either
inventory or fixed assets, and realized a gain of $85,000 in 1994, versus
$42,000 in 1993.  The Company also incurred $39,000 of cash discounts in 1995
versus $61,000 in 1994, and $86,000 in 1993.  The Company incurred interest
expense of $118,000 in 1995 compared to $189,000 in 1994 and $114,000 in 1993.
The decrease in 1995 is primarily attributable to the conversion of the
Subordinated Convertible Debenture in August 1995.  The Company had interest
income of  $58,000 in 1995 compared to $10,000 in 1994 and $6,000 in 1993.  This
increase was a result of the Company's higher cash balances during 1995 versus
1994 and 1993.

  The Company had a net tax benefit during 1995 of $573,000 as compared to tax
expense of $25,000 and $37,000 during 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The tax
benefit was a result of a change in the Company's valuation allowance reserve,
after current year utilization, of $723,000.  This tax benefit was offset by
current year tax payable of $150,000.  The Company reduced its valuation
allowance reserve because it is more likely than not that their favorable tax
attributes will be realized.


Liquidity and Capital Resources:

  During the last three fiscal years, the Company has financed its operations
with internally generated funds, capital leases and a $1,200,000 Subordinated
Convertible Loan in 1993.  The Subordinated Convertible Debenture was converted
into 2,400,000 shares of common stock in August 1995.  In addition, during
January 1994, the Company pledged receivables and received a $350,000 loan from
New England Growth Fund I, L.P.  This loan was repaid in full on March 31, 1994.
During 1995, cash increased by $2,154,000 as a result of the improved operation
of the Company.  In 1994, cash increased by $499,000 as a result of the improved
operation of the Company.  During 1994, the Company reduced its long-term debt
by approximately $447,000.  During 1993, cash decreased by $1,084,000 as the
Company paid off its bank loan by approximately $684,000 and reduced its accrued
liabilities by $600,000.  During 1995 and 1993, there were no short-term
borrowings.

  The Company has reviewed its capital spending budget for 1996 and expects to
finance its 1996 capital equipment acquisitions through lease financing.  The
Company continues to monitor its operational spending levels very closely in
order to conserve cash.  In March 1995, the Company obtained a $500,000
revolving line of credit with First National Bank of Portsmouth. To date, the
Company has not utilized this line of credit.   The Company believes that its
current cash balances and cash from operations will be adequate to meet the
Company's working capital requirements during the next year.

  On February 8, 1996, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to five percent of its common stock, or
approximately 500,000 shares.  Depending on business conditions, stock market
conditions, price per share and other factors, the Company  will repurchase
shares in open market transactions.  If the Company were to repurchase the
entire 500,000 shares at current prices per share, the cost of the repurchase
could be $1,250,000 and would be funded through the Company's cash balances.  As
of March 21, 1996, the Company has not repurchased any shares.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Vitronics Corporation and Subsidiary:
 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial 
statement schedule of Vitronics Corporation and Subsidiary listed in Items 
14(a)(1) and (2) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial 
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and 
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Vitronics 
Corporation and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial 
statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material 
respects, the information required to be included therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                      Three Years Ended December 31, 1995


A.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The Company is engaged in designing, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
state-of-the-art thermal processing systems for soldering surface mount devices
to printed circuit boards and cleaning of the finished assembly.  The Company's
customers are captive and contract manufacturers of medium to high reliability
printed circuit boards.  The primary market for the Company's products is the
electronics industry, where the systems are used in the production of printed
circuit boards, ceramic hybrid semiconductor packages and glass/epoxy circuits.
Segments of the electronics industry served by the Company's products are:
computer and peripheral office equipment, test and measurement equipment,
telecommunications equipment, medical electronics and contract assembly.  The
Company sells and markets its products on a worldwide basis, with approximately
50% of its revenue being to foreign countries, primarily Europe and Southeast
Asia.   The significant accounting policies employed are as follows:


  Principles of Consolidation--

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Vitronics Europe Ltd., located in the
United Kingdom.  All significant intercompany balances, transactions and profits
have been eliminated.


  Cash Equivalents--

   The Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments with a maturity of
three months or less, at the time of purchase, to be cash equivalents.  At
December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately
$1,886,000 and $623,000 respectively, on deposit at one bank.


  Inventories--

   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market.  Provision is made for excess or obsolete inventory and other inventory
valuation concerns in the period in which such matters are identified.  The
Company classifies its demo machines as finished goods and amortizes the cost
over three years.  This amortization is included in inventory reserves.


  Property and Equipment--

   Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the applicable
assets.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, whereas expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Upon sale or other disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income.

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
 The estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation are as follows:

          Furniture and fixtures               5-8

</TABLE>

  Other Assets--

    Included in other assets are patents and debenture costs associated with the
issuance of long-term debt.  Patents and debenture costs are being amortized on
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to
seven years.


  Foreign Currency Translation--

    All assets and liabilities of the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary are
translated at exchange rates in effect at each respective balance sheet date
(December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994).  Income and expenses are translated
at average rates for the year.  The resulting differences, due to changing
exchange rates, are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment
included as part of Stockholders' Equity.  Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings.  Included in other expenses were
losses of $13,000 and $14,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995 and December
31, 1994 respectively.


  Revenue Recognition--

    Revenue is recorded upon shipment to the customer.


  Research and Development Costs--

    All research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.


  Warranties--

    The Company's products are generally under warranty against defects in
material and workmanship for a one year period.  Estimated warranty costs are
accrued in the same period as products are shipped.


  Income taxes--

    The Company has adopted the liability method of accounting for income taxes,
as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes (SFAS 109).  SFAS 109 is an asset and liability approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's
financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax consequences,
SFAS 109 generally considers all expected future events other than future
enactments of changes in the tax law or rates.  Deferred tax assets are
recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss and credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax expense represents
the change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
Stock Options--

   The Company intends to adopt the disclosure provisions Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Number 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS
123) effective January 1, 1996, as allowed by SFAS 123.


 Income (Loss) Per Common Share--

     The income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares (where dilutive) outstanding during the
year.


 Pervasiveness of Estimates--

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


 Reclassification--

     Certain 1994 and 1993 balances have been reclassified in order to conform
to the 1995 presentation.



B.     SUBSEQUENT EVENT

 Treasury Stock Repurchase--

    On February 8, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5
percent, or approximately 500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock.  As of
March 9, 1996, the Company has not repurchased any shares.  The Company may
repurchase shares depending on market price, stock market condition, business
conditions, and other factors.

  On October 1, 1993, the Company received $1,200,000 from an investment fund.
This was a Convertible Subordinated Debenture with an interest rate of 10%
convertible into 2,400,000 shares of Vitronics' common stock.  The $1,200,000
Subordinated Convertible Debenture was converted into 2,400,000 shares of the
Company's common stock at a conversion price of $.50 per share on August 11,
1995.

  In March 1995, the Company obtained a $500,000 revolving line of credit with
First National Bank of Portsmouth.  As of December 31, 1995, nothing had been
drawn against this line.  This line of credit is collateralized by the Company's
U.S. receivables and U.S. inventory.  The Company is also required to maintain a
minimum debt service coverage of 1.2, a minimum net worth of no less than
$2,550,000, and maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of no
less than 1.7.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company was not in violation of any
loan covenants.

  Borrowings under the U.K. term loan are collateralized by substantially all of
the assets of VEL, the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary and guaranteed by the
Company.  The interest rate was 9.75% at December 31, 1995, and 9% at December
31, 1994.  At December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, this has been classified
as long-term debt.  The final payments on this debt are due in August 1997.

  In 1993, approximately $365,000 of accounts payable were converted to long-
term Notes Payable.  As of December 31, 1995, approximately $47,000 of such
Notes Payable remain outstanding and are due at the end of 1996.

  The Company finances some of its capital equipment acquisitions through lease
financing.  During 1995, the Company entered into capital leases totaling
approximately $200,000.

  As of December 31, 1995, aggregate maturities of long-term liabilities were as
follows (in thousands):

  Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans
with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's U.K.
term loan as of December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994 approximated carrying

  The Company currently has net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards
for federal and foreign income tax purposes of approximately  $320,000 and R&D
credits of approximately $75,000, all expiring in the years 2007 and 2008.
There are also capital loss carryforwards of $470,000 which will expire in 1997.
The Company has maintained a valuation of $160,000 due to the uncertainty
surrounding the ultimate utilization of these losses.  The valuation allowance
reserve has been reduced by a net $723,000 (after current year utilization)
because it is more likely than not that these favorable tax attributes will be
realized.

  The Company is currently involved in a patent litigation suit against a
competitor, Conceptronic, Inc.  The Company commenced the suit in November 1991,
seeking an injunction and damages against Conceptronic for infringement of an
apparatus patent and a method patent, both of which are owned by the Company and
cover certain aspects of its solder reflow systems.  The trial regarding this
dispute commenced on July 25, 1995 in the United States District Court for the
District of New Hampshire.  On August 16, 1995, the court directed a verdict of
non-infringement in favor of Conceptronic on the method patent, while the jury
rendered a verdict on non-infringement in favor of Conceptronic on the apparatus
patent.  The Company does not expect the jury's verdict to have a negative
impact upon the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  The
Company is unable to

predict the outcome of this appeal process, but does not believe that an adverse
decision, however unlikely in the Company's view, will have a material effect on
the Company's financial condition or results of operation.  The Company intends
to pursue all of its legal rights and remedies in connection with this
litigation, and believes that a favorable outcome may result in certain
licensing opportunities for the Company which could have a positive impact on
its financial condition and results of operations in the future.

  The Company, in the normal course of business, is involved in various other
legal proceedings, that in the opinion of management, will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial conditions or results of operations.
