                                     PART I

Item 1:  BUSINESS

         Whitney Holding Corporation (the "Company") is a Louisiana bank holding
company registered pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company
became an operating  entity in 1962 with Whitney  National Bank (the  "Louisiana
Bank") as its only  significant  subsidiary.  In  December,  1994,  the  Company
established the Whitney Bank of Alabama (the "Alabama  Bank") and,  through this
new banking subsidiary, acquired the Mobile area operations of The Peoples Bank,
Elba,  Alabama  on  February  17,  1995.  The  Louisiana  Bank,  which  has  its
headquarters in Orleans Parish,  has been engaged in general banking business in
Louisiana and the City of New Orleans since 1883.

         The Company,  through its banking  subsidiaries,  engages in commercial
and retail banking and in trust business,  including the taking of deposits, the
making of secured and unsecured loans, the financing of commercial transactions,
the issuance of credit cards, the performance of corporate, pension and personal
trust services,  investment services and safe deposit rentals.  The Louisiana  
Bank is active as a correspondent for other banks.  The Banks render specialized
services of different kinds in connection with all of the foregoing, and operate
forty-four offices in south Louisiana, five offices in the  Mobile  area,  and a
foreign branch on Grand Cayman in the British West Indies.

         There is significant competition within the financial services industry
in general as well as with respect to the particular financial services provided
by the Banks.  Within its market areas,  the Banks compete directly with several
major banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources as well as
with  various  other  smaller  banking  organizations  and  local  and  national
"non-bank"  competitors,  including savings and loans,  credit unions,  mortgage
companies,  personal and  commercial  finance  companies,  investment  brokerage
firms, and registered investment companies (mutual funds).

         In recent years there has been a significant  consolidation  within the
financial  services  industry,  particularly  with  respect to the  banking  and
savings and loan segments of this industry.  This movement to consolidation  has
been driven both by the large number of bank and S&L failures experienced during
the crisis of the late 1980's and early 1990's as well as by general competitive
pressures.  All of  the  Banks'  major  direct  banking  competitors  have  been
relatively active in expansion through acquisition. In recent years, the Company
has entered into two acquisitions of banking operations involving  approximately
$200 million of assets and liabilities.  The trend toward industry consolidation
is expected to continue in the near term.

         All material funds of the Company are invested in the Banks.  The Banks
have a large number of customer  relationships  which have been  acquired over a
period of many years and are not  dependent  upon any single  customer or upon a
few customers,  so the loss of any single  customer or a few customers would not
have a material  adverse effect on the Banks or the Company.  The Louisiana Bank
has  customers  in a number of  foreign  countries  but the  portion  of revenue
derived from these  foreign  customers is not a material  portion of its overall
revenues.

         The Company and the Banks and their related  operations  are subject to
federal, state and local laws applicable to banks and bank holding companies and
to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  the
Comptroller of Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

         The Company does not believe that  compliance  with  existing  federal,
state or local  environmental  laws and  regulations  will  impose any  material
financial obligation on the Company or materially affect the realizable value of
its assets.

Item 2:  PROPERTIES

         The Company  owns no real estate in its own name.  The  Louisiana  Bank
owns the fourteen-story Whitney National Bank Building at 228 St. Charles Avenue
in New Orleans.  The Louisiana Bank occupies  approximately 68.0% of the 364,863
square feet in this building,  and the balance is either leased to third parties
or available to be leased.  The Banks also own the premises for twelve  branches
in Orleans  Parish,  six branches in Jefferson  Parish,  four branches in Mobile
County,  four  branches in  Lafayette  Parish,  six branches in East Baton Rouge
Parish and three  branches  in St.  Tammany  Parish,  one of which is located on
leased  ground.   None  of  these  properties  is  subject  to  any  significant
encumbrances.

         The Banks hold a variety of property interest  acquired  throughout the
years in  settlement  of  loans.  Reference  is made to Note 7 to the  financial
statements  included  in Item 8 for  further  information  as to  such  property
interest as of December 31, 1994.

Item 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         There are no material  pending  legal  proceedings,  other than routine
litigation  incidental to the business, to which the Company or its subsidiaries
is a party or to which any of their property is subject.

Item 7:  MANAGEMENTS'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
            FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SUMMARY

         Whitney Holding  Corporation  earned $52.8 million in 1994 or $3.63 per
share.  These  results  include  the  effects of a $6.1  million  recovery  of a
charged-off  loan which the  Company  was able to  transfer  to income and of an
additional  $20 million  reduction in the level of the reserve for possible loan
losses.  The  transfer  of the  recovery  and  the  reserve  reduction  together
contributed  $17.0  million or $1.17 per share to 1994  earnings on an after-tax
basis.  For 1993,  the Company  reported  earnings of $76.4 million or $5.30 per
share, including an after-tax contribution to earnings of $39.5 million or $2.74
per  share  resulting  from a  total  of  $60.0  million  in loan  loss  reserve
reductions during that year.

         Net interest income and  non-interest  income both increased in 1994 as
compared to 1993, as did  non-interest  expense.  Net interest income  increased
$3.4  million  or 2.8%  while the  taxable-equivalent  net  interest  margin was
essentially  unchanged  at 4.79%  in 1994  compared  to 4.75% in 1993.  The $1.3
million or 4.3% overall increase in non-interest income reflected improvement in
virtually all income categories.  Non-interest  expense was $4.2 million or 4.2%
higher in 1994  compared  to 1993,  largely as a result of  increased  personnel
expenses  from  acquisitions,  merit pay  increases,  and various  employee  and
management incentives and benefits as well as from essential staff additions and
changes.

         Non-performing  assets  continued  their  steady  decrease  of the past
several  years in 1994. At December 31, 1994,  non-performing  assets were $22.1
million,  down 56% from $49.9  million at  December  31,  1993.  The reserve for
possible  loan losses was $34.4  million on December 31,  1994,  an amount which
represented  224% of  non-performing  loans and 3.2% of total loans. At year end
1993, the reserve  coverage was 132% of  non-performing  loans and 4.6% of total
loans on that date.

         For 1994, average earning assets were $2.67 billion, an increase of $62
million or 2.4% from $2.61 billion in 1993.  Average accruing loans  outstanding
were $956  million in 1994  compared to $904 million in the  previous  year,  an
increase of $52 million or 5.8%.  This loan growth is  attributable  to both the
Baton Rouge  acquisition,  as discussed below,  which was completed in the first
quarter  of 1994  and to a  strengthening  of  demand  for both  commercial  and
consumer credit in the Company's market areas. At December 31, 1994, total loans
outstanding were $1.06 billion, an increase of $84 million or 8.6% over the $976
million of total loans outstanding on December 31, 1993.

         Average total  deposits  showed  modest  growth  between 1994 and 1993,
increasing $37 million to $2.45 billion.  The impact of the deposits  assumed in
the Baton Rouge acquisition was partially offset by the movement of some deposit
funds to higher yielding  alternative  investment  instruments  with the rise in
market rates in 1994.

         The Company's average investment in securities increased by $75 million
or 4.9% to  $1.62  billion  in  1994 as  compared  to  $1.55  billion  in  1993.
Throughout  1994,  however,  the  level  of the  increase  over  1993  has  been
declining.  The funding of recent loan demand and deposit outflows is evident in
this trend. From December 31, 1993, the Company's total investment in securities
has decreased approximately $101 million or 6.2% to 1994's year end.

         On March 31,  1994,  the Company  and the  Louisiana  Bank  completed a
purchase and  assumption  transaction  with Baton Rouge Bank and Trust  Company.
Included in the acquired assets, which totalled approximately $118 million, were
$59 million in  commercial,  real estate  mortgage and personal  loans,  and six
banking  offices  in  the  Baton  Rouge  area.  The  deposits  assumed  included
approximately  $24  million  in  non-interest-bearing  demand  deposits  and $94
million in interest-bearing transaction,  savings and time deposit accounts. All
six branch locations have been integrated into the Louisiana Bank.

         Subsequent to year end 1994, the Company, through the Alabama Bank, its
newly formed  banking  subsidiary,  acquired the Mobile area  operations  of The
Peoples Bank, Elba, Alabama,  for a purchase price of approximately $12 million.
The assets and deposit  liabilities  associated with the five banking  locations
acquired in this transaction totalled  approximately $90 million,  including $47
million in loans.  This  impact of this  acquisition  will be  reflected  in the
Company's consolidated financial statements beginning in 1995.

         The Company  declared  quarterly  dividends in 1994 totalling $0.64 per
share  compared  with $0.43 per share in 1993, an increase of $0.21 per share or
49%. During 1993, the Company's Board of Directors twice approved  three-for-two
stock  splits which were  effective  in February and November of that year.  All
share and per-share data in this report on Form 10-K reflect the effect of these
stock splits.

FINANCIAL CONDITION


Loans
         For 1994, the Company's average loans outstanding increased $27 million
or 2.8% as compared to 1993.  Average loans outstanding of $1.02 billion for the
fourth quarter of 1994, however, are $29 million above the level in 1994's third
quarter  and $79  million or 8.4% above the  fourth  quarter of 1993.  The Baton
Rouge  acquisition in the first quarter of 1994, an improving  regional  economy
and a more aggressive  effort to market both retail and commercial loan products
all contributed to the growth in the loan portfolio throughout 1994.

         The  improvement in economic  conditions in the Company's  market area,
which is primarily  southern  Louisiana  and  Mississippi  and,  most  recently,
southern  Alabama,  has come after several  years of a weaker  economy which had
been  reflected  in limited loan demand and in efforts by many  commercial  loan
customers to reduce their existing debt levels. During that period the Louisiana
Bank also consciously reduced its exposure to credits whose performance had been
adversely  affected  by  these  adverse  economic  conditions.  The  significant
reduction in non-performing  loans over the past several years is shown in below
in table of non-performing assets.

         During 1994,  the Company  continued  to expand its lending  resources,
market areas and loan products, and management expects to continue and intensify
these efforts in 1995 as the Banks compete to place high quality  credits in the
communities they serve.  Unfunded loan  commitments  outstanding at December 31,
1994 have increased to approximately  $582 million,  some $183 million above the
level at December 31, 1993.

Deposits and Short-term Borrowings

         The  Company's  average  deposit base  increased $37 million or 1.5% to
$2.45 billion in 1994 from $2.42 billion in 1993. Underlying this modest overall
increase is the effect of the  acquisition  of Baton Rouge Bank & Trust Company,
offset in part by some net deposit  outflow of  interest-bearing  deposits other
than time certificates of deposit.

         As   is   shown   in   the   table   of   average    balance    sheets,
non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased on average by $27 million or 3.7%
in 1994 as compared to 1993.  This table also shows that average time  deposits,
which  includes both core deposits and  certificates  of deposit of $100,000 and
over,  increased $45 million or 8.6% between 1993 and 1994. Virtually all of the
growth within the time deposit  category came from core  certificates of deposit
of under  $100,000.  The  growth in the  non-interest  demand  and time  deposit
categories  in  1994  exceeded  the  amount  attributable  to  the  Baton  Rouge
acquisition for each category.

         Average  savings,  interest-bearing  demand,  and money market  account
deposits decreased $35 million or 3.0% in 1994 compared with 1993. These changes
have  resulted  in  part  from  the  increasing  attractiveness  of  alternative
investment opportunities in 1994 as market rates have risen.

         The  Company's  short-term  borrowings  consist of purchases of federal
funds and sales of securities under repurchase  agreements.  Such borrowings are
used both as a source of funding for certain  short-term  lending facilities and
as  part of the  Banks'  services  to  correspondent  banks  and  certain  other
customers.  The Company's average short-term borrowing position,  net of federal
funds sold, was approximately $135 million in 1994 and $122 million in 1993.

Investment in Securities

         The Company's annual average investment in securities  increased by $76
million or 4.9% to $1.62 billion in 1994 from $1.55 billion in 1993. Between the
fourth quarters of 1993 and 1994, however,  the average investment in securities
decreased $84 million or 5.2%,  reflecting in part the recent  strengthening  of
loan  demand.  From  December  31,  1993,  the  Company's  total  investment  in
securities has decreased  approximately $101 million or 6.2% to $1.53 billion at
1994's year end.

         Both the  period-end and average  investment in securities  constituted
approximately  54% of total  assets and 59% of  earning  assets in both 1994 and
1993. The mix of period-end and average  investment in securities  also remained
relatively  stable  between these  periods,  with U.S.  Treasury and  government
agency issues, excluding mortgage-backed issues,  representing approximately 80%
of total investments.  The weighted average maturity of the overall portfolio of
securities was 28 months at year end 1994 as compared with 34 months at year end
1993. The weighted average taxable-equivalent portfolio yield increased 10 basis
points to 5.81% at December 31, 1994 from 5.71% at December 31, 1993.

         Effective  December  31,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  115,
"Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity  Securities."  The
statement  specifies  criteria for  classifying  investments  as either  trading
securities,  securities held to maturity,  or securities available for sale, and
establishes reporting standards for each classification.

         Management has considered the Company's existing  investment  portfolio
and underlying  asset/liability  management  policies and strategies in light of
SFAS No. 115 and determined that its investments in  mortgage-backed  securities
meet the criteria for  classification  as securities  available for sale.  These
securities were reported at their estimated fair values at December 31, 1994 and
1993. Any unrealized gain or loss  associated with these  securities at year end
1994 and 1993 was reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders'
equity. The tax-effected  unrealized loss at December 31, 1994 was approximately
$5.1 million.  The remaining  portfolio of securities  was classified as held to
maturity and continues to be reported at amortized cost. The Company  maintained
no trading portfolio in 1994 or 1993.

         In accordance  with SFAS No. 115,  reported  information  on investment
securities from before the date of adoption has not been restated. On an ongoing
basis,  investment  securities  are  classified  as they  are  acquired  and the
continued propriety of classifications is periodically evaluated by management.

         The Company  does not  maintain  any  investment  or  participation  in
financial  instruments or agreements  whose value is linked to, or derived from,
changes in the value of some  underlying  asset or index.  Such  instruments  or
agreements include futures, forward contracts,  option contracts,  interest-rate
swap agreements,  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics,
and are commonly referred to as derivatives.

Asset Quality

         Over the past four years,  overall asset quality has improved steadily.
As is shown in the non-performing  assets table, during this period, the Company
has been very  successful  in its  efforts to reduce its  non-performing  assets
through the full  rehabilitation  of nonaccruing  loans, the workout of troubled
credits,  and the sale of repossessed  loan  collateral.  Non-performing  assets
totalled  $22.1 million at December 31, 1994, a decrease of $27.8 million or 56%
from $49.9 million at year end 1993.

         Of the  $15.4  million  in  nonaccruing  loans at  December  31,  1994,
approximately  $4.0 million  represented  loans on which  interest  payments are
being  recognized  in income as  collected.  Nonaccruing  loans  totalling  $6.6
million at year end 1994 were secured by real property collateral.  Another $7.7
million consisted of various commercial credits.

         In 1994,  the Company was  successful  in  recovering  $19.7 million of
previously  charged-off  loans.  For the same  period,  the  Company  identified
approximately  $3.6  million of loans to be charged  off, a decrease of 44% from
the $6.4 million of  charge-offs  in 1993. As is shown in the table  summarizing
loan loss  experience,  the  Company  ended 1994 in a net  recovery  position of
approximately $16.1 million, an improvement of $10.1 million over 1993.

         The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a level  believed
by management to be adequate to absorb potential  losses in the portfolio.  With
the significant  recoveries during 1994 and the continued improvement in overall
asset quality,  the Company was able to return $26.1 million of the reserves for
possible loan losses to income. In 1993, the Company had reduced the reserve for
possible loan losses by a total of $60 million,  reflecting  the  improvement in
asset  quality  and  management's  determination  that the steps taken in recent
years to deal with  asset  quality  issues  at the  Louisiana  Bank had  yielded
lasting positive results. In management's  judgment,  some of the reserve levels
that had been  established  in recognition of these asset quality issues were no
longer  needed.  The  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses was $34.4  million at
December 31, 1994,  which  represented a 224%  coverage of total  non-performing
loans and 3.3% of total loans.

         During 1994,  the Company  disposed of other real estate owned ("OREO")
properties  with a carrying  value at the time of sale  totalling  approximately
$11.2  million.  The value of OREO  properties  acquired in  settlement of loans
during the year was $1.6 million.  The $6.7 million  balance of OREO at December
31, 1994 consisted mainly of commercial land and buildings.

         The Company has several property  interests which were acquired through
routine banking  transactions  generally prior to 1933 and which are recorded in
its financial records at a nominal value.  Management  continually  investigates
ways to  maximize  the  return  on  these  assets.  There  were  no  significant
dispositions of these property interests in 1994. Future dispositions may result
in the recognition of substantial gains.

         The Company has not extended any credit in  connection  with what would
be defined under regulatory guidelines as highly leveraged transactions, nor has
it acquired  any  investment  securities  arising  from such  transactions.  The
Company's foreign lending and investing activities are currently  insignificant.
Note 3 to the consolidated  financial statements discusses credit concentrations
in the loan portfolio.

Capital Adequacy

         The strong  earnings  reported  for 1994,  including  the effect of the
reduction in the reserve for loan losses,  are  reflected in the increase in the
Company's regulatory capital ratios between December 31, 1994 and 1993.

         The Company's regulatory capital ratios are shown above compared to the
minimums    currently    required   for   regulatory    classification    as   a
"well-capitalized" institution. The regulatory capital ratios for the Banks were
also well in excess of minimum requirements at December 31, 1994. The Company is
committed to  maintaining  a strong  capital base to support its  philosophy  of
soundness, profitability and growth.

         Regulatory  agencies  have  proposed  rules  through which a measure of
interest rate risk will be incorporated in the level of regulatory  capital that
an institution is required to maintain.  These rules are not yet finalized,  but
they  are  likely  to  become  effective  in  1995.   Management  believes  that
implementation  of the proposed rules will not have a significant  impact on the
Company's or the Banks' ability to satisfy regulatory capital requirements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Interest Income

         Taxable-equivalent  net interest income  increased $3.9 million or 3.1%
in 1994 as  compared  to 1993,  as the net  interest  margin  rose to 4.79% from
4.75%. A combination of factors contributed to this increase,  the components of
which are detailed in the following tables analyzing  changes in interest income
and expense.

         Loan  interest  income  increased  $8.9  million  or  11.8%  in 1994 as
compared to 1993.  Approximately  half of this increase was driven by the growth
in average loans outstanding  during 1994 with the other half driven by the rise
in the effective  yield on the Company's loan  portfolio.  Market interest rates
generally  rose  throughout  1994,  and bank prime  rates  increased  a full two
percentage  points during the year. The effective yield on the Company's average
loan  portfolio,  approximately  40% of which  reprices  with  changes in prime,
increased  69 basis  points in 1994 as  compared  to 1993.  The  increase in the
effective  yield was partly  influenced  by an  adjustment  recorded  in 1994 to
recognize  $2.6 million of  previously  collected but  unrecognized  interest on
loans  that had at times  in prior  years  been  accounted  for  under  the cost
recovery method.

         Interest income on investment  securities decreased  approximately $1.5
million or 1.6% in 1994 as compared to 1993,  despite an increase  between these
years in the average investment in securities  outstanding.  The effective yield
on the  investment  securities  portfolio is not as  immediately  responsive  to
rising market rates as are loan yields.  The  effective  yield was 5.75% in 1994
and 6.13% in 1993, a decrease which reflects the lingering impact of the falling
rate  environment  that had prevailed until earlier this year.  During 1994, the
overall effective investment yield registered small but steady increases.

         The net  increase in total  interest  income  between 1993 and 1994 was
$6.7 million or 3.9%.  This overall net increase was driven by the $62.2 million
growth in total average earning assets  outstanding in 1994 as compared to 1993.
The overall effective  earning-asset  yield in 1994 was 6.73%, an increase of 10
basis points from 6.63% in 1993.

         Interest expense  increased $2.9 million or 5.8% in 1994 as compared to
1993. This increase  reflects the impact of the rising rate  environment  during
1994 and a shift in the deposit mix toward core time  deposits  from other lower
cost deposit categories, a shift which is partly attributable to the Baton Rouge
acquisition.  The average  maturity of certificates of deposit  outstanding also
lengthened somewhat during 1994 as consumer deposit rates increased. The overall
cost of funds rate on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.74% in 1994 as compared
to 2.57% in 1993, an increase of 17 basis points.

Other Income and Expense

         Non-interest income,  adjusted to exclude gains on securities sales and
the net gain from  sales of OREO,  increased  $1.7  million,  or 6.1%,  to $29.0
million in 1994 from $27.3  million in 1993.  This  followed an increase of $1.5
million or 5.8% from 1992 to 1993.

         Income from service  charges on deposit  accounts,  which accounted for
approximately 57% of adjusted  non-interest income in each of these three years,
increased 4.5% between 1993 and 1994, largely reflecting the impact of the Baton
Rouge  acquisition.  Improvement in the economy of the Company's service area in
1994 was evident in higher  credit  transaction  volume which  supported a 14.5%
increase  over 1993 in income  from  credit card  related  operations.  Improved
economic conditions and enhanced products and delivery systems helped generate a
23.5%  increase in 1994 income from  services  which  support the  international
activities of the Company's customers.

         The rise in market interest rates throughout 1994 stimulated demand for
the services of the Company's investment department, leading to a 27.5% increase
over 1993 in  investment  service fee  income.  Higher  interest  rates in 1994,
however,  also had the effect of  reducing  the volume of  activity  in, and the
income from,  the Company's  secondary  mortgage loan  operations as compared to
1993.  Secondary market income, which is included with other fees and charges in
the accompanying table of non-interest income,  decreased 43.7% or approximately
$300  thousand.  The  Company  expanded  its ATM  facilities  in 1994  and  fees
generated  from ATM  operations,  which are also  included  with  other fees and
charges, increased 180% or approximately $450 thousand over 1993.

         In 1994, the Company sold certain  held-to-maturity  securities shortly
before  they  were  scheduled  to  mature  and  recognized  a small  gain of $46
thousand. There were no sales from the investment securities portfolios in 1993.
In 1992,  the Company  recognized  a $5.4 million gain on the sale of a block of
mortgage-backed securities that was experiencing excessive prepayments as market
interest  rates  declined.  This block of  securities  was replaced with another
offering a more stable return.

         Non-interest operating expenses,  adjusted to exclude provisions for or
recoveries of losses on OREO and other problem  assets,  were $105.3  million in
1994, an increase of $7.1 million or 7.2%,  over 1993's total of $98.2  million.
Between 1992 and 1993, the increase in adjusted non-interest  operating expenses
was $1.4 million or 1.4%.

         As is shown in the accompanying table of non-interest expense, salaries
and  benefits  expense in 1994  increased  $5.5  million or 11.3% as compared to
1993.  Approximately  25% of this  increase can be attributed to the new banking
operations  in  Baton  Rouge   acquired  in  the  first  quarter  of  1994.  The
implementation  of a 401(k) employee  savings plan in the fourth quarter of 1993
contributed  another 12% to the overall  increase in personnel  expense in 1994.
The remainder of the 1994 increase resulted from merit pay increases and various
employee and management incentives as well as from essential staff additions and
changes.

         Excluding  personnel-related  expenses,  the  Baton  Rouge  acquisition
increased 1994 non-interest  expense by a total of approximately $1.4 million as
compared to 1993, with the increase concentrated  primarily in occupancy expense
and the  amortization of intangible  assets.  Enhancements to the Company's data
processing systems and automation  capabilities in 1994 as well as the expansion
of the ATM network contributed to an 18.7% increase over 1993 in the expense for
furnishings  and equipment.  The increase in credit card  operating  expense for
1994 is  consistent  with the  increase  in  income  from  these  operations  as
discussed above.

         The 59.0% increase in 1994's expense for taxes and insurance is almost
entirely a consequence of the improved earnings and equity of the Louisiana Bank
which are used to  compute  the  assessment  base for  certain  state ad valorem
taxes. The continued improvement in asset quality was an important factor in the
25.0% reduction in 1994's expense for legal and other professional  services and
the 14.5%  reduction in the expense of maintaining and operating OREO properties
prior to sale.  During  1994,  the Company  also  recovered  approximately  $1.1
million previously identified valuation losses on OREO.

Income Taxes

         The Company  provided for income taxes at an overall  effective rate of
32.4% in 1994,  up from the  32.0%  rate in 1993.  The  effective  rates in each
period  differ  from the  statutory  rate of 35%  primarily  because of the tax-
exempt income earned on investments in state and municipal obligations.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

         The asset/liability management process has as its focus the development
and  implementation of strategies in the funding and deployment of the Company's
financial  resources which are expected to maximize  soundness and profitability
over time.  Such  strategies  reflect  the goals set by the  Company for capital
adequacy  and  liquidity,  and the  tolerance  for risk  established  in Company
policies.

Interest Rate Risk/Interest Rate Sensitivity

         The  Company's  and the Banks'  financial  assets and  liabilities  are
subject to scheduled and  unscheduled  repricing  opportunities  over time.  The
potential for  generating  net interest  income,  as well as the current  market
values of financial assets and liabilities,  are related to the levels of market
interest rates available as these repricing  opportunities arise.  Interest rate
risk is a measure of this potential volatility in net interest income and market
values.

         As part of the asset/liability  management process, the Company and the
Banks use a variety of tools, including an earnings simulation model, to measure
interest  rate risk and to  evaluate  the  impact  of  proposed  changes  in its
internal  strategies  and  potential  changes in its economic  environment.  The
interest rate  sensitivity gap analysis,  which compares the volume of repricing
assets  against  repricing  liabilities  over time, is a relatively  simple tool
which  is  useful  in  highlighting   significant  short-term  repricing  volume
mismatches but is limited in measuring the potential impact of dynamic change on
earnings and net asset values.

         The interest rate  sensitivity  table presents the rate sensitivity gap
analysis at December 31, 1994.  The  interest  rates on most of the  outstanding
commercial  loans vary with changes in the Banks' prime rates or the prime rates
of  certain  money-center  banks.  These  loans  are  assigned  to the  earliest
repricing  period in the rate  sensitivity  analysis.  A substantial  portion of
loans shown in the analysis as repricing after one year is made up of fixed-rate
real estate loans,  both retail and  commercial.  These loans  generally  mature
within five years.  In preparing this analysis,  deposit funding sources with no
scheduled  maturity or  contractual  repricing date are assigned to a particular
repricing period after  consideration of past and expected  customer behavior in
response to general market rate changes.  Surveying the twelve-month period from
December 31,  1994,  the  analysis  indicates  that the Company is in a slightly
liability-sensitive position on a cumulative basis.

Liquidity

         The Company and the Banks manage  liquidity to ensure their  ability to
satisfy  customer  demand  for  credit,  to fund  deposit  withdrawals,  to meet
operating and other corporate  obligations,  and to take advantage of investment
opportunities,  all in a timely and cost-effective manner. Traditionally,  these
liquidity  needs have been met by maintaining a strong base of core deposits and
by carefully  managing the maturity structure of the investment  portfolio.  The
funds provided by current  operations and forecasts of loan  repayments are also
considered in the liquidity management process.

         The  Banks  may  enter  into  short-term   borrowing   arrangements  by
purchasing  federal funds and selling  securities under  repurchase  agreements,
both as a source of funding for certain  short-term  lending  facilities  and as
part of services to correspondent banks and certain other customers. Neither the
Company nor the Banks have accessed  long-term debt markets as part of liquidity
management.

         Average core deposits, defined as all deposits other than time deposits
of $100,000 or more, increased  approximately $32 million in 1994 over the prior
year.  During both 1994 and 1993, core deposits  comprised  approximately 90% of
total average deposits.

         As of December  31,  1994,  $283  million or  approximately  20% of the
portfolio of  investment  securities  held to maturity  was  scheduled to mature
within one year.  An  additional  $137  million  of  investment  securities  are
classified  as  available  for  sale at year  end  1994,  although  management's
determination  of this  classification  does not derive primarily from liquidity
considerations.

         The  Louisiana  Bank had $582  million  in  unfunded  loan  commitments
outstanding  at December 31, 1994, an increase of $183 million from the level at
December 31, 1993. Contingent  obligations under letters of credit and financial
guarantees of $72 million and available credit card lines of $29 million at year
end 1994 were up approximately  $15 million and $3 million,  respectively,  from
the amounts  outstanding at year end 1993.  Customer draws under these financial
commitments are not expected to place any unusual strain on the Louisiana Bank's
or the Company's liquidity positions.

                      Notes To Financial Statements

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The accounting and reporting  policies of Whitney  Holding  Corporation
and its  subsidiaries  (the  "Company")  follow  generally  accepted  accounting
principles and policies within the banking industry.  The following is a summary
of the more significant policies.

CONSOLIDATION

         The  consolidated  financial  statements  of the  Company  include  the
accounts  of Whitney  Holding  Corporation  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,
Whitney  National  Bank (the  "Louisiana  Bank") and, in 1994,  Whitney  Bank of
Alabama  (the  "Alabama  Bank").  Whitney  Bank of  Alabama  had  not  commenced
significant  operations  as of December  31,  1994.  Intercompany  accounts  and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

         Certain balances in prior years have been  reclassified to conform with
this year's presentation.

CASH AND DUE FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

         The Company considers cash and cash due from financial  institutions as
cash and cash  equivalents  for purposes of the  consolidated  statement of cash
flows.

INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

         In May, 1993, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,  "Accounting for
Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities."  Under SFAS No. 115, debt
securities which the Company both positively intends and has the ability to hold
to maturity are carried at amortized  cost.  These  criteria are not  considered
satisfied  when a security  is  available  to be sold in  response to changes in
interest rates, prepayment rates, liquidity needs or other reasons as part of an
overall asset/liability management strategy.

         Debt securities and equity  securities with readily  determinable  fair
values that are acquired with the intention of being resold in the near term are
classified  under  SFAS No. 115 as trading  securities  and are  carried at fair
value, with unrealized  holding gains and losses recognized in current earnings.
The Company does not currently hold any securities for trading purposes.

         Securities  not meeting the criteria of either  trading  securities  or
securities  held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at
fair  value.  Unrealized  holding  gains and  losses  for these  securities  are
recognized, net of related tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.

         The Company  adopted this  standard  effective  December 31, 1993. As a
result,  investments in mortgage-backed  securities were reclassified as of that
date as securities  available for sale and are being reported at fair value.  In
accordance  with SFAS No. 115, prior period  financial  statements have not been
restated to reflect this change in accounting principle.

         Interest  and  dividend  income  earned on  securities  either  held to
maturity or available  for sale is included in current  earnings,  including the
amortization  of premiums  and the  accretion  of  discounts  using the interest
method.  The gain or loss realized on the sale of a security held to maturity or
available for sale is computed with  reference to its amortized cost and is also
included in current earnings.

LOANS

         Loans are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding,  less
unearned income and the reserve for possible loan losses.

         Interest  on loans is  accrued  and  credited  to  income  based on the
outstanding  loan  principal  amounts.  The  accrual  of  interest  on  loans is
discontinued  when, in  management's  judgment,  there is an  indication  that a
borrower  will be unable to meet  contractual  payments as they become due.  For
commercial  and real  estate  loans,  this  generally  occurs  when a loan falls
90-days past due as to principal or interest, and the loan is not otherwise both
well secured and in the process of collection. Upon discontinuance,  accrued but
uncollected  interest is reversed  against  current  income.  Interest  payments
received on  nonaccrual  loans are used to reduce the  reported  loan  principal
under  the  cost  recovery  method  when  the  collectibility  of the  remaining
principal is not reasonably assured; otherwise, these payments are recognized as
interest income.
                                 Page 27 of 56


<PAGE>
         A nonaccrual loan may be reinstated to accrual status when full payment
of  contractual  principal  and  interest is expected  and this  expectation  is
supported by current performance.

RESERVE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES

         The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a level which, in
management's  judgment,  is  considered  adequate  to  absorb  potential  losses
inherent in the loan  portfolio.  The  adequacy of the reserve is  evaluated  by
management on an ongoing basis.  As adjustments to the level of reserves  become
necessary, they are reported in current earnings. The factors considered in this
evaluation   include   estimated   potential   losses  from   specific   lending
relationships,  including unused loan commitments and credit guarantees; general
economic conditions; economic conditions affecting specific classes of borrowers
or types of loan collateral;  historical loss experience;  and various trends in
loan  portfolio  characteristics,   such  as  volume,  maturity,  customer  mix,
delinquencies and nonaccruals.

         As actual  loan  losses are  incurred,  they are  charged  against  the
reserve.  Recoveries  on loans  previously  charged  off are  added  back to the
reserve.

         In 1995,  the  Company  will adopt SFAS No. 114, as amended by SFAS No.
118,  which  addresses the  accounting  by creditors  for  impairment of certain
loans. The Company's  reserve for possible loan losses will include a measure of
impairment  related  to those  loans  identified  for  evaluation  under the new
standard.  This  measurement  will be  based  on a  comparison  of the  recorded
investment in the loan with either the expected cash flows  discounted using the
loan's   original   effective   interest   rate  or,  in  the  case  of  certain
collateral-dependent  loans,  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  collateral.
Adoption  of this  standard  will not have a  material  impact on the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.

FORECLOSED ASSETS

         Collateral  acquired  through  foreclosure or in settlement of loans is
classified  as either  other real estate  owned  ("OREO") or other assets and is
carried at its fair value,  net of  estimated  costs to sell,  or the  remaining
investment in the loan,  whichever is lower. At  acquisition,  any excess of the
recorded loan value over the estimated  fair value of the  collateral is charged
against the  allowance for possible loan losses.  After  acquisition,  valuation
allowances  are  established  with a charge to  current  earnings  to adjust the
reported  value of  foreclosed  assets to reflect  changes in the  estimate of a
property's  fair value or selling costs.  Revenues and expenses  associated with
the  management  of  foreclosed  assets  prior to sale are  included  in current
earnings.

BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

         Bank  premises and equipment  are carried at cost,  net of  accumulated
depreciation, as follows (in thousands):

                                            =========================
</TABLE>

         Accumulated  depreciation  was  $63,528,000 in 1994 and  $57,408,000 in
1993.  Provisions  for  depreciation  included  in  non-interest  expenses  were
computed  primarily on the straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives
of the  assets.  Estimated  useful  lives  range  mainly from 15 to 45 years for
buildings and from 3 to 7 years for furnishings and equipment.

INCOME TAXES

         Effective   January  1,  1993,  the  Company   adopted  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." In general,  under this accounting standard,  the
tax  consequences of all temporary  differences that arise between the tax bases
of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial  statements
represent  either tax liabilities to be settled in the future or tax assets that
will be realized  as a reduction  of future  taxes.  The change in net  deferred
assets or liabilities between periods is recognized as a deferred tax expense or
benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.

         Prior to 1993,  a deferred tax expense or benefit was provided on those
items of income and expense which were  recognized in different time periods for
financial  statement  and income tax  purposes.  See Note 4 for a more  detailed
discussion of the  accounting for income taxes and of the impact of the adoption
of SFAS No. 109 in 1993.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

         Earnings per share is calculated  using the weighted  average number of
shares  outstanding  during each period presented.  Potentially  dilutive common
stock  equivalents  consist of stock  options which have been granted to certain
officers and directors.  Incorporating  these common stock  equivalents into the
calculation of earnings per share using the treasury  method does not materially
affect the reported results whether on a primary or fully-diluted basis.

         As  discussed  in Note 1, the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 115  effective
December 31, 1993. As a result,  investments in mortgage-backed  securities were
reclassified  as of that  date as  securities  available  for sale and are being
reported at fair value.

         At December 31, 1994 and 1993, U.S. Treasury and agency securities with
a carrying value of $508,725,000 and $477,904,000, respectively, were pledged to
secure public and trust deposits or were sold under repurchase agreements.

         During 1994, the Company sold certain securities  classified as held to
maturity  and  recognized  a gain of  $46,000.  The  proceeds  from these  sales
totalled $25,066,000.  All of these sales occurred shortly before the securities
were to mature. There were no sales from the securities  portfolios during 1993.
Proceeds from sales of investment  securities during 1992 were $150,120,000.  In
1992,  the  Company  sold  a  block  of  mortgage-backed   securities  that  was
experiencing  excessive  early payoffs  because of declining  mortgage rates and
replaced  it with a block of  mortgage-backed  securities  that  offered  a more
stable  return.  The  Company  realized  a  $5,400,000  gain as a result of this
transaction.

         The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt  securities held to
maturity at December 31, 1994 are shown below by  contractual  maturity.  Actual
maturities may differ from contractual  maturities  because certain issuers have
the right to call or  prepay  obligations  with or  without  call or  prepayment
penalties.

</TABLE>
         The  Company's  lending  activity,   both  commercial  and  retail,  is
conducted  primarily  among  customers in  Louisiana,  Mississippi  and southern
Alabama.  In its market  areas,  the Company  serves a broad base of  commercial
customers in diverse industries.

         Within the portfolio,  the Company  maintains a relatively  significant
concentration of outstanding  credits and loan commitments to customers involved
in the oil and gas  industry.  At December 31, 1994,  outstanding  loans to this
industry totalled $86,141,000, and unused loan commitments and letters of credit
and guarantees were $59,395,000 and $14,641,000, respectively. The operations of
this  industry have  stabilized  in recent  years,  following a period of severe
decline and major restructuring which had adversely impacted the overall economy
of the  Company's  market  area.  Management  continues  to closely  monitor its
lending relationships in this industry.

         The total of  commercial  and  other  real  estate  loans  shown  above
includes  both those for which the primary  source of repayment is the operation
or sale of the  underlying  project,  as well as those  secured  by real  estate
otherwise employed in the operations of the customer.  Unfunded  commitments for
loans secured by commercial  or other real estate were  otherwise  $6,204,000 at
December 31, 1994. Real estate values had declined  steeply during the period of
economic  contraction  in the Company's  market area, but have in recent periods
stabilized and registered  increases.  The Company's portfolio of commercial and
other  real  estate  loans is  diversified  as to both the  types of  collateral
property and the industries in which the properties are employed.

         Loans on which the accrual of interest had been  discontinued  totalled
$15,396,000  and $33,631,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  With
respect to certain  nonaccrual  loans,  interest  income is  recognized  as cash
interest  payments are received.  Interest payments on nonaccrual loans that had
been  accounted  for under the cost  recovery  method may also  subsequently  be
recognized as interest income as loan collections  exceed previous  expectations
or as workout  efforts  result in fully  rehabilitated  credits.  The  following
compares  contractual  interest  income on  nonaccrual  loans with the  interest
income reported with respect to such loans (in thousands):

</TABLE>

         During 1994, the Company recorded an adjustment to recognize $2,612,000
of previously collected but unrecognized  interest on loans that had at times in
prior  years  been  accounted  for  under  the  cost  recovery  method.  Through
management's continuing review of the Louisiana Bank's loan portfolios to ensure
compliance  with internal  policies,  it was  determined  that the cost recovery
method  had not  been  warranted  for  these  loans.  No  portion  of the  total
adjustment related to a particular prior period was material.

         The Louisiana Bank has made loans, in the normal course of business, to
certain directors and executive  officers of the Company and to their associates
(related  parties).  The  aggregate  amount of these loans was  $31,591,000  and
$31,341,000  at  December  31,  1994  and  1993,   respectively.   During  1994,
$147,353,000   of  new  loan  advances  were  made,  and   repayments   totalled
$147,603,000.  Outstanding  commitments and letters of credit to related parties
totaled $37,734,000 and $39,517,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates  and  collateral,   as  those   prevailing  at  the  time  for  comparable
transactions  with  unrelated  persons,  and do not involve more than the normal
risk of collectibility.

         Changes in the reserve for possible  loan losses for the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1994 were as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

         During 1994, the Company recovered  approximately  $6,139,000 on a loan
previously charged off and, with the continued  improvement in credit quality in
recent years, was able to transfer this recovery to income.  Total reductions in
the reserve for  possible  loan  losses,  including  the  transfer of this large
recovery,  were  $26,139,000  in 1994 and  $60,000,000  in 1993,  reflecting the
improvement in overall asset quality and management's determination that efforts
to deal with asset quality  issues have yielded  lasting  positive  results.  In
management's  judgement,  some of the reserve levels  established  previously in
recognition of these asset quality issues were no longer needed.

</TABLE>
         Effective   January  1,  1993,  the  Company   adopted  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting  for Income Taxes." Under this standard the tax  consequences of all
temporary  differences  between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements represent either tax liabilities to
be settled in the future or tax assets that will be  realized as a reduction  of
future taxes. Among other provisions, SFAS No. 109 requires the use of currently
enacted tax rates to measure  these  deferred  tax assets and  liabilities.  The
impact of any change in the enacted tax rates is  included in the  deferred  tax
expense or benefit  recognized  in the  period in which the change  occurs.  The
change in the net deferred tax asset or liability between periods represents the
deferred tax expense or benefit to be recognized  in the  financial  statements.
With the  adoption of SFAS No. 109, the Company  recognized  an  additional  net
deferred asset of $4,574,000, which is reported in the consolidated statement of
operations for 1993 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change (Note 6).

         Net deferred  income tax assets,  which are included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheets, were approximately  $17,181,000 and $19,046,000
at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The components of the net deferred
tax assets were as follows (in thousands):

         Under SFAS No. 109,  the  Company is required to  establish a valuation
allowance  against the deferred tax assets if, based on all available  evidence,
it is more likely  than not that some or all of the asset will not be  realized.
Management has weighed the evidence,  including  current  earnings  performance,
taxable income generated during available  carryback periods,  and the nature of
significant  deductible  temporary  differences,  and believes that no valuation
reserve is required as of December 31, 1994. Rules issued by regulatory agencies
impose  additional  limitations on the amount of deferred tax assets that may be
recognized  when  calculating  regulatory  capital  ratios.  The Company's ratio
calculations were not affected by these rules at December 31, 1994.

         For years ending before January 1, 1993, deferred tax expense (benefit)
resulted from timing  differences in the  recognition of revenue and expense for
income tax and financial  statement  purposes.  For the year ended  December 31,
1992, the most significant  timing  difference was the excess of interest income
recognized for tax purposes over the amount  recognized for financial  statement
purposes.  The  sources of timing  differences  and the tax effects for the year
ended December 31, 1992 is summarized as follows (in thousands):

(5) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement Plans

         The Company has a  noncontributory  qualified  defined  benefit pension
plan covering  substantially all of its employees.  The benefits are based on an
employee's  total  years of service and his or her  highest  five-year  level of
compensation during the final ten years of employment. Contributions are made in
amounts  sufficient to meet funding  requirements  set forth in federal employee
benefit and tax laws plus such  additional  amounts as the Company may determine
to be appropriate from time to time.

         The actuarial present value of vested and of total accumulated  benefit
obligations (both excluding  projected future increases in compensation  levels)
were  $32,361,000 and  $35,306,000,  respectively,  as of December 31, 1994, and
$34,012,000 and $37,375,000, respectively, as of December 31, 1993.

         The  following  table sets forth the plan's  funded  status and amounts
recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements (in thousands):

</TABLE>

         The weighted  average  discount rate used in determining  the actuarial
present value of the projected  benefit  obligation  was 8.25% in 1994,  7.5% in
1993 and 8.0% in 1992. For all periods  presented,  the Company  assumed an 8.0%
expected  long-term rate of return on plan assets and an annual rate of increase
in future  compensation  levels of 5.0%. The decrease in the benefit obligations
between year end 1993 and 1994 reflects both  actuarial  gains related mainly to
the  composition  of the  employee  base and the impact of the  increase  in the
discount rate used to determine actuarial values.

         For certain  participants  in the qualified  defined benefit plan whose
calculated  benefits are reduced as a result of  limitations  under  federal tax
laws,  the  Company  sponsored  an  unfunded  non-qualified  plan that  provides
benefits equal to those reductions.  The non-qualified plan has been terminated,
effective  as  of  January  1,  1993,  with  accrued   benefits   preserved  for
participants. The Company intends to replace the non-qualified plan with another
form of supplemental executive retirement plan.

         Effective  October 1, 1993, the Company  converted its  noncontributory
employee  thrift plan into an employee  savings plan under Section 401(k) of the
Internal  Revenue  Code.  Under the new plan,  which  covers  substantially  all
full-time  employees,  the Company will match the savings of each participant up
to 3.0% of his or her compensation.  Annual  participant  savings are limited by
tax law.  Participants  are fully  vested in their  savings and in the  matching
Company  contributions  at all  times.  The  expense of the  Company's  matching
contributions was approximately $922,000 in 1994 and $245,000 in 1993. There had
been no Company  contributions  to the  noncontributory  thrift  plan in 1993 or
1992.

Health and Welfare Plans

         The Company  also  maintains  certain  health  care and life  insurance
benefit  plans  for  retirees  and  their   eligible   dependents.   Participant
contributions   are  required  under  the  health  plan,  and  the  Company  has
established  annual and lifetime  maximum health care benefit limits.  Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for
Postretirement  Benefits Other than Pensions." This statement  requires that the
expected cost of providing these  postretirement  benefits be recognized  during
the period employees are actively working. Prior to 1993, the Company recognized
the cost only as benefit  payments  were made to or on behalf of  retirees.  The
Company continues to fund its obligations under the postretirement benefit plans
as the benefit payments are made.

         Upon  adoption of SFAS No.  106,  the  Company  elected to  immediately
recognize the accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation of $5,963,000.  The
expense related to the  recognition of this transition  obligation was reported,
net of  income  tax  effects  of  $2,023,000,  as  the  cumulative  effect  of a
accounting change in 1993 in the consolidated statements of operations (Note 6).

         At December 31, 1994, the net postretirement benefit liability reported
with other  liabilities in the  consolidated  balance  sheets was  approximately
$6,702,000.  The net periodic  postretirement  benefit expense  recognized under
SFAS No. 106 for 1994 and 1993 was  $300,000  and  $450,000,  respectively.  The
benefit  expense  includes  components  for the portion of the expected  benefit
obligation  attributed  to current  service,  for  interest  on the  accumulated
benefit  obligation,  and for  amortization of  unrecognized  actuarial gains or
losses. The expense recognized is not materially different from that which would
have been reported under the previous accounting method.

         For the actuarial calculation of its postretirement benefit obligations
at December  31,  1994 and 1993,  the Company  assumed  annual  health care cost
increases beginning at 12% and decreasing 0.6% per year to a 5.5% rate. Discount
rates of 8.25% in 1994 and 7.5% in 1993 were  used in  determining  the  present
value of projected  benefits.  A 1.0% rise in the assumed health care cost trend
rates would not  materially  impact the  accumulated  benefit  obligation or the
periodic net benefit expense.

         The  FASB  has  issued  SFAS  No.  112,   "Employers'   Accounting  for
Postemployment  Benefits," which was effective  January 1, 1994.  Postemployment
benefits  are those  provided  to  former or  inactive  employees  after  active
employment but before  retirement.  Given the current  structure of such benefit
programs  offered by the Company,  application of this accounting  standard does
not have a significant impact on the Company's  financial position or results of
operations.

Incentive and Other Plans

         The Company has a long-term  incentive  program for which all employees
are  eligible.  As of December 31, 1994,  384,125  shares of treasury  stock are
reserved for the purposes of this  program,  which include the granting of stock
options,  restricted  stock,  and  performance  and phantom  stock.  The Company
granted 50,100 shares of restricted  stock to certain  employees during 1994 for
no cash  consideration.  During 1993 and 1992,  restricted stock grants totalled
36,000 and  37,125  shares,  respectively.  Employees  receiving  the grants are
restricted from transferring or otherwise  disposing of the stock for five years
from the date of grant. The market values of the restricted  shares,  determined
as of the grant dates, were $1,357,000, $699,000 and $491,000, respectively, for
1994, 1993 and 1992.  These amounts are being amortized as compensation  expense
over the five year restriction  periods.  Compensation expense recognized during
1994,  1993 and 1992  related to these stock grants was  $340,000,  $168,000 and
$49,000, respectively.

         The  following  table   summarizes  stock  option  activity  under  the
long-term incentive program for employees for the three years ended December 31,
1994. The incentive and  non-qualified  options are fully exercisable six months
after the date of grant.

         On February  28,  1990,  an  executive  officer was granted  options to
purchase  33,750  shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $18.11 per
share through February 28, 2000. At December 31, 1994, none of these options had
been exercised.  If this officer terminates his employment with the Company, the
options will be exercisable  for six months after his date of  termination.  The
options will also be exercisable up to one year past the date of his death,  but
in no event beyond February 28, 2000.

         During 1994, the Company adopted a revised Directors' Compensation Plan
which  provides  for,  among other  matters,  the annual  award of 150 shares of
common  stock and the annual  grant of  nonqualified  options to purchase  1,000
shares of common stock to each director who is not an employee of the Company or
its subsidiaries.  As of December 31, 1994, options to purchase 12,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $26.25, the market price or the grant date,
were  outstanding.  No options were exercised in 1994. An expense of $47,000 was
recognized in 1994 in connection with the award of stock under this plan.

         Other  real  estate  owned  ("OREO")  is  comprised  of  real  property
collateral  acquired  through  foreclosure or in settlement of loans and surplus
banking OREO property.  With the exception of the pre-1933 properties  discussed
below,  these  properties  are  reported  at their  fair  value,  less  expected
disposition costs, or the recorded investment in the related loan,  whichever is
lower.  Activity in the OREO valuation reserve for the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994 was as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>
         OREO  includes  a variety of  property  interests  which were  acquired
though routine banking transactions  generally prior to 1933 and for which there
existed no ready  market.  These  were  subsequently  written  down to a nominal
holding value in accordance  with general banking  practice at that time.  These
property  interests  include a few  commercial  and  residential  site locations
principally  in  the  New  Orleans  area,   ownership   interests  in  scattered
undeveloped acreage, and various mineral interests.  Revenues derived from these
interests and related  expenses have not been  significant  over the  three-year
period ended December 31, 1994.

         Not  included  in OREO are real  estate  interests  evidenced  by stock
ownership.  Such stock is carried as an investment  in securities  and dividends
are recognized as investment income.

(11) ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The following disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 107,  "Disclosures  about Fair
Value of Financial  Instruments."  In cases where quoted  market  prices are not
available,  fair  values  have  been  estimated  using  present  value  or other
valuation  techniques.  The results of these  techniques are highly sensitive to
the assumptions  used, such as those concerning  appropriate  discount rates and
estimates  of  future  cash  flows,   which  require   considerable   judgement.
Accordingly,  estimates  presented herein are not necessarily  indicative of the
amounts the Company  could  realize in a current  settlement  of the  underlying
financial  instruments.  SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and
all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. These disclosures
should not be interpreted as representing an aggregate measure of the underlying
value of the Company.

         The Company  does not  maintain  any  investment  or  participation  in
financial  instruments or agreements  whose value is linked to, or derived from,
changes in the value of some  underlying  asset or index.  Such  instruments  or
agreements include futures, forward contracts,  option contracts,  interest-rate
swap agreements,  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics,
and are commonly referred to as derivatives.

</TABLE>

         The  following  significant  methods and  assumptions  were used by the
Company in estimating the fair value of financial instruments.

Cash and short-term investments

         The carrying value of highly liquid instruments,  such as cash on hand,
interest-  and  non-interest-bearing  deposits in  financial  institutions,  and
federal funds sold, provides a reasonable estimate of their fair value.

Investment securities

         Substantially all of the Company's investment  securities are traded in
active markets.  Fair value  estimates for these  securities are based on quoted
market prices obtained from independent pricing services. The carrying amount of
accrued interest on securities approximates its fair value.

Loans, net

         For loans with rates that are repriced in  coordination  with movements
in market  rates and with no  significant  change in  credit  risk,  fair  value
estimates  are based on  carrying  values.  The fair  values for other loans are
estimated  through  discounted cash flow analysis,  using current rates at which
loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar  credit  quality.
Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect probable credit losses. The carrying
amount of accrued interest on loans approximates it fair value.

Deposits

         SFAS No. 107 specifies that the fair value of deposit  liabilities with
no defined  maturity is to be disclosed  as the amount  payable on demand at the
reporting date,  i.e., at their carrying or book value.  These  deposits,  which
include interest and non-interest  checking,  passbook savings, and money market
accounts,  represented  approximately 77% of total deposits at December 31, 1994
and  1993.  The fair  value of fixed  maturity  deposits  is  estimated  using a
discounted cash flow calculation  that applies rates currently  offered for time
deposits  of  similar  remaining  maturities.  The  carrying  amount of  accrued
interest payable on deposits approximates its fair value.

         The economic value attributable to the relationship with depositors who
provide  low-cost funds to the Company is viewed as a separate  intangible asset
and is excluded in SFAS No. 107 from the definition of a financial instrument.

Short-term borrowings

         The  carrying  amounts of federal  funds  purchased,  borrowings  under
repurchase agreements,  and other short-term borrowings,  approximate their fair
values.




                                 Page 40 of 56


<PAGE>
Off-balance-sheet instruments

         Off-balance-sheet  financial  instruments include commitments to extend
credit,  letters of credit,  and other financial  guarantees.  The fair value of
such  instruments  is  estimated  using  fees  currently   charged  for  similar
arrangements in the  marketplace,  adjusted for changes in terms and credit risk
as appropriate. The estimated fair value for these instruments was insignificant
at December 31, 1994 and 1993.


(12) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

         In order to meet the  financing  needs of its  customers,  the  Company
deals in financial  instruments that expose it to off-balance-sheet  risk. These
financial  instruments include commitments to extend credit,  letters of credit,
and other financial  guarantees.  Such instruments  involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount  recognized in
the statements of financial position.

         The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
other parties for  commitments  to extend credit and letters of credit and other
financial  guarantees  written is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments.  The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments
and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

</TABLE>

         Commitments  to extend  credit and credit card lines are  agreements to
make a loan to a  customer  as long as there is no  violation  of any  condition
established  in the commitment or credit card  contract.  Commitments  generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment
of a fee.  Since many of the  commitments  are expected to expire  without being
drawn  upon,  the  total  commitment  amount  outstanding  does not  necessarily
represent total future cash outlay requirements.

         The amount of collateral, if any, required by the Company upon issuance
of a commitment  is based on  management's  credit  evaluation  of the borrower.
Collateral  varies but may include  accounts  receivable,  inventory,  property,
plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.

         Letters of credit and  financial  guarantees  written  are  conditional
agreements issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party.  These agreements are primarily issued to support commercial trade.
Agreements  totalling  $10,051,000 at December 31, 1994 have original maturities
greater than one year. The credit risk involved in issuing  letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
The Company holds  marketable  securities as collateral to support those letters
of credit and guarantees for which  collateral is deemed  necessary.  Letters of
credit and  financial  guarantees  outstanding  at December  31, 1994 range from
unsecured to fully secured.

(13) REGULATORY MATTERS

         The  Banks  are  required  to  maintain   non-interest-bearing  reserve
balances with the Federal  Reserve Bank to fulfill  their reserve  requirements.
The average reserve balances  maintained were approximately  $42,731,000 in 1994
and $63,243,000 in 1993.

         Minimum  regulatory  capital  requirements  have been  established with
respect to banks and bank holding  companies,  expressed in terms of  regulatory
capital  ratios.  At December  31, 1994,  the  Company's  and the Banks'  ratios
satisfied all of the minimum capital requirements.

(14) MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

         On March  31,  1994,  the  Company  and the  Louisiana  Bank  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and  assumed  the  deposit  and  certain  other
liabilities  of Baton Rouge Bank and Trust  Company.  Included  in the  tangible
assets acquired, whose fair value totalled approximately $118,000,000, were cash
and cash items of $41,000,000,  investment  securities and federal funds sold of
$13,000,000,  and  $59,000,000 in commercial,  real estate mortgage and personal
loans,  as well as six banking  offices in the Baton Rouge  area.  The  deposits
assumed  included  approximately  $24,000,000  in  non-interest-bearing   demand
deposits  and  $94,000,000  in  interest-bearing  transaction,  savings and time
deposit  accounts.  The operating results from this acquisition are reflected in
the consolidated income statements beginning April 1, 1994.

         As  part  of  the  acquisition  price,  which  totalled   approximately
$9,000,000, Whitney Holding Corporation issued 90,909 shares of its common stock
with a value of $2,000,000.

         On  February   17,  1995,   the  Company,   through  its  newly  formed
state-chartered  banking  subsidiary,  Whitney  Bank of Alabama,  purchased  the
assets and assumed the deposit  liabilities of the five Mobile branch offices of
The Peoples  Bank,  Elba,  Alabama.  The assets  acquired and  deposits  assumed
totalled approximately $90,000,000, including $47,000,000 in loans. The purchase
price was approximately $12,000,000.

(15) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         The  Company  and  its   subsidiaries  are  parties  to  various  legal
proceedings  arising in the ordinary  course of business.  After  reviewing with
outside  legal  counsel  pending and  threatened  actions,  management is of the
opinion that the ultimate  resolution  of these actions will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

         Management also does not believe that compliance with existing federal,
state or local  environmental  laws and  regulations  will  impose any  material
financial obligation on the Company or materially affect the realizable value of
its assets.

         The Company  owns its own main  office  building as well as most of its
branch banking  facilities and has not entered into material  commitments  under
non-cancelable   leases  for  facilities  or  equipment.   The  defined  benefit
retirement plan is  sufficiently  funded on an actuarial basis so as not to have
required  an  additional  contribution  by  the  Company  during  1994.  Current
projections do not indicate that a contribution will be required for 1995.

        MANAGEMENT REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

         The management of Whitney  Holding  Corporation is responsible  for the
preparation  of the  financial  statements,  related  financial  data and  other
information  in this annual  report.  The financial  statements  are prepared in
accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and include amounts
based on  management's  estimates and  judgement  where  appropriate.  Financial
information  appearing  throughout  this annual  report is  consistent  with the
financial statements.

         The Company's financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP,  independent  public  accountants.  Management has made available to Arthur
Andersen LLP all of the Company's financial records and related data, as well as
the minutes of shareholders' and directors'  meetings.  Furthermore,  management
believes that all  representations  made to Arthur Andersen LLP during its audit
were valid and appropriate.

         Management  of the Company has  established  and  maintains a system of
internal  control that  provides  reasonable  assurance as to the  integrity and
reliability  of  the  financial  statements,   the  protection  of  assets  from
unauthorized use or disposition,  and the prevention and detection of fraudulent
financial  reporting.  The system of internal  control  provides for appropriate
division of responsibility  and is documented by written policies and procedures
that are  communicated  to employees  with  significant  roles in the  financial
reporting process and updated as necessary.  Management continually monitors the
system of  internal  control  for  compliance.  The  Company  maintains a strong
internal control auditing program that independently  assesses the effectiveness
of the internal controls and recommends possible  improvements  thereto. As part
of their audit of the Company's 1994 financial  statements,  Arthur Andersen LLP
considered  the Company's  system of internal  control to the extent they deemed
necessary  to  determine  the nature,  timing and extent of their  audit  tests.
Management  has  considered  the  recommendations  of the internal  auditors and
Arthur Andersen LLP concerning the Company's  system of internal control and has
taken  actions  that it believes  are  cost-effective  in the  circumstances  to
respond appropriately to these recommendations.  Management believes that, as of
December  31,  1994,  the  Company's  system of internal  control is adequate to
accomplish the objectives discussed herein.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WHITNEY HOLDING CORPORATION:
         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whitney
Holding  Corporation (a Louisiana  corporation)  and subsidiaries as of December
31,  1994 and 1993,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
shareholders'  equity and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1994. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred to above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whitney
Holding  Corporation and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
results  of its  operations  and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the
period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

         As discussed in notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective  January 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its methods of accounting  for
income taxes and for post retirement benefits other than pensions.  As discussed
in notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated  financial  statements,  effective December
31, 1993, the Company  changed its method of accounting for certain  investments
in debt and equity securities.

                                                             
New Orleans, Louisiana                                       Arthur Andersen LLP

which the date is February 17, 1995)

Exhibit 10.8
                          WHITNEY HOLDING CORPORATION
                                     AND
                             WHITNEY NATIONAL BANK

                              EXECUTIVE AGREEMENT
                    ----------------------------------------

         THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made by and between WHITNEY HOLDING
CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Louisiana  (the  "Holding  Corporation"),  WHITNEY  NATIONAL  BANK,  a financial
institution  organized  and  existing  under the laws of the United  States (the
"Bank"), and JOHN C. HOPE, III (the "Executive").

        WHEREAS,  the  Executive  is  presently  employed by each of the Holding
Corporation and the Bank as a EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.

        NOW, THEREFORE, effective October 28, 1994, the Holding Corporation, the
Bank and the Executive agree as follows:

                                  SECTION I
                              -----------------
                                 DEFINITIONS
                            ---------------------

        1.1     "Change in Duties" means the occurrence of one of the following
                events in connection with a Change in Control:

        a.      A  diminution  in  the  nature  or  scope  of  the   Executive's
                authorities    or   duties,    a   change   in   his   reporting
                responsibilities or titles or the assignment of the Executive to
                any duties or  responsibilities  that are inconsistent  with his
                position,   duties,   responsibilities   or  status  immediately
                preceding such assignment;

        b.      A reduction in the Executive's  compensation  during the Covered
                Period. For this purpose,  "compensation"  means the fair market
                value of all remuneration  paid to the Executive by the Employer
                during  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year,  including,
                without  limitation,  deferred  compensation,  stock options and
                other forms of incentive compensation awards, coverage under any
                employee  benefit  plan  (such as a  pension,  thrift,  medical,
                dental,  life insurance or long-term  disability plan) and other
                perquisites;

        c.      The transfer of the Executive to a location requiring a change
                in his residence or a material increase in the amount of travel
                ordinarily required of the Executive in the performance of his
                duties; or

        d.      A good faith  determination  by the Executive that his position,
                duties,  responsibilities  or status has been affected,  whether
                directly  or  indirectly,  in any  manner  which  prohibits  the
                effective discharge of any such duties or responsibilities.

        1.2     "Change in Control" means and shall be deemed to have occurred
                if:

        a.      Any "person,"  including  any "group,"  determined in accordance
                with Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                amended,  becomes the beneficial owner,  directly or indirectly,
                of securities  of the Holding  Corporation  representing  20% or
                more of the combined  voting power of the Holding  Corporation's
                then    outstanding    securities,    without   the    approval,
                recommendation,  or  support  of the Board of  Directors  of the
                Holding  Corporation  as constituted  immediately  prior to such
                acquisition;








                                 Page 50 of 56
<PAGE>
        b.      The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
                regulatory agency negotiates and implements a plan for the
                merger, transfer of assets and liabilities, reorganization,
                and/or liquidation of the Bank;

        c.      Either of the Holding Corporation or the Bank is merged into 
                another corporate entity or consolidated with one or more
                corporations, other than a wholly- owned subsidiary of the
                Holding Corporation;

        d.      A change in the members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
                Corporation  which results in the exclusion of a majority of the
                "continuing  board."  For this  purpose,  the  term  "continuing
                board"  means  the  members  of the  Board of  Directors  of the
                Holding  Corporation,  determined  as of the date on which  this
                Agreement is executed and  subsequent  members of such board who
                are  elected by or on the  recommendation  of a majority of such
                "continuing board"; or

        e.      The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
                stock or the assets of the Bank or the Holding Corporation (or
                any successor corporation thereto).

        1.3     "Company" means the Holding Corporation and the Bank.


        1.4 "Covered Period" means the one-year period immediately preceding and
the  three-year  period  immediately  following  the  occurrence  of a Change in
Control.

        1.5     "Employer" means the Holding Corporation or the Bank or both, as
the case may be.

        1.6 "Severance  Amount" means 300% of the Executive's  "annual  salary."
For this purpose,  "annual salary" means the average of all compensation paid to
the Executive by the Company which is includable in the Executive's gross income
for the highest 3 of the 5 calendar  years  immediately  preceding  the calendar
year  in  which  a  Change  in  Control  occurs,  including  the  amount  of any
compensation  which the Executive elected to defer under any plan or arrangement
of the Company with respect to such years.  If the  Executive  has been employed
less  than 5 years  prior to the  calendar  year in which a  Change  in  Control
occurs,  "annual salary" shall be determined by averaging the  compensation  (as
defined  in the  preceding  sentence)  for  the  Executive's  actual  period  of
employment.  Further,  if the  Executive  has been  employed less than 12 months
prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control,  the actual  compensation of the
Executive  shall be annualized for purposes of this Section 1.6. In the event of
dispute between the Executive and the Company,  the determination of the "annual
salary" shall be made by an independent  public  accounting  firm agreed upon by
the Executive and the Company.

        1.7   "Termination"  or  "Terminated"   means  (a)  termination  of  the
employment of the Executive with the Employer for any reason,  other than cause,
or (b) the  resignation  of the  Executive  following a Change in Duties.  In no
event, however, shall the Executive's voluntary separation from service with the
Employer  on  account  of  death,  disability,  or  resignation  on or after the
attainment of the normal  retirement  age  specified in any  qualified  employee
benefit plan maintained by the Employer  constitute a Termination.  For purposes
of  determining  whether  a  Termination  has  occurred,  "cause"  means  fraud,
misappropriation  of or intentional  material damage to the property or business
of the Employer or the commission of a felony by the Executive.

                        TERMINATION RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
          --------------------------------------------------------------

        2.1 Severance Awards. If the Executive's employment is Terminated during
the Covered  Period,  then no later than 30 days after the later of (a) the date

        c.      In accordance  with Section 2.2 hereof,  provide for the benefit
                of the  Executive,  his  spouse,  and  his  dependents,  if any,
                coverage under the plans,  policies or programs (as the same may
                be amended from time to time)  maintained by the Company for the
                purpose of  providing  medical  benefits  and life  insurance to
                other   executives  of  the  Company  with  comparable   duties;
                provided,  however, that in no event shall the coverage provided
                under this  paragraph  be  substantially  less than the coverage
                provided to the Executive as of the date immediately preceding a
                Termination;

        d.      Pay to the Executive an amount equal to the contributions by the
                Company  to the  Whitney  National  Bank of New  Orleans  Thrift
                Incentive Plan, or a successor arrangement, that would have been
                made  for  the  lesser  of (i) 3  years  following  the  date of
                Termination,  or (ii) the number of years until the  Executive's
                normal retirement age under such plan;

        e.      Pay to the Executive an amount equal to the present value of the

                Whitney  National  Bank of New  Orleans  Retirement  Plan,  or a
                successor arrangement,  that would have been made for the lesser
                of (i) 3 years  following the date of  Termination,  or (ii) the
                number of years  until the  Executive's  normal  retirement  age
                under such plan; and

        f.      Pay to the Executive the amount to which the Executive  would be
                entitled  under  the  1991  Executive  Compensation  Plan,  or a
                successor  thereto,  for the calendar  year in which a Change in
                Control  occurs,   determined  as  if  all   performance   goals
                applicable to the Company and the Executive were achieved.

        2.2 Special Rules Governing Group Benefits. Coverage under Section 2.1c,
hereof,  shall (a)  commence as of the later of the date of  Termination  or the
occurrence  of a  Change  in  Control,  and  (b)  end as of the  earlier  of the
Executive's coverage under Medicare Part B or the date on which the Executive is
covered under group plans providing substantially similar benefits maintained by
another  employer.  For this purpose,  the Company shall provide coverage during
any  period  in  which  the  payment  of  benefits  is  limited  by any  form of
pre-existing condition clause.

        Coverage  under  Section  2.1c,  hereof,  may be provided  under a group
policy  or  program  maintained  by the  Company  or the  Company,  in its  sole
discretion, may acquire or adopt an individual plan, policy or program providing
coverage  solely  for  the  benefit  of  the  Executive,  his  spouse,  and  his
dependents, if any.

        If coverage  commences as of a Change in Control,  the Company shall (a)
retroactively reinstate the Executive, his spouse, and dependents, if any, as of
the  date of  Termination,  and  (b)  reimburse  to the  Executive  his  cost of
obtaining  similar coverage for the period commencing on the date of Termination
and  ending on the  occurrence  of a Change in  Control.  As to  medical  claims
incurred  during such period,  any coverage  actually  obtained by the Executive
shall be designated as the  Executive's  primary  coverage,  and the  reinstated
coverage shall operate as secondary coverage.

        2.3 Other Plans and Agreements.  To the maximum extent  permitted by law
and not withstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any plan, grant,
program,  contract  or other  arrangement  under  which  the  Executive  and the
Employer are parties,  if the  Executive's  employment is Terminated  during the
Covered Period,  then any vesting schedule or other restriction on the ownership
of any  benefits  payable  to the  Executive  under the terms of any such  plan,
grant,  contract,  or arrangement shall be accelerated or lapse, as the case may
be.

        Notwithstanding  any  provision to the  contrary  contained in any plan,
grant,  program,  contract,  or  arrangement  under which the  Executive and the
Employer  are  parties,  in the event the  Executive  has  elected  to defer the
payment of any benefit under any such plan, grant, contract, or arrangement, the
payment of such benefit  shall be  accelerated  and paid to the Executive in the
form of a  single-sum  no later than 30 days after the  Executive's  Termination
during the Covered Period.

        2.4 Taxes. The Executive shall be responsible for applicable  income tax
and the  Company  shall have the right to withhold  from any payment  made under
this  Agreement,  or to collect as a condition of any payment,  any income taxes
required by law to be withheld.

        Notwithstanding  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Company  shall pay any
excise tax or similar  penalty  imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any comparable successor provision,  on
the  Executive as a consequence  of any "excess  parachute  payment"  within the
meaning  of Section  280(g) of the Code (or a  comparable  successor  provision)
payable  under this  Agreement or any plan,  grant,  program,  contract or other
arrangement under which the Executive and the Employer are parties.

        The  Executive  shall  submit to the Company the amount to be paid under
this Section 2.4, together with supporting  documentation.  If the Executive and
the Company disagree as to such amount,  an independent  public  accounting firm
agreed upon by the Executive and the Company shall make such determination.

        3.2     Employment Rights.  The terms of this Agreement shall not be

benefit  of the  Holding  Corporation,  the Bank  and the  Executive  and  their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

        3.5 Payment of Expenses.  In the event that it is necessary or desirable
for the Executive to retain legal counsel  and/or incur other costs and expenses
in connection  with the  enforcement of the terms of the Agreement,  the Company

or terminated by any act of the Company, except as may be expressly agreed upon,
in writing, by the Company and the Executive.

hereunder be construed in the nature of severance pay. The Company's obligations
under Section 2 are absolute and  unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance,  including, without limitation, any right of offset, counterclaim,
recoupment,  defense,  or other right  which the  Company  may have  against the
Executive or others.  All amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid
without notice or demand.

        3.8  Choice of Law.  The Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana.

        3.9 No  Effect on Other  Benefits.  Any other  compensation  paid or 
benefits provided  to the  Executive  shall  be in  addition  to and  not in 
lieu of the benefits  provided  to such  Executive  under this  Agreement. 
Except as may be expressly  provided  herein,  nothing in this  Agreement 
shall be  construed as limiting,  varying or reducing  the  provision  of any
benefit  available to the Executive (or to such Executive's estate or other  
beneficiary)  pursuant to any employment   agreement,   group  plan,   including
any  qualified   pension  or profit-sharing  plan,  health,  disability or life
insurance  plan, or any other form of agreement or arrangement between the
Company and the Executive.

        3.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the  Executive  and the  Holding  Corporation  and the Bank and is  
intended  to supersede all prior written or oral  understandings  with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

        3.11  Invalidity.  In the event that any one or more  provisions  of
this Agreement  shall, for any reason,  be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any manner, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of such Agreement.

        3.12 Mitigation.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary and to the maximum extent  permitted by law, the Executive shall not be
subject to any duty to mitigate  the  severance  awards  received  hereunder  by
seeking other employment. No severance award received under this Agreement shall
be offset by any compensation the Executive receives from future employment, and
the  Executive  shall not be required  to perform any service as a condition  of
this Agreement.
