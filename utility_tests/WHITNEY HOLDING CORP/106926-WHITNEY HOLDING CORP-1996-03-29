                                     PART I

ITEM 1:  BUSINESS

         Whitney Holding Corporation (the "Company") is a Louisiana bank holding
company registered pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company
began  operations in 1962 as the parent of Whitney National Bank (the "Louisiana
Bank") which has been in continuous operation since 1883. In December, 1994, the
Company  established  the  Whitney  Bank of Alabama  (the  "Alabama  Bank") and,
through this new banking subsidiary,  acquired the Mobile area operations of The
Peoples Bank, Elba,  Alabama on February 17, 1995. During 1995, the Company also
established  the Whitney  Community  Development  Corporation  ("WCDC") which is
authorized  to make  equity and debt  investments  in  corporations  or projects
designed  primarily  to  promote  community  welfare,   including  the  economic
rehabilitation  and  development  of  low-income  areas  by  providing  housing,
services,  or jobs for residents,  or promoting  small  businesses  that service
low-income  areas.  The initial  capitalization  of WCDC was  $1,000,000.  As of
December 31, 1995, WCDC had not begun any material operations.

         The Company,  through its banking  subsidiaries,  engages in commercial
and retail banking and in trust business,  including the taking of deposits, the
making of secured and unsecured loans, the financing of commercial transactions,
the issuance of credit cards,  the delivery of  corporate,  pension and personal
trust services, investment services and safe deposit rentals. The Louisiana Bank
is active as a  correspondent  for other  banks.  The Banks  render  specialized
services of different kinds in connection with all of the foregoing, and operate
forty-five  offices in south  Louisiana,  seven offices in south Alabama,  and a
foreign branch on Grand Cayman in the British West Indies.

         There is significant competition within the financial services industry
in general as well as with respect to the particular financial services provided
by the Banks.  Within their market areas,  the Banks compete directly with major
banking  institutions of comparable or larger size and resources as well as with
various other smaller banking  organizations  and local and national  "non-bank"
competitors,  including savings and loans,  credit unions,  mortgage  companies,
personal and commercial  finance  companies,  investment  brokerage  firms,  and
registered investment companies.

         In recent years there has been a significant  consolidation  within the
financial  services  industry,  particularly  with  respect to the  banking  and
savings and loan segments of this industry.  This  consolidation has been driven
both by the large number of S&L and bank failures  experienced during the crisis
of the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as by general  competitive  pressures.
All of the Banks' major direct banking  competitors have been relatively  active
in expansion through acquisition.  In recent years, the Company has entered into
two acquisitions of banking operations  involving  approximately $200 million of
assets and  completed  a merger  with a third  bank  having  approximately  $243
million of assets in early March 1996. The trend toward  industry  consolidation
is expected to continue in the near term.

         All material funds of the Company are invested in the Banks.  The Banks
have a large number of customer  relationships  which have been developed over a
period of many years and are not  dependent  upon any single  customer or upon a
few customers. The loss of any single customer or a few customers would not have
a material  adverse  effect on the Banks or the Company.  The Louisiana Bank has
customers in a number of foreign  countries,  but the portion of revenue derived
from these foreign customers is not a material portion of its overall revenues.

         The Company and the Banks and their related  operations  are subject to
federal, state and local laws applicable to banks and bank holding companies and
to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  the
Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and the Alabama State Banking Department.

ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

         The Company owns no real estate in its own name.  The Company's and the
Louisiana  Bank's  executive  offices are located in downtown New Orleans in the
Bank's main office facilities,  which it owns. A portion of these facilities, as
well as of certain other  facilities  in  Louisiana,  are available for lease to
third parties,  although such leasing  activity is not material to the Company's
overall   operations.   The  Louisiana  and  Alabama  Banks  own   approximately
three-quarters  of the total number of branch  banking  facilities  currently in
operation.  The remaining branch facilities in Louisiana and Alabama are subject
to leases,  each of which management  considers to be reasonable and appropriate
to the use of that location. All facilities,  whether owned or leased, are being
maintained  in a manner so as to ensure that they  continue  to be suitable  for
their intended banking operations.

         In 1996,  the Company plans to open or begin  construction  on thirteen
additional  branch locations  throughout the Banks' market areas and to complete
the  construction  of a new operations  center for the Louisiana Bank and a main
office facility for the

                                  Page 3 of 60

<PAGE>



Alabama Bank.  All of these facilities will be owned by the Banks.

         The Banks hold a variety of  property  interests  acquired  through the
years in  settlement  of  loans.  Reference  is made to Note 9 to the  financial
statements  included in Item 8 for further  information  regarding such property
interests as of December 31, 1995.

ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         There are no material  pending  legal  proceedings,  other than routine
litigation  incidental to the business, to which the Company or its subsidiaries
is a party or to which any of their property is subject.

ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SUMMARY

         Whitney Holding  Corporation earned $40.9 million in 1995, or $2.77 per
share.  These results  include the effects of a $10.0  million  reduction in the
level of the reserve for possible loan losses, which contributed $6.5 million or
$0.44 per share to earnings on an after-tax  basis. For 1994, the Company earned
$52.8  million  or $3.63 per  share,  including  an  after-tax  contribution  to
earnings  of $17.0  million or $1.17 per share  resulting  from a total of $26.1
million in loan loss reserve reductions during that period.

         Net  interest  income  increased  $5.6 million or 4.5% between 1994 and
1995 and the  taxable-equivalent  net interest margin rose to 5.00% in 1995 from
4.79% in 1994.  Non-interest  income decreased $1.1 million or 3.4% from 1994 to
1995 as a direct result of a $2.3 million  decrease in gains recognized on sales
of foreclosed  real estate  collateral.  Virtually  all other income  categories
showed  improvement in 1995 over the prior year.  Non-interest  expense was $6.9
million  or 6.6%  higher  in  1995  compared  to 1994  largely  as a  result  of
acquisitions.

         Non-performing  assets  continued  their  steady  decrease  of the past
several  years in 1995. At December 31, 1995,  non-performing  assets were $14.0
million,  down $8.1 million or 37% from $22.1 million at December 31, 1994.  The
reserve for possible  loan losses was $37.0  million on December  31,  1995,  an
amount which represented 402% of  non-performing  loans and 2.6% of total loans.
At year end 1994, the reserve coverage was 224% of non-performing loans and 3.2%
of total loans on that date.

         For  1995,  average  earning  assets  were  $2.66  billion,   virtually
unchanged from $2.67 billion in 1994. During 1995,  however,  the mix of earning
assets  shifted  in favor of loans  and away  from  investments  in  securities.
Average loans  outstanding  were $1.19 billion in 1995 or 44.6% of total earning
assets  compared to $979 million or 36.7% of the total in 1994. This loan growth
of $208 million or 21.3% is attributable to the Alabama acquisition completed in
the first  quarter  of 1995,  to  strengthened  demand for both  commercial  and
consumer credit in the Company's market areas, and to more aggressive  marketing
of the Banks' loan products.  At December 31, 1995, total loans outstanding were
$1.44 billion, an increase of $379 million or 35.8% over the $1.06 billion total
at the end of 1994.

         Average total deposits decreased slightly in 1995 to $2.42 billion from
$2.45 billion in 1994,  despite the impact of the Alabama  acquisition  in early
1995. The decrease in average deposits reflects the lingering impact of the rise
in market  interest rates during 1994 which fostered  disintermediation  of some
deposit  funds as  depositors  sought  higher  yielding  alternative  investment
instruments.  With the decline in market  rates from the end of 1994 through the
end of 1995, total deposits have increased to $2.56 billion at December 31, 1995
compared to $2.41 billion at December 31, 1994.

         The  growth  in  average  loans  outstanding  in 1995  not  related  to
acquisitions and the average net deposit  outflows  relative to 1994 were funded
primarily  from  maturities of  investment  securities.  The  Company's  average
investment  in  securities  totaled  $1.43  billion in 1995,  a decrease of $193
million  or 11.9%  from  $1.62  billion  in 1994.  At year end  1995,  the total
investment in securities was $1.37 billion,  a decrease of $165 million or 10.8%
from year end 1994.

         In early  March,  1996,  the  Company  completed  a merger  with  First
Citizens Bancstock,  Inc. ("FCB"),  the parent of The First National Bank in St.
Mary Parish  ("FNB").  FNB,  which will merge into  Whitney  National  Bank (the
"Louisiana  Bank"),  operates  eleven  banking  offices in south  Louisiana with
branches in St. Mary, East Baton Rouge and Iberia Parishes and a loan production
office in Orleans Parish.  FNB has total assets of  approximately  $243 million,
$147 million in loans, total deposits of $214 million,  and shareholders' equity
of $27 million. The merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.  FCB
shareholders  received  approximately  2.03  million  shares of Whitney  Holding
Corporation  common stock in connection with this transaction and holders of FCB
stock  options  received  options  to buy  approximately  192,000  shares of the
Company's common stock.

         On February 17, 1995,  Whitney  Bank of Alabama (the  "Alabama  Bank"),
then a newly formed state-chartered banking subsidiary of the Company, purchased
the assets and assumed the deposit liabilities of the five Mobile branch offices
of The  Peoples  Bank,  Elba,  Alabama.  The fair value of the  tangible  assets
acquired totaled  approximately $90 million,  including $47 million in loans and
$34 million in investment  securities  and federal funds sold.  The Alabama Bank
assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $14 million and interest-bearing
transaction,  savings and time deposits totaling $76 million. The purchase price
was  approximately  $12 million.  Operating results from the date of acquisition
are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 1995.

         On March  31,  1994,  the  Company  and the  Louisiana  Bank  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and assumed  the  deposits  and  certain  other
liabilities  of Baton Rouge Bank and Trust  Company.  Included  in the  tangible
assets acquired, whose fair value

                                  Page 7 of 60

<PAGE>



totaled  approximately  $118  million,  were cash and cash items of $41 million,
investment  securities and federal funds sold of $13 million, and $59 million in
loans,  as well as six banking  offices in the Baton Rouge  area.  The  deposits
assumed  included  approximately  $24  million  in  non-interest-bearing  demand
deposits  and $94  million in  interest-bearing  transaction,  savings  and time
deposit accounts.  As part of the acquisition price, which totaled approximately
$9 million, Whitney Holding Corporation issued 90,909 shares of its common stock
with a value of $2 million.  The operating  results from this  acquisition  were
reflected in the Company's consolidated  statements of operations beginning with
the second quarter of 1994.

         In January,  1996, the Company  announced  negotiations to enter into a
definitive  merger  agreement  with The New  Iberia  Bancorp,  parent of The New
Iberia  Bank which has assets of  approximately  $260  million  and  branches in
Iberia,  Lafayette and Vermilion Parishes in southern  Louisiana.  Completion of
the negotiations and initiation of a plan of merger are still pending.

         The Company  declared  quarterly  dividends in 1995 totalling $0.82 per
share  compared  with $0.64 per share in 1994, an increase of $0.18 per share or
28%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LOANS

         In 1995, the Company's average loans outstanding increased $208 million
or 21.3% as compared to 1994.  Average loans outstanding of $1.32 billion in the
fourth  quarter  of 1995 were $305  million  or 29.9%  above the level in 1994's
fourth  quarter.  The  Mobile  acquisition  in the first  quarter  of 1995,  the
improved  economic  conditions in the Company's  market area, which is primarily
southern Louisiana,  southern Mississippi and southern Alabama,  together with a
focused  effort to market the Banks' retail and commercial  loan  products,  all
contributed to the substantial loan growth in 1995.

         All categories of loans  experienced solid growth from year end 1994 to
year end 1995.  Commercial  loans,  other  than those  secured  by real  estate,
increased  $165 million or 28.7% in 1995,  while loans secured by commercial and
other  non-residential  real estate  collateral,  increased $117 million or 40%.
Loans to entities  involved  in  manufacturing  and  wholesaling  exhibited  the
strongest  growth,  although  the overall  increase  was well  distributed  over
diverse industries. Retail mortgage loans increased $82 million or 83%, in large
part as a result of the successful  promotion of new retail loan  products.  The
$15  million or 15.8%  growth in loans to  individuals,  which  include  various
consumer installment and credit line loan products,  was also largely the result
of enhanced promotional efforts of new and existing products.

DEPOSITS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company's  average deposits  decreased $33 million or 1.4% to $2.42
billion in 1995 from $2.45 billion in 1994.

         As shown in the table of average balance  sheets,  non-interest-bearing
demand deposits  increased $17 million or 2.3% in 1995 as compared to 1994. This
table also shows that average time  deposits,  which includes both core deposits
and certificates of deposit of $100,000 and over, increased $64 million or 11.2%
between 1994 and 1995.  The growth  within the time deposit  category  came both
from core deposits of under $100,000 which  increased $37 million and from a $26
million  increase in certificates of deposit of $100,000 and over. The growth in
the non-interest demand and time deposits categories in 1995 exceeded the amount
attributable to the Mobile acquisition in each category.

         Average savings,  NOW and money market account deposits  decreased $114
million or 10.2% between 1994 and 1995.  This decrease  reflects the  continuing
impact of the rise in market rates during 1994 which fostered  disintermediation
of  some  deposit  funds  as  depositors  sought  higher  yielding   alternative
investment  instruments.  With the  decline in market  rates  through the end of
1995, there has been some moderation in the level of the  year-to-year  decrease
in this deposit category.

         The  Company's  short-term  borrowings  consist of purchases of federal
funds and sales of securities under repurchase  agreements.  Such borrowings are
both a source of funding for certain  short-term  lending facilities and part of
the Company's services to correspondent banks and other customers. The Company's
average  short-term   borrowing  position,   net  of  federal  funds  sold,  was
approximately $148 million in 1995 and $135 million in 1994.

INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

         At December 31, 1995, the Company's total  investment in securities was
$1.37  billion,  a decrease of $165  million or 10.8% from the December 31, 1994
total of $1.53 billion.

         The average  total  investment  portfolio  outstanding  decreased  $193
million or 11.9%  between 1994 and 1995.  Proceeds  from  maturing  investments,
particularly  U.S. Treasury  securities,  were used to fund loan growth in 1995.
The mix of average  investments  remained  relatively stable, with U.S. Treasury
and government agency issues,  excluding  mortgage-backed  issues,  representing
approximately 80% of the totals for both 1995 and 1994.

         The weighted  average  maturity of the overall  portfolio of securities
was 27 months at year end 1995 as  compared  to 28 months at year end 1994.  The
weighted  average  taxable-equivalent  portfolio yield was 5.99% at December 31,
1995, an increase of 18 basis points from 5.81% at December 31, 1994.

         Securities  classified as available for sale constituted  approximately
9% of  the  total  investment  portfolio  at  year  end  1995  and  1994.  These
securities,  all of which are mortgage-backed  securities, are reported at their
estimated  fair  values  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  condition.   The
unrealized  gain on available  for sale  securities  of $1.3 million at year end
1995 and the  unrealized  loss of $7.9 million at 1994's year end were reported,
net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity for each period. The
remaining  portfolio  securities  are  classified  as held to  maturity  and are
reported at amortized cost. The Company maintains no trading portfolio.

         The Company  does not  maintain  any  investment  or  participation  in
financial  instruments  or  agreements  whose value is linked to or derived from
changes in the value of some  underlying  asset or index.  Such  instruments  or
agreements include futures, forward contracts,  option contracts,  interest-rate
swap agreements,  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics,
and are commonly referred to as derivatives.

ASSET QUALITY

         Asset quality has exhibited a trend of steady improvement over the past
four years.  During 1995, the Company  continued to be successful in its efforts
to  reduce  all  categories  of  its  non-performing  assets  through  the  full
rehabilitation  of nonaccruing  loans, the workout of troubled  credits,  or the
sale of  repossessed  loan  collateral.  Non-performing  assets  totalled  $14.0
million at  December  31,  1995,  a decrease  of $8.1  million or 37% from $22.1
million at year end 1994.

         In 1995, the Company identified $3.1 million of loans to be charged off
as uncollectible against the reserve for possible loan losses, a decrease of 14%
from the $3.6 million of  charge-offs in 1994. At the same time, the Company was
successful in recovering $13.9 million of previously  charged-off  loans in 1995
compared to $19.7 million in 1994.

         The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a level  believed
by management to be adequate to absorb potential  losses in the portfolio.  With
the significant recoveries in 1995 and 1994 and the improvement in overall asset
quality,  the Company was able to return $10 million of the reserve for possible
loan losses to income in 1995 and $26.1 million in 1994.  After the reduction in
1995,  the reserve for  possible  loan losses was $37.0  million at December 31,
1995, or a 402% coverage of total non-performing loans and 2.6% of total loans.

         During 1995, the Company  disposed of OREO  properties  with a carrying
value at the time of sale  totalling  approximately  $2.3 million.  The value of
properties acquired in settlement of loans during the year was $1.0 million.

         The Company has several property  interests which were acquired through
routine banking  transactions  generally prior to 1933 and which are recorded in
its financial records at a nominal value.  Management  continually  investigates
ways to  maximize  the  return  on  these  assets.  There  were  no  significant
dispositions  of or income from these property  interests in 1995, 1994 or 1993.
Future dispositions may result in the recognition of substantial gains.

         The Company has not extended any credit in  connection  with what would
be defined under regulatory guidelines as highly leveraged transactions, nor has
it acquired  any  investment  securities  arising  from such  transactions.  The
Company's  foreign  lending and investing  activities are currently  immaterial.
Note 4 to the consolidated  financial statements discusses credit concentrations
in the loan portfolio.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

         The Company's risk-based  regulatory capital ratios declined moderately
between  December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1995.  This decline is  attributable
mainly to the  acquisition  of intangible  assets as part of the purchase of the
Mobile,  Alabama  banking  operations  in  February,   1995.  Intangible  assets
generally must be deducted from both regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets
before calculating regulatory capital ratios. Also contributing to this decrease
was the shift in the  asset mix from  investments  to loans,  because  loans are
generally  assigned a risk- weighting  higher than investment  securities in the
capital ratio calculations.

         The Company's regulatory capital ratios are shown above compared to the
minimums   that  are   currently   required  to  be  eligible   for   regulatory
classification  as a  "well-capitalized"  institution.  The  regulatory  capital
ratios for the Banks were also in excess of minimum requirements at December 31,
1995.

         Regulatory  agencies will assess an institution's  exposure to interest
rate  risk as  part  of  their  overall  procedures  performed  to  evaluate  an
institution's  capital  adequacy.  These  agencies have also  proposed  rules to
incorporate a measure of interest rate risk into an institution's required level
of  regulatory  capital.   Management  believes  that  implementation  of  these
procedures  and  proposed  rules  will  not  have a  significant  impact  on the
Company's or the Banks' regulatory capital requirements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET INTEREST INCOME

         Taxable-equivalent  net interest income  increased $5.7 million or 4.4%
in 1995 as  compared  to 1994,  as the net  interest  margin  rose to 5.00% from
4.79%. A combination of factors contributed to this increase,  the components of
which are detailed in the following tables analyzing  changes in interest income
and expense.

         Taxable-equivalent  loan  interest  income  increased  $27.8 million or
33.2% in 1995 as compared to 1994. Approximately 70% of this increase was driven
by the growth in average  loans  outstanding  during  1995,  with the  remaining
portion  driven  by the  rise  in the  effective  yield  of the  Company's  loan
portfolio.  Market  interest  rates  generally  rose  throughout  1994  and then
moderated during 1995, and weighted-average  bank prime rates were approximately
1.5 percentage  points higher in 1995 compared to 1994.  The effective  yield on
the Company's loan portfolio,  approximately  40% of which reprices with changes
in prime, increased 0.84 of a percentage point over this same period.

         In 1995,  taxable-equivalent  interest income on investment  securities
decreased  $9.4  million or 10.1%  from the  previous  year.  This  decrease  is
consistent   with  the  reduction  in  the  average   investment  in  securities
outstanding  between  1994 and 1995 of $193  million.  Because  of its  maturity
structure,  the effective yield on the Company's investment securities portfolio
is not as  immediately  responsive to rising or falling  market rates as are its
loan yields.  The effective  portfolio yield was 5.85% in 1995 or an increase of
10 basis points over the effective yield of 5.75% in 1994.

         The net increase in total  taxable-equivalent  interest  income between
1994 and 1995 was $18.5 million or 10.3%.  The overall  effective  earning-asset
yield in 1995 was 7.43%, an increase of 70 basis points from 6.73% in 1994.

         Interest expense increased approximately $12.8 million or 24.7% in 1995
as compared to 1994.  The  increase in  interest  expense  came  despite a $56.3
million decrease in average  interest-bearing  liabilities  outstanding  between
these periods. The increase reflects the impact of rising rates during 1994, the
rate   structures   of  the  markets  in  which  the  Company  has  made  recent
acquisitions, and a shift in the deposit mix toward time deposits, a shift which
is also partly  attributable to recent  acquisitions.  The overall cost of funds
rate on  interest-bearing  liabilities was 3.52% in 1995 as compared to 2.74% in
1994, an increase of 78 basis points.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

         Non-interest income, adjusted to exclude securities gains and net gains
from OREO sales,  increased  $1.3 million or 4.4% to $30.3  million in 1995 from
$29.0  million in 1994.  This  followed an increase of $1.7 million or 6.1% from
1993 to 1994.

         Income from service charges on deposits  accounts,  which accounted for
more than half of adjusted  non-interest income in both 1995 and 1994, decreased
sightly, largely as a result of increases in the earnings credit rate applied to
business account balances that accompanied the generally higher average interest
rates  experienced in 1995. The decrease in business  account charges was partly
offset by an  increase in  personal  account  service  charge  income  which was
largely attributable to the addition of the Alabama operations in 1995.

         Fee income from credit card related operations  increased 10.5% in 1995
compared to 1994,  while income from services  which  support the  international
activities of the Company's  customers  increased 8.9%. These increases  reflect
both economic conditions as well as the successful marketing of existing and new
banking products and services.  Increased fees from trust investment  management
services,  reflecting in part the strong performance of the financial markets in
1995, supported an overall increase of 22.3% in trust services income over 1994.
The loss of several  correspondent bank relationships to industry  consolidation
and the  moderation  of market  interest  rates in 1995  both led to a  lessened
demand for the services of the Company's  investment  department and income from
these services decreased 17.3% from 1994's level.

         The Company continued to expand its automated teller facilities in 1995
and fees generated from ATM  operations,  which are included with other fees and
charges in the  accompanying  table of  non-interest  income,  increased  70% or
approximately $500 thousand over 1994. Also included with other fees and charges
is income from the Company's  secondary  mortgage loan  operations.  This income
category  was stable in 1995 after a fairly  sharp  decline in 1994 when  rising
market rates curtailed the volume of activity.

         Non-interest operating expenses,  adjusted to exclude provisions for or
recoveries  of losses on OREO and other  problem  assets,  were $111  million in
1995,  an increase of $5.7  million or 5.4% over 1994's  total of $105  million.
Between 1993 and 1994, the increase in adjusted non-interest  operating expenses
was $7.1 million or 7.2%.

         As is shown in the table of non-interest expense, salaries and employee
benefits  expense  increased  $3.9  million or 7.3% in 1995 as compared to 1994.
Approximately  $2.1  million of this  increase  was  related to the new  banking
operations in Alabama. The remaining increase of $1.8 million is attributable to
regular merit increases and key staff additions.

         Excluding  personnel-related  expenses, the Alabama Bank acquisition in
1995 added approximately $3.0 million to non-interest  operating expenses,  with
the largest impact on the amortization of intangible assets,  marketing expense,
and the  expense of bank  premises  and  furnishings  and  equipment.  Continued
enhancements   to  the  Company's   data   processing   systems  and  automation
capabilities  in 1995  as well as  further  expansion  of its ATM  network  also
contributed to the 28.1% increase over 1994 in the expense for  furnishings  and
equipment.

         Credit card operating  expenses for 1995 grew at a rate consistent with
the  growth in income  from  these  operations  as  discussed  above.  Taxes and
insurance  expense  increased  32.2% in 1995 almost entirely as a consequence of
the addition of the Company's  earnings and increased  equity to the  assessment
base used to compute certain state ad valorem taxes. The 14.1% increase in legal
and other  professional  services  for 1995  relates  mainly to data  processing
consulting services on important system upgrades.

         A  significant  decrease in the premium rate  schedule for FDIC deposit
insurance,  which was  effective  for the third  quarter  of 1995,  is  directly
responsible  for the $2.5  million or 42.6%  reduction in the  Company's  annual
deposit insurance expense as compared to 1994. The added expense from amortizing
intangible  assets  acquired  in 1995 and 1994 was more offset in 1995 by a $2.4
million decrease in the  amortization of intangibles  from earlier  acquisitions
resulting  in a net  decrease  of $1.3  million in this  expense  category.  The
expense of  maintaining  and operating  OREO declined in 1995 with the continued
improvement in asset quality.

INCOME TAXES

         The Company  provided for income taxes at an overall  effective rate of
31.3% in 1995,  down from the 32.4% rate in 1994.  The  effective  rates in each
period differ from the statutory rate of 35% primarily because of the tax exempt
income earned on investments in state and municipal obligations.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

         Effective  January 1, 1995, the Company adopted  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  114,  as  amended by SFAS No.  118,  which
addresses  the  accounting by creditors for  impairment  of certain  loans.  The
Company's  reserve for  possible  loan losses at  December  31, 1995  includes a
measure of impairment related to those loans identified for evaluation under the
new  standard.  This  measurement  is  based  on a  comparison  of the  recorded
investment in each impaired loan with either the expected cash flows  discounted
using the loan's  original  effective  interest  rate or, in the case of certain
collateral-dependent  loans,  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  collateral.
Adoption  of this  standard  did not have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
financial position or results of operations.


ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

         The asset/liability management process has as its focus the development
and  implementation of strategies in the funding and deployment of the Company's
financial  resources which are expected to maximize  soundness and profitability
over time.  These  strategies  reflect  the goals set by the Company for capital
adequacy,  liquidity,  and the acceptable  level of risk  established in Company
policies.

INTEREST RATE RISK/INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

         The Company's financial assets and liabilities are subject to scheduled
and unscheduled repricing  opportunities over time. Both the Company's potential
for  generating  net  interest  income  and the  current  market  values  of its
financial  assets and liabilities  depend in part upon the prevailing  levels of
market interest rates when these repricing  opportunities  arise.  Interest rate
risk is a measure  of this  potential  change in  earnings  ability  and  market
values.


                                  Page 18 of 60

<PAGE>
         As part of the  asset/liability  management  process the Company uses a
variety of tools,  including an earnings  simulation  model, to measure interest
rate  risk and to  evaluate  the  impact  of  possible  changes  in rates on its
internal  strategies.  The interest rate sensitivity gap analysis,  shown in the
accompanying  table,  compares the volume of repricing assets against  repricing
liabilities over time. This analysis is a relatively simple tool which is useful
mainly in highlighting significant short-term repricing volume mismatches.

         The table  presents the rate  sensitivity  gap analysis at December 31,
1995. The interest rates on a substantial portion of the outstanding  commercial
loans vary with changes in the Banks' prime  lending rates or the prime rates of
certain  money-center  banks. These loans are assigned to the earliest repricing
period in the rate sensitivity analysis. A sizable portion of loans shown in the
analysis as repricing after one year is made up of fixed-rate real estate loans.

         In preparing this analysis,  deposit  funding sources with no scheduled
maturity or contractual  repricing  date are assigned to a particular  repricing
period after consideration of past and expected customer behavior in response to
general market rate changes.  In the twelve-month period from December 31, 1995,
the  analysis  indicates  that the Company is in a slightly  liability-sensitive
position on a cumulative basis.

LIQUIDITY AND OTHER MATTERS

         The Company and the Banks  manage their  liquidity  positions to ensure
their  ability  to  satisfy   customer  demand  for  credit,   to  fund  deposit
withdrawals,  to meet  operating and other  corporate  obligations,  and to take
advantage  of  investment  opportunities,  all in a  timely  and  cost-effective
manner.  Traditionally  these  liquidity  needs have been met by  maintaining  a
strong base of core deposits and by carefully managing the maturity structure of
the  investment  portfolios.  The  funds  provided  by  current  operations  and
forecasts of loan  repayments  are also  considered in the liquidity  management
process.

         The Banks enter into  short-term  borrowing  arrangements by purchasing
federal funds and selling  securities  under  repurchase  agreements,  both as a
source of funding for certain short-term lending facilities and as part of their
services to correspondent banks and certain other customers. Neither the Company
nor the  Banks  have  accessed  long-term  debt  markets  as  part of  liquidity
management.

         The  following  tables  present  information  concerning  deposits  and
short-term  borrowings for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993. Average core deposits,
defined as all deposits other than time deposits of $100,000 or more,  decreased
$60 million or 2.7% to $2.15  billion in 1995 from $2.21  billion in 1994.  Core
deposits comprised approximately 90% of total average deposits for both of these
periods.

         As of  December  31,  1995,  approximately  $340  million or 27% of the
portfolio of  investment  securities  held to maturity  was  scheduled to mature
within one year.  An  additional  $127  million  of  investment  securities  was
classified  as  available  for  sale at the end of 1995,  although  management's
determination  of this  classification  does not derive primarily from liquidity
considerations.

         The Banks had  approximately  $914 million in unfunded loan commitments
outstanding  at December 31, 1995, an increase of $331 million from the level at
December 31, 1994. Contingent  obligations under letters of credit and financial
guarantees increased moderately between these dates to a total of $81 million at
December 31, 1995.  Available credit card lines were $31 million at December 31,
1995,  slightly  above the level at year end 1994.  Draws under these  financial
commitments  should  not place any  unusual  strain on the  Company's  liquidity
position.

         In 1996,  the Company plans to open or begin  construction  on thirteen
additional  branch locations  throughout the Banks' market areas and to complete
the  construction  of a new operations  center for the Louisiana Bank and a main
office for the Alabama Bank. Total capital expenditures for these new facilities
are estimated at $30 million.

                          Notes To Financial Statements


(1) NATURE OF BUSINESS

         Whitney Holding Corporation (the "Company") is a Louisiana bank holding
company registered pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Company
began  operations in 1962 as the parent of Whitney National Bank (the "Louisiana
Bank"),  which has been in continuous  operation since 1883. In December,  1994,
the Company  established  the Whitney Bank of Alabama (the "Alabama  Bank") and,
through this new banking subsidiary,  acquired the Mobile area operations of The
Peoples Bank, Elba,  Alabama on February 17, 1995. During 1995, the Company also
established  the Whitney  Community  Development  Corporation  ("WCDC") which is
authorized  to make  equity and debt  investments  in  corporations  or projects
designed  primarily  to  promote  community  welfare,   including  the  economic
rehabilitation  and  development  of  low-income  areas  by  providing  housing,
services,  or jobs for residents,  or promoting  small  businesses  that service
low-income areas. The initial capitalization of WCDC was $1,000,000.
As of December 31, 1995, WCDC had not begun any material operations.

         The Company,  through its banking  subsidiaries,  engages in commercial
and retail banking and in trust business,  including the taking of deposits, the
making of secured and unsecured loans, the financing of commercial transactions,
the issuance of credit cards,  the delivery of  corporate,  pension and personal
trust services, investment services and safe deposit rentals. The Louisiana Bank
is active as a  correspondent  for other  banks.  The Banks  render  specialized
services of different kinds in connection with all of the foregoing, and operate
forty-five  offices in south  Louisiana,  seven offices in south Alabama,  and a
foreign branch on Grand Cayman in the British West Indies.

         There is significant competition within the financial services industry
in general as well as with respect to the particular financial services provided
by the Banks.  Within their market areas,  the Banks compete directly with major
banking  institutions of comparable or larger size and resources as well as with
various other smaller banking  organizations  and local and national  "non-bank"
competitors,  including savings and loans,  credit unions,  mortgage  companies,
personal and commercial  finance  companies,  investment  brokerage  firms,  and
registered investment companies.

         In recent years there has been a significant  consolidation  within the
financial  services  industry,  particularly  with  respect to the  banking  and
savings and loan segments of this industry.  This  consolidation has been driven
both by the large number of S&L and bank failures  experienced during the crisis
of the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as by general  competitive  pressures.
All of the Banks' major direct banking  competitors have been relatively  active
in expansion through acquisition.  In recent years, the Company has entered into
two acquisitions of banking operations  involving  approximately $200 million of
assets and  completed  a merger  with a third  bank  having  approximately  $243
million of assets in early March 1996. The trend toward  industry  consolidation
is expected to continue in the near term.

         All material funds of the Company are invested in the Banks.  The Banks
have a large number of customer  relationships  which have been developed over a
period of many years and are not  dependent  upon any single  customer or upon a
few customers. The loss of any single customer or a few customers would not have
a material  adverse  effect on the Banks or the Company.  The Louisiana Bank has
customers in a number of foreign  countries,  but the portion of revenue derived
from these foreign customers is not a material portion of its overall revenues.

         The Company and the Banks and their related  operations  are subject to
federal, state and local laws applicable to banks and bank holding companies and
to the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  the
Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and the Alabama State Banking Department.


(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The accounting and reporting  policies of Whitney  Holding  Corporation
and  its  subsidiaries  follow  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and
policies  within the banking  industry.  The  following is a summary of the more
significant policies.



                                  Page 26 of 60

<PAGE>



CONSOLIDATION

         The  consolidated  financial  statements  of the  Company  include  the
accounts  of Whitney  Holding  Corporation  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,
Whitney  National  Bank and  Whitney  Bank of Alabama.  Whitney  Bank of Alabama
commenced significant operations on February 17, 1995. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

         Certain balances in prior years have been  reclassified to conform with
this year's presentation.

USE OF ESTIMATES

         To prepare financial  statements in conformity with generally  accepted
accounting  principles,  management is required to develop estimates that affect
the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND DUE FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

         The Company considers cash and cash due from financial  institutions as
cash and cash  equivalents  for purposes of the  consolidated  statement of cash
flows.

INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

         Debt securities  which the Company both positively  intends and has the
ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized  cost.  These  criteria are
not considered  satisfied when a security is available to be sold in response to
changes in interest rates, prepayment rates, liquidity needs or other reasons as
part of an overall asset/liability management strategy.

         Debt securities and equity  securities with readily  determinable  fair
values that are acquired with the intention of being resold in the near term are
classified as trading  securities and are carried at fair value, with unrealized
holding gains and losses  recognized in current  earnings.  The Company does not
currently hold any securities for trading purposes.

         Securities  not meeting the criteria of either  trading  securities  or
securities  held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at
fair  value.  Unrealized  holding  gains and  losses  for these  securities  are
recognized, net of related tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.

         Interest  and  dividend  income  earned on  securities  either  held to
maturity or available  for sale is included in current  earnings,  including the
amortization  of premiums  and the  accretion  of  discounts  using the interest
method.  The gain or loss realized on the sale of a security held to maturity or
available for sale is computed with  reference to its amortized cost and is also
included in current earnings.

LOANS

         Loans are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding,  less
unearned income and the reserve for possible loan losses.

         Interest  on loans is  accrued  and  credited  to  income  based on the
outstanding  loan  principal  amounts.  The  accrual  of  interest  on  loans is
discontinued  when, in  management's  judgement,  there is an indication  that a
borrower  will be unable to meet  contractual  payments as they become due.  For
commercial  and real  estate  loans,  this  generally  occurs  when a loan falls
90-days past due as to principal or interest, and the loan is not otherwise both
well secured and in the process of collection. Upon discontinuance,  accrued but
uncollected  interest is reversed  against  current  income.  Interest  payments
received on  nonaccrual  loans are used to reduce the  reported  loan  principal
under  the  cost  recovery  method  when  the  collectibility  of the  remaining
principal is not reasonably assured; otherwise, these payments are recognized as
interest income.

         A nonaccrual loan may be reinstated to accrual status when full payment
of  contractual  principal  and  interest is expected  and this  expectation  is
supported by current performance.

RESERVE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES

         The reserve for possible loan losses is maintained at a level which, in
management's  judgement,  is  considered  adequate  to absorb  potential  losses
inherent in the loan  portfolio.  The  adequacy of the reserve is  evaluated  by
management on an ongoing basis.  As adjustments to the level of reserves  become
necessary, they are reported in current earnings. The factors considered in this
evaluation  include  the  estimated   potential  losses  from  specific  lending
relationships,  including unused loan commitments and credit guarantees; general
economic conditions; economic conditions affecting specific classes of borrowers
or types of loan collateral;  historical loss experience;  and various trends in
loan  portfolio  characteristics,   such  as  volume,  maturity,  customer  mix,
delinquencies and nonaccruals.

         As actual  losses are incurred,  they are charged  against the reserve.
Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added back to the reserve.

         Effective  January 1, 1995, the Company adopted  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 114,  "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan," as  amended by SFAS No.  118.  Under  this new  standard,  a loan is
considered impaired when it is probable that all contractual amounts will not be
collected as they become due. The extent of  impairment  is measured  based on a
comparison of the recorded  investment in the loan with either the expected cash
flows  discounted using the loan's original  effective  interest rate or, in the
case of certain  collateral-dependent  loans,  the fair value of the  underlying
collateral.  The measure of  impairment  is included in the reserve for possible
loan losses.

         The  provisions  of SFAS No.  114 were not  applied  by the  Company to
measure  impairment  for large  groups of similar  loans with  relatively  small
balances,  such as consumer credit line loans and consumer installment loans. As
allowed  under the  standard,  these  loans may be  collectively  evaluated  for
impairment.

         The guidance in SFAS No. 114 does not represent a significant departure
from  existing  procedures  followed  by the Company in  evaluating  the overall
adequacy of the reserve for possible loan losses.  Furthermore,  loans evaluated
for impairment  would also  generally meet the criteria  currently in use by the
Company  to  identify  loans  on  which  the  accrual  of  interest   should  be
discontinued.  As such,  the adoption of this new  standard  had no  significant
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.


FORECLOSED ASSETS

         Collateral  acquired  through  foreclosure or in settlement of loans is
classified  as either  other real estate  owned  ("OREO") or other assets and is
carried at its fair value,  net of  estimated  costs to sell,  or the  remaining
investment in the loan,  whichever is lower. At  acquisition,  any excess of the
recorded loan value over the estimated  fair value of the  collateral is charged
against the reserve for  possible  loan  losses.  After  acquisition,  valuation
allowances  are  established  with a charge to  current  earnings  to adjust the
reported  value of  foreclosed  assets to reflect  changes in the  estimate of a
property's  fair value or selling costs.  Revenues and expenses  associated with
the  management  of  foreclosed  assets  prior to sale are  included  in current
earnings.

BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

         Bank  premises and equipment  are carried at cost,  net of  accumulated
depreciation and amortization.

         Provisions for depreciation  and amortization  included in non-interest
expenses are computed  primarily on the straight-line  method over the estimated
useful  lives of the  assets.  Estimated  useful  lives  range  from  fifteen to
forty-five  years for buildings and improvements and from three to ten years for
furnishings and equipment.

         In March,  1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 121 which prescribes the accounting for impairment of long-lived assets used
in  operations,  such as  bank  premises  and  equipment,  certain  identifiable
intangibles, and any goodwill related to these assets. In general, the statement
requires  recognition  of an impairment  loss when the  undiscounted  cash flows
estimated  to be derived  from the use of these assets  exceeds  their  carrying
value.  The  statement  also  prescribes  the  accounting to be followed when an
entity plans to dispose of such long-lived  assets.  The effect of the Company's
adoption of SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996 will not be material.

INCOME TAXES

         Effective   January  1,  1993,  the  Company   adopted  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." In general,  under this  accounting  standard the
tax  consequences of all temporary  differences that arise between the tax bases
of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial  statements
represent  either tax liabilities to be settled in the future or tax assets that
will be realized  as a reduction  of future  taxes.  The change in net  deferred
assets or liabilities between periods is recognized as a deferred tax expense or
benefit in the consolidated statement of operations.


EARNINGS PER SHARE

         Earnings per share is calculated  using the weighted  average number of
shares  outstanding  during each period presented.  Potentially  dilutive common
stock  equivalents  consist of stock  options which have been granted to certain
officers and directors.  Incorporating  these common stock  equivalents into the
calculation of earnings per share using the treasury  method does not materially
affect the reported results whether on a primary or fully-diluted basis.

         All  share  and  per-share  data  in this  annual  report  reflect  the
three-for-two  stock splits that were  effective  February 22, 1993 and November
29, 1993.

         The  Company's  lending  activity,   both  commercial  and  retail,  is
conducted  primarily  among  customers in  Louisiana,  Mississippi  and southern
Alabama.  In its market  areas,  the Company  serves a broad base of  commercial
customers in diverse industries.

         Within the portfolio,  the Company  maintains a relatively  significant
concentration of outstanding  credits and loan commitments to customers involved
in the oil and gas  industry.  At December 31, 1995,  outstanding  loans to this
industry  totalled  $111,425,000,  and unused  loan  commitments  and letters of
credit and guarantees  were  $157,206,000  and  $14,618,000,  respectively.  The
operations  of this  industry  have  stabilized  and  improved in recent  years,
following a period of severe decline and major restructuring which had adversely
impacted the overall  economy of a large portion of the  Company's  market area.
Management  continues  to closely  monitor  its  lending  relationships  in this
industry.

         The total of  commercial  and  other  real  estate  loans  shown  above
includes  both those for which the primary  source of repayment is the operation
or sale of the  underlying  project,  as well as those  secured  by real  estate
employed in other  operations of the customer.  Unfunded  commitments  for loans
secured by  commercial  or other real estate were  $112,000,000  at December 31,
1995.  The  Company's  portfolio  of  commercial  and other real estate loans is
diversified  as to both the types of collateral  property and the  industries in
which the properties are employed.

         Non-performing  loans at December 31, 1995 and 1994 are  summarized  as
follows (in thousands):

         Effective   January  1,  1995,  the  Company   adopted  SFAS  No.  114,
"Accounting  by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended by SFAS No. 118.
The adoption of this standard,  the provisions of which are discussed in Note 2,
had no  significant  impact on the  Company's  financial  position or results of
operations.  At December 31, 1995,  the recorded  investment  in loans that were
evaluated  for  impairment  under SFAS No. 114 was  $8,009,000.  Of this  total,
$4,467,000 relates to impaired loans which required an impairment loss allowance
totalling  $1,608,000.  This  allowance  is included in the reserve for possible
loan losses at year end 1995.  The remaining  balance of impaired loans required
no loss allowance. The average recorded investment in impaired loans during 1995
was approximately $7,900,000.

         With respect to certain nonaccrual loans, interest income is recognized
as cash interest payments are received. Interest payments on current or previous
nonaccrual  loans that had been accounted for under the cost recovery method may
also  subsequently be recognized as interest income as loan  collections  exceed
previous  expectations  or as  workout  efforts  result  in fully  rehabilitated
credits.  The following compares contractual interest income on nonaccrual loans
and  restructured  loans with both the interest  income reported on a cash basis
with  respect  to such  loans and the prior  cost  recovery  interest  currently
recognized on nonaccrual loans and certain accruing loans (in thousands):

         During 1994, the Company recovered approximately $6,139,000 on one loan
that previously had been charged off and, with the improvement in credit quality
in recent years,  was able to transfer this recovery to income in that year. The
reductions  in the  reserve  for  possible  loan  losses in 1995,  1994 and 1993
reflect  improved asset quality,  successful  recovery  efforts and management's
determination  that  efforts  to deal with asset  quality  issues  have  yielded
lasting positive results.

         The Banks have made loans in the normal  course of  business to certain
directors and executive officers of the Company and to their associates (related
parties). The aggregate amount of these loans was $52,516,000 and $31,591,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  During 1995, $234,862,000 of new loan
advances  were  made,  and   repayments   totalled   $213,937,000.   Outstanding
commitments  and letters of credit to related  parties  totaled  $68,095,000 and
$37,734,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Related party loans are
made on substantially the same terms,  including  interest rates and collateral,
as those  prevailing  at the time for  comparable  transactions  with  unrelated
persons, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility.

         Effective   January  1,  1993,  the  Company   adopted  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting  for Income Taxes." Under this standard the tax  consequences of all
temporary  differences  between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements represent either tax liabilities to
be settled in the future or tax assets that will be  realized as a reduction  of
future taxes. Among other provisions, SFAS No. 109 requires the use of currently
enacted tax rates to measure  these  deferred  tax assets and  liabilities.  The
impact of any change in the enacted tax rates is  included in the  deferred  tax
expense or benefit  recognized  in the  period in which the change  occurs.  The
change in the net deferred tax asset or liability between periods represents the
deferred tax expense or benefit to be recognized  in the  financial  statements.
With the  adoption of SFAS No. 109, the Company  recognized  an  additional  net
deferred asset of $4,574,000, which is reported in the consolidated statement of
operations for 1993 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change (Note 7).

         Net deferred  income tax assets,  which are included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheets, were approximately  $12,199,000 and $17,181,000
at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The components of the net deferred
tax assets were as follows (in thousands):

         Under SFAS No. 109,  the  Company is required to  establish a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax asset if, based on all available evidence, it
is more  likely  than not that  some or all of the asset  will not be  realized.
Management has weighed the evidence,  including  current  earnings  performance,
taxable income generated during available  carryback periods,  and the nature of
significant  deductible  temporary  differences,  and believes that no valuation
reserve is required as of December 31, 1995. Rules issued by regulatory agencies
impose  additional  limitations on the amount of deferred tax assets that may be
recognized  when  calculating  regulatory  capital  ratios.  The Company's ratio
calculations were not affected by these rules at December 31, 1995.

         The effective tax rate is less than the  statutory  federal  income tax
rate in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 because of
the following:

(6) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement Plans

         The Company has a  noncontributory  qualified  defined  benefit pension
plan covering  substantially all of its employees.  The benefits are based on an
employee's  total  years of service and his or her  highest  five-year  level of
compensation during the final ten years of employment. Contributions are made in
amounts  sufficient to meet funding  requirements  set forth in federal employee
benefit and tax laws plus such  additional  amounts as the Company may determine
to be appropriate from time to time.

         The actuarial present values of vested and of total accumulated benefit
obligations  (both of which exclude  projected  future increases in compensation
levels) were $39,067,000 and $42,461,000, respectively, as of December 31, 1995,
and $32,361,000 and $35,306,000, respectively, as of December 31, 1994.

         The  weighted-average  discount rate used in determining  the actuarial
present value of the projected  benefit  obligation was 7.25% in 1995,  8.25% in
1994 and 7.5% in 1993. For all periods  presented,  the Company  assumed an 8.0%
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The annual rate of increase in
future compensation levels was assumed to be 4% in 1995 and 5% in 1994 and 1993.

         In 1995,  the Company  adopted a  nonqualified  defined  benefit  plan,
effective  as of January 1, 1995.  This  unfunded  plan  provides to  designated
executive  officers  retirement  benefits  calculated using the qualified plan's
formula,  but without the  restrictions  imposed on  qualified  plans by certain
specified  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Benefits that become payable
under the nonqualified  plan would be reduced by amounts paid from the qualified
plan. The Company previously maintained a nonqualified excess benefit retirement
plan  which was  terminated  effective  January  1, 1993 with  accrued  benefits
preserved for  participants.  Designated  executives  participating in the newly
adopted  nonqualified  plan were required to relinquish their benefits under the
terminated plan. At December 31, 1995, the actuarial  present value of projected
benefit  obligations under the nonqualified  plans was approximately  $2,120,000
and the recorded  accrued  pension  liability  was  $1,250,000.  The net pension
expense was not material.

         Effective  October 1, 1993, the Company  converted its  noncontributory
employee  thrift plan into an employee  savings plan under Section 401(k) of the
Internal  Revenue  Code.  Under the new plan,  which  covers  substantially  all
full-time  employees,  the Company matches the savings of each participant up to
3% of his or her  compensation.  Annual  participant  savings are limited by tax
law.  Participants are fully vested in their savings and in the matching Company
contributions at all times. The expense of the Company's matching  contributions
was approximately $946,000 in 1995, $922,000 in 1994 and $245,000 in 1993.

Health and Welfare Plans

         The Company  also  maintains  certain  health  care and life  insurance
benefit  plans  for  retirees  and  their   eligible   dependents.   Participant
contributions   are  required  under  the  health  plan,  and  the  Company  has
established  annual and lifetime  maximum health care benefit limits.  Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for
Postretirement  Benefits Other than Pensions." This statement  requires that the
expected cost of providing these  postretirement  benefits be recognized  during
the period employees are actively working. Prior to 1993, the Company recognized
the cost only as benefit  payments  were made to or on behalf of  retirees.  The
Company continues to fund its obligations under the postretirement benefit plans
as the benefit payments are made.

         Upon  adoption of SFAS No.  106,  the  Company  elected to  immediately
recognize the accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation of $5,963,000.  The
expense related to the  recognition of this transition  obligation was reported,
net of  income  tax  effects  of  $2,023,000,  as the  cumulative  effect  of an
accounting change in 1993 in the consolidated statements of operations (Note 7).

         At December 31, 1995, the net postretirement benefit liability reported
with other  liabilities in the  consolidated  balance  sheets was  approximately
$6,314,000.  The net periodic  postretirement  benefit expense  recognized under
SFAS No.  106 for  1995,  1994 and 1993 was  $168,000,  $300,000  and  $450,000,
respectively.  The benefit  expense  includes  components for the portion of the
expected benefit obligation  attributed to current service,  for interest on the
accumulated benefit obligation,  and for amortization of unrecognized  actuarial
gains or losses.  The expense  recognized is not materially  different from that
which would have been reported under the previous accounting method.

         For the actuarial calculation of its postretirement benefit obligations
at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company assumed annual health care cost
increases beginning at 10%, 11% and 12%, respectively, with each decreasing to a
5.5% rate over a ten year period. Discount rates of 7.25% in 1995, 8.25% in 1994
and 7.5% in 1993  were  used in  determining  the  present  value  of  projected
benefits.  A 1.0% rise in the  assumed  health  care cost trend  rates would not
materially impact the accumulated benefit obligation or the periodic net benefit
expense.

Incentive and Other Plans

         The Company has a long-term  incentive  program for which all employees
are  eligible.  As of December 31, 1995,  263,625  shares of treasury  stock are
reserved for the purposes of this  program,  which include the granting of stock
options,  restricted  stock,  and  performance  and phantom  stock.  The Company
granted 40,000 shares of restricted  stock to certain  employees during 1995 for
no cash  consideration.  During 1994 and 1993,  restricted stock grants totalled
50,100 and  36,000  shares,  respectively.  Employees  receiving  the grants are
restricted from transferring or otherwise  disposing of the stock for five years
from the date of grant. The market values of the restricted  shares,  determined
as of the grant dates, were $1,155,000,  $1,357,000 and $699,000,  respectively,
for 1995,  1994 and 1993.  These  amounts are being  amortized  as  compensation
expense over the five year restriction periods.  Compensation expense recognized
during 1995,  1994 and 1993 related to these employee stock grants was $598,000,
$340,000 and $168,000, respectively.

         The  following  table   summarizes  stock  option  activity  under  the
long-term  incentive  program for  employees  for the  three-year  period  ended
December 31, 1995. The incentive and non-qualified options are fully exercisable
six months after the date of grant.

         On February  28,  1990,  an  executive  officer was granted  options to
purchase  33,750  shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $18.11 per
share through February 28, 2000. At December 31, 1995, none of these options had
been exercised.  If this officer terminates his employment with the Company, the
options will be exercisable  for six months after his date of  termination.  The
options will also be exercisable up to one year past the date of his death,  but
in no event beyond February 28, 2000.

         During 1994, the Company adopted a revised Directors' Compensation Plan
which  provides  for,  among other  matters,  the annual  award of 150 shares of
common  stock and the annual  grant of  nonqualified  options to purchase  1,000
shares of common stock to each director who is not an employee of the Company or
its subsidiaries.  The nonqualified  options are exercisable at the market price
on the grant date. As of December 31, 1995, options to purchase 11,000 shares of
common  stock at an  exercise  price of $26.25 and  14,000  shares at a price of
$26.75 were outstanding. During 1995, options for 1,000 shares were exercised at
a price of $26.25 when the market price was $33.75.  No options  were  exercised
during 1994. The expense of the stock awards under this plan was $56,000 in 1995
and $47,000 in 1994.

         In  October,  1995,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation," which is effective for years beginning after December
15, 1995. Among other provisions,  this statement establishes a fair value based
method of accounting for stock- based compensation, including the award of stock
options.  As provided  for in SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected not to adopt
the fair value based method for measuring  stock-based  compensation  cost to be
included  in its  results  of  operations,  but will  continue  to follow  prior
generally accepted accounting principles.  Pro forma disclosures will be made in
future  periods of net income and earnings per share  determined  as if the fair
value method had been applied in measuring compensation cost.

         OREO  includes  a variety of  property  interests  which were  acquired
though routine banking transactions  generally prior to 1933 and for which there
existed no ready  market.  These  were  subsequently  written  down to a nominal
holding value in accordance  with general banking  practice at that time.  These
property  interests  include a few  commercial  and  residential  site locations
principally  in  the  New  Orleans  area,   ownership   interests  in  scattered
undeveloped acreage, and various mineral interests.

(13) ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The following disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 107,  "Disclosures  about Fair
Value of Financial  Instruments."  In cases where quoted  market  prices are not
available,  fair  values  have  been  estimated  using  present  value  or other
valuation  techniques.  The results of these  techniques are highly sensitive to
the assumptions  used, such as those concerning  appropriate  discount rates and
estimates  of  future  cash  flows,   which  require   considerable   judgement.
Accordingly,  estimates  presented herein are not necessarily  indicative of the
amounts the Company  could  realize in a current  settlement  of the  underlying
financial  instruments.  SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and
all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. These disclosures
should not be interpreted as representing an aggregate measure of the underlying
value of the Company.

         The Company  does not  maintain  any  investment  or  participation  in
financial  instruments or agreements  whose value is linked to, or derived from,
changes in the value of some  underlying  asset or index.  Such  instruments  or
agreements include futures, forward contracts,  option contracts,  interest-rate
swap agreements,  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics,
and are commonly referred to as derivatives.

</TABLE>

         The  following  significant  methods and  assumptions  were used by the
Company in estimating the fair value of financial instruments.

Cash  and  short-term   investments  -  The  carrying  value  of  highly  liquid
instruments, such as cash on hand, interest and non-interest bearing deposits in
financial  institutions,  and federal funds sold, provides a reasonable estimate
of their fair value.

Investment securities - Substantially all of the Company's investment securities
are traded in active  markets.  Fair value  estimates for these  securities  are
based on quoted market prices obtained from independent  pricing  services.  The
carrying amount of accrued interest on securities approximates its fair value.

Loans,  net - For loans  with  rates  that are  repriced  in  coordination  with
movements in market rates and with no  significant  change in credit risk,  fair
value  estimates are based on carrying  values.  The fair values for other loans
are estimated  through  discounted  cash flow  analysis,  using current rates at
which loans with  similar  terms would be made to  borrowers  of similar  credit
quality. Appropriate adjustments are made to reflect probable credit losses. The
carrying amount of accrued interest on loans approximates its fair value.

Deposits - SFAS No.  107  specifies  that the fair value of deposit  liabilities
with no defined  maturity is to be disclosed as the amount  payable on demand at
the reporting date, i.e., at their carrying or book value. These deposits, which
include interest and non-interest  checking,  passbook savings, and money market
accounts,  represented  approximately  72% and 77% of total deposits at December
31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The fair value of fixed maturity  deposits is
estimated using a discounted cash flow  calculation that applies rates currently
offered for time deposits of similar remaining  maturities.  The carrying amount
of accrued interest payable on deposits approximates its fair value.

         The economic value attributable to the relationship with depositors who
provide  low-cost funds to the Company is viewed as a separate  intangible asset
and is excluded in SFAS No. 107 from the definition of a financial instrument.

Short-term  borrowings  - The  carrying  amounts  of  federal  funds  purchased,
borrowings  under  repurchase   agreements,   and  other  short-term  borrowings
approximate their fair values.

Off-balance-sheet  instruments - Off-balance-sheet financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, and other financial guarantees.
The fair value of such instruments is estimated using fees currently charged for
similar  arrangements  in the  marketplace,  adjusted  for  changes in terms and
credit risk as appropriate.  The estimated fair value for these  instruments was
insignificant at December 31, 1995 and 1994.


(14) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

         In order to meet the  financing  needs of its  customers,  the  Company
deals in financial  instruments that expose it to off-balance-sheet  risk. These
financial  instruments include commitments to extend credit,  letters of credit,
and other financial  guarantees.  Such instruments  involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount  recognized in
the statements of financial position.

         The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
other parties for  commitments  to extend credit and letters of credit and other
financial  guarantees  written is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments.  The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments
and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

</TABLE>

         Commitments  to extend  credit and credit card lines are  agreements to
make a loan to a  customer  as long as there is no  violation  of any  condition
established  in the commitment or credit card  contract.  Commitments  generally
have  fixed  expiration  dates  or other  termination  clauses  and may  require
payments of a fee. Since many of the  commitments are expected to expire without
being drawn upon, the total commitment  amount  outstanding does not necessarily
represent total future cash outlay requirements.

         The amount of collateral, if any, required by the Company upon issuance
of a commitment  is based on  management's  credit  evaluation  of the borrower.
Collateral varies,  but may include accounts  receivable,  inventory,  property,
plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.

         Letters of credit and  financial  guarantees  written  are  conditional
agreements issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party.  These agreements are primarily issued to support commercial trade.
Agreements  totalling  $14,052,000 at December 31, 1995 have original maturities
greater than one year. The credit risk involved in issuing  letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
The Company holds  marketable  securities as collateral to support those letters
of credit and guarantees for which  collateral is deemed  necessary.  Letters of
credit and financial  guarantees  outstanding  at December 31, 1995,  range from
unsecured to fully secured.

(15) REGULATORY MATTERS

         The  Banks  are  required  to  maintain   non-interest-bearing  reserve
balances with the Federal  Reserve Bank to fulfill  their reserve  requirements.
The totals of the average balances maintained were approximately  $41,022,000 in
1995 and $42,731,000 in 1994.

         Minimum  regulatory  capital  requirements  have been  established with
respect to banks and bank holding  companies,  expressed in terms of  regulatory
capital  ratios.  At December  31, 1995,  the  Company's  and the Banks'  ratios
satisfied all of the minimum capital requirements.

         Dividends  received from the subsidiary Banks are the primary source of
funds available to Whitney  Holding  Corporation for the declaration and payment
of dividends to the Company's  shareholders.  There are various  regulatory  and
statutory  provisions  that limit the amount of  dividends  that the  subsidiary
Banks may distribute to the Company.  Without prior  regulatory  approvals,  the
Banks will have  available  an amount  equal to  approximately  $37 million plus
their current net income to distribute as dividends in 1996.

(16) MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

         In early  March,  1996,  the  Company  completed  a merger  with  First
Citizens Bancstock,  Inc. ("FCB"),  the parent of The First National Bank in St.
Mary Parish  ("FNB").  FNB, which will merge into the Louisiana  Bank,  operates
eleven banking offices in south Louisiana, with branches in St. Mary, East Baton
Rouge, and Iberia Parishes and a loan production  office in Orleans Parish.  FNB
has total assets of  approximately  $243 million,  $147 million in loans,  total
deposits of $214 million, and shareholders' equity of $27 million. The merger is
intended to qualify as a tax-free  reorganization and will be accounted for as a
pooling of  interests.  FCB  shareholders  received  approximately  2.03 million
shares of  Whitney  Holding  Corporation  common  stock  with a market  value of
approximately  $63  million.  Holders of FCB stock  options at the closing  date
received options to buy approximately  192,000 shares of Company common stock at
a  weighted-average  exercise  price  of  $11.64.  Selected  proforma  financial
information for the pooled companies,  assuming the merger had been completed at
the  beginning of the earliest  year  presented,  is as follows  (unaudited,  in

         On February 17, 1995,  Whitney Bank of Alabama purchased the assets and
assumed the deposit liabilities of the five Mobile branch offices of The Peoples
Bank,  Elba,  Alabama.  The fair value of the tangible assets  acquired  totaled
approximately  $90  million,  including  $47 million in loans and $34 million in
investment   securities  and  federal  funds  sold.  The  Alabama  Bank  assumed
non-interest-bearing   demand  deposits  of  $14  million  and  interest-bearing
transaction,  savings and time deposits totaling $76 million. The purchase price
was  approximately  $12 million.  Operating results from the date of acquisition
are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 1995.

         On March  31,  1994,  the  Company  and the  Louisiana  Bank  purchased
substantially  all of the assets and assumed  the  deposits  and  certain  other
liabilities  of Baton Rouge Bank and Trust  Company.  Included  in the  tangible
assets acquired,  whose fair value totaled approximately $118 million, were cash
and cash items of $41 million,  investment  securities and federal funds sold of
$13  million,  and $59 million in loans,  as well as six banking  offices in the
Baton Rouge area. The deposits  assumed  included  approximately  $24 million in
non-interest-bearing   demand  deposits  and  $94  million  in  interest-bearing
transaction,  savings  and time  deposit  accounts.  As part of the  acquisition
price,  which totaled  approximately  $9 million,  Whitney  Holding  Corporation
issued  90,909  shares  of its  common  stock  with a value of $2  million.  The
operating  results  from  this  acquisition  were  reflected  in  the  Company's
consolidated statements of operations beginning with the second quarter of 1994.

(17) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         The  Company  and  its   subsidiaries  are  parties  to  various  legal
proceedings  arising in the ordinary  course of business.  After  reviewing with
outside  legal  counsel  pending and  threatened  actions,  management is of the
opinion that the ultimate  resolution  of these actions will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

         Management also does not believe that compliance with existing federal,
state or local  environmental  laws and  regulations  will  impose any  material
financial obligation on the Company or materially affect the realizable value of
its assets.

         Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Banks  have  entered   into   material
commitments under non-cancelable leases for facilities or equipment.

           MANAGEMENT REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

         The management of Whitney  Holding  Corporation is responsible  for the
preparation  of the  financial  statements,  related  financial  data and  other
information  in this annual  report.  The financial  statements  are prepared in
accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and include amounts
based on  management's  estimates and  judgement  where  appropriate.  Financial
information  appearing  throughout  this annual  report is  consistent  with the
financial statements.

         The Company's financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP,  independent  public  accountants.  Management has made available to Arthur
Andersen LLP all of the Company's financial records and related data, as well as
the minutes of shareholders' and directors'  meetings.  Furthermore,  management
believes that all  representations  made to Arthur Andersen LLP during its audit
were valid and appropriate.

         Management  of the Company has  established  and  maintains a system of
internal  control that  provides  reasonable  assurance as to the  integrity and
reliability  of  the  financial  statements,   the  protection  of  assets  from
unauthorized use or disposition,  and the prevention and detection of fraudulent
financial  reporting.  The system of internal  control  provides for appropriate
division of responsibility  and is documented by written policies and procedures
that are  communicated  to employees  with  significant  roles in the  financial
reporting process and updated as necessary.  Management continually monitors the
system of  internal  control  for  compliance.  The  Company  maintains a strong
internal control auditing program that independently  assesses the effectiveness
of the internal controls and recommends possible  improvements  thereto. As part
of their audit of the Company's 1995 financial  statements,  Arthur Andersen LLP
considered  the Company's  system of internal  control to the extent they deemed
necessary  to  determine  the nature,  timing and extent of their  audit  tests.
Management  has  considered  the  recommendations  of the internal  auditors and
Arthur Andersen LLP concerning the Company's  system of internal control and has
taken  actions  that it believes  are  cost-effective  in the  circumstances  to
respond appropriately to these recommendations.  Management believes that, as of
December  31,  1995,  the  Company's  system of internal  control is adequate to
accomplish the objectives discussed herein.



                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF WHITNEY HOLDING CORPORATION:

         We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whitney
Holding  Corporation and  subsidiaries (a Louisiana  corporation) as of December
31,  1995 and 1994,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
shareholders'  equity and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1995. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred to above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whitney
Holding  Corporation and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
results  of its  operations  and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

         As discussed in notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective  January 1, 1993,  the Company  changed its methods of accounting  for
income taxes and for post retirement benefits other than pensions.
                                                             Arthur Andersen LLP
New  Orleans,  Louisiana
January 16, 1996 (except
with  respect to the first
paragraph of Note 16 as to
which the date is
March 8, 1996)

                              RESTORATION BENEFITS

         4.1 Special Definitions.  For purposes  of this Article IV, Restoration
Benefit  means a benefit  determined and payable  to a Participant in accordance
with this Article IV.

         The term "Retirement  Election Period" shall mean (a) the 30-day period
commencing  as of the first day of the calendar year  immediately  preceding the
year in which a  Participant  will attain his or her earliest  Early  Retirement
Date  determined  under the Retirement  Plan,  but determined  without regard to
termination  of  employment,  or (b) if an executive  officer is designated as a
Participant hereunder after he or she has attained the earliest Early Retirement
Date (within the meaning of subparagraph  (a)), the 30-day period  commencing as
of the date on which he or she is designated as a Participant hereunder.

         4.2 Time of Payment.  A  Participant's  Restoration  Benefit  hereunder
shall be payable as of such  Participant's  Benefit  Commencement Date. The term
Benefit  Commencement Date shall mean (a) the date designated,  in writing, by a
Participant during his or her Retirement  Election Period,  which date shall not
be earlier than the  Participant's  termination of employment with the Employer,
or (b) if no Benefit  Commencement  Date is designated  in  accordance  with the
provisions of the preceding subparagraph (a), the last day of the calendar month
in which the Participant  terminates his or her employment,  completes 60 months
of Vesting Service or attains age 65, whichever occurs last.

         4.3 Amount of Restoration Benefit.  A Participant's Restoration Benefit
shall  be  the  difference  between a  Participant's  Maximum Benefit and Normal
Retirement Benefit or Early Retirement Benefit, as the case may be.

         For this  purpose,  the terms  "Normal  Retirement  Benefit" and "Early
Retirement  Benefit" shall have the meanings  ascribed to them in the Retirement
Plan. The term "Maximum Benefit" means a Participant's Normal Retirement Benefit
or  Early  Retirement  Benefit,  as the case may be,  subject  to the  following
adjustments:

                  a.       Compensation  shall  be determined  without regard to
                           the  limit  imposed under Code Section 401(a)(17) (or
                           any successor thereto);

                  b.       No  reduction  shall  be  taken  on  account  of  the
                           limitations  imposed  under  Code  Section  415 (or a
                           successor thereto), including,  without limitation, a
                           reduction  to reflect the annual benefit payable from
                           the Retirement Plan;

                  c.       No reduction shall be taken on account of the general
                           test imposed under Code Section 401(a)(4) (or a

                           successor thereto); and

                  d.       Compensation  shall be determined taking into account
                           any amount which a Participant  defers under any plan
                           of deferred compensation  maintained by the Employer,
                           including,  without limitation, the Savings Plus Plan
                           (or any successor thereto), any plan maintained under
                           Code Section 125, and the Whitney Holding Corporation
                           Deferred Compensation Plan (or a successor thereto).

The Plan  Committee  shall  determine the amount of the  Restoration  Benefit in
accordance with the guidelines set forth herein; any such determination shall be
conclusive and binding on all Participants hereunder.

her Retirement Election Period, from among the following:

                           however, that the duration of the guaranteed payments
                           shall not exceed the  number of whole  years  between
                           such Participant's  Benefit Commencement Date and the
                           date on which he or she attains age 80.

                           payments made during the life of the Participant paid
                           to   the   Participant's    Beneficiary   after   the

                  e.       Joint  and  Last  Survivor  Annuity  with  Guaranteed

joint and 100% survivor  annuity (if a  Participant  is married as of his or her
Benefit  Commencement  Date),  or (b) in the form of a single life annuity (if a
Participant is not married as of his or her Benefit Commencement Date).

         4.5 Cash Out of  Small  Benefits.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
Paragraph  4.4  to  the  contrary,  if  the  present  value  of a  Participant's
Restoration  Benefit is $50,000 or less as of his or Benefit  Commencement Date,
the Plan Committee  shall  distribute such amount to the Participant in the form
of an immediate  single-sum payment. No additional benefit shall be payable with
respect to such Participant under this Plan.

         4.6 Actuarial  Assumptions.  For purposes of  determining a Restoration
Benefit hereunder, the Plan Committee shall use, to the extent practicable,  the
actuarial  assumptions  used to determine  benefits under the  Retirement  Plan.
Otherwise,  the Plan Committee shall adopt such actuarial  assumptions as may be
reasonably necessary to determine benefits payable hereunder.

         4.7 Vesting. Any Restoration Benefit payable hereunder shall be subject
to the vesting rules set forth in the Retirement  Plan,  taking into account all
service with the  Employer,  including  any  affiliate of the  Employer.  To the
extent  service  with a  predecessor  employer is taken into  account  under the
vesting provisions of the Retirement Plan, such service shall be taken into

account under this Plan for vesting purposes.

         If a Participant's employment with the Employer is terminated,  for any
reason,  before he or she is fully vested  within the meaning of the  Retirement
Plan, no Restoration Benefit shall be payable from this Plan.

         4.8  Participant   Elections.   Any  elections   permitted  during  the
Retirement Election Period shall be made, in writing, on forms acceptable to the
Plan  Committee.  Such  elections  shall be  effective  upon receipt by the Plan
Committee,  which  shall  not be later  than  the  last  day of a  Participant's
Retirement  Election  Period. A Participant's  elections  hereunder shall become
irrevocable as of the last day of his or her Retirement Election Period.

                                    ARTICLE V

         5.1      Special Definition.  The  term  Death  Benefit  shall  mean  a
                  benefit payable in accordance with this Article V.

         5.2      Participant's  Death  Before  Benefit Commencement Date.  If a
                  Participant  dies before his or her Benefit Commencement Date,
                  a  Death  Benefit  shall be distributed in accordance with the
                  provisions of this Paragraph 5.2:

         a.       Amount.  The  amount  of  the Death Benefit payable under this
                  Paragraph 5.2 shall equal the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined
                  in  the Retirement Plan) of either (i) the Participant's Early
                  Retirement  Benefit  (if  he  or  she  dies  after  his or her
                  earliest  Early  Retirement  Date,  or (ii) the  Participant's
                  Normal  Retirement  Benefit,  computed  as  if  he  or she (1)
                  terminated employment on the date of his or her death, (2) was
                  eligible  for a Normal Retirement  Benefit, (3) retired with a
                  Qualified  Joint  and  Survivor  Annuity  (as  defined  in the
                  Retirement Plan) on his or her Normal Retirement Date, and (4)
                  died on the date after he or she would have reached his or her
                  Normal Retirement Date.

         b.       Form.  A  Death Benefit payable under this Paragraph 5.2 shall
                  automatically  be  distributed  in  the form of the survivor's
                  portion of a Qualified Joint and 50% Survivor Annuity.

         c.       Time.  The  distribution  of  a Death  Benefit hereunder shall
                  commence  as  of  the earlier of (i) the Participant's Benefit
                  Commencement Date, or (ii) the date on  which  the Participant
                  would  have  attained  the  earliest  Early   Retirement  Date
                  determined under the Retirement Plan.

         d.       Beneficiary.  The death benefit  provided under this Paragraph
                  5.2 shall be payable to (i) the Participant's surviving spouse
                  (if he or she is married  on the date of his or her death), or
                  (ii)  the  Participant's  Beneficiary  (if  he  or  she is not
                  married on the date of his or her death.

         5.3  Participant's   Death  After  Benefit   Commencement  Date.  If  a
Participant dies after his or her Benefit  Commencement Date, the Employer shall
pay to the Participant's  Beneficiary the remaining Restoration Benefit, if any,
which would otherwise be payable to the deceased Participant, in accordance with
the method of distribution in effect on the date of the Participant's death.

         5.4 Single-Sum Payment.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article
V to the  contrary,  if the  present  value  of a Death  Benefit  payable  under
Paragraph  5.2  hereof  is  $50,000  or less  determined  as of the  date of the
Participant's  death,  the Plan Committee  shall  distribute  such amount to the
Participant's  surviving spouse or Beneficiary,  as the case may be, in the form
of a single-sum payment,  and no additional benefits shall be payable under this
Plan with respect to such Participant.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                             RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT

         6.1 Benefits  Payable  on  Termination  for Cause.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if a Participant's employment with
the  Employer  is  terminated for Cause before his or her Benefit Commence Date,
the Participant's

104303_4

                                        4

participation  in this Plan shall be terminated and neither the  Participant nor
his or her Beneficiary shall be entitled to any form of benefit under this Plan.

         For  purposes of this  Paragraph  6.1,  the term  "Cause"  means that a
Participant  is found  guilty  (by a court of  competent  jurisdiction),  pleads
guilty or pleads nolo  contendere to any act of fraud or dishonesty  against the
Employer.

         6.2 Early Payments.  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Plan to the
contrary,  the Plan  Committee may distribute or direct the trustee of any trust
established  pursuant to Paragraph 9.2 hereof to  distribute to any  Participant
(or Beneficiary),  in the form of an immediate  single-sum  payment,  all or any
portion of a Participant's  Restoration Benefit, if an Adverse  Determination is
made with  respect to such  Participant.  For this  purpose,  the term  "Adverse
Determination"  shall  mean  that,  based upon  Federal  tax or  revenue  law, a
published  or private  ruling or  similar  announcement  issued by the  Internal
Revenue  Service,  a  regulation  issued by the  Secretary  of the  Treasury,  a
decision by a court of competent  jurisdiction,  a closing  agreement made under
Section  7121 of the Code that is approved by the Internal  Revenue  Service and
involves such  Participant or a determination  of counsel,  a Participant has or
will recognize income for Federal income tax purposes with respect to any amount
that is or will be payable  under this Plan  before it is  otherwise  to be paid
hereunder.

         Further, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
Plan  Committee  may direct the  trustee of any trust  established  pursuant  to
Paragraph  9.2  hereof  to  distribute  to any  Participant  in the  form  of an
immediate  single-sum payment all or any portion of a Participant's  Restoration
Benefit,  based upon a change in ERISA, a published  advisory opinion or similar
announcement  issued by the  Department  of Labor,  a  regulation  issued by the
Secretary  of  Labor,  a  decision  by a court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  an
agreement between such Participant and the Department of Labor or similar agency
or an opinion of counsel,  such  Participant  is not a  "management"  or "highly
compensated"  employee or this Plan is not an "unfunded" plan within the meaning
of ERISA.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                               PLAN ADMINISTRATION

         7.1  Powers.  This  Plan  and all  matters  related  thereto  shall  be
administered by the Plan Committee.  The Plan Committee shall have the power and
authority to  interpret  the  provisions  of this Plan and shall  determine  all
questions arising under this Plan including,  without limitation,  all questions
concerning  administration,  eligibility,  and the amount of any benefit payable
hereunder.  In  addition,  the  Plan  Committee  shall  have  the  authority  to
prescribe,  amend, and rescind rules and administrative  procedures  relating to
the operation of this Plan, to instruct any trustee as to the  investment of any
asset held for the purposes  described in Paragraph  9.2 hereof,  and to correct
any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Plan.

         Any  determination  by the Plan Committee need not be uniform as to all
or any Participants  hereunder.  Any such determination  shall be conclusive and
binding on all persons.
         7.2 Payments.  The Plan Committee shall have the power and authority to
determine the time, method, and amount of any distribution  hereunder.  The Plan
Committee  shall  direct  the  trustee  of any  trust  established  pursuant  to
Paragraph 9.2 hereof, in writing, as to any such distribution or withdrawal. Any
withdrawal on account of an early  payment made in  accordance  with Article VI,
hereof,   shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  an  advance  against  the  affected
Participant's Restoration Benefit.

         7.3  Delegation  of  Administrative   Authority;   Experts.   The  Plan
Committee,   in  its  sole  discretion,   may  delegate  such  nondiscretionary,
ministerial duties as it deems appropriate to the Human Resources  Department of
Whitney  National Bank. When acting in accordance with such delegation  (whether
made orally or in writing)  the Human  Resources  Department  shall be deemed to
possess the power and authority  granted to the Plan  Committee  hereunder.  The
Plan  Committee  shall  engage  the  services  of  such  independent  actuaries,
accountants,  attorneys and other administrative personnel as it deems necessary
to administer the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                              PARTICIPANTS' RIGHTS

         8.1      Spendthrift Provision.  Neither  a  Participant  nor any other
person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign,

104303_4

                                        5

<PAGE>



transfer,  pledge,  anticipate,  mortgage or  otherwise  encumber any benefit or
amount  payable  hereunder.  No amount  payable under this Plan shall,  prior to
actual payment,  be subject to seizure or  sequestration  for the payment of any
debt,  judgment,  alimony or separate  maintenance  owed by a Participant or any
other  person.  No amount  payable  under  this Plan  shall be  transferable  by
operation of law in the event of a Participant's or other person's bankruptcy or
insolvency.

         8.2 Plan Not an Employment Agreement.  This Plan shall not be deemed to
constitute an employment agreement between  the parties, nor shall any provision
restrict the right of the Employer to  discharge any  Participant as an employee
of the Employer.

         8.3 Offset.  If,  at   the  time  of  any  distribution   hereunder,  a
Participant,  his or her Beneficiary, or both are indebted to the Employer, then
any distribution to be made to the Participant,  his or her Beneficiary or both,
may,  at the  discretion  of the  Employer,  be  reduced  by the  amount of such
indebtedness.

         8.4 Obligation for Benefit Payments.  Notwithstanding  any provision of
this Plan to the contrary,  the payment of benefits under this Plan shall remain
the  obligation  of the  Employer.  In  the  event  the  Employer  designates  a
third-party as the payor of the benefits and the assets of such  third-party are
insufficient  to meet the payment  obligations  of the Employer under this Plan,
the Employer shall remain responsible for such deficiency.

         8.5 Taxes.  The Employer or any  third-party  payor shall withhold from
the  payment  benefits  hereunder  any  amount  required  to be  withheld  under
applicable federal or state tax laws.

         8.6 Employer's  Protection.  By commencing  participation  herein, each
Participant  shall be deemed to have agreed to  cooperate  with the  Employer by
furnishing any and all information reasonably requested by the Plan Committee in
order to  facilitate  the funding or payment of benefits  hereunder,  including,
without limitation,  the taking of such physical examinations as the Employer or
the Plan may deem  necessary  and taking such other action as may  reasonably be
requested by the Employer or the Plan  Committee.  If a  Participant  refuses to
cooperate, is uninsurable or is insurable at other than standard rates, the Plan
Committee,  in its  sole  discretion,  may  determine  that the  Participant  is
ineligible to participate hereunder.

         If  insurance  on the  life of any  Participant  is  obtained  and such
Participant  commits suicide during the two-year period beginning on the date of
his or her  participation  in this Plan or if a Participant  hereunder makes any
material  misstatement of information or nondisclosure  of medical history,  the
Plan Committee,  in its sole discretion,  may terminate the participation of any
such Participant, without liability for benefit payments hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         9.1  Termination  of Plan.  The Board of Directors  of Whitney  Holding
Corporation  shall have the right, at any time, to terminate this Plan, in whole
or in part.  The  termination  of this Plan  shall not  reduce  any  Restoration
Benefit accrued as of the effective date of such termination,  without the prior
written consent of each affected  Participant.  Notwithstanding any provision of
this Plan or the Retirement  Plan to the contrary,  the termination of this Plan
shall cause the benefits payable hereunder to be fully vested and nonforfeitable
as to any affected Participant.

         9.2 Funding.  The Employer may establish a trust in connection with the
adoption of this Plan.  Each year during the  continuance of this Plan, the Plan
Committee may designate amounts to be added to the trust.

         The property  comprising  the assets of any such trust,  including  any
insurance  policy on the life of a  Participant  purchased  by any such trust or
contributed  to any such trust by the  Employer,  shall at all times  remain the
property of such  trust.  The  trustee of any such trust  shall  distribute  the
assets  comprising such trust in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and
the trust  agreement,  all as instructed by the Plan Committee,  but in no event
shall such trustee distribute the assets of any such trust to or for the benefit
of the Employer, except as provided in any applicable trust agreement.

         No Participant  or Beneficiary  shall have the right to, or claim under
or against,  any insurance policy on the life of the Participant obtained by the
Employer  or any  asset  held in  trust to help  defray  the  cost  incurred  in
providing  benefits under this Plan. Any such policy or other property shall be,
and remain, a general, unpledged asset of the Employer or the trust, as the case
may be.

         9.3 Inurement.  This Plan shall be binding upon and shall insure to the
benefit of the Employer and each Participant  hereto and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

         9.4  Amendments  and  Modifications.  Except as  specifically  provided
herein,  this Plan may be changed or altered by written instrument signed by the
Board of Directors of Whitney Holding Corporation;  provided,  however,  that no
such  amendment  or  modification,  shall  reduce the amount of any  Restoration
Benefit  accrued  hereunder as of the date of any such amendment or modification
without the prior written consent of each affected Participant.

         9.5 Governing Law.  This Plan is governed  by  the laws of the State of
Louisiana,  in  all  respects,  including  matters of construction, validity and
performance.

         EXECUTED December 1995, in multiple  counterparts,  each of which shall
be deemed an original, to be effective as of the date first written above.
