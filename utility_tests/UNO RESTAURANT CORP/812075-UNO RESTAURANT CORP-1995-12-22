ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

GENERAL AND DEVELOPMENTS DURING FISCAL YEAR 1995

        The Company owns and operates or franchises a total of 150 restaurants,
including 80 owned and 60 franchised  casual dining, full-service restaurants
under the name "Pizzeria Uno...Chicago Bar & Grill." The Pizzeria Uno
restaurants offer a diverse, high-quality menu at moderate prices in a casual,
friendly atmosphere. The restaurants feature the Company's signature
Chicago-style deep- dish pizza and a selection of entrees, including thin crust
pizza, pasta, fajitas, ribs, steak and chicken, as well as a variety of
appetizers, salads, sandwiches and desserts. The Company's restaurants average
approximately 6,200 square feet with seating for an average of approximately
180 guests.  For the fiscal year ended October 1, 1995, Company-owned
restaurants averaged $1,925,000 in sales.  Company-owned restaurants are
located predominantly in the Northeast and Mid- Atlantic states, and franchised
restaurants are located throughout the United States.

        In fiscal 1993, the Company began implementing strategic initiatives
intended to strengthen its position in casual dining and to distinguish its
restaurants from quick service pizza, pizza and pasta, and full-service Italian
restaurants.  As part of this strategy, during fiscal 1994, the Company
invested approximately $2.5 million in new kitchen capabilities, including
saute stations, grills and fryers, for its Company-owned restaurants enabling
the Company to enhance the quality, breadth and appeal of its non-pizza menu
items. To better communicate its concept and broadened menu to consumers, the
Company refined the name of its restaurants to  Pizzeria Uno ...Chicago Bar &
Grill  and upgraded the design and decor of its restaurants to be consistent
with its casual dining theme. In addition, in fiscal 1993, the Company
increased the size of its deep-dish pizzas to provide greater value and added
additional restaurant managers in many of its higher volume units to improve
overall service. The Company believes these strategic initiatives directly
contributed to an increase in its average guest check and increases in
comparable store sales of 3.3% in fiscal 1995.

        The Company recently has been expanding its channels of distribution to
capitalize on the Pizzeria Uno brand name and the appeal of its signature
Chicago- style deep-dish pizza. Currently, the Company is distributing
refrigerated and frozen Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to approximately 900
supermarkets, primarily in New England, for sale in their fresh deli counters
and frozen food sections.  Since January 1993, the Company has also been
supplying frozen Pizzeria Uno brand, Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to American
Airlines for service on its flights.  Approximately 1.7 million Pizzeria Uno
brand pizzas were served aboard American Airlines flights during fiscal 1995.
The Company is testing a similar pizza product at Pizzeria Uno kiosks in 14
General Cinema theaters. The Company also operates four neighborhood,
limited-seating take-out units under the name "Uno...Pizza Takery." These units
are located in strip centers, occupy approximately 2,000 square feet and offer
limited seating for up to 40 customers.


        The Company acquired the rights to the name "Pizzeria Uno" from the
late Ike Sewell, who opened the original Pizzeria Uno restaurant in Chicago,
Illinois in 1943 and is considered the originator of Chicago-style deep-dish
pizza. The Company opened its first Pizzeria Uno restaurant in 1979.

                                     -3-

        During the fiscal year ended October 1, 1995, the Company opened 16
full-service Company-owned restaurants, and exchanged ownership of its
restaurant in Fairview Heights, Illinois for a competitor s restaurant in
Orlando, Florida.  Five franchised restaurants opened during the fiscal year,
and five closed.


        During the fiscal year ending September 29, 1996, the Company
anticipates opening up to 12 Company-owned full-service restaurants and up to
10 franchised restaurants.  The timing of these planned openings is subject to
various factors, including locating satisfactory sites and negotiating leases
and franchise agreements.

        In December, 1994, the Company purchased three Bay Street Grill
restaurants located in Schaumburg, Illinois; Woodbridge, New Jersey; and
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The three full-service, casual dining restaurants,
which specialize in seafood, generated total annual sales of  $6.6 million
during fiscal 1995. The Company has no current plans to open additional Bay
Street Grill restaurants.

        In December 1994, the Company obtained a $50 million unsecured,
revolving credit and term loan facility through Fleet Bank.  The new facility
replaced a $20 million unsecured revolving credit facility.  The new revolving
credit facility will convert to a three year term loan in December 1997, and
advances under this agreement will accrue interest at either the bank's prime
rate plus .25%, or alternatively, at 100-150 basis points above LIBOR.

        On October 26, 1995, the Company entered into a five year interest rate
swap agreement with Fleet Bank involving the exchange of floating rate interest
payment obligations for fixed rate interest payment obligations. The notional
amount of this interest rate swap agreement was $20 million. The Company
entered into this agreement in order to manage interest costs and risks
associated with fluctuating interest rates.

        The Board of Directors of the Company declared a 25% stock split on
November 15, 1994 payable in the form of a stock dividend on February 28, 1995
to the stockholders of record of the Company on February 8, 1995.  The stock
split resulted in one additional share of Common Stock being issued for each
four shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the record date.  Cash 
was issued in lieu of fractional shares.

        During June 1995, the Company completed a secondary public equity
offering of 2.3 million shares of its Common Stock underwritten by Montgomery
Securities.  The Company received $22.6 million in net proceeds from the
offering.

        In October 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the
repurchase of up to a total of 1.5 million shares of the Company s Common Stock
in the market from time to time during the subsequent six months.  This
superseded the Board of Directors  previous authorization in July 1995 for the
repurchase of up to a total of 500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. As
of November 30, 1995, the Company had repurchased a total of 494,100 shares of
its Common Stock at prices between $7.00 and $8.25 per share.


RESTAURANT CONCEPT AND MENU

        Pizzeria Uno restaurants are full-service, casual dining restaurants,
featuring the Company's signature Chicago-style deep-dish pizza and a diverse
menu of high quality, moderately-priced menu items. The Company's target market
is middle to upper-middle income individuals in the 17 to 49 year-old age
group. The restaurants are 

                                     -4-
<PAGE>   5
generally open from 11:00 a.m. to midnight, seven days per week.

        The restaurants feature the Company's signature Chicago-style deep-dish
pizzas and a selection of entrees, including thin crust pizza, pastas, fajitas,
ribs, steak and chicken, as well as a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches
and desserts. The Company's signature product, its Chicago-style, deep-dish
pizza, filled with ingredients such as fresh meats, spices, vegetables and real
cheeses, is baked according to proprietary recipes. The Company believes that
its proprietary recipes produce a superior pizza that is difficult to
duplicate. In fiscal 1994, the Company invested approximately $2.5 million in
new kitchen capabilities, including saute stations, grills and fryers, for its
Company-owned restaurants enabling the Company to enhance the quality, breadth
and appeal of its non-pizza items.  At the end of fiscal 1995, the Company's
average check per guest for full service Company-owned restaurants was
approximately $9.50.  For fiscal 1995, sales of alcoholic beverages accounted
for approximately 18% of total restaurant sales.

RESTAURANT DESIGN AND SITE SELECTION

        The Company has recently upgraded the design and decor of its
restaurants to be consistent with its theme as "Pizzeria Uno...Chicago Bar &
Grill." Pizzeria Uno restaurants are designed and decorated to provide a
friendly and comfortable atmosphere expected of full-service, casual dining
restaurants and distinguished from typical pizza restaurants. The decor of each
restaurant emphasizes quality with wood, brick and brass. To ensure quality and
compliance with Company standards, preliminary exterior design and complete
interior and kitchen design for all Company-owned and franchised restaurants
are prepared by the Company. The Company's current prototype free-standing
restaurant occupies approximately 6,400 square feet, with a seating capacity of
approximately 200 customers.

        The Company considers the specific location of a restaurant to be
critical to its long-term success and devotes significant effort to the
investigation and evaluation of potential sites. One or more of the Company's
executive officers inspect and approve the site for each Company-owned and
franchised restaurant.  Within each target market area, the Company evaluates
population density and demographics, major retail and office concentration and
traffic patterns. In addition, the Company evaluates visibility, accessibility,
proximity to direct competition and various other site specific factors.
Pizzeria Uno restaurants are located in both urban and suburban markets, in
free-standing buildings, strip centers and malls. Restaurant development is
currently targeted at high profile, free-standing locations.

        Historically, the Company has leased most of its restaurants to
minimize investment costs. Since fiscal 1992, however, the Company began
selectively purchasing real estate to develop new restaurants where available
and when the expected long-term cost of owning the real estate is less than the
cost of leasing. Of the 88 Company-owned restaurants open as of November 30,
1995, 74 are located in leased facilities and 14 are fee owned properties. See
"Item 2. - Properties."

UNIT ECONOMICS

        For the fiscal year ended October 1, 1995, the 62 Company-owned
restaurants open for the entire fiscal year generated average restaurant sales
of approximately  $1,935,000, average restaurant operating income of
approximately $279,000 (or 14.4% of sales) and average restaurant cash flow of
approximately $410,000 (or 21.2% of sales).  The 23 Company-owned restaurants
opened in fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995 had an average cash investment of
approximately $1,545,000 for building, leasehold improvements, furniture,
fixtures and equipment, but excluding land costs and pre-opening expenses. 
The Company expects that the average cash investment required to open a
full-service Pizzeria Uno restaurant will be approximately $1.5  million,
excluding land and pre-operating expenses.  In the future, the Company
anticipates that it will continue to purchase a portion of its new restaurant
locations and expects that its total investment for each fee owned unit will be
approximately $2.0 to $2.5 million.

RESTAURANT EXPANSION

        The Company intends to continue opening Company-owned restaurants in
two of its primary metropolitan markets, New York and Baltimore/Washington,
D.C.  The Company is also engaged in site development efforts in Chicago,
Orlando and Denver. Due to its current concentration of restaurants in New
England, future expansion in this market will be more selective. In fiscal
1995, the Company opened 16 restaurants, and exchanged ownership of one
restaurant in metropolitan St. Louis for a competitor's restaurant in Orlando,
Florida.  The Company expects to open approximately 12 restaurants in fiscal
1996.

        The  Company will continue to grant franchisees the right to expand the
Pizzeria Uno restaurant business throughout the United States and, as
opportunities arise, outside the United States.  In fiscal 1995, five
franchised restaurants were opened, and five franchised restaurants were
closed.  During fiscal 1996, the Company expects franchisees to open
approximately 10 restaurants.  See "-- Franchise Program."


OTHER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

        The  Company has recently been expanding its consumer product business
principally through distribution of its deep-dish pizza in the fresh deli
counters and frozen food sections of approximately 900 supermarkets  in New
England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Currently, Pizzeria Uno
deep-dish pizza is the leading brand of fresh, refrigerated pizza sold in New
England supermarkets.  The Company also is currently supplying private-label
thin-crust pizza to selected New England supermarket chains. In addition, in
January 1993, the Company began supplying frozen deep-dish pizzas to American
Airlines for service on its flights. Approximately 1.7 million pizzas were
served aboard American Airlines flights during fiscal 1995.  During 1995, the
Company also began distributing frozen deep-dish pizza to two wholesale club
chains. Finally, the Company is testing the sale of frozen pizzas at Pizzeria
Uno kiosks currently located in 14 General Cinema movie theaters.  To support
the growth of the Company's consumer product business, a production facility in
Brockton, Massachusetts began operation in January 1993.  The Company expanded
the facility later in fiscal 1993 and further expanded the facility in  fiscal
1995. See "Item 2 - Properties."

        The  Company  is continuing  to  test  other traditional  and
non-traditional distribution channels for its signature, deep-dish  pizza
product. The Company is currently operating four limited-seating take-out units
with the name "Uno...Pizza 

                                     -8-
<PAGE>   9
Takery." The units are located in strip centers, occupy approximately
2,000 square feet and offer limited seating for up to 40 customers.

        In December 1994, the Company purchased three Bay Street Grill
restaurants located in Schaumburg, Illinois; Woodbridge, New Jersey; and 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Bay Street  Grill restaurants are
full-service, casual dining restaurants, which specialize in seafood. The
Company has no current plans to open additional Bay Street Grill restaurants.

RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT

        The staff for a typical Pizzeria Uno restaurant consists of one general
manager, two assistant managers and approximately 50 to 70 hourly employees,
many of whom are part-time personnel.  Managers of Company-owned restaurants
are compensated with a salary plus a performance bonus based on  restaurant
sales and profits.  The Company believes that turnover among the Company's
restaurant managers is below the industry average.


        The Company conducts an initial ten-week training program for all
managers and franchisees focusing on restaurant operations.  There is
continuing training of Company-owned restaurant managers through specialized
training programs and regular meetings that emphasize the areas of leadership,
quality of food preparation and service.  The Company requires its food
handling personnel and alcohol serving employees to participate in a training
program to ensure the sanitary and responsible service of food and alcohol. 
The training program is conducted on an ongoing basis.  The Company also holds
quarterly regional meetings and an annual national meeting of franchisees and
Company managers which focus on continuing training in marketing, new products,
site selection and aspects of business management.

        Each Company-owned restaurant manager and franchisee is required to
comply with an extensive operations manual which contains detailed standards
and specifications for all elements of operations.  The Company generally
visits franchisees on a quarterly basis, but continuing training of franchised  
restaurant managers is the responsibility of the franchisees.
                
        The Company employs three operations vice presidents and 13 regional
operations directors.  The Company also currently employs three field-service
supervisors to monitor all franchised restaurants.  Their duties  include
quarterly visits and detailed, annual inspections of quality,  service and
sanitation. As additional restaurants are opened, the Company intends to add
qualified supervisors in order to maintain quality control.

PURCHASING


        The Company negotiates directly with suppliers for all  primary food
ingredients and beverage products to ensure adequate  supplies and to obtain
competitive prices.  The Company seeks competitive bids from suppliers on many
of its primary food ingredients on a periodic basis no less than annually for
each supplier.  The Company approves suppliers of these ingredients and
products and requires its suppliers to adhere to product specifications
established by the Company.  Several key  ingredients are proprietary. They are
manufactured for the Company under  private label and sold to authorized
distributors for resale to Company-owned restaurants and franchisees.  The
Company and its  franchisees purchase substantially all food and beverage
products from  authorized local or national distributors.  In some cases,
franchisees find  it more economical to purchase most of these products from
the same distributors

                                     -9-
<PAGE>   10
servicing the Company-owned restaurants in order to take advantage of
volume discounts.  The Company does not derive any income from suppliers or
distributors on sales to franchisees.  All essential food and beverage products
are available, or upon short notice can be made available, from alternative
qualified suppliers.

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING

        For fiscal 1995, the Company spent 2.7% of restaurant and consumer
product sales on advertising and marketing.  The Company relies primarily on
television, radio, direct mail and print advertising.  Through an advertising
cooperative fund, the Company prepares regional and local advertising materials
and also produces menus and promotional programs for both franchised and
Company-owned restaurants.

        Franchisees are required to contribute a fee of up to 1.0% of
franchised restaurant sales to the advertising cooperative fund, and the
Company contributes an equal percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales.
Except for the materials prepared and distributed by the Company through the
advertising cooperative fund, franchisees are responsible for the
implementation of advertising and marketing for their respective restaurants,
subject to adherence to Company-established guidelines. In  addition, the
Company's franchise agreement requires  franchisees to spend at least 2% of
franchised restaurant sales each year on local advertising and public
relations.
          
FRANCHISE PROGRAM

        As of October 1, 1995, the Company had 61 franchised Pizzeria Uno
restaurants operated by 34 franchisees located in 18 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada.  Historically, franchises were granted on  a
unit-by-unit basis, rather than by territory.  The Company is currently
pursuing territory development with franchisees for construction of one or more
restaurants over a certain period of time and within a certain geographic area. 
For example, the Company recently signed an area franchise agreement with a
Portland, Oregon franchisee covering several counties in Oregon requiring the
franchisee to open four restaurants prior to March 31, 2000.  The Company is in
continual discussions with existing and prospective  franchisees for the
development of certain geographic areas and expects to grant additional
franchises to qualified applicants with restaurant- related operating
experience and requisite financial resources.  

        New domestic franchisees are required to pay at the time the
development agreement is signed a nonrefundable fee of $10,000 per restaurant
committed to be developed.  The Company's current franchise agreement also
requires franchisees to pay a unit franchise fee of $30,000 per restaurant
before signing a franchise agreement for a specific location and a continuing
monthly royalty of 5%  of restaurant sales.  Royalties and franchise fees for
international  franchises are negotiated on an individual basis.  Royalties
received by the Company averaged 4.4% of franchised restaurant sales for the
fiscal year ended October 1, 1995.  At the beginning of fiscal 1992, the
Company implemented a variable royalty plan that allows royalty rate reductions
from contractual rates for those franchised restaurants meeting certain
criteria.  It is available only to those franchised restaurants that do not
achieve minimum sales levels during their first five years of operation in  
relation to their overall capital investment, including capitalized lease
obligations.  The minimum royalty rate under the variable royalty plan is 3%
and ranges up to 5%.  Seven franchised restaurants currently qualify for some
degree of royalty rate reduction under the variable royalty plan.   

        The Company receives weekly and monthly sales reports from its
franchisees and, 

                                     -10-
<PAGE>   11
in addition, conducts test sales audits of all franchisees on an annual
basis.  Based upon these reports, the Company believes that the average
annualized sales for its franchised restaurants in fiscal 1995 was
approximately $1.4 million.

        The franchise agreements generally prohibit the Company from granting
competing franchises or opening competing restaurants within three miles of a
franchised restaurant. The franchise agreements have an initial term of 20
years with three successive ten-year renewal periods at the option of the
franchisee, provided that the agreement has not previously been terminated by
either party.  Upon each renewal, the Company may require a franchisee to sign
a revised franchise agreement and to make capital expenditures to renovate the
restaurant, but may not increase the continuing monthly royalty or charge a
renewal fee. The Company retains the right to terminate a franchise agreement
for a variety of reasons, including significant and willful understatement of
gross receipts, failure to pay fees, material misrepresentation on an
application for a franchise, or material breach or default under the franchise
agreement, including failure to maintain Company operating standards. Many
state franchise laws limit the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse
to renew a franchise. The Company has the right to audit and receive certain
monthly and annual financial and other information from franchisees.

        The Company's initial training program for franchisees is similar to
its training program for management trainees and employees in Company-owned
restaurants. See "-- Restaurant Management." In order to ensure uniform quality
standards, the Company requires franchisees to comply with Company
specifications as to space, design and decor, menu items, principal food
ingredients and day-to-day operations, as set forth in the Company's operations
manual. The Company's executives or field-service personnel generally visit
each franchise location at least four times per year.

        The Company guarantees certain limited equipment and leasehold
improvement financing to qualified franchisees through an agreement with an
unaffiliated finance company. Under this agreement, the Company guarantees
financing provided by the finance company to qualified franchisees in the
maximum aggregate amount of $2 million for all franchisees combined. The
Company has also guaranteed up to a maximum of $431,000 of future lease
payments in the event of default by specific franchisees.

COMPETITION

        The restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to price,
service and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes,
economic conditions and population and traffic patterns. There is also intense
competition for real estate sites, personnel and qualified franchisees. The
Company competes within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as
with national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more
restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories
than the Company.

EMPLOYEES        

        The Company employed approximately 5,815 persons, 118 of whom were
corporate personnel and 333 of whom were field service or restaurant managers
or trainees.  The remaining employees were restaurant personnel, many of whom
were part-time. Of the 118 corporate employees, 62 were in management positions
and 56 were general office employees.

        The Company considers its employee relations to be good. None of the
Company's employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements except for
employees of its 

                                     -11-

<PAGE>   12
three Restaurants in urban Chicago who are members of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union of the AFL-CIO,
and who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the Company
through November 30, 1996.

TRADEMARKS

        The Company regards its many trademarks and service marks as having
significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its
products. Its most significant marks include "Uno," "Pizzeria Uno," "Pizzeria
Due" and "Bay Street."  The Company's registrations of its significant marks
are subject to renewal at various times from 1998 to 2005. However, the Company
intends to renew its registration of such marks prior to expiration. The
Company has applied for federal registration of the trademark "Pizzeria Uno . .
 . Chicago Bar & Grill." The Company's policy is to pursue registration of its
marks whenever possible and to oppose strenuously any infringement of its
marks.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

        The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws
affecting its business. Each of the Company's restaurants is subject to
licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may
include alcoholic beverage control, health and safety and fire agencies in the
state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties or
failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent
the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.

        Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of the Company's
restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and
municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on
the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked
or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations
relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the Company's
restaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of
operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, and handling,
storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

        The Company may be subject in certain states to "dram-shop" statutes,
which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to
recover damages from an establishment which wrongfully served alcoholic
beverages to such person. The Company carries liquor liability coverage as part
of its existing comprehensive general liability insurance.

        The Company is also subject to federal and a substantial number of
state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Such laws impose
registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale
of franchises. These laws often also apply substantive standards to the
relationship between franchisor and franchisee and limit the ability of a
franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.

        The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of various federal,
state and local health agencies, including the United States Food and Drug
Administration (the "FDA") and the United States Department of Agriculture. The
FDA specifies standards for nutrition content claims and health claims made in
connection with food items offered in the Company's restaurants. The FDA also
prescribes the format and content of nutrition information required to appear
on labels of certain products,  

                                     -12-

including the Company's line of fresh and frozen items sold through 
supermarkets.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
- -------------------

        The Company owns a 30,000 square foot production plant in Brockton,
Massachusetts.  The production plant produces frozen product for service aboard
American Airlines flights, as well as fresh, refrigerated pizzas that are sold
at deli counters in approximately 900 supermarkets in New England, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio.  This facility provides sufficient capacity
to support double the level of sales achieved in fiscal 1995.  See "ITEM 1.
Other Business Development."

        Prior to fiscal 1992, all Company-owned restaurants were located in
leased space.  However, during fiscal 1992, the Company purchased real estate
to develop new restaurants in Portland, Maine, Lynnfield, Massachusetts and
Hyannis, Massachusetts, and also purchased the real estate related to its three
urban Chicago restaurants; during fiscal 1993 the Company purchased real estate
to develop new restaurants in Orlando, Florida; during fiscal 1994 in Amherst,
New York, and  Paoli and Franklin Mills, Pennsylvania; and in fiscal 1995, in
Potomac, Virginia,  Schaumburg, Illinois, Denver, Colorado and Williamsburg,
Virginia.  During fiscal 1996, the Company intends to purchase approximately
four additional restaurant properties.

        The leases for Company-owned restaurants typically have initial terms
of 20 years with certain renewal options and provide for a base rent plus real
estate taxes, insurance and other expenses, plus additional percentage rents
based on revenues of the restaurant.  All of the Company's franchised
restaurants are in space leased from parties unaffiliated with the Company,
with the exception of one franchised restaurant which is subleased from the
Company.  Franchised restaurant leases typically have lease terms through the
initial term of the franchise agreements.

        One of the Company-owned restaurants in Boston, Massachusetts is
located on the first floor of a six-story office building owned by Aaron D.
Spencer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Spencer has
leased the entire building to the Company pursuant to a five-year lease, ending
on March 29, 1997, at a rent of $162,000 per year.  The rent will be increased
by 12% of the cost of any improvements to the building made by Mr. Spencer. 
The Company is responsible for all taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and
repairs.  The lease may be terminated by either the Company or Mr. Spencer upon
six months prior notice.  If Mr. Spencer or the Company terminates the lease, a
new lease between the Company and Mr. Spencer relating only to the restaurant
space of the building will become effective immediately.  The new lease will
have a five-year term with two five-year renewal options.  Rent under the new
lease will be 6.5% of total restaurant revenues but with a minimum rent,
determined by independent appraisal, equal to the fair market rent at the time
the new lease becomes effective.  The Company currently sublets all but the
restaurant space at rents which approximate the $162,000 annual rent that it is
obligated to pay Mr. Spencer.  Management believes that the terms of both the
existing lease and the new lease which will become effective upon termination
of the existing lease are comparable to those otherwise available in the real
estate market.

        The Company's executive offices are located in two adjacent buildings
in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.  The first, a three-story building owned by Mr.
Spencer, is leased to the Company pursuant to a five-year lease, commencing on
March 30, 1987, with options to renew for two additional five-year periods.
Rent during the initial term of the lease was $30,000 per year.   Currently,
the first of the two five-year options has been exercised at a rate of $36,000
per year.  During the final option period, rent will be equal to fair market
rent, but may not be less than the rent under the lease during the immediately
preceding term.  The value of any leasehold improvements made by the Company
will not be considered in determining fair market 

                                     -15-

value rent.  The Company added the third floor to the building.  The
Company is responsible for all taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and
repairs.  The second, a two-story building owned by Mr. Spencer's children, is
also leased to the Company pursuant to a 15 year lease commencing on February
1, 1990, with options to renew for three additional five-year periods.  Rent
during the first five years of the initial term of the lease was $106,800 per
year, increasing to $128,160 per year for the next five years, and to $153,792
for the final five years of the initial term of the lease.  The Company is
responsible for all taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and repairs.  Rent
during any option period will be 120% of the rent for the prior term of the
lease.  Management believes that the terms of the leases for the two offices
are as favorable as otherwise available in the real estate market.  With the
two buildings, the executive offices currently consist of approximately 25,000
square feet and house the Company's executive, administrative and clerical
offices.

        As of October 1, 1995, there were approximately 4,300 beneficial owners
of the Company's Common Stock.

DIVIDENDS                     

        The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock and
for the foreseeable future intends to continue its policy of retaining earnings
to finance the development and growth of the Company.  The Board of Directors
may reconsider this policy from time to time in light of conditions then
existing, including the Company's earnings performance, financial condition and
capital requirements.  Pursuant to both the private placement in June 1990 of
$10 million of senior, unsecured notes with a major insurance company, and a
$50 million unsecured revolving and term credit agreement obtained in December
1994, the Company became subject to various financial and operating covenants,
including limitations on the payment of cash dividends.  The most restrictive
limitations, in general, preclude the Company from paying cash dividends, if
such payment, when aggregated with certain other payments, would exceed 35% of
net income for the then most recent four-quarter period or would cause certain
net tangible asset and debt ratios to be exceeded.

        On November 15, 1994, the Board of Directors declared a five-for-four
stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid in shares of the
Company s Common Stock on February 28, 1995 to stockholders of record on
February 8, 1995.

(1) Percentage of restaurant and consumer product sales

</TABLE>

FISCAL YEAR 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1994

        Total revenues increased 28% to $158.7 million in fiscal 1995 from
$124.1 million the prior year.  Company-owned restaurant sales increased 29.7%
to $146.1 million due primarily to a 21.4% increase in operating weeks of
full-service Pizzeria Uno restaurants resulting from the addition of 16
restaurants during the past four quarters, as well as the purchase of three Bay
Street Grill restaurants in December 1994.  The increase in restaurant sales was
also due to a 3.3% increase in comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended
October 1, 1995.

        Consumer product sales increased 14.3% to $8.5 million from $7.4 million
in fiscal 1994 due to higher sales of Pizzeria Uno brand and private label
refrigerated pizza, as well as increased shipments of frozen pizza for tests by
customers outside New England.

        Franchise income increased 3.9% to $4.1 million in fiscal 1995 from $4.0
million  the prior year.  Royalty income increased 4.7% to $4.0 million
principally due to an increase in comparable store sales of 2.4% for the year.
Initial franchise fees totaled $125,000 for fiscal 1995 compared to $150,000 in
fiscal 1994.

                                     -21-
<PAGE>   22
        Cost of food and beverages as a percentage of restaurant and consumer
product sales increased to 25.5% for fiscal 1995 from 25.1%  the prior year.
This percentage cost increase primarily reflected changes in sales mix toward a
larger percentage of higher-cost non-pizza menu items.

        Labor and benefits as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product
sales decreased slightly to 30.6% for fiscal 1995 from 30.8%  the prior year,
principally due to the leverage of higher comparable store sales.

        Occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product
sales declined to 14.8% for fiscal 1995 from 15.8% the prior year, primarily
due to an increased number of owned restaurant properties and the operating
leverage provided by the increase in comparable store sales noted above.

        Other operating costs declined as a percentage of restaurant and
consumer product sales to 8.8% for fiscal 1995  from 9.0%  the prior year,
principally due to the operating leverage provided by the increase in
comparable store sales.

        General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total
revenues to 7.1% for fiscal 1995 from 7.5% the prior year as a result of
allocating certain fixed expenses over a larger revenue base.

        Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of restaurant
and consumer product sales increased to 7.0% for fiscal 1995 from 6.4% the
prior year, principally due to increased amortization of pre-opening costs
associated with the higher rate of unit growth.

        Operating income increased 30.0% to $13.4 million for fiscal 1995
compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 1994.  The operating profit margin improved
slightly to 8.4% from 8.3%, primarily as a result of the increase in
Company-owned restaurants and comparable store sales.

        Other expense increased to $1,944,000 or 1.2% as a percentage of total
revenues in fiscal 1995 from $845,000 or .7% of total revenues  the prior year.
This increase was due to higher interest expense associated with the increased
level of debt used to fund the Company's accelerated expansion plan and its
ownership of an increasing number of restaurant properties.  In addition, other
expense in the comparable period in 1994 was favorably affected by a $312,000
gain on the sale of a restaurant to a franchisee.
        
        The effective income tax rate declined to 37% for fiscal 1995 from
39.1% in fiscal 1994, primarily due to the effect of the FICA tip tax credit,
which became effective on January 1, 1994 and generally lower state income
taxes.

FISCAL YEAR 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR (53 WEEKS) 1993

        Total revenues increased 13.9% to $124.1 million in fiscal 1994 from
$108.9 million in the prior year. Company-owned restaurant sales increased
14.7% to $112.7 million in fiscal 1994 due primarily to a 9.4% increase in
operating weeks of full-service restaurants resulting from the addition of
eight new restaurants, and a 6.5% increase in comparable store sales.

        Consumer product sales increased 4.9% to $7.4 million in fiscal 1994
from $7.1 million in the prior year primarily due to expanded sales of private
label, thin-crust pizzas to several supermarket chains in New England. Initial
shipments 

                                     -22-
<PAGE>   23
of both refrigerated and frozen Pizzeria Uno brand pizzas commenced in
fiscal 1994 to new customers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio in
order to expand the Company's regional presence beyond New England.

        Franchise income increased 9.2% to $4.0 million in fiscal 1994 from
$3.6 million in the prior year. Royalty income increased 9.5% to $3.8 million
in fiscal 1994 from $3.5 million in the prior year primarily due to an increase
of 7.1% in average unit sales. Initial franchise fees totaled $150,000 in
fiscal 1994 compared to $147,500 in fiscal 1993.

        Cost of food and beverages as a percentage of restaurant and consumer
product sales increased to 25.1% in fiscal 1994 from 24.7% in the prior year,
reflecting primarily changes in sales mix toward a larger percentage of higher
cost non-pizza menu items.

        Labor and benefits as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product
sales decreased slightly to 30.8% in fiscal 1994 from 31.3% in the prior year,
principally due to the leverage of higher comparable store sales.

        Occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant and consumer product
sales declined to 15.8% in fiscal 1994 from 16.4% in the prior year, resulting
from the Company's purchase of the real estate for several restaurants since
fiscal 1992, and the operating leverage provided by the increase in comparable
store sales.

        Other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant and consumer
product sales were 9.0% for fiscal 1994, remaining relatively unchanged from
8.7% in the prior year.

        General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total
revenues to 7.5% in fiscal 1994 from 7.6% in the prior year, principally due to
the allocation of certain fixed expenses over a larger revenue base.

        Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of restaurant
and consumer product sales decreased to 6.4% in fiscal 1994 from 6.8% in the
prior year principally due to the increase in comparable store sales.

        Operating income increased 27.3% to $10.3 million in fiscal 1994 from
$8.1 million for the prior year. The operating profit margin increased to 8.3%
in fiscal 1994 from 7.4% in the prior year, principally due to an increase in
Company-owned restaurants and comparable store sales.

        Other expense declined to $845,000 in fiscal 1994 from $1.1 million in
the prior year, principally due to a $312,000 gain on the sale of a restaurant
to a franchisee in fiscal 1994.

        The effective income tax rate declined to 39.1% in fiscal 1994 from
40.5% in fiscal 1993, primarily due to the FICA tip credit, which became
effective on January 1, 1994.

</TABLE>

        Historically, the Company has leased most of its restaurant locations
and pursued a strategy of controlled growth, financing its expansion
principally from operating cash flow, equity offerings and from the sale of
senior, unsecured notes and short-term borrowing under revolving lines of
credit. During fiscal 1995, the Company's investment in property, equipment and
leasehold improvements was $39.9 million.

        The Company opened 16 restaurants during fiscal 1995 and currently
plans to open up to 12 restaurants in fiscal 1996.  The Company expects that
the average cash investment required to open a full-service Pizzeria Uno
restaurant, excluding land and pre-opening costs, will be approximately $1.5
million.

        As of October 1, 1995, the Company had outstanding indebtedness of
$21.8 million under its unsecured, revolving line of credit, $3.3 million of
senior, unsecured notes and $820,000 in capital lease obligations.  In December
1994, the Company obtained a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility
to replace its then existing $20.0 million revolving credit facility.  The new
revolving credit facility will convert to a three year term loan in December
1997.  Advances under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at
either the bank's prime rate plus .25%, or alternatively, at 100-150 basis
points above LIBOR.  The Company anticipates using the revolving credit
facility in the future for repayment of the $3.3 million of principal
outstanding under its senior, unsecured notes, for the development of
additional restaurants, and for working capital.

        On October 26, 1995, the Company entered into a five year interest rate
swap agreement involving the exchange of floating rate interest payment
obligations for fixed rate interest payment obligations.  The notional amount
of this interest rate swap agreement was $20 million.  The Company entered into
this agreement in order to manage interest costs and risks associated with
fluctuating interest rates.

        During June 1995, the Company completed a secondary public equity
offering of 2.3 million shares of its Common Stock underwritten by Montgomery 
Securities.  The Company received $22.6 million in net proceeds from the
offering.

        In October 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the
repurchase of up to a total of 1.5 million shares of the Company's Common stock
in the market from time to time during the subsequent six months.  This
superseded the Board of Directors  previous authorization in July 1995 for the
repurchase of up to a total of 500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. As
of November 30, 1995, the Company had repurchased a total of 494,100 shares of
its Common Stock at prices between $7.00 and $8.25 per share.

                                     -24-
<PAGE>   25
        The Company believes that existing cash balances, cash generated from
operations and borrowings under its revolving line of credit will be sufficient
to satisfy the Company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements
through fiscal 1996.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

        Inflation has not been a major factor in the Company's business for the
last several years.  The Company believes it has historically been able to pass
on increased costs through menu price increases, but there can be no assurance
that it will be able to do so in the future.  Future increases in local area
construction costs could adversely affect the Company's ability to expand.

SEASONALITY

        The Company's business is seasonal in nature, with revenues and, to a
greater degree, operating income being lower in its first and second quarters
than its other quarters due to reduced winter volumes.

                         Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Uno Restaurant Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uno Restaurant
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 1, 1995 and October 2,
1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 1995.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Uno Restaurant
Corporation and subsidiaries at October 1, 1995 and October 2, 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 1, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

and franchised restaurants are located throughout the United States.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company's fiscal year ends on the close of business on the Sunday closest to
September 30 in each year. The fiscal year ended October 3, 1993 included 53
weeks of operations.

INVENTORY

Inventory, which consists of food, beverages and store supplies, is stated at
the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. The Company
provides for depreciation of buildings and equipment over their estimated useful

the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease using the
straight-line method.

temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Earnings per common share amounts are calculated based upon the weighted-average
number of shares outstanding, giving effect to the dilutive effect of stock
options. Average shares outstanding and all per share amounts included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are based on
the increased number of shares, giving retroactive effect to the five-for-four
stock split in fiscal year 1995 (see Note 7).

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the accompanying 1994 and 1993 financial statements have been
reclassified to permit comparison with 1995.

2.  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

In December 1994, the Company completed an agreement with Bay Street
Restaurants, Inc. to purchase the net assets of three restaurants located in
Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In December 1993, the Company acquired
the leasehold improvements and equipment of three franchised restaurants in
Connecticut. These acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired companies prior
to the dates of acquisition would not have a material impact on the consolidated
results of operations in fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993.

During 1995, the Company assigned its leasehold interest in its Fairview
Heights, Illinois restaurant to an unaffiliated party in exchange for the
leasehold interest in that unaffiliated party's restaurant located in Orlando,
Florida. The Company recorded the transaction at fair market value, and wrote
off the net book value of equipment no longer usable.

On November 8, 1993, the Company sold to a franchisee for $2,500,000 a Pizzeria
Uno restaurant in Lake Buena Vista, Florida and recorded a gain of $312,000,
which has been included in other income in fiscal year 1994.

4.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company leases three buildings from its principal shareholder for a
restaurant and for corporate office space. Rent expense in the amount of
approximately $442,000 was charged to operations in each of the fiscal years
presented. The Company believes that the terms of these leases approximate fair
rental value.

The Company's President and his brother own and operate three franchised
restaurants. Additionally, the Chairman of the Company owns a 50% interest in a
franchised pizza takery, and one of the directors of the Company has a
partnership interest in a franchised restaurant. These franchisees pay royalties
to the Company under standard franchise agreements, with the exception of the
pizza takery, which is being operated as a test concept and, as a result, is not
currently being charged royalties.

5.  LEASES

The Company conducts the majority of its operations in leased facilities, which
are accounted for as capital or operating leases. The leases typically provide
for a base rent plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses, plus
additional contingent rent based

and allows all employees with at least six months of service to make annual
tax-deferred voluntary contributions up to 15% of their salary. Under the Plan,
the Company matches a specified percentage of the employees' contributions,
subject to certain limitations, and makes annual discretionary contributions of
the Company's Common Stock. Total contributions made to the plans were $153,000,
$110,000 and $25,000 in fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company sponsors a Deferred Compensation Plan which allows officers to defer
up to 20% of their annual compensation. These assets are placed in a rabbi trust
and are presented as assets of the Company in the accompanying balance sheet as
they are available to the general creditors of the Company in the event of the
Company's insolvency. The related liability of $426,000 at October 1, 1995 is
included in other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. Deferred
compensation expense in the amounts of $173,000 and $265,000 were recorded in
fiscal year 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Board (FASB) Statement No. 109 (Statement 109). As permitted by Statement 109,
the Company has elected not to restate the financial statements of any prior
years. The effect of the change on net income for fiscal 1994, as well as the
cumulative effect, was not material.

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On October 26, 1995, the Company entered into a five year interest rate swap
agreement involving the exchange of floating rate interest payment obligations
for fixed rate interest payment obligations. The notional amount of this
interest rate swap agreement was $20 million. The Company entered into this
agreement in order to manage interest costs and risks associated with
fluctuating interest rates. In the event that a counterparty fails to meet the
terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company's exposure is limited to
the interest rate differential. The Company has executed this agreement with a
creditworthy institution and considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote.

                               FIRST AMENDMENT TO
                    REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT

This FIRST AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT is entered
into as of January 30, 1995, by and among UNO RESTAURANTS, INC., a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Borrower"), UNO FOODS INC., a Massachusetts
corporation "UFI"), PIZZERIA UNO CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("PUC"),   
UNO RESTAURANT CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("URC"), URC HOLDING
COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation ("UHC" and, together with UFI, PUC, URC
and the Borrower, hereinafter referred to collectively, as the "Loan Parties"),
FLEET BANK OF MASSACHUSETTS, N.A., a national banking association ("Fleet"),
THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF BOSTON, a national banking association ("FNBB") and
MELLON BANK, N.A., a national banking association ("Mellon"), and FLEET BANK OF
MASSACHUSETTS, N.A., as Agent for the Banks referred to below (Fleet, together
with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the "Agent").

                                  RECITALS
                                  --------

        WHEREAS, the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Banks have entered into
that certain Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of December 9,
1994 (as amended and in effect from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"); and

        WHEREAS, the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Banks desire to amend
certain provisions of the Credit Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and
valuable consideration, the parties hereby agree as follows:

        Section 1.  Amendments to Credit Agreement.
                    -------------------------------

        1.1. Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended, as of the
date of this Amendment, by deleting the definition "Banks" appearing therein in
its entirety and substituting therefor the following:

        "`BANKS' shall mean, Fleet, FNBB, Mellon, and their respective
successors and assigns."

        1.2. Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby further amended, as
of the date of this Amendment, by adding thereto the following new defined
term, such term to be inserted in the appropriate alphabetical order:

        "`FEDERAL FUNDS RATE,' shall mean, for any day, a fluctuating interest
     rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the rates on overnight
     Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System
     arranged by Federal funds brokers, as published for such day (or, if such
     day is not a Business Day, for the next preceding Business Day) by the
     Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is not so published for
     any day 


                                     -1-
<PAGE>   2

     that is a Business Day, the average of the quotations for such day on such 
     transactions received by the Agent from three Federal funds brokers of 
     recognized standing selected by the Agent."

     1.3. Section 1.2 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended, as of the
date of this Amendment, by deleting such Section in its entirety and
substituting therefor the following:

        "Section 1.2. ACCOUNTING TERMS. All accounting terms used and not
     defined in this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with GAAP
     consistently applied, and all financial data required to be delivered
     hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with such principles. If any
     changes in accounting principles are hereafter occasioned by promulgation
     of rules, regulations, pronouncements or opinions by or are otherwise
     required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the American
     Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or successors thereto or
     agencies with similar functions), and any of such changes results in a
     change in the method of calculation of, or affect the results of
     calculation of, any of the financial covenants, standards or terms found
     herein, then the parties hereto agree to enter into and diligently pursue
     negotiations in order to amend such financial covenants, standards or terms
     so as to reflect fairly and equitably such changes, with the desired result
     that the criteria for evaluating the financial condition and results of
     operations of URC and its Subsidiaries shall be the same after such changes
     as if such changes had not been made. If the parties are unable to agree
     upon the amendments to any such financial covenants, standards or terms,
     the parties agree to submit any remaining disputes to an independent third-
     party accounting firm (having no substantial relationship with any party)
     of national recognition selected by such parties for a determination of the
     appropriate amendments to such financial covenant, standard or term, which
     determination shall be binding upon the parties."

     1.4. Section 2.2 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended, as of the
date of this Amendment, by deleting paragraph (e) of such Section in its
entirety and substituting therefor the following:

        "(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, the
     Borrower shall not be required to provide notice to the Agent of Advances
     which are made in accordance with "target balance" services provided by the
     Agent (each, a "Target Balance Advance"), and the minimum borrowing amounts
     established under Section 2.2(a) shall not apply to such Target Balance
     Advances. All Target Balance Advances shall be Prime Rate Loans unless
     otherwise agreed by the Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks. The Agent
     shall, to the extent practicable, notify each Bank on the date of any
     Target Balance Advance of such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such
     Advance. Provided that the Agent has notified the Banks prior to 3:00 p.m. 
     on the date of such Target Balance Advance, each Bank shall make available

                  INTERNATIONAL SWAP DEALERS ASSOCIATION, INC.

                                MASTER AGREEMENT

                          dated as of October 25, 1995


Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A. and Uno Restaurants, Inc. have entered and/or
anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a "Transaction") that
are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule
(the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a
"Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:--

1.   INTERPRETATION

(a)  Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have
the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.

(b)  Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule
will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any
Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such
Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.

(c)  Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the
fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement
between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.

2.   OBLIGATIONS

(a)  General Conditions.

     (i)  Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each
     Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
     Agreement.

     (ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value
     on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
     Confirmation or otherwise 

<PAGE>   2

     pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the
     manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement
     is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be
     made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant
     obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or
     elsewhere in this Agreement.

     (iii)     Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject
     to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
     of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing,
     (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of
     the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and
     (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)  Change of Account.  Either party may change its account for receiving a
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.

(c)  Netting.  If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:

     (i)  in the same currency; and

     (ii) in respect of the same Transaction,

by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and,
if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the
other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger
aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess
of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction.  The election may be
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii)
above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the
election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii)
above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and
will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make
and receive payments or deliveries.

(d)  Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

     (i)  Gross-Up.  All payments under this Agreement will be made without any
     deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such
     deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by
     the practice of any relevant 

                                     -2-
<PAGE>   3

     governmental revenue authority, then in effect.  If a party is so
     required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:

          (1)  promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

          (2)  pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be
     deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or
     withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section
     2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or
     withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been
     assessed against Y;

          (3)  promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
     copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such
     payment to such authorities; and

          (4)  if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to
     the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such
     additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually
     received by Y (free and clear off Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed
     against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no
     such deduction or withholding been required.  However, X will not be
     required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not
     be required to be paid but for:

               (A)  the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
     contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

               (B)  the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
     Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have
     occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in
     a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a
     Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or
     brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax
     Law.

     (ii)      Liability. If:--

          (1)  X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice
          of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction
          or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an
          additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);

          (2)  X does not so deduct or withhold; and

          (3)  a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
          against X,

     then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability
     resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such
     liability (including any related liability 

                                     -3-
<PAGE>   4

     for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if
     Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section
     4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).

(e)  Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant
Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation
will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required
to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the
other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the
period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but
excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will
be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days
elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in
the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will
compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the
relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

3.   REPRESENTATIONS

Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered
into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times
until the termination of this Agreement) that:--

(a)  BASIC REPRESENTATIONS.

     (i)     STATUS. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of
     the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant
     under such laws, in good standing;

     documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to
     deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this

     its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any
     Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary
     action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance;

     (iii)   NO VIOLATION OR CONFLICT. Such execution, delivery and performance
     do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any
     provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any
     court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets
     or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its
     assets;

     (iv)    CONSENTS. All governmental and other consents that are required to

     complied with; and

     (v)     OBLIGATIONS BINDING. Its obligations under this Agreement and any
     Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid
     and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective
     terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
     moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
     subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general
     application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding
     in equity or at law)).

(b)  Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred
and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of
its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(c)  Absence of Litigation.  There is not pending or, to its knowledge,
threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding
at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or

enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to
which it is party or its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or such Credit Support Document.

(d)  Accuracy of Specified Information.  All applicable information that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified
for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the

     in the Schedule or any Confirmation;

     (ii) any other documents specified in the  Schedule or any Confirmation;

<PAGE>   6

     (iii)     upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document
     that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow
     such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under
     this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any
     deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such
     deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion,
     execution or submission of such form or document would not materially
     prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such
     demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a
     manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and
     to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b)  Maintain Authorizations.  It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority
that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.

(c)  Comply with Laws.  It will comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply
would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(d)  Tax Agreement.  It will give notice of any failure of a representation
made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of
such failure.

(e)  Payment of Stamp Tax.  Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon it or in respect to its execution or performance of this
Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organized, managed and
controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office
through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located ("Stamp
Tax Jurisdiction") and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other party's
execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction
which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.

5.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND TERMINATION EVENTS

(a)  EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified
Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of
default (an "Event of Default") with respect to such party:--

     (i)    FAILURE TO PAY OR DELIVER. Failure by the party to make, when due,
     any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e)
     required to be made by it if 

                                     -6-
<PAGE>   7

     such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day 
     after notice of such failure is given to the party;

     (ii)   BREACH OF AGREEMENT. Failure by the party to comply with or perform
     any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment
     under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give
     notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section
     4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party
     in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or
     before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the
     party;

     (iii)  CREDIT SUPPORT DEFAULT.
        
            (1)  Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such
            party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be   
            complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit
            Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable
            grace period has elapsed;

            (2)  the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document
            or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in
            full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either
            case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the
            satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each
            Transaction to which such Credit Support Document relates without
            the written consent of the other party; or

            (3)  the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms,
            disclaims,  repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or
            challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;

     (iv)   MISREPRESENTATION. A representation (other than a representation
     under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or
     repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this
     Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or
     misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have
     been made or repeated;

     (v)    DEFAULT UNDER SPECIFIED TRANSACTION. The party, any Credit Support
     Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party
     (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any
     applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation
     of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that
     Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable
     notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due
     on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early
     termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at
     least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice
     requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or

                                     -7-
<PAGE>   8
     rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is
     taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act
     on its behalf);

     (vi)   CROSS DEFAULT. If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as
     applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event
     of default or other similar condition or event (however described) in
     respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any
     applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or
     instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them
     (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the
     applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has
     resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at
     such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or
     instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a
     default by such party, such Credit Support Provider of such Specified
     Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on
     the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the
     applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or instruments (after
     giving effect to any applicable notice requirement of grace period);

     (vii)  Bankruptcy.  The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party
     or any applicable Specified Entity of such party:
          
            (1)  is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation,
            amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes   insolvent or is unable to
            pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally
            to  pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general
            assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of
            its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted against it a
            proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any
            other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other
            similar law affecting creditors' rights, or a petition is presented
            for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such
            proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such
            proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or
            bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an
            order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed,
            discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the
            institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed
            for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than
            pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or
            becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional
            liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other
            similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets;
            (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all
            its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration
            or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all
            or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains
            possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged,
            stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8)
            causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under
            the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has 

                                     -8-
<PAGE>   9

            an analogous effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1)
            to (7)(inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or    
            indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of  
            the foregoing acts; or

     (viii) Merger Without Assumption.  The party or any Credit Support
     Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or
     into, or transfers all of substantially all its assets to, another equity
     and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:

            (1)  the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume
     all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under
     this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its
     predecessor was a party by operation of law    or pursuant to an agreement
     reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement;

            (2)  the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend
     (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such
     resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this
     Agreement.

(b)  Termination Events.  The occurrence at any time with respect to a party
or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party  or any Specified
Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if
the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in
(ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below,
and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is
specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the
event is specified pursuant to (v) below:--

     (i)    ILLEGALITY. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable
     law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the
     promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,
     tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any
     applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a
     result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which
     will be the Affected Party): -

            (1)  to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a
            payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect
            of  such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision
            of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or

            (2)  to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party
            to  perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or
            such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document
            relating to such Transaction;

     (ii) TAX EVENT. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
     brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on
     which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is
     taken or brought with respect to a party to this 

                                     -9-
<PAGE>   10

     Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the
     Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will,
     on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date ( 1 ) be required to pay to
     the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax
     under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section
     2(e), 6(d)(ii) or  6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is
     required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in
     respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no
     additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under
     Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

     (iii)  TAX EVENT UPON MERGER. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the
     next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay
     an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section
     2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
     6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or
     withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which
     the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by
     reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a
     party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or
     transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which
     will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event
     described in Section 5(a)(viii);

     (iv)   CREDIT EVENT UPON MERGER. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified
     in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit
     Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates
     or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or
     substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not
     constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the
     creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is
     materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
     Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action
     (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate,
     will be the Affected Party); or

     (v)    ADDITIONAL TERMINATION EVENT. If any "Additional Termination Event"
     is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the
     occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or
     Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination
     Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).

(c)  EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ILLEGALITY. If an event or circumstance which would
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an
Event of Default.

6.   EARLY TERMINATION

(a)  RIGHT TO TERMINATE FOLLOWING EVENT OF DEFAULT.  If at any time an Event of
Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is 

                                    -10-
<PAGE>   11

effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding
Transactions.  If, however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the
Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of
all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with
respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1),
(3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time      
immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the
presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such
party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the
extent analogous thereto, (8).

(b)  RIGHT TO TERMINATE FOLLOWING TERMINATION EVENT.

     (i)  NOTICE.  If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,
     promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the
     nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will
     also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other
     party may reasonably require.

     (ii)  TRANSFER TO AVOID TERMINATION EVENT.  If either an Illegality under
     Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected
     Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the
     Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to
     designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all
     reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss,
     excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days
     after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations
     under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of
     its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.

     If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
     notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,
     whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after
     the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).

     Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject
     to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party,
     which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in
     effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the
     transferee on the terms proposed.

     (iii)  TWO AFFECTED PARTIES.  If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or
     a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use
     all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice
     thereof is given under Section 6(b)(k) on action to avoid that Termination
     Event.

     (iv)  RIGHT TO TERMINATE, IF: --

          (1)  a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section
          6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to
          all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party
          gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or


                                     -11-
<PAGE>   12

          (2)  An Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon
          Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon
          Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,

     either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case
     of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event
     or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected
     Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a
     Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is
     only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other
     party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing,
     designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an
     Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.

(c)  EFFECT OF DESIGNATION.

     (i)    If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under
     Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so
     designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination
     Event is then continuing.

     (ii)   Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early
     Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i)
     or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be
     made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The
     amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be
     determined pursuant to Section 6(e).

(d)  CALCULATIONS.

     (i)    STATEMENT. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the
     occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the
     calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
     provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail,
     such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any
     amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant
     account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of
     written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in
     determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such
     quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of
     such quotation.

     (ii)   PAYMENT DATE. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any
     Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that
     notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of
     Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on
     which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
     Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event).
     Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under
     applicable law) interest 

                                    -12-
<PAGE>   13

     thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency,
     from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but
     excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such
     interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the
     actual number of days elapsed.

(e)  PAYMENTS ON EARLY TERMINATION. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment
method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the parties fail
to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be
deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be,
shall apply.  The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination
Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.

     (i)  EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If the Early Termination Date results from an
     Event of Default:-

          (1)  FIRST METHOD AND MARKET QUOTATION. If the First Method and
          Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
          Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum
          of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in
          respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency
          Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party
          over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts
          owing to the Defaulting Party.

          (2)  FIRST METHOD AND LOSS. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
          Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive
          number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.

          (3)  SECOND METHOD AND MARKET QUOTATION. If the Second Method and
          Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the
          sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party)
          in respect of the Termination Transactions and the Termination
          Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting
          Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
          Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.  If that amount is a positive
          number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party;
          if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the
          absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

          (4)  SECOND METHOD AND LOSS.  If the Second Method and Loss apply, an
          amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in
          respect of this Agreement.  If that amount is a positive number, the
          Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a
          negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value
          of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

                                    -13-
<PAGE>   14

     (ii)  TERMINATION EVENTS.  If the Early Termination Date results from a
     Termination Event:--

          (1)  One Affected Party.  If there is one Affected Party, the amount
          payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if
          Market  Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies,
          except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and
          to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the
          Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party,
          respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the
          Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in
          respect of all Terminated Transactions.

          (2)  Two Affected Parties.  If there are two Affected Parties:--

               (A)  if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
               Settlement Amount in respect of the Termination Transactions,
               and an amount will be payable equal to (1) the sum of (a)
               one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the
               party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the Settlement
               Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount ("Y") and
               (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts
               owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the
               Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and

               (B)  if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
               respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the
               Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated
               Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of
               the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher
               Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

          If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it
          is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to
          Y.

     (iii)  Adjustment for Bankruptcy.  In circumstances where an Early
     Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
     respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be
     subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to
     reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under
     this Agreement  (and retained by such other party) during the period from
     the Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under
     Section 6(d)(ii).

     (iv)  Pre-Estimate.  The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an
     amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of
     loss and not a penalty.  Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain
     and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise
     provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any
     additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.   TRANSFER

                                    -14-
<PAGE>   15

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that:--

(a)  a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to
any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b)  a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any
amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.

8.   CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY

(a)  PAYMENT IN THE CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY. Each payment under this Agreement
will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable
law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual
Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency
other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results
in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a
reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into
the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all
amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in
the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the
Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required
to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be
necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the
Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency
payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will
refund promptly the amount of such excess.

(b)  JUDGMENTS. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is
entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive
immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual
Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other
currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in
such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any
variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is
converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such
judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is 

                                    -15-
<PAGE>   16

able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the
currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual
Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order
actually received by such party.  The term "rate of exchange" includes, without
limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the
purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.

(c)  SEPARATE INDEMNITIES. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the
party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being
obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of
this Agreement.

(d)  EVIDENCE OF LOSS. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient
for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual
exchange or purchase been made.

9.   MISCELLANEOUS

(a)  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.

(b)  AMENDMENTS.  No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by
a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by
an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging
system.

(c)  SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS.  Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and
6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the

enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office
represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office
or jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of such party, the obligations
of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through
its head or home office.  This representation will be deemed to be repeated by
such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.

(b)  Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior
written consent of the other party.

(c)  If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any

which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a
Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.

11.  EXPENSES

A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party
for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and
Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and

     jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States
     District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if

     York; and

     (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of

     waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such
     court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.

Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the
other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to
the other party.  The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given
in the manner provided for notices in Section 12.  Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by law.

of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for
recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after
judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its

"LOSS" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency
Equivalent of an mount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its

<PAGE>   22

consideration of an agreement between such party (taking into account any
existing Credit Support Document with respect to the obligations of such party)
and the quoting Reference Market- maker to enter into a transaction (the
"Replacement Transaction") that would have the effect of preserving for such
party the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the
underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction
of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in
respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that
would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have been
required after that date.  For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect to the
Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be executed
but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the
relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of
each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be
included.  The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation
as such party and the Reference Market- maker may, in good faith, agree.  The
party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference
Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as
of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon

and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in
good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e),
and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other.  If more
than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic
mean of the quotations, without regard to be quotations having the highest and
lowest values.  If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market
Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and
lowest quotations.  For this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same

disregarded.  If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed
that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of
Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.

"NON-DEFAULT RATE" means a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof of
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it)
if it were to fund the relevant amount.

on, such payer.

Date, the sum of: -

(b)  such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to
any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated

the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a
commercially reasonable result.

RE:  Interest Rate Swap Transaction

Dear Mr. Brown:

        The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and
conditions of the Swap Transaction entered into between us on the Trade Date
referred to below (the "Swap Transaction").  This letter agreement constitutes
a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.

        The definitions and provisions contained in the 1991 ISDA Definitions
(as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.) are
incorporated into this Confirmation.  In the event of any inconsistency between
those definitions and provisions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will
govern.

        1.   This Confirmation evidences a complete binding agreement between
you and us as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation
relates. In addition, you and we agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly
to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in the form of the ISDA Master
Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "ISDA Form"), with such
modifications as you and we will in good faith agree.  If the Agreement is not
executed and returned to Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A. within 45 days of
the date that it is sent, Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A. may, at its option,
terminate this transaction.  Upon the execution by you and us of such an
agreement, this confirmation will supplement, form a part of, and be subject to
that agreement.  All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that
agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation except as expressly
modified below.  Until we execute and deliver that agreement, this
Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form
(each a "Confirmation") confirming transactions (each a "Transaction") entered
into between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation),
shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of


<PAGE>   37

the ISDA Form as if we had executed an agreement in such form (but without any
Schedule) on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us.  In the
event of any inconsistency between the provisions of that agreement and this    
Confirmation this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of this
Transaction.  For the purpose hereof, Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A. is
referred to as "Party A" and Unos Restaurants, Inc. is referred to as "Party B".
