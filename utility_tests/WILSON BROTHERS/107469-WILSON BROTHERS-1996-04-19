     Item 1.   Business.

     General Development of Business

     Wilson  Brothers  was  incorporated  in  Illinois  in  1898.
Reference  herein  to "the Company" includes collectively  Wilson
Brothers  and  its  subsidiaries  unless  the  content  indicates
otherwise.  The Company's principal executive offices are located
at 902 South Main Street, Point Marion, PA 15474.

     During  the  1995 fiscal year, the Company had  one  active,
wholly-owned subsidiary - Houze Glass Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation  ("Houze")  located in  Point  Marion,  Pennsylvania,
which is engaged in the specialty decoration of glass and ceramic
items.

     At  the beginning of fiscal year 1993 approximately 53.7% of
the  Company's common stock was owned by DWG Corporation ("DWG").
On  April 23, 1993, DWG Acquisition Group L.P. acquired 28.6%  of
DWG's  then  outstanding shares of common stock.  DWG Acquisition
Group  L.P.  subsequently changed its name to  Triarc  Companies,
Inc. ("Triarc").

      On  September  28, 1993, the Company's Board  of  Directors
authorized  the  sale  or liquidation of  all  of  its  operating
businesses.   On  December  28,  1993,  Triarc  entered  into   a
Securities Purchase Agreement with Bruce Paparella and Warren  B.
Kanders  (the  "Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant  to  the  Purchase
Agreement,  on  January  10, 1994, Mr.  Paparella  acquired  from
Triarc  1,296,436  shares  of  the Company's  common  stock,  Mr.
Kanders  acquired  from Triarc 648,217 shares  of  the  Company's
common  stock, Triarc assigned to Mr. Paparella and  Mr.  Kanders
that certain note made by the Company and owned by Triarc with  a
remaining  principal  balance  of  $1,500,000  which  note  bears
interest  at the prime rate and at the time was convertible  into
956,937  shares  of the Company's common stock (the  "Convertible
Note"), and Triarc assigned to Mr. Paparella and Mr. Kanders  cer
tain accounts receivable by Triarc in the amount at September 30,
1993 of $1,230,000 (the "Accounts Receivable").  As a consequence
of  said transactions, Mr. Paparella owned a 75% interest in  the
Convertible Note and the Accounts Receivable and Mr.  Kanders  ob
tained  a  25% interest in the Convertible Note and the  Accounts
Receivable and, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Kanders together  owned  ap
proximately 59% of the Company's outstanding common stock and, as
a  result  of such transactions, may be deemed to have controlled
the  Company.   The  Company  has been informed  that,  effective
December 30, 1994, Mr. Kanders entered into three separate  stock
purchase agreements pursuant to which Mr. Kanders transferred the
aggregate  of 648,217 shares of the Company's common stock  owned
by him to four individuals, including Mr. Paparella who purchased
348,217  shares for $5,000.  The remainder of these  shares  were
sold  by Mr. Kanders to three individuals who are not related  to
Mr.  Paparella.  In addition, the Company has been informed that,
on  December 22, 1994 Mr. Kanders made a gift of his 25%  portion
of  the  Convertible  Note,  which was convertible  into  239,234
shares of Common Stock (representing 6.9% of the Common Stock  on
a  fully  diluted basis assuming the Convertible Note  was  fully
converted into such shares of Common Stock), and Mr. Kanders' 25%
interest  in  the Accounts Receivable to a charitable foundation,
Choate  Rosemary Hall Foundation, Inc., leaving Mr. Kanders  with
no  remaining beneficial interest in the Company's common  stock.
On April 18, 1995, John Sanford, the Company's Vice President and
Chief  Financial Officer, acquired in a private transaction  with
Mr.  Walter Carucci, a $362,500 interest in such convertible note
which  is convertible into 231,259 shares of the Company's Common
Stock  and,  as  such,  Mr.  Sanford may  be  deemed  to  be  the
beneficial  owner  of 231,259 shares issuable  to  him  upon  his
election to convert his interest in the notes.  In addition,  Mr.
Sanford also acquired, in a private transaction with Mr. Carucci,
a  warrant  to  purchase 648,218 shares of the  Company's  Common
Stock from Mr. Paparella, exercisable commencing in January 1996.

      As a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 1995,
Mr. Paparella beneficially owns 1,644,653 shares of the Company's
outstanding Common Stock, representing 49.5% of such Common Stock
and, in addition, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford beneficially  own
358,852 shares and 231,259 shares, respectively, of the Company's
common   stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  their  respective
interests in the Convertible Note.  Assuming Mr. Paparella's  and
Mr.  Sanford's  interests  in  the  Convertible  Note  are  fully
converted into such shares of common stock, Mr. Paparella and Mr.
Sanford  may  be  deemed to beneficially  own  the  aggregate  of
2,003,505   shares   and   231,259  shares   of   common   stock,
respectively,  constituting approximately  57.1%  of  the  common
stock of the Company and may be deemed to control the Company.
     
     From  September  28,  1993  through  January  9,  1994,  the
Company's  two  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Houze  and  Northern
Engineering  Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation  ("Northern"),
were treated as discontinued operations.  As of January 10, 1994,
however,  the  Company's  Board of Directors  deemed  it  in  the
Company's  best  interest to continue the  operations  of  Houze.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements  for  each  of
the  periods  presented have been restated to  reflect  only  the
operations of Northern as discontinued.
     
        On  May 12, 1994, the Company sold all of the outstanding
shares  of  Northern  to  a corporation controlled  by  a  former
director  of the Company.  In consideration for the sale  of  the
Northern  shares, the Company received $10,000,  plus  a  secured
promissory note (the "Note") in the principal amount of  $750,000
repayable on or before May 1, 1999, which bears interest  payable
quarterly  at 8 percent per anum. Such note is collateralized  by
certain  real  property  of Northern (the "Mortgaged  Property").
The  Mortgaged Property was not appraised in connection with  the
transaction.   If  the Mortgaged Property is  sold,  all  of  the
principal  and interest is immediately due and payable. Effective
October  28,  1994, the Company agreed to reduce  the  percentage
from  50  percent  to 30 percent of the amount that  the  Company
shall be entitled to receive if the Mortgaged Property is sold in
excess  of  $750,000. In exchange, the purchaser made  a  partial
prepayment of the principal of the Note in the amount of $150,000
which  was  paid  by  November 7, 1994, and  agreed  to  make  an
additional $150,000 partial prepayment which was paid on  January
15,  1995.   The purchaser had the option to prepay the remaining
principal  balance of the Note by June 30, 1995.  Such prepayment
was  not  made, and therefore, the purchaser was to  additionally
compensate  the Company $50,000 by July 15, 1995, of  which  only
$10,000  has  been paid.  As a result, the Company believes  that
the principal amount of the Note and accrued interest thereon may
not be collectible, and therefore as of September 30, 1995 made a
full  valuation reserve in the financial statements  of  $450,000
for  the  principal balance and $6,000 for the  accrued  interest
balance  on  the  note.   The  Company  intends  to  pursue   all
opportunities   for   collection,  including   repossession   and
liquidation of the Mortgaged Property.

     On   November  16,  1995,  the  Company  received   $472,541
representing the net proceeds distributed in connection with  the
resolution of all litigation claims of Northern, retained by  the
Company after the sale of Northern, with Pennsylvania Engineering
Corporation.    These  proceeds  were  applied  to  interest  and
principal  under the Note.  The Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect the
stock sale of Northern.

     Industry Segments

     The Company presently operates in one business segment.

     Business

     Wilson  Brothers  is  a holding company  whose  business  is
conducted  through Houze.  Through Houze, the Company is  engaged
in the specialty decoration of glass and ceramic items.

     Except  as  described below, the Company does not anticipate
that present environmental regulations will materially affect its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  To date,
the  Company  has  not been required to make significant  capital
expenditures in order to meet current environmental standards.

      As  of December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 108
employees  of which 28 were salaried employees and the  remainder
were  hourly personnel.  Workers are represented by the  American
Flint Glass Workers Union under a contract which expires in March
1999.  The Company believes its relations with its employees  are
satisfactory.

     Except  as  described below, patents, trademarks,  licenses,
franchises  and concessions are not material to the  business  of
the  Company.   Working capital requirements of the  Company  are
expected to be fulfilled from operating cash flow supplemented by
a revolving line of credit facility arranged with a bank on March
4,  1994  and extended on various dates through maturity on  June
30,  1996.  During the last three years, the Company has not  had
any  material  expenditures  for Company  or  customer  sponsored
research   and   development  activities.   No  single   customer
accounted  for  more  than  10%  of  the  Company's  consolidated
revenues in 1995.

     Houze  is  engaged in the specialty decoration of glass  and
ceramic items.  Sales are made through sales representatives  and
are  generally  for advertising specialties, premiums,  souvenirs
and  the  retail trade.  Houze's core business, which  is  highly
competitive, consists principally of the decoration of mugs which
are sold to advertising specialty distributors.  Custom imprinted
tumblers  or  coffee  mugs  generally  lend  more  exposure   per
advertising dollar to customers because of their frequency of use
in  the  business  atmosphere.  From time  to  time,  Houze  also
obtains special contract orders.  Such special contract orders do
no  necessarily  occur each year and there  were  no  significant
contract  orders  in  1993, 1994 or 1995.  The  decorative  glass
business  is highly competitive, particularly in connection  with
items such as tumblers, mugs and glasses.  The particular markets
targeted  by the ceramic mug segment are pharmaceutical companies
that  utilize  the "magic" process to demonstrate a change  which
occurs  when a particular medication is prescribed.   Houze  also
targets  companies that desire to advertise a particular  product
or  perhaps a change in the company (i.e., name or logo).   Houze
competes on the basis of price, quality and design.  Many of  its
competitors   are  much  larger  companies,  with   far   greater
resources.   Anchor  Hocking Corporation and  Libbey  Owens  Ford
Company  are  dominant in this industry.  Using  price,  quality,
service  and  expertise  of  design as  priorities,  the  Company
believes  that  it  can  maintain  a  competitive  edge  in   the
advertising specialty market.

     For  the  last three years the custom decorated ceramic  mug
product  line  has  been  approximately 85%  of  Houze's  overall
business.

     Management is currently looking to expand Houze's decorative
products  to  include  custom  imprinted  ceramic  steins,   shot
glasses,  and travel mugs. The Company is currently experimenting
with the decoration of molded plastic mugs.

     Houze  is continuing to use the "magic" process which  is  a
thermal chromatic process whereby ceramic pigment is activated by
either high or low temperatures.  This allows for a visual change
in  the  product  to reveal an advertisement or artistic  effect.
This  process  is  now available through other  manufacturers  in
Japan.    Consequently,  competition  in  this  market  area   is
increasing to some extent.

     Houze  purchases much of its raw material supplies of  glass
and  ceramic  items  from  five  principal  suppliers.   However,
management believes that such raw materials are readily available
from other sources at competitive prices.

     Houze  enters into licensing agreements with customers which
permit  Houze  to imprint specific logos or designs  directly  on
products.

     In recent years, Houze's sales have been greatest during the
fall quarter as a result of customers' holiday programs.  Backlog
or  orders  believed  to  be firm as of  December  31,  1995  was
$310,000  compared to $420,000 at year end 1994.  Backlog  orders
are filled within the current fiscal year.

     Because  the  ceramic mug business is dependent on  imported
ware,  Houze  is required to maintain inventories to cover  needs
for 45 - 60 days at minimum.  If a shortfall occurs, inventory is
supplemented  with ware purchased from a distributor  located  in
the  United States.  Houze does not offer extended payment  terms
to customers.

     Houze  is  not dependent on any single customer  because  of
Houze's  method  of  distribution.  Houze  is  a  member  of  the
Advertising Specialty Institute and a supplier to the advertising
industry.   Houze  maintains  a nationwide  distribution  network
through over 12,000 distributors offering Houze products.

     As an advertising specialty supplier, no material portion of
Houze's  business  is  affected by renegotiation  of  profits  or
termination  of  contracts at the election  of  any  governmental
agency.

     In  February 1993, the Company became aware that certain  of
Houze's  products may have concentrations of lead and cadmium  at
levels  which  might  constitute hazardous  waste.   While  after
testing,  it  was  ascertained  that  products  currently   being
produced   are   within  acceptable  levels,  certain   products,
generally  those produced prior to 1980, had unacceptable  levels
of  lead and cadmium.  These products had been disposed of  in  a
disposal  site  located  on Houze's property.   The  Pennsylvania
Department  of  Environmental Regulation (PDER) and  the  Company
agreed to a consent order on September 22, 1994, which outlines a
plan  for  Houze to remove and encapsulate all of  the  hazardous
waste  and  thereby  comply  with  residual  waste  pile  closure
requirements.   The  Company intends to  fully  comply  with  the
requirements  of the consent order.  The estimated  cost  of  the
Company's original plan of remediation was increased during  1993
by  $700,000  from $200,000, based on advice from its consultant,
which  was  provided  for  in  the  1993  consolidated  financial
statements.   On  December  31, 1995,  the  reserve  balance  was
$825,000  reflecting a charge of $41,000 and  $14,000  in  actual
remediation expenses incurred during 1995 and 1994, respectively.
While  the  Company  believes that the total  cost  of  the  plan
provided  by the PDER in the consent order discussed  above  will
not  exceed  the amount reserved, the Company is unable  at  this
time to make a final determination of the cost of implementation,
and  therefore, has not adjusted such reserve beyond that arising
from  actual  remediation  expenditures.   The  final  costs   to
complete  the plan of remediation may be substantial in  relation
to  the  consolidated financial position of  the  Company,  which
could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
and liquidity.

     The Company has no foreign operations or any material export
sales.

     Item 2.   Properties.

     Operations  of  Houze  occupy a facility  in  Point  Marion,
Pennsylvania  which  has  approximately 175,000  square  feet  of
manufacturing and office space on a 16 acre site.  Such  facility
is substantially utilized.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

      In  December 1993, a civil action was brought in the United
States  District  Court for the Western District of  Pennsylvania
against the Company, Houze and Triarc Companies, Inc. ("Triarc"),
the  former parent of the Company, by the former chief  operating
officer  of  Houze.  The complaint alleged that such officer  was
owed  bonuses  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $116,000  plus
interest on said amount.  The amount of the claim for bonuses had
been  recorded  in the consolidated financial statements  of  the
Company.   The Company and Houze answered the claim and  asserted
certain  counterclaims.  By agreement dated January 1, 1995,  the
Company,  Houze  and  Triarc agreed  to  settle  the  claims  and
counterclaims.  The agreement provides that Houze  will  pay  the
former  officer  the  aggregate  amount  of  $37,500  in  several
installments by December 31, 1996, of which $31,350 has been paid
as of December 31, 1995.  The $116,000 reserve for this claim was
reduced accordingly as of December 31, 1994.
     
     While  the  Company is not currently engaged in  litigation,
the  Company is from time to time involved in routine  litigation
incidental  to its business.  The Company does not  believe  that
any  of  such  routine litigation will have  a  material  adverse
effect  on  its  consolidated financial position  or  results  of
operations.

     Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

     Not applicable.

                             PART II
                                
     Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related
Stockholder Matters.

     There is no current established public trading market for
the Company's common stock.

     Prior  to September 14, 1993, the high and low sales  prices
for  the  common  stock of the Company as listed on  the  Pacific
Stock Exchange were as follows:

                                       Prices
     Year and Period                High     Low
       1993
          First Quarter             $.75      $.50
          Second Quarter             .875      .50
          Third Quarter              .875      .125


     From September 14, 1993 through December 31, 1993, the range
of high and low bid information for the common stock of the

     Such over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer
prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may
not necessarily represent actual transactions.

     On  September  14,  1993,  the Company's  common  stock  was
delisted  from the Pacific Stock Exchange for failure  to  comply
with  minimum  listing criteria.  Since that time  the  Company's
common  stock  has been traded over the counter through  National
Quotation Bureau's "pink sheets".   Since December 12, 1993,  the
"pink sheets" has listed no bid for the Company's common stock.

     As of December 31, 1995, there were 3,027 record holders of
the Company's common stock.

     The  Company  did not declare or pay any cash  dividends  in
1995   or  1994.   The  applicable  provisions  of  the  Business
Corporation  Act  of  Illinois,  the  Company's  jurisdiction  of
incorporation, limit the payment of dividends to an amount  equal
to  the  difference between the assets of a corporation  and  its
liabilities.   Under  such provisions at December  31,  1995,  no
dividends were permitted to be paid.  The Company has no  present
plans for the payment of any dividends.

     On  January  10,  1994,  pursuant to a  Securities  Purchase
Agreement  dated December 28, 1993 among Bruce Paparella,  Warren
B.  Kanders  and  Triarc  Companies,  Inc.  ("Triarc"),  (i)  Mr.
Paparella  acquired from Triarc 1,296,436 shares of the Company's
common  stock,  (ii)  Mr. Kanders acquired  from  Triarc  648,217
shares  of  the Company's common stock, (iii) Triarc assigned  to
Mr.  Paparella  and Mr. Kanders that certain  note  made  by  the
Company and owned by Triarc with a remaining principal balance of
$1,500,000 which note bears interest at the prime rate and at the
time  was  convertible into 956,937 shares of Common  Stock  (the
"Note"),  and  (iv)  Triarc assigned to  Mr.  Paparella  and  Mr.
Kanders certain accounts receivable held by Triarc in the  amount
at  September 30, 1993 of $1,230,000 (the "Accounts Receivable").
Triarc  is  the successor to DWG Corporation ("DWG"), the  former
controlling shareholder of the Company.  As a consequence of said
transactions, Mr. Paparella obtained a 75% interest in  the  Note
and  the  Accounts  Receivable and Mr.  Kanders  obtained  a  25%
interest in the Note and the Accounts Receivable.

      The Company has been informed that, effective December  30,
1994,  Mr.  Kanders  entered into three separate  stock  purchase
agreements   pursuant  to  which  Mr.  Kanders  transferred   the
aggregate  of 648,217 shares of the Company's Common Stock  owned
by him to four individuals, including Mr. Paparella who purchased
348,217  shares for $5,000.  The remainder of these  shares  were
sold  by Mr. Kanders to three individuals who are not related  to
Mr.  Paparella.  In addition, the Company has been informed that,
on  December 22, 1994 Mr. Kanders made a gift of his 25%  portion
of the Convertible Note which was convertible into 239,234 shares
of Common Stock (representing 6.9% of the Common Stock on a fully
diluted  basis assuming the Convertible Note was fully  converted
into such shares of Common Stock) and Mr. Kanders 25% interest in
the  Accounts  Receivable  to  a  charitable  foundation,  Choate
Rosemary  Hall  Foundation, Inc., leaving  Mr.  Kanders  with  no
remaining beneficial interest in the Company's Common Stock.   On
April  18,  1995, John Sanford, the Company's Vice President  and
Chief Financial Officer, acquired, in a private transaction  with
Mr.  Carucci, a $362,500 interest in such convertible note  which
is  convertible into 231,259 shares of the Company's Common Stock
and,  as  such,  Mr. Sanford may be deemed to be  the  beneficial
owner  of  231,259 shares issuable to him upon  his  election  to
convert his interest in the notes.  In addition, Mr. Sanford also
acquired,  in  a private transaction with Mr. Walter  Carucci,  a
warrant to purchase 648,218 shares of the Company's Common  Stock
from Mr. Paparella, exercisable commencing in January 1996.

      As  a result of these transactions as of December 31, 1995,
Mr. Paparella beneficially owns 1,644,653 shares of the Company's
outstanding Common Stock, representing 49.5% of such Common Stock
and, in addition, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford beneficially  own
358,852 shares and 231,259 shares, respectively, of the Company's
common   stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  their  respective
interests in the Convertible Note.  Assuming Mr. Paparella's  and
Mr.  Sanford's  interests  in  the  Convertible  Note  are  fully
converted into such shares of common stock, Mr. Paparella and Mr.
Sanford  may  be  deemed to beneficially  own  the  aggregate  of
2,003,505   shares   and   231,259  shares   of   common   stock,
respectively,  constituting approximately  57.1%  of  the  common
stock of the Company and may be deemed to control the Company.

     Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation.

     Trends

     Due to continued decline in sales and the negative impact of
increased competition, the Company discontinued the operations of
Northern,  which  represented  the  Company's  industrial   crane
business, effective September 28, 1993, and such operations  were
subsequently sold as discussed elsewhere herein.

     The following discussion and analysis of financial condition
pertains  primarily  to  Houze, which  represents  the  remaining
business of the Company.

     Houze    continues   to   face   significant    competition,
particularly  in its core business which consists principally  of
the  decoration  of mugs which are sold to advertising  specialty
distributors.  In an effort to gain market share and  to  compete
with its competitors, many of which are larger companies with far
greater  resources, Houze instituted price reductions  for  large
orders   and  has  increased  its  marketing  efforts  to  retail
distributors  and  holders of licensed  products.   Additionally,
Houze  has made significant improvements to its customer services
area  in response to the higher level of service demanded by  its
customers.

     Liquidity

     The   Company's  consolidated  cash  and  equivalents,  were
$428,000  at  December 31, 1995 compared to $136,000 at  December
31,  1994.   During  this period, cash and equivalents  increased
primarily  due  to collection of $150,000 on notes receivable  in
connection  with  the  sale of Northern, collection  of  $472,500
receivable  from  affiliate in connection with secured  loans  to
Pennsylvania   Engineering  Company,  increased  collections   of
accounts  receivable and maintaining lower levels of inventories,
offset by operating losses.

     From  June  1987 through May 1989, the Company made  certain
secured  loans  to  Pennsylvania Engineering Corporation  ("PEC")
which  may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Company  at
such time, and in connection therewith, at December 31, 1994  the
Company  was  owed  a  principal balance  of  $1,555,000  on  its
outstanding  loans to PEC and $1,032,000 of accrued interest  and
$78,000  of fees.  Such outstanding loans to PEC were payable  on
demand,  bore  interest  at  the  prime  rate  plus  3%  and  are
collateralized  by a mortgage on certain real property  owned  by
PEC's  subsidiary, Lectromelt Corporation.  On February 4,  1992,
PEC  and  its subsidiaries, Birdsboro Corporation and  Lectromelt
Corporation, filed petitions for relief under Chapter  7  of  the
Federal Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania.  A trustee was appointed in
such proceedings on February 7, 1992.  In accordance with Chapter
7  of  the  Code,  upon  such  appointment  the  trustee  assumed
jurisdiction over the assets and all powers with respect  to  the
business  of  PEC and such subsidiary. On December 28,  1994  the
Company received $60,000 in satisfaction of the mortgage from the
sale   of  certain  real  property  owned  by  PEC's  subsidiary,
Lectromelt  Corp. Such proceeds were applied to accrued  interest
receivable  and  a  comparable amount  was  charged  against  the
valuation  reserve and recorded as other income in the  statement
of  operations.   On  September 11, 1995,  the  Company  and  the
Bankruptcy  Trustee  for PEC entered into a Settlement  Agreement
pursuant   to  which  the  Company's  claims  against  PEC   were
recognized  as an allowed, general unsecured claim in the  amount
of  $1,399,986 and provided for a contingent minimum distribution
to  the Company in settlement of such claim in an amount equal to
at  least  33  percent  of  its allowed  claim.   The  Settlement
Agreement  permitted the Company to withdraw from the  settlement
if   the  Trustee's  proposed  distribution  plan  provided   for
distribution  to  the  Company of less than  33  percent  of  the
recognized  claim.   On  October 16, 1995, the  Bankruptcy  Court
approved  the  Trustee's  settlement  with  the  Company  and  on
November 16, 1995 the Trustee made a distribution to the  Company
in  the  amount of $472,541 in full and final settlement  of  the
Company's  claim  against  PEC.  Such proceeds  were  applied  to
accrued  interest receivable, and a comparable amount was charged
against the valuation reserve and recorded as other income in the
statement of operations.
     On  March 11, 1994, Houze entered into an agreement  with  a
bank for a revolving line of credit facility in an amount not  to
exceed  $400,000. The line of credit has since been increased  to
$500,000 and extended to June 30, 1996.  Advances on such line of
credit bear interest at the lending bank's prime rate plus  3.5%.
In  addition, the bank is entitled to reimbursement of  fees  for
auditing  Houze's  accounts receivable during  the  term  of  the
commitment.   Advances are collateralized by accounts receivable,
inventory and an assignment of a $100,000 Certificate of  Deposit
from Fay Penn Economic Development Council and are guaranteed  by
the Company and Messrs. Paparella and Sanford.  No assurances can
be  given  as  to  the  success  of  obtaining  an  extension  or
refinancing subsequent to June 30, 1996.  A failure by  Houze  to
renegotiate such credit facility beyond June 30, 1996 would  have
a material adverse effect on the Company.

     For   the   year  ended  December  31,  1995,  the   Company
compensated  Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford $72,500  and  $59,375,
respectively,  for  management services,  of  which  $60,000  and
$55,000,  respectively, was paid in January 1996.  Mr.  Paparella
and  Mr.  Sanford's annual compensation for 1996 will be  $12,000
and   $12,000, respectively.

In accordance with an agreement with the Company's former lender,
DWG  made  a  principal  payment on  December  31,  1982  on  the
Company's  behalf and purchased interest notes which were  issued
by  the  Company  to such lender in payment of accrued  interest.
Pursuant  to  a Conversion Rights Agreement entered into  between
the  Company and DWG, the obligations of the Company arising from
the  principal payment by DWG and purchase of interest notes were
convertible  into  newly-issued shares of  the  Company's  common
stock.   In  1983,  DWG  converted $651,445 principal  amount  of
interest notes into 651,445 shares of the Company's common stock.
In November and December 1988, the Company repaid all outstanding
interest  notes which aggregated $2,132,000, repaid $4.5  million
of  the  $6.0 million note evidencing such principal payment  and
paid  substantially  all  accrued  interest  owed  to  DWG.   The
remaining principal balance of a $1.5 million note owed to Triarc
Companies, Inc., successor to DWG, as of December 31, 1993  bears
interest at the prime rate and is convertible into 956,937 shares
of  the Company's common stock.  Effective January 10, 1994, such
convertible  note  was purchased by Mr. Bruce Paparella  and  Mr.
Warren  B. Kanders in connection with their acquisition of common
stock from Triarc Companies, Inc., as described elsewhere herein.
On  December 22, 1994, Mr. Kanders donated his 25% rights in such
note  to  a  charitable  institution.  On April  18,  1995,  John
Sanford,   the  Company's  Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial
Officer,  acquired a $362,500 interest in such  convertible  note
which  is convertible into 231,259 shares of the Company's Common
Stock  and,  as  such,  Mr.  Sanford may  be  deemed  to  be  the
beneficial  owner  of 231,259 shares issuable  to  him  upon  his
election to convert his interest in the notes.  In addition,  Mr.
Sanford  also acquired, in a private transaction with Mr.  Walter
Carucci,  a  warrant to purchase 648,218 shares of the  Company's
Common  Stock  from  Mr.  Paparella,  exercisable  commencing  in
January 1996.
     
     As  a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 1995,
Mr. Paparella beneficially owns 1,644,653 shares of the Company's
outstanding Common Stock, representing 49.5% of such Common Stock
and, in addition, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford beneficially  own
358,852 shares and 231,259 shares, respectively, of the Company's
common   stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  their  respective
interests in the Convertible Note.  Assuming Mr. Paparella's  and
Mr.  Sanford's  interests  in  the  Convertible  Note  are  fully
converted into such shares of common stock, Mr. Paparella and Mr.
Sanford  may  be  deemed to beneficially  own  the  aggregate  of
2,003,505   shares   and   231,259  shares   of   common   stock,
respectively,  constituting approximately  57.1%  of  the  common
stock of the Company and may be deemed to control the Company.

     The  Company has incurred losses from operations and  as  of
December 31, 1995, the Company had a stockholders' deficiency  of
$4.0  million and a consolidated working capital deficit of  $2.2
million.

     The  Company's ability to meet its cash requirements in  the
next  year  is  dependent  upon substantial  improvement  in  the
results  of  operations and cash flows, maintaining and  renewing
its  financing from its bank or others.  If these conditions  are
not  satisfactorily  achieved,  the  Company  may  be  unable  to
generate sufficient cash flow to meet its requirements, including
payments  of  amounts  which  may be expended  for  environmental
remediation  described elsewhere herein, and  therefore,  may  be
unable to continue operations.

     The  financial  statements have been  prepared  on  a  going
concern  basis,  and accordingly, do not include any  adjustments
relating  to  the recoverability and classification  of  recorded
asset  amounts nor the amounts and classification of  liabilities
that  might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
in existence or be required to sell its assets.

     Capital Resources

     Capital  expenditures of Houze, were $0, $16,000 and  $9,000
in   1995,  1994  and 1993, respectively.  The Company  does  not
anticipate any material capital expenditures in 1996, other  than
expenditures  by  Houze  for environmental remediation  described
below.

     As described elsewhere herein, the Company became aware that
certain of the products of Houze may have concentrations of  lead
and  cadmium  at  levels which might constitute hazardous  waste.
While  after testing, it was ascertained that products  currently
being  produced  are within acceptable levels, certain  products,
generally  those produced prior to 1980, had unacceptable  levels
of  lead and cadmium.  These products had been disposed of  in  a
disposal  site  located  on  Houze  property.   The  Pennsylvania
Department  of  Environmental Regulation (PDER) and  the  Company
agreed to a consent order on September 22, 1994, which outlines a
plan  for  Houze to remove and encapsulate all of  the  hazardous
waste  and  thereby  comply  with  residual  waste  pile  closure
requirements.  The  Company intends  to  fully  comply  with  the
requirements  of  the consent order. The estimated  cost  of  the
Company's original plan of remediation was increased during  1993
by  $700,000  from $200,000, based on advice from its consultant,
which  was provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
On December 31, 1995, the reserve balance was $845,000 reflecting
a  charge  of $41,000 and $14,000 in actual remediation  expenses
incurred  during 1995 and 1994, respectively.  While the  Company
believes that the total cost of the plan provided by the PDER  in
the  consent  order  discussed above will not exceed  the  amount
reserved,  the  Company is unable at this time to  make  a  final
determination  of the cost of implementation, and therefore,  has
not  adjusted  such  reserve  beyond  that  arising  from  actual
remediation expenditures.  The final costs to complete  the  plan
of remediation may be substantial in relation to the consolidated
financial  position of the Company, which could have  a  material
adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity.

     Inflation and Changing Prices

     Management   believes  that  inflation  did   not   have   a
significant effect on gross margins during the last three years.

     Results of Operations

     1995 Compared with 1994

     Net  sales  decreased  to $5.0 million  in  1995  from  $5.5
million in 1994.  The decrease in net sales and cost of sales was
primarily due to continued erosion of market share resulting from
increased competitive pressures, decreased pricing and  the  lack
of  special contract orders which have supported sales volumes of
Houze in prior years.

     The  Company sold 2.6 million units of decorative  mugs  and
glassware  at  an average price of approximately  $1.91  in  1995
versus  3.1  million units sold at an average price of  $1.79  in
1994.   The .5 million unit decrease in sales volume reduced  the
Company's  sales  by  approximately $895,000.   However,  average
sales  price per unit increased by $.12 which offset such reduced
unit  volume  sales  during 1995 by approximately  $312,000.   In
addition, the Company sold .5 million units of "misprinted  mugs"
at  an  average price of $.07, for which the inventory value  was
reduced  to  zero  in 1994 when such mugs were produced,  because
they were deemed not salable.

       The  Company's  general and administrative  expenses  were
$113,000 higher in 1995 primarily due to increased legal fees  in
connection  with  the  settlement with PEC and  other  litigation
described elsewhere herein.

     Other  income included the collection of $472,500  from  the
final settlement of the Company's claims against PEC, offset by a
$457,000  allowance for principal and interest due from the  sale
of Northern which the Company believes may not be collectible.

     1994 Compared with 1993

     Net  sales  decreased  to $5.5 million  in  1994  from  $7.0
million in 1993. The decrease in net sales and cost of sales  was
primarily due to continued erosion of market share resulting from
increased competitive pressures, decreased pricing and  the  lack
of  special contract orders which have supported sales volumes of
Houze in prior years.

     Loss  from  continuing operations decreased primarily  as  a
result  of  increased  unit prices and gross  margins  and  lower
selling,  general and administrative expenses and the elimination
of  affiliate  charges. The Company sold  3.1  million  units  of
decorative   mugs   and  glassware  at  an   average   price   of
approximately $1.79 in 1994 versus 4.1 million units sold  at  an
average  price of $1.71 in 1993. The 1 million unit  decrease  in
sales  volume  reduced the Company's sales by approximately  $1.8
million. However, average sales price per unit increased by  $.08
which  offset  such  reduced unit volume  sales  during  1994  by
approximately $248,000.  The Company's general and administrative
expenses  were  $461,000 lower in 1994 primarily due  to  tighter
cost  controls.  As a result of the Company's new bank  financing
arrangement  as  of March 1994, total financing  costs  decreased
from $211,000 in 1993 to $50,000 in 1994.

     Loss  from discontinued operations relates to the operations
and  the  sale  of Northern in May 1994 for less than  originally
anticipated at the time of its discontinuance.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 1995

 (1) Basis of Presentation

     Wilson Brothers (the "Company") is a holding company whose
     business is conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary
     Houze Glass Company ("Houze").  Houze operates in the
     specialty advertising business and engages in the decoration
     of glass and ceramic items.  Houze's products are primarily
     distributed throughout the United  States through sales
     representatives.
     
     Principles of Consolidation
     
     All  significant  intercompany items and  transactions  have
     been eliminated in consolidation.
     
     On  April  23,  1993,  DWG Acquisition Group  L.P.  acquired
     shares  of  DWG Corporation ("DWG"), representing  28.6%  of
     DWG's   then  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock.    DWG
     subsequently  changed  its name to  Triarc  Companies,  Inc.
     ("Triarc").   DWG owned at the time approximately  53.7%  of
     the Company's outstanding common stock.
     
     On  January  10,  1994,  pursuant to a  Securities  Purchase
     Agreement  dated  December 28, 1993 among  Bruce  Paparella,
     Warren  B.  Kanders and Triarc, Mr. Paparella acquired  from
     Triarc  1,296,436 shares of the Company's common stock,  and
     Mr.  Kanders  acquired  from Triarc 648,217  shares  of  the
     Company's common stock, collectively replacing Triarc as  59
     percent ownership of the Company's outstanding common stock.
     In  addition, Triarc assigned to Mr. Paparella (75  percent)
     and  Mr.  Kanders  (25  percent) the $l,500,000  outstanding
     balance  of note payable to parent ("Convertible Note")  and
     certain accounts receivable ("Accounts Receivable") held  by
     Triarc in the amount at September 30, 1993 of $l,230,000.
     
     Effective December 30, 1994, Mr. Kanders entered into  three
     separate  stock purchase agreements pursuant  to  which  Mr.
     Kanders transferred the aggregate of 648,217 shares  of  the
     Company's  Common  Stock owned by him to  four  individuals,
     including  Mr.  Paparella who purchased 348,217  shares  for
     $5,000.   The  remainder of these shares were  sold  by  Mr.
     Kanders  to  three individuals who are not  related  to  Mr.
     Paparella.  In addition, the Company has been informed that,
     on  December  22, 1994 Mr. Kanders made a gift  of  his  25%
     portion  of the Convertible Note which was convertible  into
     239,234  shares of Common Stock (representing  6.9%  of  the
     Common   Stock  on  a  fully  diluted  basis  assuming   the
     Convertible  Note was fully converted into  such  shares  of
     Common  Stock) and Mr. Kanders' 25% interest in the Accounts
     Receivable  to a charitable foundation, leaving Mr.  Kanders
     with  no  remaining  beneficial interest  in  the  Company's
     Common  Stock.   On  April  18,  1995,  John  Sanford,   the
     Company's  Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial   Officer,
     acquired a $362,500 interest in such convertible note  which
     is  convertible into 231,259 shares of the Company's  Common
     Stock  and,  as such, Mr. Sanford may be deemed  to  be  the
     beneficial owner of 231,259 shares issuable to him upon  his
     election to convert his interest in the notes.  In addition,
     Mr. Sanford also acquired, in a private transaction with Mr.
     Walter Carucci, a warrant to purchase 648,218 shares of  the
     Company's  Common  Stock  from  Mr.  Paparella,  exercisable
     commencing in January 1996.
     
     As  a  result of these transactions as of December 31, 1995,
     Mr.  Paparella  beneficially owns 1,644,653  shares  of  the
     Company's  outstanding Common Stock, representing  49.5%  of
     such  Common Stock and, in addition, Mr. Paparella  and  Mr.
     Sanford  beneficially own 358,852 shares and 231,259 shares,
     respectively,  of the Company's common stock  issuable  upon
     conversion  of their respective interests in the Convertible
     Note.   Assuming Mr. Paparella's and Mr. Sanford's interests
     in the Convertible Note are fully converted into such shares
     of common stock, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford may be deemed
     to  beneficially own the aggregate of 2,003,505  shares  and
     231,259  shares of common stock, respectively,  constituting
     approximately 57.1% of the common stock of the  Company  and
     may be deemed to control the Company.

     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                                
(2)                            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Use of Estimates

     The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
     with generally accepted accounting principles requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
     contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
     and expenses during the period.  Actual results could differ
     from those estimates.
     
     Properties

     Properties    are   carried   at   cost   less   accumulated
     depreciation.  Depreciation is computed on the straight-line
     method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging
     from four to forty years.
     
     Assets which have been fully depreciated are retained in the
     accounts for as long as they are useful to operations.  Upon
     disposition,  it is the Company's policy to  eliminate  from
     the accounts the carrying value of the asset and the related
     accumulated  depreciation or amortization and to  credit  or
     charge the resulting profit or loss to operations.
     
     Effective  for  fiscal years beginning  after  December  15,
     1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121 - "Accounting for the
     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to  be
     Disposed  of",  which is not expected  to  have  a  material
     effect  on  the  Company's reported  financial  position  or
     results of operations.
     
     Income Taxes
     
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109,
     "Accounting  for Income Taxes", which had no effect  on  the
     Company's   reported  financial  position  or   results   of
     operations.
     
     Loss per Share
     
     Loss  per  share has been computed using only  the  weighted
     average  number  of  outstanding  shares  of  common   stock
     (3,321,039  shares  in each year), since  the  inclusion  of
     common stock equivalents (shares issuable upon conversion of
     the note referred to in Note 9) would be antidilutive.
     
     Concentration of Credit Risk
     
     The  Company's  financial instruments that  are  exposed  to
     concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  and
     accounts and notes receivable.  The Company places its  cash
     with high quality financial institutions.
     
     Cash and Equivalents
     
     The  Company classifies as cash and equivalents  all  highly
     liquid  investments with a maturity of three months or  less
     when purchased.

     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                                
(3)  Discontinued Operations
     
     On September 28, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the
     sale or liquidation  of  its  wholly-owned subsidiary Northern Engineering
     Corporation  ("Northern"),  the  Company's  crane   business
     segment.  Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
     for  each  of  the periods presented have been  restated  to
     reflect  such business segment as discontinued.  On May  12,
     1994,  the  Company  sold all of the outstanding  shares  of
     Northern to a corporation controlled by a former director of
     the Company.
     
     In  consideration for the sale of the Northern  shares,  the
     Company  received  $10,000, plus a secured  promissory  note
     (the  "Note") in the principal amount of $750,000  repayable
     on  or  before  May  1, 1999, which bears  interest  payable
     quarterly   at   8  percent  per  annum.    Such   note   is
     collateralized  by certain real property  of  Northern  (the
     "Mortgaged  Property").   The  Mortgaged  Property  was  not
     appraised  in  connection  with  the  transaction.   If  the
     Mortgaged  Property  is  sold,  all  of  the  principal  and
     interest is immediately due and payable.

     Effective October 28, 1994, the Company agreed to reduce the
     percentage from 50 percent to 30 percent of the amount  that
     the  Company  shall be entitled to receive if the  Mortgaged
     Property  is  sold in excess of $750,000.  In exchange,  the
     purchaser made a partial prepayment of the principal of  the
     Note in the amount of $150,000 which was paid by November 7,
     1994, and has made an additional $150,000 partial prepayment
     on January 15, 1995.  The purchaser had the option to prepay
     the  remaining  principal balance of the Note  by  June  30,
     1995.   Such  prepayment was not made,  and  therefore,  the
     purchaser was to additionally compensate the Company $50,000
     by  July  15, 1995, of which $10,000 has been  paid.   As  a
     result,  the Company believes that the principal  amount  of
     the   Note   and  accrued  interest  thereon  may   not   be
     collectible, and therefore has made a full valuation reserve
     in  the December 31, 1995 financial statements in the amount
     of $450,000 for principal, plus $6,000 for accrued interest.
     The   Company  intends  to  pursue  all  opportunities   for
     collection,  including repossession and liquidation  of  the
     Mortgaged Property.
     
     Sales of Northern were $662,000 and $2,134,000 for each of the
     years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.
     
(4)  Inventories

(6)  Notes Receivable from Affiliates

     From  June  1987 through May 1989, the Company made  certain
     secured  loans  to Pennsylvania Engineering  Corp.  ("PEC"),
     which  may  be  deemed  to have been  an  affiliate  of  the
     Company.  In connection therewith, as of December 31,  1994,
     the  Company  was owed a principal balance of $1,555,000  on
     its  outstanding  loans  to PEC and  $1,032,000  of  accrued
     interest and $78,000 of fees.  PEC filed for bankruptcy.  On
     December   28,  1994,  the  Company  received   $60,000   in
     satisfaction  of the mortgage from the sale of certain  real
     property  owned by PEC's subsidiary, Lectromelt Corporation.
     Such  proceeds were applied to accrued interest  receivable,
     and  a  comparable amount was charged against the  valuation
     reserve  and  recorded as other income in the  statement  of
     operations.   On  September 11, 1995, the  Company  and  the
     Bankruptcy   Trustee  for  PEC  entered  into  a  Settlement
     Agreement pursuant to which the Company's claims against PEC
     were  recognized as an allowed, general unsecured  claim  in
     the  amount  of  $1,399,986 and provided  for  a  contingent
     minimum  distribution to the Company in settlement  of  such
     claim  in  an  amount equal to at least 33  percent  of  its
     allowed  claim.   The  Settlement  Agreement  permitted  the
     Company  to  withdraw from the settlement if  the  Trustee's
     proposed distribution plan provided for distribution to  the
     Company of less than 33 percent of the recognized claim.  On
     October   16,  1995,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  approved   the
     Trustee's  settlement with the Company and on  November  16,
     1995  the Trustee made a distribution to the Company in  the
     amount  of  $472,541  in full and final  settlement  of  the
     Company's claim against PEC.  Such proceeds were applied  to
     accrued  interest  receivable, and a comparable  amount  was
     charged against the valuation reserve and recorded as  other
     income in the statement of operations.
     
(7)  Income Taxes and Other Liabilities
     
     As a result of the change in ownership effective January 10,
     1994  as  described  in  Note 1, substantially  all  of  the
     Company's   pre-acquisition   Federal   income   tax    loss
     carryforwards  and  tax  credit  carryforwards   have   been
     eliminated.   As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the  Company
     provided a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax
     assets  of  $1,005,000  and  $792,000,  respectively.    The
     deferred tax assets primarily result from the 1995 and  1994
     net losses and certain differences in the tax basis and book
     basis of inventories, receivables and liabilities.
     
     The  reported tax provision and a computed tax benefit based
     on  the loss from continuing operations before income  taxes
     are reconciled as follows:

(8)  Short-term Borrowings
     
     In  November  1991,  the  Company's wholly-owned  subsidiary
     Houze  Glass Corporation ("Houze") entered into an  accounts
     receivable  financing arrangement with a commercial  lender.
     Such  arrangement provided for advances to be  made  against
     accounts receivable sold thereunder of up to 75% of the full
     net  amount thereof, interest on such advances at the  prime
     rate  plus 1%, the payment of a commission of 1.25%  of  the
     full  amount  of all accounts receivable for which  advances
     were  made  and  the  payment of an  administrative  fee  of
     $50,000 per year.  Pursuant to the arrangement, all accounts
     receivable  of Houze were pledged as additional  collateral.
     On  March  4, 1994, Houze entered into an agreement  with  a
     bank  for  a revolving line of credit facility in an  amount
     not  to  exceed $400,000.  Advances on such line  of  credit
     bear  interest at the lending bank's prime rate  plus  3.5%.
     In  addition, the bank is entitled to reimbursement of  fees
     for auditing Houze's accounts receivable during the term  of
     the  commitment.   Advances are collateralized  by  accounts
     receivable,  inventory  and  an  assignment  of  a  $100,000
     Certificate  of  Deposit from Fay Penn Economic  Development
     Council  and  are guaranteed by the Company  and  Mr.  Bruce
     Paparella,  the  Company's President and  Mr.  Sanford,  the
     Company's  Vice President and Chief Financial  Officer.   On
     March 11, 1994, Houze was advanced $160,000 of the revolving
     line  of  credit  and used the proceeds to  repay  the  then
     outstanding  borrowings  under the  aforementioned  accounts
     receivable  financing arrangement.  The  revolving  line  of
     credit facility maturity was extended from December 30, 1994
     to  June  30, 1996 with a limit of $500,000.  No  assurances
     can be given as to the success of obtaining an extension  or
     refinancing subsequent to June 30, 1996.  A failure by Houze
     to  renegotiate such credit facility would have  a  material
     adverse effect on the Company.

     The  short-term borrowings of Houze as of and for the  years
     ended December 31 are as follows:

(9)  Note Payable to Majority Owners
     
     Note payable to majority owners as of December 31, 1995 and
     December 31, 1994 in the amount of $1,500,000 bears interest
     at the prime rate and is convertible to 956,937 shares of
     the Company's common stock.  Mr. Paparella is the owner of a
     37.5% interest in such Note and, as such, is the beneficial
     owner of 358,852 shares of the Company's Common Stock
     issuable to Mr. Paparella upon his election to convert his
     interest in the Note.  In December 1994, Mr. Kanders made a
     gift of his 25% interest in the Note to a charitable
     foundation and such charitable foundation is the beneficial
     owner of 239,234 shares of the Company's Common Stock
     issuable upon conversion of its interest in the Note.  On
     April 18, 1995, John Sanford, the Company's Vice President
     and Chief Financial Officer, acquired a $362,500 interest in
     such convertible note.  As a result,  Mr. Sanford is the
     beneficial owner of 231,259 shares issuable to him upon his
     election to convert his interest in the notes.  Conversion
     by the majority owners would be dilutive of their individual
     percentage ownership of the Company's aggregate outstanding
     common stock.


 (10)                   Pension Plan
     
     Houze  has  a  defined  benefit  plan  covering  hourly-paid
     employees.   Contributions are computed using the  projected
     unit credit method of funding, the objective of which is  to
     fund  each  participant's benefits under the  plan  as  they
     accrue.  Houze's funding policy is to contribute the minimum
     amount  required by the Employee Retirement Income  Security
     Act  of  1974.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, no contributions
     were required to be made under the plan.

     The net periodic pension cost for the plan in 1995, 1994 and
     1993 was $45,000, $42,000 and $40,000, respectively.  The
     components of the net periodic pension cost are as follows:

     were used in developing this data.  Plan assets are invested
     in a managed portfolio, consisting primarily of corporate
     bonds and common stock.

     Related Party Transactions
     
     There were no charges from affiliates for the year ended
     December 31, 1995. The Company was charged $19,000 during
     1994 for consulting services provided by a firm of which an
     officer of the Company is a partner.  Charges from
     affiliates for the year ended December 31, 1993 include
     $751,000 of non-recurring charges to the Company by Triarc
     for the Company's allocated portion of costs to terminate
     the lease on Triarc's corporate headquarters ($157,000) as
     well as the allocated costs related to a five-year
     
                Wilson Brothers and Subsidiaries
        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                                
     consulting  agreement between Triarc  and  the  former  Vice
     Chairman of Triarc and the Company ($594,000).
     
     In  addition,  DWG  charged  approximately  $98,000  to  the
     Company  for the period January 1993 through April 1993  for
     management  services,  allocations of  certain  reserves  on
     amounts owed to DWG, and costs of allocated leased space and
     equipment.
     
     The  Company  leased transportation and other equipment  for
     $17,000 from a subsidiary of DWG in 1993.
     
     The   Company   and  its  subsidiaries  maintained   certain
     insurance coverage with Chesapeake Insurance Company Limited
     ("Chesapeake Insurance"), a subsidiary of DWG which may have
     been  deemed  to  be an affiliate of the Company.   Premiums
     attributable  to  such insurance coverage,  which  consisted
     principally  of property coverage, amounted to approximately
     $4,000   in  1993.   In  addition,  the  Company   and   its
     subsidiaries  maintained  certain  insurance  coverage  with
     unaffiliated   insurance  companies  for  which   Chesapeake
     Insurance  reinsured a portion of the  risk.   Net  premiums
     attributable to such reinsurance were approximately  $89,000
     in 1993.

     For   information  concerning  certain  other   transactions
     between  the  Company and other corporations  which  may  be
     deemed  to  be  affiliates of the Company, see  other  Notes
     included elsewhere herein.
     
(12) Business Segments
     
     Continuing  operations  comprise one business  segment:  the
     decorative glass segment.  No single customer accounted  for
     10% or more of consolidated net sales in 1995, 1994 or 1993.
     
(13) Commitments and Contingencies
     
     The  Company has incurred losses from operations and  as  of
     December   31,   1995,  the  Company  had  a   stockholders'
     deficiency  of  $4.0  million  and  a  consolidated  working
     capital deficit of $2.2 million.
     
     The  Company's ability to meet its cash requirements in  the
     next  year is dependent upon substantial improvement in  the
     results  of  operations  and  cash  flows,  maintaining  and
     renewing  its financing from its bank or others.   If  these
     conditions are not satisfactorily achieved, the Company  may
     be  unable  to  generate sufficient cash flow  to  meet  its
     requirements,  including payments of amounts  which  may  be
     expended for environmental remediation described below,  and
     therefore, may be unable to continue operations.

     The  financial  statements have been  prepared  on  a  going
     concern   basis,  and  accordingly,  do  not   include   any
     adjustments    relating    to   the    recoverability    and
     classification of recorded asset amounts nor the amounts and
     classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
     the  Company  be  unable  to continue  in  existence  or  be
     required to sell its assets.

     The Company has become aware that certain of the products of
     Houze may have concentrations of lead and cadmium at levels
     which might constitute hazardous waste.  While after
     testing, it was ascertained that products currently being
     produced are within acceptable levels, certain products,
     generally those produced prior to 1980, had unacceptable
     levels of lead and cadmium.  These products had been
     disposed of in a disposal site located on the property of
     the decorative glass segment.  The Pennsylvania Department
     of Environmental Regulation ("PDER") and the Company agreed
     to a consent order on September 22, 1994, which outlines a
     plan for Houze to remove and encapsulate all of the
     hazardous waste and thereby comply with residual waste pile
     closure requirements.  The Company intends to fully
     
                Wilson Brothers and Subsidiaries
        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                                
     comply  with  the  requirements of the consent  order.   The
     estimated cost of the Company's original plan of
     remediation  was  increased during  1993  by  $700,000  from
     $200,000, based on advice from its outside consultant.   The
     additional  costs were provided for in the 1993 consolidated
     financial  statements.  At December  31,  1995  the  reserve
     balance was $825,000.
     
     While  the Company believes that the total cost of the  plan
     agreed  to by the PDER in the consent order discussed  above
     will  not exceed the amount reserved, the Company is  unable
     at  this  time to make a final determination of the cost  of
     implementation,  and  therefore,  has  not   adjusted   such
     reserve.  During the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
     $41,000  and  $14,000,  respectively,  was  charged  to  the
     reserve  for costs incurred in connection with the Company's
     compliance  with the PDER's plan to encapsulate all  of  the
     hazardous waste.
     
     By  agreement dated January 1, 1995, the Company, Houze  and
     Triarc  agreed to settle an outstanding claim  by  a  former
     officer  of Houze for bonuses owed.  The agreement  provides
     that  Houze  will  pay to the former officer  the  aggregate
     amount  of  $37,500 in several installments by December  31,
     1996 of which $31,350 was paid in 1995.  The original amount
     of   such   claim  previously  recorded  in  the   financial
     statements  of  approximately  $116,000  plus  interest  was
     reduced accordingly.
     
     In  addition to the litigation noted above, and as discussed
     under Item 3 Legal Proceedings, the Company is from time  to
     time involved in other routine litigation incidental to  its
     business,  the outcome of which in the opinion of management
     will  not  have  a material adverse effect on the  Company's
     consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 11.  Executive Compensation.

     During  the  year  ended  December  31,  1995,  the  Company
compensated Bruce Paparella $72,500 and John Sanford $59,375  for

salaries  to  the  Company's Chief Executive  Officer  and  Chief
Financial  Officer in the annual amounts of $12,000 and  $12,000,
respectively, for management services.

     All  of the Company's executive officers hold positions with
non-affiliated  companies (see Item 10) that pay compensation  to
such  officers.  Each such officer devotes the time necessary  to
the  Company  and to his non-affiliated employer as is  necessary
for the effective discharge of his duties.  The Company is unable
to  estimate the approximate amount of time spent by the officers
listed  in  Item  10  on  the affairs  of  the  Company  and  its
subsidiaries.   No  minimum amount of  time  is  required  to  be
devoted to such affairs by any such officers.

Management.

beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's Common Stock,  as

five percent of such shares, by each director of the Company,  by
each executive officer named in Item 10 and by all directors  and

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Transactions.

     In  connection  with  the  sale of control  of  the  Company
pursuant  to  a Securities Purchase Agreement dated December  28,
1993,  Triarc Companies, Inc. ("Triarc"), the former  controlling
shareholder   of  the  Company,  assigned  to  Bruce   Paparella,
President  and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and  Warren
B.  Kanders, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the  Company's
common  stock, the $1,500,000 outstanding balance of a note  (the
"Note")  by  the  Company  and certain accounts  receivable  (the
"Accounts  Receivable") of the Company  held  by  Triarc  in  the
amount, at September 30, 1993, of $1,230,000.

Effective  December  30,  1994, Mr. Kanders  entered  into  three
separate   stock   purchase  agreements,  whereby   Mr.   Kanders
transferred  all of his shares of the Company's common  stock  to
four  individuals, including Mr. Paparella who purchased  348,217
shares  for  $5,000.   In  addition, on December  22,  1994,  Mr.
Kanders  made  a  gift of his portion of the  Note  and  Accounts
Receivable  to  a  charitable foundation,  leaving  him  with  no
remaining beneficial interest in the Company's common stock.   On
April  18,  1995, John Sanford, the Company's Vice President  and
Chief  Financial  Officer, acquired a $362,500 interest  in  such
convertible note which is convertible into 231,259 shares of  the
Company's Common Stock and, as such, Mr. Sanford may be deemed to
be  the  beneficial owner of 231,259 shares issuable to him  upon
his  election to convert his interest in the notes.  In addition,
Mr.  Sanford  also  acquired, in a private transaction  with  Mr.
Walter  Carucci,  a  warrant to purchase 648,218  shares  of  the
Company's Common Stock from Mr. Paparella, exercisable commencing
in January 1996.

      As  a result of these transactions as of December 31, 1995,
Mr. Paparella beneficially owns 1,644,653 shares of the Company's
outstanding Common Stock, representing 49.5% of such Common Stock
and, in addition, Mr. Paparella and Mr. Sanford beneficially  own
358,852 shares and 231,259 shares, respectively, of the Company's
common   stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  their  respective
interests in the Convertible Note.  Assuming Mr. Paparella's  and
Mr.  Sanford's  interests  in  the  Convertible  Note  are  fully
converted into such shares of common stock, Mr. Paparella and Mr.
Sanford  may  be  deemed to beneficially  own  the  aggregate  of
2,003,505   shares   and   231,259  shares   of   common   stock,
respectively,  constituting approximately  57.1%  of  the  common
stock of the Company and may be deemed to control the Company.
     
     In  connection  with the change of control  of  DWG,  Steven
Posner,  who was Vice Chairman of the Board of the Company  prior
to  April 23, 1993, entered into a five-year consulting agreement
with DWG providing for an initial payment of $1.0 million at  the
commencement  of  the  term  of  such  agreement  and  an  annual
consulting  fee of $1.0 million per annum for the performance  of
his duties under such consulting agreement.  After the change  of
control  of DWG on April 23, 1993, Triarc allocated the costs  of
Mr.  Posner's consulting agreement to its subsidiaries, including
the  company.   The Company was allocated $594,000 in  connection
with  such consulting agreement, although no payment was made  by
the  Company to Triarc during 1993 with respect to the consulting
agreement.
