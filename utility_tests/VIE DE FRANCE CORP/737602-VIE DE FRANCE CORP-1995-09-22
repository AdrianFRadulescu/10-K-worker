ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     The Company is currently engaged in only one industry segment as of June
24, 1995. Accordingly, no segment data is included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for fiscal year ending June 24, 1995.

GENERAL

     The Company is a leading manufacturer in the United States of food
products for the food service industry using the sous vide food processing
technology.  The Company opened a USDA-approved food processing plant in
Alexandria, Virginia in May 1990 and began operating another plant in Norway in
August 1994.  Sous vide is an advanced system of food preparation, developed in
France, which cooks meats, seafood, poultry, sauces and vegetables over time
using low heat.  Before the cooking process begins, the product is
vacuum-sealed in special plastic pouches that better maintain the food's flavor
and moisture in comparison to other methods of cooking.  Following the
completion of the cooking process, the product can be either frozen or
refrigerated for distribution.  Currently, all of the Company's products are
frozen.  The Company also works with equipment manufacturers to provide
efficient computer controlled reheating equipment to its sous vide food service
providers who effectively convert their operations into sous vide kitchens and
improve customer satisfaction through better and consistent product quality,
while realizing reductions in their food and labor costs as a result of this
technology.

     Vie de France was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1974.  Its
principal executive offices are located at 85 South Bragg Street, Suite 600,
Alexandria, VA 22312 and its telephone number at that location is (703)
750-9600.

BACKGROUND

     The Company commenced operations in 1972 as a wholesale producer of French
bread for daily delivery to the Washington, DC area.  The Company expanded its
markets throughout the 1970s.  In fiscal year 1979, the Company began offering
its product through Company-owned retail bakeries where the products could be
freshly baked throughout the day.  During the 1980s, the Company expanded its
frozen dough product line and developed processes to facilitate the baking of
these products at the point-of-sale.  As of May 1994, the Company owned and
operated 31 retail units.  The Company sold the Bakery Division and the
Restaurant Division to Vie de France Yamazaki, Inc. in 1991 and 1994,
respectively.

     The Company began development of the sous vide business in 1987, in
conjunction with research performed previously by Nouvelle Carte France, a
French company.  As a result of the growth in the application of sous vide in
Europe, the Board authorized the establishment of the Vie de France Culinary
Corporation for the express purpose of the research and development of sous
vide for the U.S. market.  This Company was formed in 1987, and was later
merged into Vie de France Corporation.  In 1989, construction began on a 30,000
square foot plant in Alexandria, Virginia designed to manufacture its sous vide
product line under the trade name Vie de France Culinary.  The Culinary plant
began operations in May 1990.  The plant has since expanded to 50,000 square
feet.

     During fiscal years 1991 through 1995, the Culinary Division successfully
built its sous vide sales volume from zero to over $2.0 million in fiscal year
1991, $4.6 million in fiscal year 1992, $8.2 million in fiscal year 1993, $12.1
million in fiscal year 1994 and $15.0 million in fiscal year 1995.  In 1992,
the Company started a national direct sales organization to continue to
increase sales.  The Company is focusing its sales efforts on wholesale
customers in the hotel industry and national/regional restaurant chains, as
well as large-volume food providers such as the airline and transportation
industries.

     In order to reduce costs, increase quality and increase production
capacity, the Company is pursuing the development and construction of single
product sous vide production plants located adjacent to, or in the proximity of
suppliers of raw materials.  One such plant, located in Norway, began
production in August 1994.  The Company currently has capacity in its plants to
support near term sales growth.

PRODUCTS

     The Company offers a wide range of sous vide products including entrees,
side dishes, and sauces.  The entree items consist of a variety of seafood,
pork, beef and poultry items.  Side dishes and sauces range from vegetables and
rice to cream or tomato-based sauces.  The products are sealed in either single
or multi-serving packaging and then case-packed.  Single-pack items offer the
greatest flexibility to the customer, while multi-pack packaging provides
increased efficiency and economy for large-volume banquets.





                                                                               2
<PAGE>   4
During fiscal year 1995, the Company began packaging its products for retail
consumption. The Company is currently testing this market with a line of
products being sold through outlets such as Sam's Club, a division of Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.

DISTRIBUTION

     The Culinary Division distributes its products in a frozen state to
customers nationwide and internationally primarily to Asian markets.  The
Company expects to expand distribution into the European markets in fiscal year
1996 in conjunction with last year's opening of the Norwegian production
facility.  Its products are stored in a number of regional frozen warehouses as
well as at the Alexandria, Virginia plant.  Major regional food service
distributors, including Sage Distribution, Kraft Food Service and Sysco Food
Service, purchase the product from the Company and re-sell to food service
providers.  Export products are transported in frozen containers via ship.

RAW MATERIAL STATUS

     The Company buys its raw materials from a number of suppliers at market
prices.  While these prices may fluctuate during the year, the Company does not
believe that availability poses a material risk to its business.  The majority
of product sales are subject to price revision to reflect shifts in the price
of raw materials.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS AND OTHER ITEMS IMPORTANT TO OPERATING SEGMENTS

     The Company believes that its Vie de France trademark is important to its
business success.  Accordingly, it takes the necessary steps to protect it.
The Company and Vie de France Yamazaki, Inc. entered into a Trademark and
Service Mark License Agreement in 1991 and, in conjunction with the sale of the
Restaurant Division, amended and restated this agreement.  The Company holds no
patents that are essential for its continued operations.

CUSTOMER DEPENDENCY

     Food service distributors continued to be the leading market segment for
the Company with fiscal year 1995 sales representing approximately 59% of total
net sales.  In fiscal year 1995, sales to food service distributors
representing Hyatt Hotels and Marriott Hotels accounted for 32% and 21% of
total net sales, respectively.  Sales to the airline industry in fiscal year
1995 represented 29% of total net sales, which was comprised of sales to five
national/international carriers and one regional carrier.  In fiscal years 1994
and 1993, sales to food service distributors representing Marriott hotels
amounted to 55% and 68% of total net sales, respectively.  In fiscal year 1994,
sales to food service distributors representing Hyatt hotels amounted to 16% of
total net sales.  Sales to distributors serving the airline industry
represented 17% and 11% of total net sales in fiscal years 1994 and 1993
respectively.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Sales and Gross Margins."

SEASONALITY

     Culinary sales are seasonally impacted by the hotel banquet industry,
which peaks in September through December and March through June.

COMPETITION

     The Company considers itself to be a leader in the sous vide segment of
the food service industry.  At present, limited competition exists within the
frozen wholesale component of this segment.  However, other firms exist within
the retail and refrigerated components of the sous vide segment.  As such, the
Culinary Division primarily competes for sales against the traditional forms of
food preparation, rather than against other sous vide suppliers.  The Company
offers value-added products, but must offer these products in a price range
that makes it economically advantageous for its users to convert from
traditional methods of food preparation.  The Company believes its products can
compete against these traditional methods in price and product performance, as
well as convenience.  The Company also provides a full product line of items to
further compete against traditional kitchens.  In addition, it offers
implementation and menu development services, as well as equipment, to its
customers as another means of building sales.  The Company depends upon its
pricing structure, menu items, and customer service programs as a means of
maintaining its leadership position within the sous vide industry.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

     For continuing operations, the Company invested $94,000, $95,000 and
$67,000 in research and development activities in fiscal years 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  The Company invests in development on an ongoing basis in
order to maintain the vitality of its product lines and to build sales.

REGULATION

     The Company is subject to various Federal, state and local laws affecting
its business, including health, sanitation and safety regulations.  The
Culinary-U.S. plant operates under USDA supervision over the handling and
labeling of its products.  The Company believes its operations comply in all
material respects with applicable laws and regulations.

     The Company's Norwegian plant meets European Community standards and
regulations.  The Norwegian product, along with certain raw materials, are
subject to import regulations.

EMPLOYEES

     The Company employs approximately 110 people including full-time and
part-time workers and corporate staff.





                                                                               4
<PAGE>   6
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Company leases its offices and its two manufacturing facilities.  The
Culinary-U.S. plant, located in Alexandria, Virginia, is approximately 50,000
square feet.  The Culinary-Norway plant, located in Hjelmeland, Norway, is
approximately 20,000 square feet.

     The Company's Norway plant operates under a twenty-year capital lease
whereby the Company will own the facility at the end of the lease term.

The Company owns substantially all of the equipment used in its facilities.

     Lease commitments and future minimum lease payments are shown in Note 8 to
the  Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in this Form 10-K.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is engaged in ordinary and routine litigation incidental to
its business, but management does not believe that any amounts it may be
required to pay by reason thereof will have a material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     None.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Fiscal year 1995 represents a year in which the Company's operations
were dedicated to developing and improving its sous vide food manufacturing
business.  As part of its strategy to open new markets and reduce its cost of
raw materials, the Company established and opened its second plant, in Norway,
which is the world's pre-eminent source of salmon.  The current year results
reflect continued improvement in both sales and earnings for its U.S.
operations offset, however, by losses associated with the Norwegian operations.
These results, when taken together with investment income and a gain associated
with discontinued operations, produced a profitable fiscal year 1995.

SALES AND GROSS MARGINS

         The Company's sales of sous vide products are generally to hotels,
airlines, and other food service providers who order through their distributor
networks.  In fiscal year 1993, the Company's customer base included Marriott
hotels along with one airline.  In fiscal year 1994, a second national hotel
chain, Hyatt hotels, became a significant customer.  Total food service sales
represented 71% of total net sales, with airline customers representing
approximately 17% of total net sales.  During fiscal year 1995, the Company's
hotel sales amounted to 59% of total





7
<PAGE>   9
net sales, with Hyatt and Marriott representing 32% and 21% of total net sales
respectively.  As of June 24, 1995, approximately 104 Hyatt and 90 Marriott
properties were using sous vide products.  The Company has also significantly
expanded its sales to the airline industry, now selling to six major airlines.

         The Company expanded its sales within the foodservice market by adding
a national health care chain, Unicare, to its customer base.  In addition, it
also began to sell to the retail market, through the introduction of a specific
product line developed for Sam's Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
This effort began during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995, and thus, does
not represent any significant volume of sales in fiscal year 1995.  The Company
believes that its sales to Sam's Club and other retail channels can reach
significant levels in the upcoming fiscal year.  As a result of the exposure
stemming from these two new accounts, the Company has received inquiries from a
number of prospective customers.  Discussions and recipe development work are
currently underway with these prospective customers.

         A comparison of net sales, gross margin percentages and losses from
operations follows:

</TABLE>

        Fiscal year 1995 sales increased by 23% over fiscal year 1994 to
$15,707,000 from $12,786,000.  This increase is attributed to substantial
growth within the airline segment.  Sales to Hyatt increased during fiscal year
1995, offsetting a decrease of sales to Marriott.  During fiscal year 1994, as
compared to fiscal year 1993, total sales increased by 36% to $12,786,000 from
$9,377,000.  This growth is primarily attributable to the expansion of sales to
Hyatt and airline customers.

        Gross margin as a percentage of total net sales increased to 30% from
23% in fiscal year 1995 versus fiscal year 1994 due primarily to lower raw
material costs during the year along with increased labor productivity.  These
improvements were offset, somewhat, due to the start-up effects of the Norway
plant.  Gross margin improved by one percentage point in 1994 versus 1993 due
to the benefits associated with higher volume in the Alexandria, Virginia
plant.  The Company expects the gross margin to further improve as its
Norwegian subsidiary builds its sales volume.  Over the long term, a further
reduction of costs will be realized from the construction of highly efficient
mono-product facilities that are closer to the source of that product's raw
materials, along with the purchasing leverage created from increased volumes.

        The Company has successfully expanded its product line and manufactures
seafood, beef, poultry, vegetable and sauce products packaged in bulk or
multiple servings suitable for banquet





                                                                               8

</TABLE>

        Selling, distribution and administrative costs increased as a
percentage of net sales to 33% from 28%.  For fiscal year 1995, these costs
increased by 46% as compared to the prior year, to $5,221,000 from $3,579,000.
This increase is due to the selling expenses associated with Norway, for which
there were few outside sales, additional sales personnel in the United States
who are just beginning to generate sales, and residual corporate costs that
still are present within the Company, but were partially allocable to the
former Restaurant Division in prior years.  These costs decreased as a
percentage of net sales from 33% to 28% in fiscal year 1994 compared to fiscal
year 1993, as the rate of sales growth offset the rate of real dollar growth in
this expense category.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

        Depreciation and amortization increased by $356,000 to $1,053,000 for
fiscal year 1995 versus $697,000 for fiscal year 1994.  This increase is
attributable to the depreciation associated with the Norway plant.  For fiscal
year 1994 as compared to fiscal year 1993, depreciation and amortization
increased by $79,000 from 1993's level of $618,000.

NONOPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE

        Investment income consists of returns earned on funds received from the
sale of the Restaurant Division together with interest income associated with a
$4.9 million collateralized European bank deposit, which earns interest at a
rate which the Company believes to be in excess of the prevailing short-term
interest rates in the United States.

        Interest expense relates to the borrowings, including a capital lease,
associated with the Company's Norwegian subsidiary.  At June 24, 1995, the
Company, through its Norwegian subsidiary, had borrowings of approximately $3.0
million, bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.25% to 10.0%.  It is
anticipated that these borrowings will remain outstanding during the upcoming
fiscal year.

PROVISION FOR TAXES

        The provision for income taxes in fiscal year 1995 relates primarily to
the difference between fiscal year 1994's estimated income tax accrual for
continuing operations and that same year's actual income expense computed
during fiscal year 1995.  The net effect of a variety of timing differences for
fiscal year 1994 resulted in additional income, and therefore, additional
income tax.  The impact of this difference is reflected in the current year's
operating results.

        In fiscal year 1994, the gain generated by the sale of the Restaurant
Division resulted in the Company fully utilizing its available net operating
loss tax carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million.  As part of the
accounting for the sale of the former Restaurant Division, income taxes were
allocated between results from continuing operations, loss from discontinued
operations and the gain on sale of discontinued operations based on the taxable
income or loss of each component.  As a result, $116,000 was recorded as a tax
benefit from continuing operations.  In addition, a tax benefit of $687,000 and
a tax provision of $4,438,000 were recorded against discontinued operations and
gain on disposal of discontinued operations, respectively, which amounts to a
total net tax provision of $3,635,000 charged against fiscal year 1994
earnings.

        Because of the Company's operating losses, no net provision for income
taxes was recorded in fiscal year 1993.  In fiscal year 1993, a tax benefit of
$135,000 was recorded against the loss from continuing operations, a provision
of $258,000 was recorded against income from discontinued operations, and an
extraordinary gain of $123,000 related to the use of net operating loss
carryforwards fully offset the net income tax provision.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

        (Loss) income from discontinued operations reflects the operating
results attributable to the operations of the former Restaurant Division, net
of income tax effects, in fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993.  The loss for
fiscal year 1994 also includes the estimated costs to settle a recent claim by
the Environmental Protection Agency related to the former Bakery Division
(which was sold in 1991) of $250,000.

        Gain from discontinued operations for the current year relates to the
reduction of reserves previously established for the former Restaurant
Division.  In the third quarter of fiscal year 1995, the Company reduced its
reserves by $213,000, and by an additional $517,000 in the fourth quarter.
These reductions were possible due to the expiration of certain contingent
liabilities.

        The gain on the sale of the Restaurant Division in fiscal year 1994 is
net of income taxes of $4.4 million.  Net proceeds on the sale amounted to
$17.6 million, after transaction and related direct disposal costs of
approximately $2.8 million.  In addition, Yamazaki assumed certain outstanding
liabilities of the Division.





                                                                              10
<PAGE>   12
IMPACT OF INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY

        Inflation has from time to time had a material impact on the Company's
expenses.  Inflation in labor and ingredient costs can significantly affect the
Company's operations.  Many of the Company's employees are paid hourly rates
related to, but generally higher than the federal minimum rates.

        The Company's sales pricing structure allows for the fluctuation of raw
material prices.  As a result, market price variations do not significantly
affect the gross margin realized on product sales.  Customer sensitivity to
price changes can influence the overall sales of individual products.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        The Company has experienced a decline in its liquidity over the past
year.  The combined total of the cash and short-term investment balances was
$14,210,000 and $17,887,000 at June 24, 1995 and June 25, 1994, respectively.
Additionally, the Company held investments of $2,025,000 and $5,050,000 at June
24, 1995 and June 25, 1994, respectively, with maturities greater than one
year.  In addition, the Company holds one preferred stock investment of
$500,000 at June 24, 1995.  This decrease in liquidity is a direct result of
the increased working capital requirements for the Company along with an
increase in the Notes Receivable to a related party.

        Cash used by operations amounted to $6,056,000 and $990,000 in fiscal
years 1995 and 1994 respectively, as compared to cash provided of $1,513,000
for fiscal year 1993.  The use of cash in fiscal year 1995 resulted primarily
from the payment of income taxes related to the sale of the former Restaurant
Division, along with increases in inventory, receivables, and notes receivable.
The use of cash in fiscal year 1994 resulted primarily from increases in
inventory and receivables relating to increased sales volumes, as well as
income tax payments.  Fiscal year 1993 cash generated by operations primarily
reflects the receipt of a $1,500,000 income tax refund.  Cash in the amount of
$1,095,000 was provided by investing activities, representing a decrease in
investments needed to finance capital expenditures of $1,490,000 and increases
in inventories and receivables.  Cash in the amount of $7,487,000 was generated
by investing activities in fiscal year 1994, including $17,600,000 of cash
generated from the sale of the Restaurant Division, which was partially offset
by cash expenditures totaling $3,117,000 for property additions for both
continuing and discontinuing operations.  Fiscal year 1995's investments in
capital projects included, approximately $400,000 to complete construction of
the Norway plant, $250,000 for a new packaging line at the Alexandria, Virginia
facility and approximately $450,000 for other equipment at Alexandria.  Fiscal
year 1996 equipment costs of approximately $900,000 are expected for the
Alexandria facility with less than $100,000 expected for the Norway facility.
Cash in the amount of $1,344,000 was generated by financing activities,
representing the debt acquired by the Norway subsidiary, offset by $890,000 in
repayments.  Cash in the amount of $448,000 was generated through the exercise
of stock options during fiscal year 1994, while no financing activities took
place during fiscal year 1993.

        The Company continues to evaluate the possibility of establishing
additional production facilities in order to increase efficiencies.  One such
way would be to produce sous vide products closer to the source of supply and
as a means to enter new markets.  The cost of such facilities ranges  from
approximately $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, depending upon the nature of the
product and the production volume desired.  Local governments may provide
subsidies and other assistance in connection with such facilities.  It is
possible that the Company may use some of its cash resources to fund these
efforts.

        The Company's Norwegian subsidiary  has secured a working capital
commitment for its liquidity needs in Norway in the form of an overdraft
facility.  As of June 24, 1995, $603,000 was outstanding under this overdraft
facility.  Subsequent to year-end, the subsidiary reduced its overdraft
facility balance, and can borrow up to $600,000 under this commitment.

        The Company has on deposit $4.9 million with a European bank.  This
deposit is denominated in U.S. dollars and earns a rate of return in excess of
the prevailing short-term rates in the United States.  This deposit has been
pledged as collateral to the bank so that the bank may loan funds to a French
subsidiary of Setucaf S.A., a French company which is 21% owned by Food
Research Corporation, the majority stockholder of the Company.  This deposit is
redeemable on thirty days notice without penalty.  The Company believes no
material risk to principal is associated with this deposit.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

In fiscal 1996 the Company intends to build upon the broader sales base
established in fiscal 1995.  While modest growth is expected in sales to the
hotel industry, the Company believes  that double-digit sales growth is
possible within the airline industry, and anticipates substantial sales gains
in the health care and retail segments.  The Company will continue to explore
and develop its emerging markets and formats that show promise of generating
significant sous vide sales.  Although the course of the European business is
difficult to forecast, it is management's expectation that its Norwegian
operations will reduce its losses substantially in fiscal 1996.  If so, the
Company will move towards, and may attain, overall operating profitability
during the coming year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Vie de France Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under items 14(a)(1) and (2) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Vie de France Corporation and its
subsidiaries at June 24, 1995 and June 25, 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 24, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

     The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Vie de
France Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively "the Company").  All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the financial
statements.


Fiscal Year

     The Company utilizes a 52/53 week fiscal year which ends on the last
Saturday in June.  Fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993 contained 52 weeks.


Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped to
customers.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.


Investments

     Effective June 25, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities," which expands the use of fair value accounting
for those securities, but retains the use of the amortized cost method for
investments in debt securities which management has the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity.  The Company has segregated its investments into
the following two categories:

     Held-to-Maturity

     Securities held-to-maturity, for which management has both the ability and
     intent to hold to maturity, are carried at amortized cost.

     Available for Sale

     Securities available for sale include securities which could be sold in
     response to changes in interest rates or general liquidity needs.  Such
     securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
     recorded as a separate component of equity.

Fixed Assets

     Machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives which range from two to eight
years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method
over the terms of the leases which range from four to twenty years.

     Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and
renewals and improvements are capitalized.  For continuing operations,
maintenance and repairs charged to expense amounted to $373,000 in 1995,
$313,000 in 1994 and $172,000 in 1993.

     The components of fixed assets were as follows:

Income Taxes

     The Company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for
financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes.  Deferred
income taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences.

     As of the beginning of fiscal year 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income
Taxes".   The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 was insignificant as of
June 27, 1993 since the resulting deferred tax asset was fully offset by a
valuation allowance.

Earnings Per Share

     Net income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares of stock and dilutive stock outstanding during each period.

Foreign Currency Translation

     The statement of operations of the Company's Norwegian subsidiary (the
"Subsidiary") has been translated to U.S. dollars using the average currency
exchange rates in effect during the year.  The Subsidiary's balance sheet has
been translated using the currency exchange rate as of the end of the fiscal
year.  The impact of currency exchange rate changes on the translation of the
Subsidiary's balance sheet has been charged directly to stockholders' equity.

at June 24, 1995 are fully offset by a valuation allowance of approximately
$602,000 due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate realizability of the
assets.

NOTE 4 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1995, the Company
reduced its reserves related to the sale of the former Restaurant Division.
This reduction was possible due to the expiration of certain contingent
liabilities.

     In March 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the sale of
substantially all of the net assets of the Restaurant Division pursuant to an
asset purchase agreement entered into with Vie de France Bakery Yamazaki, Inc.,
a subsidiary of Yamazaki Baking Company, Ltd., a Japanese company.  Effective
May 25, 1994, the Company completed the sale for approximately $20.4 million in
cash, which resulted in a gain of approximately $9.2 million, net of income
taxes of $4.4 million.  The gain on sale of discontinued operations is stated
net of operating pre-tax losses from March 4, 1994 to the sale date of May 25,
1994 of approximately $469,000.

     Operating results of the Restaurant Division for fiscal year 1994 up to
the measurement date of March 4, 1994 consisted of a pre-tax loss of
approximately $1,250,000 which is reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations under the caption "(Loss) income from discontinued operations."
Also reported under the caption "(Loss) income from discontinued operations"
are $250,000 in additional expenses associated with a claim made in 1994 by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  relating to an ammonia leak at one of the
Company's former bakery locations which was reported as a discontinued
operation in 1991.

     Borrowings under the Den norske Bank ("DnB") Overdraft Facility are
limited to a percentage of the Subsidiary's inventories and receivables, up to
a maximum of $1,000,000 with a floating interest rate equal to the prevailing
Norwegian overnight funds rate plus two percentage points.

     The term loan from DnB has a stated interest rate of 7.25% and will be
repaid through ten semi-annual payments of principal and interest beginning
August 30, 1995 and ending February 28, 2000.  As part of the terms for this
loan, the Company has guaranteed the repurchase of certain assets of the
Subsidiary in the amount of $426,000.

     Statens Narings-OgDistriktutvikiingsfond ("SND"), a governmental
development agency in Norway, issued to the Subsidiary an eight-year term loan
whose terms require the establishment of a working plant facility.  The loan
has a variable interest rate which at June 24, 1995 was 10.0%, and will be
repaid through  sixteen semi-annual payments of principal and interest
beginning August 1, 1996 and ending February 1, 2004.

     The Subsidiary entered into a twenty-year capital lease obligation with an
initial principal amount of  $1,691,000 and with quarterly payments of $49,000.
At the end of the lease term, ownership of the facility will revert to the
Subsidiary.  The Company has issued no guarantees with respect to this lease.

     During fiscal year 1995, the Subsidiary was not in compliance with certain
of the covenants set forth by DnB.  Subsequent to year-end, DnB agreed to
temporarily waive such covenants in exchange for certain guarantees on the part
of the Company.  These included a guaranty in the form of a renewable six-month
stand-by letter of credit issued by the Company in the amount of $600,000,
along with the subordination of a $300,000 loan from the Company to the
Subsidiary.  Accordingly, DnB has agreed to maintain the overdraft facility and
waive its covenant requirements for as long as the stand-by letter of credit is
in effect, but has limited borrowings up to the amount of the guaranty of
$600,000.

     Maturities for the renewable overdraft facility  the two term loans and
for the capital lease during the next five fiscal years on an aggregate basis
at June 24, 1995 were as follows:  1996 - $734,000; 1997 - $154,000; 1998 -
$158,000; 1999 - $162,000; 2000 - $166,000.  The maturities for 1996 of
$734,000 include $603,000 borrowed under the overdraft facility, which the
company intends to renew rather than repay upon maturity.

     No borrowings were outstanding at June 25, 1994.

NOTE 6 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     The Company's capital stock is divided into two classes:  Common Stock and
Class B Stock.  The Class B Stock, which is reserved for issuance to employees
under stock option plans, is identical in all respects to the Common Stock
except that the holders thereof have no voting rights unless otherwise required
by law.

     No dividends were paid during fiscal years 1995, 1994 or 1993.

NOTE 7 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     The Company sponsors a qualified employee savings plan under which
employees who meet certain minimum age and service requirements are eligible to
participate.  The Company matches one-third of the first 6% of eligible
employees' voluntary contributions to the plan.  The Company expensed, as a
component of continuing operations, $11,000, $16,000 and $15,000 in fiscal
years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, for contributions to the savings and
profit sharing plan.

     In fiscal year 1994, the Company implemented a non-qualified employee
savings plan under which senior management employees are eligible to
participate.  The Company matches one-third of the first 6% of eligible
employees' voluntary contributions to the plan.  The Company's matching
contribution is limited to 6% of the combined contributions into both the
qualified and the non-qualified plan.  The Company expensed, as a component of
continuing operations, $14,000 in both fiscal years 1995 and 1994 for this
plan.

     During fiscal year 1993, the Company established, upon stockholder
approval, the 1992 Stock Option Plan which provides for up to 300,000 shares of
the Company's Common Stock to be made available to employees at various prices
as established by the Board of Directors at the date of grant.  Upon the
adoption of the 1992 Stock Option Plan, two previous plans, the 1986 Stock
Option Plan and the 1982 Stock Option Plan, were terminated except with respect
to 373,000 options issued and outstanding under these plans.  During fiscal
year 1995, the Company granted 77,000 options under the 1992 Stock Option Plan.
The outstanding options expire through fiscal year 2005.

                       FOURTH ADDENDUM TO DEEDS OF LEASE


         This Fourth Addendum to Deeds of Lease is made as of this 30 day
of January, 1995, by and between Duke-Shirley Industrial Development
("Landlord") and Vie de France Corporation ("Tenant").

                                  WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, as of this date Tenant is a party to leases with the Landlord
for the premises known as 4100, and 4102 through 4108, and 4112 Wheeler Avenue,
Alexandria, Virginia, ("Leases"); and

         WHEREAS, by Addendum to Deeds of Lease dated March 26, 1990, by Second
Addendum to Deeds of Lease dated July 14, 1992, and by Third Addendum to Deeds
of Lease dated September 29, 1993 collectively ("Addenda"), the Landlord and
Tenant amended the Leases; and

         WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant agree to lease additional space to Tenant
known as 4110 Wheeler Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia ("4110 Premises") and to
modify the prior Addenda upon the terms and conditions set forth hereinafter.

         NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the recitals above and the rents,
covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Landlord and Tenant agree
as follows:

         1.      Tenant shall lease the 4110 Premises, approximately 6,000
square feet, more or less, of rentable warehouse space, to be delivered in "as
is" condition and



                                      1
<PAGE>   2
without any warranty except as specifically set forth herein.  This premises
shall be in addition to the premises already defined in the Leases and Addenda.

         2.      Tenant hereby leases the 4110 Premises for a term commencing
January 16, 1995 until April 30, 1999, which term may be extended as provided
in the Addenda.

         3.      The rent payable on the first day of each calendar month for
the 4110 Premises shall be $3,228.00 per month as base rent ("Base Rent"), plus
Tenant's proportionate share of common area maintenance ("CAM") and real estate
taxes.  CAM expenses are assessed for this and all other leased premises at
$.20 per square foot and are adjustable as hereinafter provided.  This new rate
is effective as of January 1, 1995.

         4.      The Base Rent shall hereafter be increased by the greater of
either (i) 3 1/2% of the previous calendar year's Base Rent, or (ii) the
percentage increase of the consumer price index for all urban consumers
("CPI-U") over the previous 12-month period, pursuant to the formula more fully
defined in the Leases and Addenda.  The first increase shall be on January 1,
1996, calculated on the starting monthly base rent of $3,228.00.

         5.      In consideration of this addendum to lease the 4110 Premises,
Landlord agrees that Tenant shall not be required to pay Base Rent for the
first 90 days from the commencement date of this lease.  However, should Tenant
default or cancel this addendum or any of the other Leases or Addenda within
the first six months of the 





                                       2
<PAGE>   3
term of this Fourth Addendum to lease the 4110 Premises, then the abated Base 
Rent shall come due in full as part of the damages due Landlord for such breach.

         6.      Landlord may maintain, in its sole discretion, policies of
insurance and for such amounts covering loss or damage from all perils included
within the classifications of fire, extended coverage, vandalism, malicious
mischief, special extended perils (all risk), and any other perils, and rental
income insurance policy with loss payable to Landlord in an amount equal to the
sum of one year's base rent, estimated real property taxes, and insurance
premiums.  Tenant shall not knowingly do or permit to be done anything which
invalidates any such insurance policies.  Tenant shall comply with all other
insurance requirements as specified within the Leases and Addenda.

         7.      Landlord will provide prompt repair and maintenance services
to the common areas of the industrial development.  Trash and debris will be
removed from the common areas, and security patrols will be established for 40
hours each week during nonworking hours.  Tenant shall contribute to the
repair, maintenance, and security costs for the common areas by the payment of
CAM charges on the first day of each month, as required paragraph 3 above.
Tenant shall also pay monthly any CAM increases at its proportionate share:
60/3577.

         8.      Real estate taxes, both general and special, becoming due upon
the 4110 Premises shall be borne by Tenant and shallbe paid as additional rent.
The 4110 Premises constitutes 11.11 percent of the tax parcel.  So payment of
taxes by Tenant shall equal 11.11 percent of the parcel's total tax bill.
Taxes are payable 





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
semi-annually and Tenant shall pay its share of such taxes within ten (10) days
after notice from Landlord.

         9.      Landlord's duty to maintain the roof of 4110 Premises, as
provided in paragraph 4.02 of the Lease, hereby shifts to the Tenant.  Tenant
shall be fully responsible for prompt repairs to or replacement of the roof for
any roof leak or damage developing thereto during the term or extension hereof.
Furthermore, Tenant and Landlord hereby modify the Addendum leasing the 4112
Premises, so that it, too, shall be a roof responsibility of Tenant.  In
consideration, Tenant has hereby elected and instructed Landlord to contract
with R.D. Bean, Inc. ("Bean's"), roofing contractor, to begin reroofing the
roof area covering 4100-4112 Wheeler Ave., representing all of Tenant's demised
premises pursuant to the Lease and these Addenda in accordance with Bean's
attached contract.  Tenant agrees to first raise the six pieces of roof-based
air-handling equipment at 4100-4104 premises, at Tenant's cost, which is a
prerequisite to Bean's roofing work.  If this is not timely done to permit
Bean's schedule of roof work from 2/15/95 - 3/95, then Tenant will be solely
responsible to Bean for any delay-increases in Bean's work.  Otherwise, upon
receipt of Bean's final invoice (with ten-year warranty addressed to both
Tenant and Landlord), Tenant will immediately reimburse Landlord $28,000, which
the parties agree is Tenant's share for the roof work and was determined after
reference to the Addenda for cost-sharing of this new roof installation.
Should Tenant choose to install the Dynaflex walkways referenced in Bean's
contract, this will be at Tenant's expense.  Any other cost





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
overruns shall be pro-rated for Tenant's leased premises and shared by Tenant
by 25% thereof.

         10.     Tenant acknowledges that the 4110 Premises has floor-tile in
part of the premises which may contain asbestos.  Tenant may remove this
floor-tile, but shall  hold Landlord harmless for any liability concerning this
floor-tile or the asbestos therein.  Likewise, Landlord acknowledges that there
may be asbestos-containing construction material in other interior parts of the
premises, and Landlord shall hold Tenant harmless from any liability related
thereto.  Tenant acknowledges Landlord makes no further warranty concerning the
existence of or liability for any other environmental or hazardous material,
including but not limited to the nuclear gauge equipment warehoused at the
premises by the prior tenant, Ambric Testing.  Tenant has reviewed the 1/12/95
letter from Ambric Testing which included test results confirming such
equipment detected below 0.005 microcuries.

         11.     This Fourth Addendum to Deeds of Lease amends and is made part
of the Leases and Addenda.  Except as amended hereby, all terms, covenants,
provisions and conditions of the Leases and Addenda shall apply to the 4110
Premises and shall remain in full force and effect during the current or
extended terms of said Leases and Addenda.  The Leases and Addenda are hereby
ratified and reaffirmed as if fully set forth herein.  Any breach of this
addendum shall be deemed a breach of the Leases and Addenda, and vice versa.

         12.     Tenant shall have the right once per year to review, upon 10
business days written notice, all CAM charges for the leased premises.  No
documents may be





                                       5

Whereas, at the inception of such work the Contractor agreed to guarantee the
aforesaid roof against faulty materials or workmanship for a limited period and
subject to the conditions herein set forth:

Now, Therefore the Contractor hereby agrees, subject to the conditions herein   
set forth, that during a period __________ from the date of completion of said
roof, it will, at its own cost and expense, make or cause to be made such
repairs to said roof and composition flashing resulting solely from faults or
defects in materials or workmanship applied by or through the Contractor but
not to exceed the Owner's original cost of the installed roof over the life of
this warranty.

This guarantee is made subject to the following conditions:

1. Specifically excluded from this guarantee is any and all damage to said
roof, the building or contents caused by the acts or omissions of other trades
or contractors; lightning, windstorm, hailstorm, or other unusual phenomena of
the elements; foundation settlement; failure or cracking of the roof deck;
defects or failure or material used as a roofbase over which the roof is
applied; faulty construction or parapet walls, copings, chimneys, skylights,
vents, supports, or other parts of the building; vapor condensation beneath the
roof; penetrations for pitch boxes; or fire.  If the roof is damaged by reason
of any of the foregoing this guarantee shall thereupon become null and void for
the balance of the guarantee period unless such damage is repaired by the
Contractor at the expense of the party requesting such repairs.

2. The Contractor is not liable for consequential damages to the building or
contents resulting from any defects in said roof or composition flashing.

3. No work shall be done on said roof, including, but without limitation, work
in connection with flues, vents, drains, sign braces, railings, platforms or
other equipment fastened or to set on the roof, and no repairs or alterations
shall be made to said roof, unless the Contractor shall be first notified,
shall be given the opportunity to make the necessary roofing application
recommendations with respect thereto, and such recommendations are complied
with.  Failure to observe this condition shall render this guarantee null and
void.  The Contractor shall be paid for time and material expended in making
recommendations or repairs occasioned by the work of others on said roof.

4. This guarantee shall become null and void if the roof is used as a promenade
or work deck is or sprayed or flooded, unless such use was originally specified
and the specification is noted in paragraph 8 below.

5. This guarantee shall not be or become effective unless and until the
Contractor has been paid in full for said roof in accordance with the agreement
pursuant to which such roof was applied.

6. This guarantee shall become null and void unless the Contractor is promptly
notified of any alleged defect in materials or workmanship and provided an
opportunity to inspect the roof.

7. This guarantee is in lieu of all other guarantees or warranties, express or
implied.  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE
DESCRIPTION ON THE FACE HEREOF.

Dear Mr. Esenstad:

         This letter will confirm that Duke-Shirley Industrial Park, as
 Landlord ("Landlord"), and Vie de France Corp., as Tenant ("Tenant"), have
entered into that certain agreement entitled Fifth Addendum to Deeds of Lease
(the "Fifth Addendum") dated today, April 6, 1995, pertaining to 4303 Wheeler
Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia (the "4303 Premises").

         This letter is to memorialize the side agreement between Landlord and
Tenant as to the Fifth Addendum and the 4303 Premises regarding such personal
property that may remain on or within the 4303 Premises upon and after the
commencement of the term of the Fifth Addendum, having been left or abandoned
by tenant(s) or other parties having possession of the 4303 Premises prior to
Tenant.  In consideration of the covenants and conditions set forth herein and
in the Fifth Addendum, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that Landlord will
rebate to Tenant a portion of the Base Rent in the amount of $25.00 for each
day such personal property remains on or within the 4303 Premises.  This rebate
shall be made in one lump sum payment after said personal property has been
removed.  Landlord agrees to use its best efforts to have said personal
property removed as soon as is practicable and as allowed by law.

         Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Fifth
Addendum, and/or the Leases and Addenda described in the Fifth Addendum, in the
event Landlord is unable to deliver to Tenant possession to the 4303 Premises
within fourteen (14) days after April 11, 1995, the Fifth Addendum shall be
null and void.

this 7 day of April, 1995, by and between Duke-Shirley Industrial Development
("Landlord") and Vie de France Corporation ("Tenant").

                                  WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, as of this date Tenant is a party with Landlord to leases
dated March 30, 1989 and August 1, 1989 (the "Leases") and addenda thereto for
the premises known as 4100, and 4102 through 4108, 4110, and 4112 Wheeler

         WHEREAS, by Addendum dated March 26, 1990, by Second Addendum dated
July 14, 1992, by Third Addendum dated September 29, 1993, and by Fourth
Addendum dated January 30, 1995 (collectively, the "Addenda"), Landlord and
Tenant amended the Leases; and

         WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant agree to lease additional space to Tenant
known as 4303 Wheeler Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia (the "4303 Premises") and
to modify the Leases and Addenda upon the terms and conditions set forth
hereinafter.

         NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the recitals above and the rents,
covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, Landlord and Tenant agree as
follows:



                                      1
<PAGE>   15
         1.      Tenant shall lease the 4303 Premises, approximately 6,000
square feet, more or less, of rentable warehouse space, to be delivered in "as
is" condition and without any warranty except as specifically set forth herein,
including such equipment, fixtures and furnishings determined to be the
property of Landlord.  The 4303 Premises includes that certain walk-in freezer
situated within the 4303 Premises of approximately fifty (50) feet by
twenty-six and one-half (26 and 1/2) feet in size, and all compressors and
other equipment and devices relating thereto, which Tenant is taking "as is"
with no warranties or representations of any kind.  The 4303 Premises shall be
in addition to the premises already defined in the Leases and Addenda.

         2.      Tenant hereby leases the 4303 Premises for a term commencing
April 11, 1995 until March 31, 1996.

         3.      The rent payable for the 4303 Premises shall be $4,700.00 per
month  as base rent ("Base Rent"), plus Tenant's proportionate share of
Landlord's  common area maintenance ("CAM") costs and insurance costs for the
Industrial Development, and shall be due and payable on the first day of each
calendar month during the term of this Fifth Addendum and any extension;
provided, however, that the rent (eg: Base Rent, CAM charges, insurance costs,
etc.) payable for the period of April 11 through April 30, 1995 shall be
two-thirds (2/3) of the regular monthly amounts due, and shall be due on or
before April 11, 1995.

         4.      Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as additional rent the sum of
Nine Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($900) per annum payable in advance without
deduction, set-off, or demand in equal monthly installments of Seventy-Five and





                                       2
<PAGE>   16
No/100 Dollars ($75) each on or before the first day of each calendar month
payable with all other sums due and payable hereunder on or before the first
day of each month, as required in paragraph 3 above, as a reimbursement to
Landlord for Tenant's proportionate share of insurance costs as to the
Industrial Development; provided, however, that the installment payable for the
period of April 11 through April 30, 1995 shall be $49.50, and shall be due on
or before April 11, 1995.  Landlord shall accordingly maintain policies of
insurance covering loss of or damage to the 4303 Premises in the full amount of
its replacement value.  Such policies shall provide protection against such
perils which Landlord deems necessary.  Landlord may also maintain a rental
income insurance policy.  Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of any
increase in the premiums of such policies which Landlord may be carrying.
Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything which invalidates any such
insurance policies which Landlord may be carrying.

         Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense, maintain such primary or additional
insurance on its fixtures, equipment, and building improvements as Tenant deems
necessary to protect its interest.  Tenant shall comply with all other
insurance requirements as specified in the Leases, the Addenda, and this Fifth
Addendum.

         5.      Landlord will provide prompt repair and maintenance services
to the common areas of the Industrial Development.  Trash and debris will be
removed from the common areas, and security patrols will be established for 40

replacements on the roof during said ten-year warranty period in order for the
warranty to remain in full force and effect.

Premises, Tenant shall be responsible for all maintenance and repairs and/or

maintenance contract with a licensed professional refrigeration company
acceptable to Landlord for the term of this Fifth Addendum and any extensions.

         9.      Tenant shall have the right once per year to review, upon 10

whatsoever shall conclusively be deemed a waiver of such renewal option.

                 c.       Tenant shall take the 4303 Premises "as is" for the
Renewal Term and Landlord shall have no obligation to make any improvements or
alterations to the 4303 Premises.

<PAGE>   20
Rent, or (ii) the percentage increase of the consumer price index for all urban
consumers ("CPI-U") over the previous 12-month period, pursuant to the formula
more fully defined in the Leases and Addenda.  The first increase shall be on
April 1, 1996, calculated on a stipulated annual Base Rent for the original
term of this Fifth Addendum in the amount of $56,400.00.  Each successive
increase during the Renewal Term shall be on the first day of April of each
successive year.

                 e.       Tenant's rights to exercise the option to renew the
original term under this Fifth Addendum shall be personal to Tenant and shall
not inure to the benefit of any assignee, in fact or in law, or any other
occupant of the 4303 Premises.

                 f.       Except as set forth herein, the leasing of the 4303
Premises for the Renewal Term shall be upon the same terms and conditions as

and subject to all of the provisions of this Fifth Addendum, including, without
limitation, the obligation of Tenant to pay all CAM charges, insurance costs,

of the Leases and Addenda.  Except as amended hereby, all terms, covenants,
provisions and conditions of the Leases and Addenda shall apply to the 4303

from 1 September 1994 to 31 August 2014.

Vie de France Norway A/S may terminate the contract by giving six months'
notice in the event of a force majeure situation, for example if the market
situation changes for instance due to boycott actions against Norwegian
products or lack of raw materials.  Such a situation must persist for minimum
three months.  Should such a situation arise and Vie de France Norway A/S
therefore terminates the contract, the company shall be obligated to pay the
outstanding rent for a period of three years from the date of signature of this
contract.  The rent shall not be changed for the remaining part of such period.

3.  RENTAL AND ADJUSTMENT THEREOF


From 1 September 1994 the rental is payable in the amount of NOK 308,000 per
quarter.  The rental is payable in advance on 1 September, 1 December, 1 March
and 1 June every year.  Penalty interest of 12 per cent per annum shall accrue
for any late payment.

The rental is the sum of interest and instalments on the lessor's loan in
respect of the building, insurance, and the costs of the lessor's maintenance
obligation.

             The interest rate is fixed at 0.2 per cent above the nominal
interest rate on the above-mentioned loan.  Interest and instalments are
calculated as an annuity with 80 instalments over 20 years each of NOK
11,500,000.

             The insurance of the buildings and does not included liability in
respect of production losses.

The basis is the stipulated annual costs, with a step-wise increment as the
building gets older.

Either party hereto can demand that the rental be adjusted once a year in
accordance with the actual changes in the above three cost factors.

If Hjelmeland municipality enters into a new agreement concerning the above
mentioned loan, the Vie de France Norway A/S shall be given an opportunity to
make its position clear.  If a new agreement is signed then in principle it
will be based on the most favourable offer.

The rental does not include expenses such as electricity and municipal rates
for water, sewage and refuse collection.

4.  TAKE-OVER

The property is taken over by the lessee from 1 September 1994 and is leased in
the condition it is in upon signature of this contract unless otherwise agreed

Norway A/S accepts that the production equipment shall remain intact on the
production premises for a period of one year after vacating the premises.

Our ref.:  brvdfntj.lls                      Sandnes, Nov. 18., 1993

Dear Sirs,

RE:  OUR OFFER LETTER DATED OCTOBER 18, 1993 FOR CREDIT FACILITIES - AMENDMENTS

We refer to our above mentioned letter and to your request for amendments of
terms and conditions in said letter.  We are pleased to offer you the following
amendments:

1.  Term Loan availability

The Term Loan is made available for drawdown when the planned production
machinery at the production plant in Hjelmeland has been installed and
production of sous vide salmon at the plant has started, provided that other
terms and conditions for the facilities have been complied with.

2.  Extension of the Bridge Loan Facility

The Bridge Loan Facility is extended from May 31, 1994 to September 30, 1994
due to change in equipment requirements and later date of upstart of production
than previously expected.

3. Negative covenant regarding guarantee from parent company for buy back of
   machinery.

Last line in last paragraph on page 5, regarding guarantee of 55 % cost price,
is amended to read:  "with an estimated cost price of USD 775,000".
<PAGE>   9
4. Negative covenant regarding equity/subordinated loan utilization.

The condition in paragraph 13 under negative covenants, page 6, 1st sentence is
changed to read: " Borrower's equity/subordinated loan capital has to be fully
paid in, and minimum 90 % of the paid in equity/subordinated loan has to be
utilized, before the Bridge Loan Facility is made available for drawings."

5. Commitment fee for Overdraft Facility and Bridge Loan Facility

The fees begin to accrue as of the actual signing date of the loan agreements.

We hope the above amendments are satisfactory to you


Yours sincerely
for Den norske bank AS
