Item 1.   BUSINESS.

General

     WLR  Foods,  Inc.  (WLR  Foods)  is  a  fully-integrated  poultry
processing company involved in  the production, further processing and
marketing  of turkey  and chicken  products,  and the  distribution of
poultry  and meat  products.   In addition,  WLR manufactures  ice for
retail  distribution   and  is  a  provider   of  public  refrigerated
warehousing services.

     WLR  Foods  markets more  than 250  branded,  as well  as private
label,  commodity  and value-added  poultry  and  related products  to
selected retail, food service  and institutional markets, primarily in
the mid-Atlantic, northeastern, and southeastern regions of the United
States and, to a lesser extent, the upper Midwest and California.  WLR
Foods  exports to  more than  40 countries,  with  particular customer
strength in the  Far East,  the Caribbean and  United States  military
installations.
 
     WLR Foods  is a combination  of three poultry  companies, Wampler
Foods, Inc., Horace W. Longacre, Inc. and Rockingham Poultry Marketing
Cooperative  Incorporated,  all of  which  trace  their beginnings  to
before 1945.   The three companies  combined in 1985 and  1988, and in
1992 were joined by Round  Hill Foods, Inc. and its  affiliates (Round
Hill) of  New Oxford,  Pennsylvania.   Previously, WLR Foods'  poultry
operations  were  conducted  through  two  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,
Wampler-Longacre  Chicken,  Inc.  and  Wampler-Longacre  Turkey,  Inc.
These subsidiaries,  along with Round Hill, were  merged on January 1,
1994  to   form  one  subsidiary,  Wampler-Longacre,   Inc.  (Wampler-
Longacre).  WLR Foods  expanded its operations into North  Carolina in
September  1994  with the  acquisition of  Cuddy Farms,  Inc.-USA Food
Division  of Marshville,  North  Carolina and  its turkey  processing,
further processing,  feedmill and distribution facilities.   The Cuddy
acquisition also provided  WLR Foods with  an additional cold  storage
facility.

     In April 1990, the Company expanded into the cold storage and ice
manufacturing and distribution business with the acquisition of Cassco
Ice & Cold Storage, Inc. (Cassco).    In 1992, WLR Foods  acquired all
the  Virginia ice  business assets  of Southern  Ice Company,  Inc., a
Norfolk-based ice manufacturing and distribution company, and in 1993,
the   Company  acquired  the  assets  of  two  ice  manufacturing  and
distribution companies  located in  the greater Washington,  D.C. area
and  in Richmond,  Virginia.   WLR Foods  acquired an  additional cold
storage facility as part of the Cuddy acquisition.
 
     The  Company also  owns  65%  of  May  Supply  Company,  Inc.,  a
wholesale distributor of plumbing supplies and equipment.  

<PAGE>
Poultry Production

     WLR  Foods   controls  the   breeding,  hatching,   grow-out  and
processing of  its turkeys and chickens.   For fiscal 1995,  WLR Foods
produced  approximately 574 million  pounds of dressed  turkey and 545
million pounds of dressed chicken.

     WLR Foods  purchases breeder stock  turkey eggs which  it hatches 
and  places with  growers  who supply  labor  and housing  to  produce
breeder flocks.  These  breeder flocks produce eggs that are  taken to
the  company-owned turkey  hatchery for  incubation and  hatching into
poults,  providing approximately  50% of  the Company's  poult supply.
The  balance of  the  Company's  poults  are  purchased  from  outside
sources.  In its chicken operations, WLR Foods purchases breeder flock
chicks and  places them with growers  who supply labor and  housing to
raise the birds.  The birds are then moved to breeder farms where they
begin providing eggs,  which are in turn transported  to company-owned
hatcheries.  Once hatched, day-old poults and chicks are inspected and
vaccinated  against common  poultry  diseases.   In  total, WLR  Foods
contracts with 149 breeder growers who grow most of WLR Foods' turkey,
and all of WLR Foods' chicken, breeder flocks.

     After hatching and vaccination, poults and chicks are transported
to one of  WLR Foods'  approximately 820 contract  growers located  in
Virginia,  West Virginia, Pennsylvania,  Maryland, North  Carolina and
South Carolina who  supply labor and housing to raise  the turkeys and
chickens to maturity.  WLR Foods supplies feed primarily from company-
owned  feed  mills and  provides  grower  support through  WLR  Foods'
technicians and veterinarians.

     Grow-out  and breeder farms provide  WLR Foods with  more than 54
million  square feet of growing facilities.  These farms typically are
grower-owned  and operate  under  contract with  WLR Foods,  providing
facilities, utilities and labor.  Contract growers are  compensated on
a   cost-based   formula   and   several   incentive-based   formulas.
Approximately  90% of WLR Foods' turkeys and  100% of its chickens are
raised  by contract  growers, with  the balance  grown by  independent
growers and company-owned farms.   WLR Foods strives to  maintain good
contract  grower  relationships  and  believes  the   availability  of
contract growers is sufficient for anticipated needs.

     An important  factor in the  grow-out of  poultry is the  rate at
which poultry converts feed  into body weight.  The  Company purchases
its  primary feed ingredients on  the open market.   These ingredients
consist primarily of corn and soybean meal and represent approximately
65%  of  WLR  Foods'  total cost  to  grow  turkeys  and chickens  and
approximately 32% of its cost  of sales for fiscal 1995.   Because the
quality and composition  of feed  is critical to  the feed  conversion
rate, WLR Foods formulates and produces  a majority of its own feed at
one  of   its  four  feed  mills.    WLR  Foods  has  an  annual  feed
manufacturing capacity  in excess of 1.8 million  tons and anticipates
no  difficulty  in meeting  the Company's  feed   requirements  in the
future.

     Once the turkeys  and chickens reach processing  weight, they are
transported  in  WLR  Foods'  trucks  to  one  of  its  seven  poultry
processing  plants.   These  plants utilize  modern, highly  automated
equipment to process and  package the turkeys and chickens for sale or
preparation for 
                                       2
<PAGE>
further processing.   WLR Foods further processes bulk
poultry  in  its processing  plants  and in  three  additional further
processing  plants by adding value beyond  deboning and skinning, such
as  slicing,  grinding, marinating,  spicing  and  cooking to  produce
delicatessen products,  frankfurters, meat  salads, ground  turkey and
chicken, and food service products.

Distribution, Public Refrigerated Warehousing, Ice and Other

     WLR  Foods'  distribution  business,  with  its  warehousing  and
transportation equipment, includes fresh poultry, beef, and other meat
products  purchased from  third parties  for resale, and  is conducted
within  a radius  of  approximately 75  miles  of WLR  Foods'  further
processing  facility  in Franconia,  Pennsylvania.    In fiscal  1995,
Cassco  sold 23  million  eight-pound equivalent  bags of  retail ice,
making it one  of the  largest ice manufacturers  in the  mid-Atlantic
region.   In addition, Cassco operates  public refrigerated warehouses
at five locations.   WLR Foods' protein conversion plants  convert the
nonedible  by-products  of its  poultry  processing  plants into  feed
ingredients, with the balance sold to pet food manufacturers.

     The  following table  sets  out sales  revenues  from WLR  Foods'
products for the last three fiscal years.

Competition 

     Poultry  production requires  continuous growing  and processing,
with limited storage, making  the poultry industry highly competitive.
WLR  Foods markets its products in competition with larger and smaller
poultry companies on the basis of price, quality and service, with WLR
Foods'  greatest competition coming from four or five of the country's
larger  poultry producers  and  processors.   The  pricing of  poultry
products  is so competitive that any  company with a cost advantage is
in a favorable competitive position.  Seasonal increases in production
and  customer buying  patterns  contribute to  fluctuations in  prices
which  are  controlled  more by  supply  and  demand than  by  cost of
production.   WLR Foods primarily  markets its products  in the highly
competitive  northeastern, mid-Atlantic  and southeastern  sections of
the United States.  

     In June 1995 WLR Foods was ranked as the tenth largest in poultry
processing/further  processing according to  Meat &  Poultry Magazine.
WLR Foods was the second largest American turkey producer according to
Turkey  World magazine's December 1994 issue.   WLR 
                                       
                                       3

<PAGE>

Foods was cited as the sixteenth largest chicken  producer in the December 
1994  issue of Broiler Industry magazine. 

Seasonality 

     In  general,  WLR  Foods  consistently  produces  and  sells  its
products throughout the year.   Highest demand for poultry  is in May,
June,  July,  November and  December.   The  early summer  months have
strong demand for chicken and  further processed products and November
and December are high demand months for  turkey products.  The highest
demand for ice is during the period from mid-May to mid-September.  

Trademarks and Patents

     Wampler-Longacre  markets  its  products  under   the  trademarks
WAMPLER  LONGACRE and design, TRIM  FREE and chicken  in heart design,
MOUNTAIN  MAID, SALADFEST, TENDERLINGS and TURKEY WITH A TWIST, all of
which  are federally  registered  trademarks.   Wampler-Longacre  also
markets under the trademarks  CHEF'S QUALITY and CHEF'S  SELECT, which
have pending federal applications.  Following the acquisition of Cuddy
Foods, Wampler-Longacre  obtained the  right to market  products under
the CUDDY FAMILY  FARMS, COLONY  FARMS, FARMERS CHOICE,  TOP ROUND  OF
TURKEY, and DELI ROAST COLLECTION marks.  Wampler-Longacre markets its
export and foreign military sales under the  COLONEL ROCKINGHAM design
and ROCKINGHAM trademarks.   Products are also sold under  the GENUINE
SHENVALLEY VIRGINIA POULTRY mark. 

     Cassco distributes  its products  under the federally  registered
trademark CASSCO.  

     Wampler-Longacre holds a patent for pasteurized salads.  

Government Contracts

     WLR  Foods' government contracts are a small segment of its total
sales,  consisting of  bids  on particular  products  for delivery  at
specified  locations.  Contracts are generally bid, and the product is
delivered, within a one- to two-month period.  These contracts include
both chicken  and turkey  products and can  involve further  processed
products.  WLR Foods  had approximately  $0.9 million  of governmental
contracts outstanding as of July 1, 1995, the same as at July 2, 1994.

Foreign Sales 

     WLR  Foods' foreign  sales  constituted approximately  8% of  its
total annual sales in fiscal 1995, compared to 7% for fiscal year 1994
and 6% for fiscal year 1993.  Wampler-Longacre has a full-time staffed
foreign sales office which coordinates foreign sales efforts on behalf
of WLR  Foods.   Foreign  sales  originate from  that  office and  use
independent brokers as needed.  Sales are made in over 40 countries.  

                                       4

Transportation  

     Transportation   logistics,   including   the   availability   of
transportation equipment and the efficiency of transportation systems,
are key elements in the raising  of poultry, transporting feed to  the
contract growers  and outside purchasers, transporting  poultry to the
processing plants, and  transporting products to customers.  WLR Foods
has contracts with  two railroad  companies for the  delivery of  feed
ingredients to WLR Foods' feedmills.

     Delivery of the Company's  products are generally made by  truck.
WLR  Foods maintains  a fleet  of refrigerated  trucks and  uses them,
along with refrigerated common carrier and customer-owned vehicles, to
deliver  its products.    Export products  are loaded  in refrigerated
containers and shipped overseas.

Raw Materials

     WLR  Foods' largest  cost is for  basic feed  ingredients, namely
corn  and soybean meal.   Feed costs represented  approximately 32% of
the Company's total cost of sales in fiscal year ended July 1, 1995.  

     Feed  grains are  commodities subject  to volatile  price changes
caused by  weather, size of  harvest, transportation and  storage cost
and  the  agricultural  policies  of the  United  States  and  foreign
governments.  Although  WLR Foods  can, and  sometimes does,  purchase
grain  in the  forward  markets, it  cannot  completely eliminate  the
potential adverse effect of grain price increases. 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Compliance

     WLR  Foods'   facilities  and  operations  are   subject  to  the
regulatory jurisdiction  of various  federal  agencies, including  the
Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Environmental
Protection Agency,  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and
of  corresponding state  agencies  in Virginia,  West Virginia,  North
Carolina  and Pennsylvania.   All environmental permits,  such as air,
water  and solid  waste disposal  permits, are  issued  by appropriate
state agencies.

     A  total  of seven  environmental  permits are  held  by Wampler-
Longacre's  Virginia  facilities,  all of  which  were  issued  by the
Virginia  Department  of Environmental  Quality.    The Hinton  turkey
processing  facility  holds  an  air permit  which  regulates  certain
combustion equipment and a water permit which regulates  the treatment
of process  wastewater.   The Harrisonburg turkey  processing facility
holds a water  permit requiring pretreatment of its process wastewater
to  meet  certain  effluent  standards  before  discharging  into  the
regional   sewer  system.     Wampler-Longacre's  Timberville  chicken
processing and rendering facility holds a water permit which regulates
the  discharge of process wastewater and an air permit which regulates
the operation of its  protein conversion facility, as well  as certain
combustion equipment.  The chicken processing facility in Alma/Stanley
holds one  water  permit  which  regulates the  discharge  of  process
wastewater.   

                                       5
<PAGE>

Finally, the Broadway feedmill holds an air permit which
was issued  primarily  for the  control  and abatement  of  dust.   In
addition to the seven  environmental permits held by Wampler-Longacre,
WLR  Foods holds a  Virginia Pollution  Abatement permit  which allows
Wampler-Longacre's Virginia  facilities to  apply to land  in Virginia
certain wastewater  biosolids generated by the  facilities' wastewater
treatment systems.

     In West  Virginia, Wampler-Longacre's Moorefield  facilities hold
four  environmental  permits, all  of which  were  issued by  the West
Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor & Environmental Resources.  The
chicken processing and  rendering facility holds a  water permit which
regulates  the discharge of  process wastewater,  an air  permit which
regulates the operation of  the company's protein conversion facility,
and a sludge management permit regulating the land application in West
Virginia of  certain wastewater biosolids generated  at the Moorefield
facilities wastewater treatment works.   The Moorefield feedmill holds
one  air permit  which  was  issued  primarily  for  the  control  and
abatement of dust.

     Wampler-Longacre's North Carolina facilities  hold a total of ten
environmental  permits, all of which were issued by the North Carolina
Department  of Environment, Health &  Natural Resources.    The Monroe
turkey processing plant holds three permits:  an industrial wastewater
discharge permit  which requires  process wastewater to  be pretreated
prior to discharge  to a  regional sewer system,  a stormwater  permit
which  regulates  stormwater  discharges,  and  an  air  permit  which
regulates boiler  emissions.   The Marshville turkey  processing plant
and  Charlotte  turkey  processing   plant  each  hold  an  industrial
wastewater discharge permit and stormwater permit which are similar to
the counterpart permits held by the Monroe facility.  In addition, the
Marshville facility holds a  stormwater permit which regulates cooling
water  and boiler blowdown discharges.   Finally, the Wingate feedmill
holds a stormwater permit which regulates stormwater discharges and an
air  permit which  regulates emissions  from boilers,  bagfilters, and
related equipment.

     Pennsylvania facilities owned by Wampler-Longacre hold a total of
six  environmental permits.    The Franconia  turkey processing  plant
holds five permits:   two water permits for  the treatment of  process
wastewater,  two   air  permits  to  regulate   operation  of  certain
combustion and  incineration equipment, and one  municipal solid waste
disposal permit  for the disposal of incinerator  ash.  The New Oxford
turkey  processing  facility  holds  one air  permit  which  regulates
combustion  equipment.  All of the Pennsylvania permits were issued by
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.

     In addition to the foregoing environmental permits, and where not
otherwise  addressed above, all facilities have  taken steps to ensure
compliance with stormwater regulations.   Where applicable, facilities
have  applied for  the necessary  group, individual  or  general storm
water  permit  in  accordance   with  state  and  federal  guidelines.
Further,  each  facility  has registered  aboveground  and underground
storage  tanks   in  accordance   with  relevant  state   and  federal
regulations.

                                       6

<PAGE>

     Management  believes  that  all  facilities  and  operations  are
currently in compliance  with environmental and  regulatory standards.
Compliance has not  had a  materially adverse effect  upon WLR  Foods'
earnings   or  competitive  position  in  the  past,  and  it  is  not
anticipated to have a materially adverse effect in the future.

Employees

     WLR Foods employed over 9,000 persons as of July 1, 1995, none of
whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.


Item  2.  PROPERTIES.  

     WLR Foods' seven poultry  processing facilities and three further
processing plants are located in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania
and  North   Carolina,  and  have   a  total  slaughter   capacity  of
approximately 650,000 turkeys per week  (single shift) and 3.1 million
chickens  per week (double  shift).  WLR Foods  owns and operates four
feed mills with a production capacity in excess of 1.8 million tons of
finished feed per year;  a turkey hatchery with a  production capacity
of approximately 335,000  poults per week  and two chicken  hatcheries
with a  production capacity  of approximately  3.2 million  chicks per
week;   freezer  and   cold   storage  for   finished  products   with
approximately 5.2  million cubic  feet  of capacity;  and two  protein
conversion  plants with a total  production capacity of  4,500 tons of
raw product weekly.  The diversity, number and geographic proximity of
its processing and support facilities provide WLR Foods with operating
flexibility  and  enable  it to  alter  the size  and  mix  of poultry
processed among the various facilities, as market conditions change. 

     Cassco  operates public refrigerated facilities at five locations
with  approximately  9.2 million cubic  feet.    These facilities  are
located  close to major food processors in Virginia, West Virginia and
North  Carolina.    Cassco   also  operates  seven  ice  manufacturing
facilities  in Virginia,  West Virginia  and Washington,  D.C. with  a
capacity of approximately 1,000 tons per day.  

     From fiscal  1988 through the  end of fiscal 1995,  WLR Foods has
spent over $169 million (excluding capital leases) for replacement and
productivity improvements, acquisitions  and expansion of  facilities,
and  protein conversion plant construction.   WLR Foods owns virtually
all of its  manufacturing and  production equipment which  is in  good
repair and is updated periodically.  Replacement parts and service for
the  equipment   are  readily  available,  which   allows  for  timely
processing of the Company's products.

Item  3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     On February  6, 1994, WLR  Foods filed suit in  the United States
District  Court for  the  Western District  of Virginia  against Tyson
Foods, Inc.  (Tyson), seeking,  among other things,  (1) a declaratory
judgment as to  the validity of  the Company's Shareholder  Protection
Rights   

                                       7
<PAGE>

Plan,   and   (2) a    declaratory   judgment   as   to   the
constitutionality  of Article 14,  Virginia Code  Sections 13.1-725 et
seq.  (Virginia  Affiliated Transactions  Statute),  and Article 14.1,
Virginia  Code  Sections 13.1-728  et  seq.  (Virginia  Control  Share
Acquisitions Statute), of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act under the
Virginia and United States Constitutions.

     In response, on February 25, 1994, Tyson, joined later by Tyson's
WLR Acquisition Corp., filed counterclaims against the Company and all
its directors,  except Peter A.W. Green, seeking,  among other things,
to  invalidate the  Company's Shareholder  Protection Rights  Plan and
certain  severance agreements,  and  a declaratory  judgment that  the
Virginia Affiliated  Transactions Statute, the Virginia  Control Share
Acquisitions  Statute and  other  Virginia statutes,  facially and  as
applied, are unconstitutional  under the  United States  Constitution.
Tyson  also sought a declaratory  judgment that four  of the Company's
directors  who resigned as employees  of the Company  in February 1994
were not  disinterested shareholders, and, therefore,  were ineligible
to vote their shares at a  Special Meeting of the Shareholders held on
May 21,  1994,  and  that   the  Company's  directors  breached  their
fiduciary  duties  in  taking  certain actions  described  in  Tyson's
counterclaims.  

     The  United  States  District  Court entered  final  judgment  on
December 6, 1994, upholding the legality of the directors' actions and
the validity of Virginia's  corporate laws relied upon by  WLR and its
directors.  Tyson appealed to the  United States Court of Appeals  for
the Fourth Circuit.  On September 22, 1995, a three-judge panel of the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously  in favor of WLR and
its  directors on all issues.   Finding that  Tyson's arguments lacked
merit, the Fourth Circuit  affirmed the judgment of the  United States
District Court.

          Wampler-Longacre, Inc., is a  named third-party defendant in
United  States v. Keystone Sanitation Co., Inc., et al., United States
District Court for  the Middle District of  Pennsylvania, Civil Action
No. 1:CV-93-1482.  In general, the  third-party plaintiffs are seeking
to hold  Wampler-Longacre jointly  and severally liable  under federal
and state  laws for the costs  of cleaning up hazardous  wastes at the
Keystone Sanitation Co., Inc. ("Keystone") municipal  landfill located
in Union Township, Adams County,  Pennsylvania.  The Keystone landfill
is on  the  federal government's  National  Priorities List  of  sites
eligible for  cleanup under the Comprehensive  Environmental Response,
Compensation  and Liability Act ("CERCLA"),  42 U.S.C. Section  9601 et seq.
(also  known  as  the  federal  Superfund  law).    Wampler-Longacre's
predecessor, Round Hill Foods,  Inc., used the Keystone  landfill from
1974 to 1990.

     At this time  there are  approximately 165 parties  named in  the
civil action who  are potentially liable  for the cleanup  costs.   In
addition,  a fourth  party action  may be filed  in the  coming months
which will add an additional 700 to 900 parties.  

     In  CERCLA  actions,  although  liable parties  are  jointly  and
severally liable for the  cleanup costs, in practice a  liable party's
contribution toward  the  cleanup  costs  is generally  based  on  the
party's waste allocation.  Waste allocation is determined based on the
amount of waste a party contributed to  a site in proportion to all of
the  other named  parties.   At  this  time, Wampler-

                                       8

<PAGE>
Longacre's  waste allocation is 1.02898%.   This waste allocation 
percentage presupposes the unlikely event  that all of  the waste 
generated by  the Company's predecessor was  actually disposed of by  
Keystone Sanitation Company, Inc.  in the  Keystone landfill  and not  
in any  of the  other nearby landfills.    This waste  allocation  
percentage,  moreover, does  not account  for  50-60% of  the overall  
waste in  the landfill  that was contributed  by  potential fourth-party  
defendants.    Thus, Wampler-Longacre's waste allocation is expected to 
decrease significantly once these fourth-parties are brought into this 
civil action.

     Wampler-Longacre  denies liability.   As  a food  processor, only
non-hazardous  trash has  been deposited  at the landfill  by Wampler-
Longacre.    Nevertheless, if  Wampler-Longacre  is  held liable,  its
liability  could  reach   $206,000.     However,  current   settlement
negotiations  are underway  which would  make  third-party defendants,
including WLR Foods,  responsible solely  for a portion of the cleanup
costs.   If  this settlement  is reached,  and provided  that Wampler-
Longacre's waste  allocation does not  change significantly,  Wampler-
Longacre's liability  is  expected to  be approximately  $50,000.   Of
course,  numerous factors  could cause Wampler-Longacre's  exposure to
increase or  decrease.  Nonetheless, a reasonable estimate of Wampler-
Longacre's exposure in this matter is in the range set forth above.

Item  4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.  

          No matters were submitted to the shareholders of the Company
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended July 1, 1995.

                        ARTICLES OF RESTATEMENT
                                  OF
                            WLR FOODS, INC.

     Pursuant to Va.  Code Section 13.1-639 and  Section 13.1-711, WLR

Incorporation as follows:

                              ARTICLE ONE
                                 NAME

     The name of the Corporation is WLR Foods, Inc.

                              ARTICLE TWO
                             CAPITAL STOCK

     Section One.  Authorized  Shares.  The total number  of shares of

all  classes  of  capital  stock  which  the  Corporation  shall  have

authority to issue is two hundred fifty million (250,000,000), divided

into  fifty million (50,000,000) shares of preferred stock without par

value,  one  hundred million  (100,000,000) shares  of  Class A Common

Stock,  no par value (Class A  Common Stock), and  one hundred million

(100,000,000) shares of  Class B Common  Stock, no par  value (Class B

Common Stock).

     Upon  the Articles of Amendment  of the Articles of Incorporation

becoming effective pursuant to the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the

Effective  Time), and without  any further action  on the  part of the

Corporation or its shareholders, each whole share of the Corporation's

Common  Stock,  no  par value  (the  Old  Common  Stock), then  issued

(including  shares held  in  the treasury  of  the Corporation)  shall

automatically be  reclassified, changed  and converted into  one fully

paid and nonassessable share of  Class A Common Stock and certificates

previously 

                                      
<PAGE>                                      


representing shares of Old  Common Stock shall be deemed  to represent

the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock.

     (a)  Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

          (1)  The powers,  preferences  and  rights  of  the  Class A

Common Stock  and the  Class B Common Stock,  and the  qualifications,

limitations  or  restrictions  thereof,   shall  be  in  all  respects

identical, except  as otherwise required by law  or expressly provided

in these Articles of Incorporation, as amended.

          (2)  (i)  At each annual or special meeting of shareholders,

each holder of Class A Common Stock shall be  entitled to one (1) vote

in person  or by proxy for each share of Class A Common Stock standing

in  his name  on  the stock  transfer records  of  the Corporation  in

connection  with  the  election of  directors  and  all other  actions

submitted to  a vote of shareholders.   Each holder  of Class B Common

Stock shall be entitled to one-tenth of one vote in person or by proxy

for each share  of Class B Common  Stock standing in  his name on  the

stock  transfer records  of  the Corporation  in  connection with  the

election of directors  and all other  actions submitted  to a vote  of

shareholders;  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  this  Articles  of

Incorporation, as amended, and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act.

               (ii)      The holders of the Class B Common Stock shall

each be  entitled to vote separately  as a class only  with respect to

(A) proposals to change  the par  value of the  Class B Common  Stock,

(B) other amendments to these Articles  of Incorporation that alter or

change the powers,  preferences or  special rights of  the holders  of

Class B Common Stock so as

                                   2
<PAGE> 


to  affect them adversely, and  (C) such other matters  as may require

class voting under the Virginia Stock Corporation Act.

               (iii)     The  number of  authorized shares  of Class B

Common Stock may  be increased or decreased (but not  below the number

of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the  holders of

a majority of the Class A Common Stock.

          (3)  Dividends may be  declared and paid  to the holders  of

the  Class A  Common  Stock and  the  Class B  Common  Stock in  cash,

property,  or other  securities  of the  Corporation  out of  any  net

profits  or net assets of  the Corporation legally available therefor.

If  and when  dividends on  the Class A Common  Stock and  the Class B

Common Stock  are declared payable from  time to time by  the Board of

Directors, whether payable in cash, in property or in  shares of stock

of the  Corporation, the holders of  the Class A Common  Stock and the

holders  of  the  Class B Common  Stock  shall  be  entitled to  share

equally,  on  a  per share  basis,  in  such  dividends, except  that,

dividends or other distributions payable on the Common Stock in shares

of Common Stock shall be made  to all holders of Common Stock and  may

be made (i) in shares of Class B Common Stock to the record holders of

Class A  Common  Stock and  to the  record  holders of  Class B Common

Stock, (ii) in shares of Class A Common Stock to the record holders of

Class A  Common Stock  and in  shares of Class B  Common Stock  to the

record  holders  of  Class  B  Common Stock  or  (iii)  in  any  other

authorized class  or series of  capital stock to  the holders  of both

classes of Common Stock.

          (4)  (i)  All outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock may

be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on  a share-for-share

basis by the Board of Directors if,

                                   3
<PAGE> 


as a result of the  existence of the Class B Common Stock,  either the

Class A  Common Stock or Class B Common Stock  is or both are excluded

from  trading on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange, the  American  Stock

Exchange and all other principal national securities exchanges then in

use and is also excluded from quotation on the National Association of

Securities Dealers  Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ)  and any other

comparable national quotation system then in use.

               (ii) All  outstanding  shares of  Class B  Common Stock

shall be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a share-for-

share basis if at any time the number of outstanding shares of Class A

Common  Stock  as  reflected on  the  stock  transfer  records of  the

Corporation  falls below  10% of  the aggregate number  of outstanding

shares of  Class A  Common Stock  and of  Class B  Common Stock.   For

purposes of the  immediately preceding sentence, any shares  of Common

Stock  repurchased  by  the  Corporation shall  no  longer  be  deemed

"outstanding" from and after the date of repurchase.

               (iii)     In the event of any conversion of the Class B

Common Stock  pursuant to subdivision (4)(i)  or (4)(ii), certificates

which formerly represented  outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock

will thereafter  be deemed  to represent  a like  number of shares  of

Class A Common Stock and  all authorized shares of Common Stock  shall

consist of only Class A Common Stock.

          (5)  (i)  If   any  person  or   group  acquires  beneficial

ownership of 30% or more of  the then issued and outstanding shares of

Class  A  Common  Stock after  the  Effective  Time  (other than  upon

original issuance by the Corporation, by  operation of law, by will or

the laws of  descent and distribution, by gift or  by foreclosure of a

bona fide loan), and such person

                                        4
<PAGE> 


or  group (a  "Related  Person")  does not  own  an  equal or  greater

percentage of the Class B Common Stock acquired after  the record date

for  the first  issuance of  Class B  Common Stock  (the "Distribution

Date"),  such person or group  must, within a  90-day period beginning

the day after becoming a Related Person, make a public tender offer in

compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  to  acquire

additional Class B Common Stock as provided  in this subsection (5) of

Article Two, Section One (a "Minority Protection Transaction").

               (ii)      In each Minority Protection  Transaction, the

Related Person must make a public tender offer  to acquire that number

of  shares of Class B  Common Stock determined  by (A) multiplying the

percentage of outstanding Class  A Common Stock beneficially owned  on

such date and acquired after the Effective Time by such Related Person

by the total number of  shares of Class B Common Stock  outstanding on

the  date such  person  or  group became  a  Related  Person, and  (B)

subtracting therefrom the  total number  of shares of  Class B  Common

Stock  beneficially  owned  on  such   date  and  acquired  after  the

Distribution Date by such Related Person (including shares acquired on

such date  at or  prior to  the  time such  person or  group became  a

Related  Person).  The Related Person must  acquire all of such shares

validly tendered; provided, however,  that if the number of  shares of

Class B Common Stock tendered to the Related Person exceeds the number

of shares required to be acquired pursuant to the formula set forth in

this  clause (ii),  the  number of  shares  of  Class B  Common  Stock

acquired from each tendering holder shall be pro rata in proportion to

the  total number of  shares of Class  B Common Stock  tendered by all

tendering holders.

                                        5
<PAGE> 


               (iii)     The  offer price  for any  shares of  Class B

Common Stock required to  be purchased by the Related  Person pursuant

to this  provision shall be the  greater of (A) the  highest price per

share paid by the Related Person for any share of Class A Common Stock

in the six-month period ending on the date such person or group became

a Related Person or  (B) the highest bid price  of a share of  Class A

Common Stock or  Class B Common  Stock on  the NASDAQ National  Market

System (or  such other  exchange or quotation  system as  is then  the

principal  trading market for such shares) on  the date such person or

group became a Related Person.  For purposes of clause (iv) below, the

applicable  date  for  the  calculations  required  by  the  preceding

sentence  shall  be  the date  on  which  the  Related Person  becomes

required to engage in a Minority Protection Transaction.  In the event

that the  Related Person has acquired Class A Common Stock in the six-

month period ending on the date such person or group becomes a Related

Person  for   consideration  other  than  cash,  the   value  of  such

consideration per share of Class A Common Stock shall be as determined

in good faith by the Board of Directors.

               (iv)      A Minority Protection Transaction  shall also

be  required  to  be effected  by  any  Related  Person that  acquires

beneficial ownership of the next higher integral multiple of 5% (e.g.,

35%, 40%, 45%, etc.) of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock

after the  Effective Time  (other than  upon issuance  or sale  by the

Corporation, by operation  of law, by will or the  laws of descent and

distribution, by gift, or by foreclosure of a bona fide  loan) if such

Related Person does not then own an equal or greater percentage of the

shares of Class B  Common Stock acquired after the  Distribution Date.

Such Related Person shall be required to make a public tender offer to

acquire that number of shares of Class B Common Stock

                                   6 
<PAGE>                                   


prescribed by  the formula set  forth in  clause (ii) above,  and must

acquire all shares validly tendered or a pro rata  portion thereof, as

specified in said  clause (ii),  at the price  determined pursuant  to

clause (iii) above.

               (v)  If  any  Related Person  fails  to  make an  offer

required by  this subsection  (5) of Article  Two, Section One,  or to

purchase shares  validly tendered and not  withdrawn (after proration,

if any),  such Related Person shall not be entitled to vote any shares

of Class A Common  Stock beneficially owned by such Related Person and

acquired  by such Related Person  after the Effective  Time unless and

until  such requirements  are complied  with or  unless and  until all

shares of  Class A Common Stock  causing such offer requirement  to be

effective are no longer beneficially owned by such Related Person.

               (vi)      The    Minority     Protection    Transaction

requirement shall not apply to any increase in percentage ownership of

Class A  Common Stock  resulting  solely from  a change  in the  total

amount  of  Class  A  Common  Stock  outstanding,  provided  that  any

acquisition after such  change which  results in any  person or  group

owning 30% or more of the Class A Common Stock excluding, in the  case

of the numerator but not of the denominator of the calculation of such

percentage, shares of Class A Common Stock held by such Related Person

immediately after the Effective Time, shall be subject to any Minority

Protection Transaction requirement that  would be imposed with respect

to a  Related Person pursuant  to this subsection (5)  of Article Two,

Section One.

               (vii)     All calculations with  respect to  percentage

ownership of issued and  outstanding shares of either class  of Common

Stock will be based upon the numbers of issued

                                   7
<PAGE> 


and outstanding shares reported  by the Corporation on the  last filed

of  (A) the Corporation's most recent  annual report on Form 10-K, (B)

its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or (C) if any, its most

recent Current Report on Form 8-K.

               (viii)    For purposes of this  subsection (5) of  this

Article  Two, Section One, the  term "person" means  a natural person,

company,   government,   or    political   subdivision,   agency    or

instrumentality  of  a  government,  or  other  entity.    "Beneficial

ownership"  shall be  determined  pursuant to  Rule 13d-3  promulgated

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended (the 1934 Act),

or  any successor regulation.  The formation or existence of a "group"

shall be  determined pursuant to Rule  13d-5(b) under the 1934  Act or

any successor regulation.

          (6)       Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of

the Corporation,  whether voluntary or involuntary,  the remaining net

assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders

of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock in accordance

with their respective rights and interests.

          (7)       In  the event of a  merger or consolidation of the

Corporation  with  or  into  another   entity  (whether  or  not   the

Corporation  is the surviving entity),  the holders of  Class B Common

Stock shall be entitled to receive the same per share consideration as

                          BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Section One.  Term.  Commencing with the election of directors at

the annual meeting  of shareholders  in 1990, the  directors shall  be

divided into three Classes,  A, B, and C, as nearly equal in number as

possible following such procedure as shall be established by the Board

of Directors.  The initial term of office for members of Class A shall

expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1991; the initial term

of office for members of Class B shall expire at the annual meeting of

shareholders in 1992;  and the initial  term of office for  members of

Class C



                                   11 
<PAGE>

shall expire at the annual  meeting of shareholders in 1993.   At each

annual meeting  of shareholders following  such initial classification

and election,  successive elections  of those directors,  or directors

elected to succeed  those directors, shall  be selected for a  term of

office  to   expire  at  the   third  succeeding  annual   meeting  of

shareholders after their  election and shall  continue to hold  office

until their respective  successors are elected and  qualify.  However,

any director named between any annual meeting of shareholders shall be

for the term ending with the next annual meeting of  shareholders.  If

the  number of directors fixed  by the bylaws  increases or decreases,

all Classes of directors shall be increased or decreased as equally as

possible.

     Section  Two.   Removal.   Shareholders  may  remove one  or more

directors only  with cause, defined  as willful misconduct  or knowing

violation of  criminal law or of any  federal or state securities law.

However, shareholders may remove one or more directors with or without

cause upon a recommendation  for removal without cause from  the Board

of Directors passed by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors.

                             ARTICLE FOUR

Incorporation  of the Corporation shall be amended by approval of each

voting group  entitled to vote on  the amendment by a  majority of all

votes entitled to be cast by the voting group, provided such amendment

has  been   recommended  for  approval  to  the  shareholders  of  the

Corporation by a majority of the Board of Directors.

part, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of  the Board of Directors, or by the

holders of two-thirds  (2/3) of all  shares entitled to  vote by  each

voting group of the shareholders of the Corporation, at any meeting of

the Board of  Directors or of  the shareholders, as  the case may  be,

except that the shareholder  vote for Bylaw amendments that  have been

recommended  to the  shareholders by  a two-thirds  (2/3) vote  of the

Board of Directors shall require only a majority of all votes entitled

to be cast by each voting group.  Bylaws made or  amended by the Board

of  Directors may be altered or repealed by the shareholders according

to this  Section, but shall  remain in  effect unless  and until  such

action be taken by the shareholders.

registered in his name on the books of the Corporation.  

     Section 3.  Quorum.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting

constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.  

     Section 4.  Adjournment of Meetings.  If less than a quorum shall
be  in attendance at the  shareholders' meeting, the  meeting shall be
adjourned from  time to time  by a  majority vote of  the shareholders
entitled to vote present or represented by proxy  until a quorum shall
attend.    Any meeting  at  which  a quorum  is  present  may also  be
adjourned  in like  manner for  such  time upon  such call  as may  be
determined by the shareholders  entitled to vote present in  person or
by proxy at such meetings.  At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum
is  present,  any business  may be  transacted  which might  have been
transacted if the meeting had been held as originally called.  

     Section 5.   Annual Election of Directors.  The annual meeting of
the  shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of

person so appointed fails to appear or refuses to act, the chairman of

The number of inspectors shall be three (3).  

     (b)  The  inspectors of  election shall  determine the  number of
shares  outstanding  and  the   voting  power  of  each,  the   shares
represented  at  the  meeting, the  existence  of  a  quorum, and  the
authenticity,  validity  and effect  of  proxies;  they shall  receive
votes, ballots or consents and shall hear and determine all challenges
and questions if any may  arise in connection with the right  to vote;
they  shall count  and tabulate all votes or  consents, determine when
the polls  shall close,  and determine the  result; and they  shall do
such  acts  as may  be proper  to conduct  the  election or  vote with
fairness to all shareholders.  

     (c)  The  inspectors  of  election  shall  perform  their  duties
impartially,  in good  faith, to  the best  of  their ability,  and as
expeditiously as is practical.   The decision, act or certificate of a
majority  of  the  inspectors is  effective  in  all  respects as  the
decision, act or certificate of  all.  Any report or certificate  made
by the inspectors  of election is  prima facie evidence  of the  facts
stated therein.  

     Section  8.    Organization.    The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of
Directors,  or  such other  officer or  board member  as the  Board of

shareholders.   The Secretary or  an Assistant Secretary  shall act as
secretary of the meeting and keep a record of the proceedings thereof.
The Board of Directors  of the Corporation shall  be entitled to  make

extent, determined by  the Board of Directors  or the chairman of  the
meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to  be held in
accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.  

     Section 9.   Record Date  for Special Meeting.   For purposes  of

                              ARTICLE IX
              Limitation of Liability and Indemnification

     Section 1.   Limitation or Elimination of Liability.  To the full
extent that  the Virginia Stock  Corporation Act, as it  exists on the
date hereof or may hereafter  be amended, permits the limitation    or
elimination of the liability  of directors or officers, a  director or
officer  of the Corporation shall not be  liable to the Corporation or
its shareholders for any monetary damages in excess of one dollar.   
     Section  2.   Indemnification.  The Corporation shall indemnify a
director or officer  of the Corporation who  is or was a  party to any
proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was  such a director or
officer or is  or was serving at  the request of the Corporation  as a
director,  officer, partner,  trustee,  employee or  agent of  another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit  plan
or other enterprise against  all liabilities and expenses  incurred in
the proceeding except such   liabilities and expenses as  are incurred
because of his willful misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal
law.  

     Section  3.    Determination  to  Indemnify.     Subject  to  the
provisions  of Section 7 of this Article, a determination to indemnify
a director or  officer under Section 2 of this  Article shall be made,
in the  first instance, by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of
Directors, such quorum consisting  of  disinterested directors.   If a
quorum  of  disinterested  directors  cannot  be  obtained,  then  the
determination shall be made by majority vote of a committee designated
by  the Board of Directors  (in which designation interested directors
may participate),  the committee  to consist  solely of two   or  more
disinterested  directors.  If  such a committee  cannot be designated,
the determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by a
majority vote of a  quorum consisting of disinterested directors,  or,
if the  same cannot be obtained, by the committee described above.  If
neither  a  quorum  consisting   of  disinterested  directors  or  the
committee described  above can be  obtained, the selection  of special
legal counsel shall be made by majority vote of the Board of Directors
(in   which   selection   interested   directors   may   participate).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, in any  instance,
the determination to indemnify  a director or  officer may be made  by
vote of the shareholders, except that any shares owned, or voted under
the  control  of,  directors  or  officers  who  are  parties  to  the
proceeding may not be voted.

     Section  4.   Advances and  Reimbursements of  Expenses.   Once a
determination to indemnify   has been made pursuant to  the provisions
of Section 3  of this Article, the Corporation shall make advances for
expenses of, and reimbursements for expenses incurred by, any director
or officer in any  proceeding described in Section 2 of  this Article,
upon receipt of an undertaking from the director  or  officer to repay
the same if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled


                                   9
<PAGE>
to  indemnification.      Such  undertaking  shall  be  an  unlimited,
unsecured general obligation of  the director or officer and  shall be
accepted  without reference  to his  ability to  make repayment.   The
director  or officer also shall furnish the Corporation with a written
statement of his  good faith belief that  he has met the  standard  of
conduct described in Va. Code Section 13.1-697, as amended.  

     Section 5.  Indemnification  of Agents and Employees.   The Board
of  Directors may cause the Corporation to indemnify and make advances
and reimbursements  to any person not  specified in Section 2  of this
Article who was or is a party  to any proceeding by reason of the fact
that he  is or was an employee  or agent of the  Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation  as a director, officer,
partner,   trustee,  employee   or  agent   of   another  corporation,
partnership,  joint venture,  trust,  employee benefit  plan or  other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one
to  whom indemnification is  granted in Section 2.   The provisions of
Section  2   through 4  of  this Article  shall be  applicable to  any
indemnification,   determination,   advancements  and   reimbursements
provided pursuant to this Section.  
 
     Section  6.   Indemnification  Insurance.    The Corporation  may
purchase and maintain insurance  to indemnify it against  the whole or
any  portion of the  liability assumed by  it in accordance  with this
Article, and also may procure  insurance in such amounts as  the Board
of Directors  may determine on  behalf of any person  who is or  was a
director, officer, employee or agent of  the Corporation, or is or was
serving  at  the request  of the  Corporation  as a  director officer,
partner,  trustee,   employee    or  agent   of  another  corporation,
partnership,  joint venture,  trust,  employee benefit  plan or  other
enterprise, against liability asserted against or incurred by any such
person  in any  such  capacity or  arising from  his  status as  such,
whether  or  not the  Corporation would  have  power to  indemnify him
against such liability under the provisions of this Article.   

     Section 7.  Changes in the Board Composition.  In the event there
has been  a change in  the composition of  a majority of the  Board of
Directors after the  date of the alleged act or  omission with respect
to  which   indemnification  is  claimed,  any   determination  as  to
indemnification, advancement or reimbursement of expenses with respect
to  any claim for indemnification made pursuant  to Sections 2 or 5 of
this Article shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the
Board  of Directors  and the  proposed indemnitee.   If  the Board  of
Directors  and the proposed indemnitee  are unable to  agree upon such
special  legal  counsel,  the  Board of  Directors  and  the  proposed
indemnitee each shall select a  nominee, and the nominee shall  select
such special legal counsel.   

     Section 8.   Applicability of  this Article.   The provisions  of
this  Article shall  be applicable  to all  actions, claims,  suits or
proceedings commenced after the  adoption hereof, whether arising from
any action taken or failure to act  before or after such adoption.  No
amendment, modification or  repeals of this Article shall diminish the
rights provided hereby  or diminish the right  to indemnification with
respect  to  any  claim,  issue  or  matter in  any  then  pending  or
subsequent proceeding  that is based   in any material  respect on any
alleged action or failure to act prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal. Reference herein to directors, officers,


                                   10
<PAGE>

employees  or   agents  shall  include  former   directors,  officers,
employees  and  agents  and   their  respective  heirs,  executors and
administrators.

                           Redemption Rights

Act, Article 14.1 of Title 13.1   of the Code of Virginia of 1950,  as
amended,  the Corporation is authorized to redeem shares acquired in a
control share acquisition, as  that term is defined under  the Control
Share Acquisition Act.   

                              ARTICLE XI
                              Fiscal Year

     The Board of Directors shall have power to fix, and, from time to
time,  change, the fiscal  year of  the Corporation.  Unless otherwise
fixed by the Board, the fiscal year shall end on  the Saturday closest
to June 30th.  

                              ARTICLE XII
                              Amendments

     These Bylaws may be amended, in whole or in part, by a two-thirds
(2/3) vote of the Board of  Directors, or by the holders of two-thirds
(2/3)  of all  shares entitled  to vote  by each  voting group  of the
shareholders  of the  Corporation,  at any  meeting  of the  Board  of
Directors or of the shareholders, as  the case may be, except that the
shareholder vote  for Bylaw amendments  that have been  recommended to
the shareholders by a two-thirds (2/3)  vote of the Board of Directors
shall require only a majority of all votes entitled to be cast by each
voting group.  Bylaws made or amended by the Board of Directors may be
altered  or repealed by the  shareholders, but shall  remain in effect
unless and until such action be taken by the shareholders.  
 
                             ARTICLE XIII
                          Implied Amendments

     Any  action taken  or authorized  by the  shareholders or  by the
Board of Directors which would be inconsistent with the Bylaws then in
effect, but  which is taken or  authorized by the affirmative  vote of
not less  than that number of  shares or the number  of directors that
would be  required to amend these  Bylaws so that the  Bylaws would be
consistent with  such action,  shall be given  the same  effect as  if
these Bylaws had been  temporarily amended or suspended to  the extent
necessary to permit the specific action so taken or authorized.

      Management's Discussion and Analysis from Annual Report to Shareholders

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


GENERAL INFORMATION

WLR Foods, Inc. posted record sales for the seventh consecutive year.
The Company experienced significant changes during fiscal 1995, a
result of the August 1994 acquisition of the Cuddy Farms, Inc. - USA
Food Division (Carolina Division) in North Carolina.  The acquisition
moved WLR Foods to the second largest turkey processor in the nation,
and increased the Company's presence in foodservice.  
 
The Company continued to oppose the Tyson Foods, Inc. hostile takeover
attempt through the year, although expenses have been minimal since
January 1995.  At the current level of activity, management does not 
anticipate the continuing costs to have a material impact on operations 
in fiscal 1996. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 
upheld the lower court ruling in favor of WLR Foods on September 22, 1995.

During fiscal 1995, WLR Foods expanded and renegotiated its line of
credit with several banks. The new facility is a $110 million
revolving line of credit, of which $15 million is available for
standby letters of credit.  The terms of the revolver led to the
renegotiation of the financial covenants on the existing long-term
fixed rate debt. Additionally, two new debt facilities were placed
during the year: a $25 million, variable rate, seven-year term loan to
finance the Carolina acquisition and a $22 million, 12-year, fixed
rate term loan which replaced the variable rate term loan placed in
1991. This refinancing allows for greater operating flexibility for
the future. 
 
Fiscal 1995 was a year of changes in the capital stock for WLR
Foods. The Board of Directors announced a $20 million stock repurchase
plan in February and in June authorized an additional $10 million to
be repurchased.  As of September 10, 1995, 1.16 million shares of
stock have been repurchased at a cost of $17.7 million.  Management
expects to continue the repurchase plan during fiscal 1996. The Board
also declared a three-for-two stock split, and a 12.5% increase in the
regular quarterly dividend. The current annual dividend is $0.24 per
share, based on the split-effected shares.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994 

Sales increased 25% to $908.8 million in fiscal 1995, primarily the result of 
the acquisition of the Carolina Division in late August 1994. Sales pounds 
increased 18%, comprised of a 2% increase in chicken pounds sold, and a 40% 
increase in turkey and further processed pounds sold. Average quoted 
commodity prices for whole chickens and turkeys were down 8% and 1%, 
respectively, compared to fiscal 1994 average prices, resulting from abundant 
supplies of not only poultry but of competing meats. As export demand for 
dark turkey meat dropped due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso, prices 
for dark turkey meat decreased to low levels, averaging 25% lower than the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.  In the new fiscal year, an increase in export 
demand for dark turkey products is moving prices upward. Domestic demand
for whole turkeys and further processed white meat products has also increased 
these commodity prices since fiscal year end. 

Cost of sales increased 24%, primarily due to higher volumes sold somewhat 
offset by lower average grain costs. Corn prices were down 10% and soybean 
meal was 16% lower than in fiscal 1994. Corn prices have moved somewhat 
higher since year end, and management anticipates the average price of corn 
to be above the fiscal 1995 average. Soybean meal prices have remained stable 
through the last six months, but due to weather patterns in the Midwest, 
prices have moved higher since fiscal year end. Currently, WLR Foods does 
not have any commitments to purchase corn or soybean meal in the future. 
Overall, management anticipates corn and soybean meal costs to be in the 
range of the five year average cost of both commodity grain inputs. 
Operating costs remained steady, with efficiency improvements offsetting
increases in labor and packaging costs. 

Disease is always a risk of raising poultry. This summer, the poultry 
industry, and the Company experienced live production losses due to heat 
and disease. WLR Foods most notable losses occurred in the Carolina Division 
from spiking mortality of turkeys. This disease affects young turkeys during 
periods of high temperatures.  The impact of this situation is two-fold: 
reduced numbers of live birds available for slaughter and the failure of 
surviving birds to mature as uniformly as healthy flocks, thereby increasing 
processing costs. Management has taken several approaches to combat the 
disease with positive initial results.  Extensive research supported by WLR 
Foods and the industry is underway in an attempt to isolate the cause.
 
Gross profit margin improved as a result of lower grain prices and increased 
sales of value-added products. This trend reversed in the fourth quarter as 
prices dropped for dark turkey meat products and as grain prices increased. 
Since fiscal year end, average quoted prices for whole turkeys and breastmeat 
have increased seasonally and are expected to remain in a more normal range 
through the end of calendar 1995. 

Total selling, general and administrative expenses rose 43.7% because of a 
significant increase in volumes sold.  Selling, marketing, advertising and 
delivery costs were due to the acquisition of the Carolina Division and 
higher volumes sold. Higher sales volumes of further processed and foodservice 
products also resulted in increased selling, marketing and advertising 
expenses. Administrative costs increased only 6% over the prior year.  
Fiscal 1995 includes $1.3 million in defense costs for the hostile takeover 
attempt of the Company by Tyson Foods compared to $3.1 million in fiscal 1994. 

 

                                   3

WLR Foods other expenses increased due to increases in the amounts borrowed 
along with higher interest rates on the variable rate loans. Additional funds 
were borrowed to finance two acquisitions, and an additional $16.3 million was
used to repurchase 1.06 million shares of the Company's common stock in fiscal 
1995.  The effective tax rate was 37.6%, compared to 37.4% for fiscal 1994.

Fiscal 1994 compared to Fiscal 1993. 
 
Net sales for fiscal 1994 increased 18% over the previous year. Sales volumes 
were up 15%, the result of a 14% increase in chicken pounds sold and a 19% 
increase in turkey sales due to internal growth and the New Oxford acquisition.
Cassco Ice & Cold Storage's revenues rose 34% in fiscal 1994, reflecting a 
full year of revenues from operations acquired in fiscal 1993. Average quoted 
commodity prices were up 5% for chickens and 6% for turkeys over the previous 
year. This trend continued the fiscal 1993 price movement.
 
Cost of sales increased 18% in fiscal 1994 with higher sales volumes and 
higher feed costs. These costs reduced the gross margin to 13%. Feed costs 
were up $16 million compared to fiscal 1993. Operating efficiencies continued 
to improve over previous years, as higher volumes of product were processed. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 14% over fiscal 1993, 
with nearly half, 6%, resulting from advisory fees for the hostile takeover 
defense. Higher sales volumes increased delivery costs and selling expenses. 
Although selling, general and administrative expenses were up in total 
dollars, the percentage of net sales for these expenses fell from 9% to 8.7%.  

The Company's interest expense increased in fiscal 1994 due to higher interest 
rates and increased borrowings.

The effective tax rate increased from 35.5% to 37.4% as a result of lower 
tax credits available to WLR Foods. 


LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

The Company's working capital position improved in fiscal 1995. At year end, 
working capital was $120.6 million, up from $70.0 million last year. The 
increase was the result of the $110 million revolving credit facility 
established in March 1995. The revolving credit facility allows WLR Foods 
to borrow funds for general corporate purposes, with no repayments until 
the facility matures in 1998.  The change in terms on the bank facility 
allowed WLR Foods to reclassify nearly all of the revolver borrowing as 
long-term financing for statement purposes. Working capital changes, 
in addition to the acquired businesses and refinancing were due to changes 
in operating accounts of $10 million, primarily made up of increased finished 
goods inventories.  Since fiscal year end, finished goods inventories have 
been sold down to prior year post-acquisition levels.  WLR Foods current 
ratio improved to 2.7-to-1 compared to 2.0-to-1 for last year. Management 
anticipates the current ratio to remain strong over the next two years as 
a result of the debt restructuring during fiscal 1995. 

The Company refinanced two variable rate term loans, extending the scheduled 
repayments into the future. The refinancing revised the financial covenants 
reflecting the financial strength of WLR Foods. The revised covenants will
allow the Company more operating flexibility for the 
                                  
                                  4

future. One of the loans was expanded to $22 million and fixed at a rate of 
7.47% for 12 years. The second remains a variable rate note,  with pricing at 
one quarter of a percent lower than the facility it replaced. 

As of July 1, 1995, total debt-to-total capitalization was 44.7%, up from 
28.4% a year ago. The increase is the result of borrowing used for the 
Carolina Division acquisition, and the repurchase of WLR Foods stock. The 
common stock subject to repurchase is classified as debt for the total 
debt-to-total capital calculation. Management expects this percentage to 
fluctuate based on usage of the revolving line of credit, but anticipates 
levels remaining below 50%. 

Book value per share of common stock was $10.47 compared to $9.45 last year, 
both of which reflect the three-for-two stock split. The book value per share 
calculation includes as equity the $17.8 million common stock subject to
repurchase. This approach assumes the shares outstanding will become 
non-contingent shares at the termination of the put-agreement in 1998 which 
was part of the original purchase agreement for the Carolina Division. The 
net increase in book value reflects $16.1 million in earnings and $29.1 
million of additional shares issued (including stock issued for acquisitions), 
less $4.1 million of dividends paid and $16.3 million to  repurchase shares. 
The regular quarterly dividend was increased by 12.5% to six cents per share 
during the year. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WLR Foods spent $17.3 million on capital improvements in fiscal 1995. These 
include $1.8 million expended on the expansion of the Moorefield plant to add 
a portion control chicken product line for foodservice customers, $1.4 million 
on the completion of the Monroe turkey plant expansion, and the balance on 
normal replacement and upgrades of equipment and facilities. For fiscal 1996 
capital expenditures are budgeted at $30 million. Approximately $23 million
is budgeted for normal replacements and upgrades.  The remainder is available 
for longer term projects: renovations to the Marshville  processing plant to 
increase capacity and efficiency, and building an ice manufacturing facility 
and installing equipment in Richmond, Virginia. The Marshville project will 
be operational this fall with anticipated contributions realized for the 
second half  of fiscal 1996.  The Richmond ice facility should be operational 
by fiscal year end with contributions not realized until fiscal 1997. 

Depreciation expense for the year was $24.8 million with an additional $0.6 
million of amortization.  For fiscal 1996, depreciation and amortization is 
forecast at $25 million. Management anticipates the cash generated from 
operations and the available revolving credit balance to be adequate to fund 
capital spending, scheduled debt service and dividend needs for fiscal 1996, 
with additional capital available to pursue acquisitions when opportunities 
arise. 

Management is not aware of any significant environmental, legal or accounting 
issue or pronouncement that will materially impact the operations or financial 
position of WLR Foods.

WLR FOODS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION

Organization
WLR Foods, Inc. (the Company) is primarily engaged in fully integrated
turkey and chicken production, processing, further processing and
marketing. WLR Foods sells products through a variety of selected
national and international retail, foodservice and institutional
markets.

Fiscal year
The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30. 
Fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993 ended on July 1, 1995, July 2, 1994
and July 3, 1993, respectively, and included 52 weeks in fiscal 1995
and fiscal 1994, and 53 weeks in fiscal 1993. 

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of WLR Foods and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
Inventories of feed, grain, eggs, packaging supplies, processed
poultry and meat products are stated at the lower of cost or market as
determined by the first-in, first-out valuation method.  Live poultry
and breeder flocks consist of poultry raised for slaughter and
breeders.  Poultry raised for slaughter are stated at the lower of
average cost or market. Breeders are stated at average cost less
accumulated amortization.  The costs of breeders are accumulated
during their development stage and then amortized into the cost of the
eggs produced over the egg production cycle of the breeders. 

The Company has four methods of purchasing grain: cash purchasing,
forward pricing, grain options, and hedging with futures contracts.
Each purchasing method creates varying degrees of risk for WLR Foods.
During the fiscal years presented, the Company has used only cash
purchasing and forward pricing to buy its grain. As of July 1, 1995,
WLR Foods does not have any forward contractual agreements for the
purchase of grains.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets.  The costs of maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations, while costs associated with renewals,
improvements and major replacements are capitalized.

Income Taxes
Effective July 4, 1993, WLR Foods adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS 109).  Under the asset and liability method of SFAS 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax  


                                       7
<PAGE>
consequences attributable to the differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income for the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

The Company adopted SFAS 109 using the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle, although the adoption of the new statement
did not have a material effect on the consolidated statement of
earnings or the consolidated balance sheet.

Net Earnings Per Common Share
Net earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number
of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the
fiscal years (17,858,942 shares, 16,450,718 shares and 13,983,228
shares in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively).  Net earnings are
reduced by the preferred stock dividend to arrive at the net earnings
available to common shareholders.  Fully diluted earnings per share
assume the full conversion of the Series L Convertible Preferred Stock
during the period they were outstanding.  Fully diluted earnings per
share were based on the fully diluted weighted average common shares
and common share equivalents of 15,666,522 for fiscal 1993. 
 
Stock Split
On February 28, 1995, the Company declared a three-for-two stock split
effected in the form of a 50%  stock dividend paid on May 12, 1995 to 
shareholders of record on April 14, 1995. The split resulted in the
issuance of an additional 6.1 million shares of common stock. All
numbers of common shares and per share data have been restated to
reflect the stock split.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined
by the Company using available market information. Except for debt
instruments (Note 5), the carrying amounts of all financial
instruments approximate their fair values due to their short
maturities.

Reclassifications
Certain 1994 and 1993 amounts have been reclassified to conform with
fiscal 1995 presentations.


2.  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Each transaction discussed below has been accounted for as a purchase,
and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included
herein include the net assets acquired at fair value and the results
of operations from the date of acquisition.

On April 3, 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Cassco Ice &
Cold Storage, Inc., acquired the remaining 50% interest in a cold
storage and distribution facility in Marshville, North Carolina  for
$2.3 million in cash.  The business is a refrigerated distribution
center that operates as a public refrigerated warehouse, located on 
approximately 15 acres. The Company acquired its initial 50% interest
in the facility as part of its purchase of Cuddy Farms, Inc.-USA Food
Division mentioned below.

                                               -------         ------- 

Long-term debt, excluding current maturities  $106,481         $46,368 
                                              ========         =======
 
The 9.41% Senior Unsecured Notes have $3 million principal payments
due in May of each year through 2000.  In 2001, a final balloon
payment of $9 million is due. Interest is payable semi-annually.  The
7.47% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 were placed in June 1995. The
notes require interest payments on a semi-annual basis through
maturity. Principal payments of $4.4 million begin in 2003. The
financial covenants for both senior notes include fixed charge
coverage, debt-to-capital, tangible net worth and current ratio
requirements. 

The Unsecured Bank Term Note is a seven-year fully amortizing variable
rate note, priced at London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) plus 75
basis points. With initial funding in April 1995, WLR Foods made the
first payment on June 30, 1995. Principal and interest payments are
due quarterly, with repricing occurring on or about the due date of
the payment. Annual principal payments are $3,571,000. 

WLR Foods has two unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $110
million with banks.  The first facility is a three-year, $100 million
syndicated facility, which matures on April 1, 1998.  On July 1, 1995,
$35 million was outstanding, with $50 million available for borrowing. 
The facility provides for $15 million of standby letters of credit,
including $6.5 million currently available for new standby letters of
credit. Pricing is LIBOR plus 35 basis points.  The second revolving
credit facility is a $10 million facility maturing in March 1996. No
amounts were outstanding on July 1, 1995.  The revolving credit and
bank term agreements contain various covenants, including maintenance
of a minimum net worth, current ratio, fixed charge coverage, and a 
maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio. 

The fair value of the fixed rate notes is estimated at $47.8 million
based on quoted market prices for similar issues at July 1, 1995. The
carrying value of all other debt approximates fair value at July 1,
1995.

Required annual principal repayments of long-term debt are as follows:

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company maintains a Profit Sharing and Salary Savings Plan that is
available to substantially all employees who meet certain age and
service requirements. Most participants may elect to make
contributions of up to 15% of their salary. For each employee dollar
contributed (limited to the first 4% of an employee's compensation),
the Company is required to contribute a matching amount of 50 cents.
The Company can also make additional contributions at its discretion.
WLR Foods total contributions under this plan were approximately $2.3
million, $2.1 million, and $1.5 million, for fiscal 1995, 1994, and 
1993, respectively.

7. INCOME TAXES

Effective July 4, 1993, WLR Foods, Inc. adopted SFAS 109.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts resulting from 
applying the federal statutory tax rates (35% for fiscal years 1995 and 1994 
and 34% for 1993) to earnings before income taxes and minority interest as 
follows for fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993:

At the adoption of SFAS 109 management determined a valuation allowance was 
unnecessary, and during fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1994, no valuation allowance 
was recorded. Based on the Company's historical earnings, future expectations
of taxable income, the reversing of gross deferred tax liabilities and 
potential net operating loss carrybacks, management believes that it is more 
likely than not that the Company will realize the gross deferred tax assets.

The sources of deferred income taxes and their related tax effects are as 
follows for fiscal year 1993:

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE

In February 1994, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 
Shareholder Protection Rights Plan (the Plan)  wherein one right
attaches to and trades with each share of common stock.  Each right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company, at an
exercise price of $45.33, the number of shares of common stock or
participating preferred stock having a market value of twice the
exercise price.  Such participating preferred stock is designed to
have economic and voting terms similar to those of one share of common
stock. Rights will separate from the common stock and become
exercisable following the earlier of 1) the date a person or group
acquires 15% or more of the outstanding stock, or 2) the tenth
business day (or such later date the Board may decide) after any
person commences a tender offer that would result in such person or
group holding a total of 15% or more of the common stock.
Additionally, rights owned by the acquiring person or group would
automatically become void. 

If a person or group acquires between 15% and 50% of the outstanding
common stock, the Board may, in lieu of allowing rights to be
exercised, require each outstanding right to be exchanged for one
share of common stock or participating preferred stock.

A provision in the Plan allows for rights holders to acquire stock of
the acquiring person or group, in the event a change of control of the
Company has occurred. 

The rights are redeemable by the Company at $0.01 per right prior to
becoming exercisable and expire 10 years from issuance. 

WLR Foods has 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, with
17,297,671 shares outstanding on July 1, 1995 and 16,513,992
outstanding on July 2, 1994. Additionally, there are 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock authorized with none outstanding as of July 1, 1995
or July 2, 1994. 

The Common Stock Subject to Repurchase arises from WLR Foods
commitment to repurchase 
                                        
                                        14

the shares held by a trustee on behalf of Cuddy Farms, Inc. for
$17,750,000 in cash if Cuddy Farms has a payment default under its
credit facilities. The obligation is in effect until August 1998, at
which point the obligation is terminated. 

9. STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS 

WLR Foods Stock Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in
accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Plan which was ratified by the
shareholders of the Company on November 1, 1988.  The Plan provides
for the granting of incentive or nonqualified common stock options.
The option price under the Plan shall not be less than the fair market
value of the common shares as of the date of the grant. The options
vest over a three-year period and are exercisable at varying dates not
to exceed 10 years from the grant. 

The changes in the outstanding common shares under option for fiscal
1995, 1994, and 1993 are listed below:

At July 1, 1995  452,875 options are exercisable. 
          
On October 29, 1994, the shareholders of WLR Foods approved the Poultry 
Producer Stock Purchase Plan and amended and restated the Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan. These plans allow contract producers and employees to purchase 
stock at a 10% discount off the market price.  All shares must be held in the 
plans for a period of two years. Upon termination of employment or contract, 
participants are terminated from the respective plans.

11. Related Party Transactions 

Certain directors of WLR Foods are contract producers of live 
poultry for the Company. In addition, a WLR Foods director is a 
director/officer of a company which supplies fuel and related products 
to certain locations of the Company.  A second director provided consulting 
services to WLR Foods during each fiscal year presented.  As a result
of the August 1994 acquisition (Note 2), Cuddy Farms, Inc.  became a related 
party. The 1995 transactions include poult purchases and feed sales to 
Cuddy Farms, Inc. at prices established when the acquisition was completed. 
The contract terms are through 1998 with extensions available.

Transactions with these related parties during the past three fiscal years 
are as follows:
          
                                       Purchases              Sales to

In management's opinion, all related party transactions are conducted under 
normal business conditions, with no preferential treatment given to related 
parties.

                              Exhibit 13.4
         Independents Auditors Report on Consolidated Financial Statements








Independent Auditors  Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
WLR Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WLR
Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 1, 1995 and July 2, 1994, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders  equity
and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period
ended July 1, 1995.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above represent fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of WLR Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 1, 1995 and
July 2, 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended July 1,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
