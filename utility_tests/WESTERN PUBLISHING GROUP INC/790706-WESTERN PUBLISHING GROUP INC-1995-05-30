    on the second anniversary of the grant.
 
(2) The options granted to Mr. Oess were immediately vested on the date

    future price appreciation of Common Stock of the Company.  The gains
    reflect a future value based upon growth at these prescribed rates.  The
    Company is not aware of any formula which will determine with reasonable
    accuracy a present value based on future unknown or volatile factors.

ITEM 13.CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS


In Fiscal 1995, the Company paid 49-50 Associates ("49-50"), a partnership in
which Mr. Bernstein is the Managing General Partner, rent for the premises
occupied by the Company's corporate headquarters.  The rental payments totalled
$78,558.  In Fiscal 1995, the Company paid P&E Properties, Inc. ("P&E
Properties"), a corporation owned by Mr. Bernstein, approximately $801,670 to
reimburse P&E Properties for the use of an airplane owned by P&E Properties. 
When commercially available flights are available to the destination, the
Company reimburses P&E Properties at the rate of the normal first class fare. 
When commercial flights are not available, the Company reimburses P&E Properties
at an amount equal to the hourly variable operating costs of the airplane, times
the number of hours of use.  The Company also reimburses P&E Properties for
out-of-pocket expenditures made by P&E Properties on the Company's behalf.

Salaries are paid by P&E Properties to Mr. Bernstein and certain other officers
whose services are rendered to P&E Properties.  Salaries paid to such persons
were not related to services performed by P&E Properties for the Company.  None
of the services  provided by P&E Properties to the Company were provided
pursuant to a written agreement.  The Company believes that the terms of its
transactions with P&E Properties were no less favorable than could have been
obtained from unaffiliated third parties on an arm's-length basis.
