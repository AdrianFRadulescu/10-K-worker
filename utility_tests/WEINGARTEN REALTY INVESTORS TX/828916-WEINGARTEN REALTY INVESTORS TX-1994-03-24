                                     PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
     General. Weingarten Realty Investors (the "Company"), an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act and its
predecessor entity began the ownership and development of shopping centers and
other commercial real estate in 1948. The Company, as of December 31, 1993,
owned or had interests in 150 developed income-producing real estate projects,
134 of which were shopping centers, located in the Houston metropolitan area and
in other parts of Texas and in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Arizona, Maine and Tennessee. The Company's other commercial real estate
projects included twelve industrial projects, three multi-family housing
properties and one office building, which serves as the Company's headquarters.
The Company's interests in these projects aggregated approximately 15.0 million
square feet of building area and 57.3 million square feet of land area. The
Company also owned interests in 24 parcels of unimproved land held for future
development which aggregated approximately 8.5 million square feet.
 
     The Company currently employs 153 persons, its principal executive offices
are located at 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008, and its phone
number is (713) 866-6000.
 
     Reorganizations. In December 1984, the Company engaged in a series of
transactions primarily designed to enable it to qualify as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes for the 1985 calendar
year and subsequent years. The Company contributed certain assets considered
unsuitable for ownership by the Company as a REIT and $3.5 million in cash to
WRI Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), a Texas corporation and a newly-formed
subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for voting and non-voting common stock of
Holdings (which was subsequently distributed to the Company's shareholders) and
$26.8 million of mortgage bonds. For additional information concerning Holdings,
refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at page 25.
 
     On March 22, 1988, the Company's shareholders approved the conversion of
the Company's form of organization from a Texas corporation to an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act. The conversion
was effected by the Company's predecessor entity, Weingarten Realty, Inc.,
transferring substantially all of its assets and liabilities to the newly-formed
Company in exchange for common shares of beneficial interest, $.03 par value
("Common Shares"), in the Company. The shareholders of the corporation received
Common Shares for their shares of Common Stock of the corporation (on a share-
for-share basis), and the trust continues the business that was previously
conducted by the corporation. The change did not affect the registrant's assets,
liabilities, management or federal income tax status as a REIT.
 
     Management Services. Through December 31, 1992, the Company contracted with
Weingarten Realty Management Company (the "Management Company"), whereby the
Management Company performed certain services for the Company as an independent
contractor. The Management Company provided leasing and management services with
respect to the operation of substantially all of the Company's properties
including collecting rent, making repairs, cleaning and providing maintenance.
In addition, the Management Company performed acquisition and development
services for the Company such as conducting feasibility studies on properties
subject to purchase, constructing additional improvements on its existing
properties, developing new properties or renovating existing improvements. The
Management Company paid all operating expenses of the properties out of the
rents collected from such properties and was required to maintain books and
records and to furnish the Company monthly and annual financial reports and
annual budgets for each property. The Management Company was paid a fee under
the management agreement for managing the Company's properties based on gross
revenues from the Company's income producing properties and was paid additional
fees for leasing services and for certain additional services specifically
requested by the Company, including market research, advertising and promotion,
development, acquisition and management information services. The Management
Company was also reimbursed for certain of its costs and expenses. The Company
continues to be "self-advised" and is now self-managed.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Management Company was acquired by the
Company, thereby allowing direct management of its properties. This transaction
was completed based on a favorable private letter ruling by the Internal Revenue
Service. It formally integrated the management personnel of the Company with
 
                                        1
<PAGE>   4
 
management personnel previously employed by the Management Company. The
combination had no material effect on the Company's operations or financial
position.
 
     Location of Properties. Historically, the Company has emphasized
investments in properties located primarily in the Houston area. Since 1987, the
Company has actively acquired properties outside of Houston. Of the Company's
174 properties which were owned as of December 31, 1993, 77 of its 150 developed
properties and 16 of its 24 parcels of unimproved land were located in the
Houston metropolitan area. In addition to these properties, the Company owned 46
developed properties and 5 parcels of unimproved land located in other parts of
Texas. Because of the Company's investments in the Houston area, as well as in
other parts of Texas, the Houston and Texas economies affect, to some degree,
the business and operations of the Company.
 
     Houston's 1993 economic performance was generally flat compared to 1992 and
performed at a lower level than the strengthening national economy. This
stagnant economic performance was due in large part to weak oil and gas prices,
energy industry consolidations, and national policy uncertainty in the health
care and aerospace industries. A deterioration in the Houston or Texas economies
could adversely affect the Company. However, the Company's centers are generally
anchored by grocery and drug stores under
long-term leases, and such types of stores tend to be less affected by economic
change.
 
     Competition. There are other developers and operators engaged in the
development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers and commercial
property who compete with the Company in its trade areas. This results in
competition for both acquisitions of existing income-producing properties and
also for prime development sites. There is also competition for tenants to
occupy the space that the Company and its competitors develop, acquire and
manage.
 
     The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
tenants in its market areas are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance
of properties and that the Company's competitive advantages include the
favorable locations of its properties, its ability to provide a retailer with
multiple locations in the Houston area with anchor tenants and its practice of
continuous maintenance and renovation of its properties.
 
     Financial Information. Certain additional financial information concerning
the Company is included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
located on pages 16 through 30 herein.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     General. In 1993, no single property accounted for more than 3.7% of the
Company's total assets or 5.6% gross revenues. Three properties, in the
aggregate, represented approximately 12.6% of the Company's gross revenues for
the year ended December 31, 1993; otherwise, none of the remaining properties
accounted for more than 2.6% of the Company's gross revenues during the same
period. The occupancy rate for all of the Company's improved properties as of
December 31, 1993 was 92.1%.
 
     Substantially all of the Company's properties are owned directly by the
Company (subject in certain cases to mortgages), although the Company's
interests in certain of its properties are held indirectly through its interests
in joint ventures or under long-term leases. In the opinion of management of the
Company, its properties are well maintained and in good repair, suitable for
their intended uses, and adequately covered by insurance.
 
     Shopping Centers. As of December 31, 1993, the Company owned, either
directly or through its interests in joint ventures, 134 shopping centers with
approximately 12.4 million square feet of building area. The shopping centers
were located predominantly in Texas with other locations in Louisiana, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Maine and Tennessee.
 
     The Company's shopping centers are primarily neighborhood and community
shopping centers which range in size from 100,000 to 400,000 square feet, as
distinguished from small strip centers which generally contain 5,000 to 25,000
square feet and from large regional enclosed malls which generally contain over
500,000 square feet. Most of the centers do not have climatized common areas but
are designed to allow retail customers to park their automobiles in close
proximity to any retailer in the center. The Company's centers are customarily
constructed of masonry, steel and glass and all have lighted, paved parking
areas which are typically landscaped with berms, trees and shrubs. They are
generally located at major intersections in close proximity to neighborhoods
which have existing populations sufficient to support retail activities of the
types conducted in the Company's centers.
 
     The Company has approximately 2,600 separate leases with approximately
1,900 different tenants in its portfolio, including national and regional
supermarket chains, other nationally or regionally known stores (including drug
stores, discount department stores, junior department stores and catalog stores)
and a great variety of other regional and local retailers. The large number of
locations offered by the Company and the types of traditional anchor tenants
help attract prospective new tenants. National and regional supermarket chains
which are tenants in the Company's centers include Albertsons, Fiesta, Fleming
Foods, HEB, Kroger Supermarkets, Market Basket, Price-Lo, Randalls Food Markets,
Rice Food Markets and Super Value Supermarkets. In addition to these supermarket
chains, the Company's nationally and regionally known retail store tenants
include Eckerd and Walgreen drugstores; K-Mart and Wal-Mart discount stores;
Beall's, Palais Royal and Weiner's junior department stores; MacFrugals,
Marshall's, Office Depot, Solo Serve, 50-Off and T.J. Maxx off-price specialty
stores; Luby's, Piccadilly and Wyatt cafeterias; Academy, Oshman's and
SportsTown sporting goods; Service Merchandise catalog stores; and the following
restaurant chains: Arby's, Boston Chicken, Burger King, Champ's, Church's Fried
Chicken, Dairy Queen, Domino's, Jack-in-the-Box, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Long
John Silver's, McDonald's, Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse, Pizza Hut,
Shoney's, Steak & Ale, Taco Bell and What-a-burger. The Company also leases
space in 3,000 to 10,000 square foot areas to national chains such as
Clothestime, The Gap, One Price Stores, Payless Shoes (a division of the May
Company) and Radio Shack (McDuff's).
 
     The Company's shopping center leases have lease terms generally ranging
from three to five years for tenant space under 5,000 square feet and from 10 to
35 years for tenant space over 10,000 square feet. Leases with primary lease
terms in excess of 10 years, generally for anchor and out-parcels, frequently
contain renewal options which allow the tenant to extend the term of the lease
for one or more additional periods, each such period generally being of a
shorter duration than the primary lease term. The rental rates paid during a
renewal period are generally based upon the rental rate for the primary term,
sometimes adjusted for inflation or for the amount of the tenant's sales during
the primary term.
 
     Most of the Company's leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of
fixed minimum rentals, the tenants' pro rata share of ad valorem taxes,
insurance (including fire and extended coverage, rent insurance and liability
insurance) and common area maintenance for the center (based on estimates of the
costs for such
 
                                        8
<PAGE>   11
 
items) and for the payment of additional rentals based on a percentage of the
tenants' sales ("percentage rentals"). Utilities are generally paid directly by
tenants except where common metering exists with respect to a center, in which
case the Company makes the payments for the utilities and is reimbursed by the
tenants on a monthly basis. Generally, the Company's leases prohibit the tenant
from assigning or subletting its space and require the tenant to use its space
for the purpose designated in its lease agreement and to operate its business on
a continuous basis. Certain of the lease agreements with major tenants contain
modifications of these basic provisions in view of the financial condition,
stability or desirability of such tenants. Where a tenant is granted the right
to assign or sublet its space, the lease agreement generally provides that the
original lessee will remain liable for the payment of the lease obligations
under such lease agreement.
 
     During 1993, the Company added approximately 1.2 million square feet to its
portfolio of shopping center properties through the acquisition of properties
and another 148,000 square feet of space through development. The acquisitions
were primarily focused in the Houston area. However, during the year, the
Company entered two new markets -- El Paso, which complements its West Texas and
Albuquerque holdings, and Phoenix, Arizona, which represents an opportunity to
gain a significant presence in a growing metropolitan area.
 
     Industrial Properties. The Company currently owns a total of twelve
industrial projects, all located in the greater Houston area. These projects
include 40 buildings having a total of 2.3 million square feet of building area
situated on 5.6 million square feet of land. These figures include the Company's
interests in a joint venture. Major tenants of the Company's industrial
properties include Advo (a leading direct mail advertising company), Pepsico's
PFS division, Stone Container Corporation, Iron Mountain Records Storage and
Paul Arpin Van Lines.
 
     Four of such buildings, containing approximately 642,000 square feet of
building space, are located in the Railwood Industrial Park, a master-planned
industrial park in northeast Houston, which offers full utilities, loading docks
and rail service in an architecturally controlled environment.
 
     During 1993, the Company acquired one project representing 68,000 square
feet of office/service space. This center is located in Houston and had an
average occupancy of 26% at the time of the acquisition.
 
     Office Building. The Company owns a seven-story, 121,000 square foot
masonry office building with a detached, covered, three-level parking garage
situated on 171,000 square feet of land fronting on North Loop 610 West in
Houston. The building serves as the Company's corporate headquarters. Other than
the Company, the major tenant of the building is Charter Bank, which occupies
22%.
 
     Multi-family Residential Properties. The Company owns, through joint
venture interests, three apartment projects located in Houston and San Antonio,
Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana. The Company's percentage ownership represents
approximately 283 units of the projects' aggregate 833 units. All are garden-
type projects complemented by landscaping, recreational areas and adequate
parking. These projects are managed by our joint venture partners, all of whom
are experienced apartment operators.
 
     Unimproved Land. The Company owns, directly or through its interest in
joint ventures, 24 parcels of unimproved land aggregating approximately 8.5
million square feet of land area located in Texas and Louisiana. These
properties include approximately 5.6 million square feet of land adjacent to
certain of the Company's existing developed properties, which may be used for
expansion of these developments, as well as approximately 2.9 million square
feet of land which may be used for new development. Almost all of these
unimproved properties are served by roads and utilities and are ready for
development. Most of these parcels are suitable for development as shopping
centers, and the Company intends to emphasize the development of these parcels
for such purpose.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to its business, to which the Company is a party
or to which any of its properties is subject.

Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and the Comparative Summary of
Selected Financial Data appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results
and percentage relationships on the Statements of Consolidated Income, including
trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future
operations.
 
FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
 
     The Company's total debt decreased $95.9 million to $147.7 million at
December 31, 1993, compared to $243.6 million at the end of 1992. This
significant reduction in debt between years was primarily the result of the
Company's decision to call all $123.0 million of outstanding convertible note
and debenture issues during 1993. The issues were converted into 3.9 million
common shares, all of which had a beneficial anti-dilutive effect on earnings
per share.
 
     During March 1993, the Company raised $113.0 million of new capital through
an equity offering of 2.8 million common shares. Although a large portion of
these proceeds was initially used to reduce short-term
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   15
 
revolving credit debt, the proceeds were ultimately the primary source of the
Company's capital needs for the year. During 1993, approximately $96.0 million
was invested in new assets, consisting of acquisitions totaling 1.3 million
square feet, the development of new shopping centers and capital improvements to
existing properties.
 
     The Company had an average cost of debt for 1993 of 8.1% and its current
debt structure provides protection against future interest rate fluctuations.
The $92.2 million of floating-rate debt currently in place is covered by virtue
of $40.0 million of interest rate swap contracts (extending out 8-11 years) and
the existing option of liquidating the $51.4 million of government securities
and reducing a like amount of debt. As a result of the conversion of all
outstanding convertible notes and debentures into equity and the common share
offering, the Company's financial position and capital structure is the
strongest in its history.
 
LIQUIDITY
 
     The Company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will
continue to provide adequate capital for all principal payments as well as
dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements, and that cash on hand,
borrowings under its existing credit facilities, and the use of project
financing as well as other debt and equity alternatives will provide the
necessary capital to achieve growth. Cash flow from operating activities as
reported in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows increased to $57.6 million
for 1993 from $38.3 million for 1992.
 
     The Company satisfied its REIT requirement of distributing at least 95% of
ordinary taxable income with dividend distributions of $52.3 million in 1993.
Accordingly, federal income taxes were not provided. The Company's dividend
payout ratio for the year approximated 90% of the 1993 funds from operations
(defined as net income plus depreciation, amortization and extraordinary charge,
less gains on sales of property and securities). Recently, the Company's Board
of Trust Managers approved an increase in the quarterly dividend per common
share from $.54 to $.57.
 
     As of December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately $59.7 million
available under its $100 million revolving credit facilities. The Company also
has a substantial number of operating properties which are currently free of
debt or other restrictions, thereby providing a collateral base for future
borrowings. More importantly, the Company's extremely low debt-to-equity ratio
subsequent to the capital restructuring discussed above affords it a wide range
of alternatives in the financial markets to fund future capital needs.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The Company considers funds from operations to be the most appropriate
measure of the performance of an equity REIT since such measure does not
recognize depreciation and amortization expenses as operating expenses.
Management believes that reduction for these charges are not meaningful in
evaluating income-producing real estate, which historically has not depreciated.
 
COMPARISON OF 1993 TO 1992
 
     Net income increased $16.2 million, or 80.5%, to $36.2 million ($1.50 per
share) in 1993 from $20.1 million ($1.15 per share) in 1992. Funds from
operations increased $17.3 million, or 42.4%, to $58.0 million in 1993 from
$40.7 million in 1992. These significant increases realized between comparative
years relate to the Company's shopping center acquisitions during the past two
years, as well as a substantial decrease in interest expense achieved through
the conversion into equity of all the convertible issues outstanding at the
start of 1993.
 
     Rental revenues were $94.2 million for 1993 as compared to $83.2 million
for 1992. The $11.0 million difference represents a 13.2% increase. New
properties added through the Company's acquisition and new development programs
contributed a significant part of this increase.
 
     Interest income increased $1.9 million in 1993 as compared with 1992,
primarily because the Company had significantly more funds invested in
government securities in 1993 than it did in 1992. The funds invested during
1993 represented a portion of the proceeds derived from a public offering during
March of 1993. The
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   16
 
increase in interest income was also due to $.4 million more interest received
from WRI Holdings, Inc. on the Hospitality mortgage bonds, due to its improved
cash flow from its hotel operations. The Company did not recognize interest
income from various other debt with WRI Holdings, Inc. of approximately $5.2
million and $4.9 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.
 
     The $.8 million increase in other income between years is due, in part, to
additional income recorded with respect to the Company's unconsolidated equity
investment in real estate properties. Since the fourth quarter of 1992, the
Company has increased its investment in joint ventures accounted for using the
equity method, resulting in this increase. The increase in other income is also
due to certain management fee income relating primarily to the non-owned portion
of the Company's joint venture investments, as the Company became self-managed
at the beginning of 1993 (more fully explained below).
 
     Interest expense decreased $8.6 million in 1993 to $10.0 million, as
compared to $18.7 million in 1992, primarily because average debt outstanding
during the year decreased $129.2 million, from $267.7 million in 1992 to $138.5
million in 1993. This significant reduction in average debt outstanding was
achieved by the use of proceeds from the Company's last two public offerings and
the conversion of all of the Company's outstanding convertible debt issues into
equity. The conversion of the convertible notes and debentures during 1993 is
expected to further decrease interest expense by $3.1 million and increase net
income by a like amount for 1994.
 
     The reduction in interest expense for the year was partially offset by the
Company's $40 million in interest rate swap contracts. Although these
instruments provide rate protection for the long-term (8.1% for 8-11 years),
they penalized the 1993 results of operations with $1.0 million of additional
interest expense. During the year, the Company had an average of only $18.5
million of floating rate debt outstanding, thus leaving approximately $21.5
million of unmatched interest rate swaps. The reduction in interest expense was
also partially offset by a $.9 million decrease in the amount of interest which
was capitalized during the year (thus serving to increase interest expense). The
significant portion of this change in capitalized interest ($.7 million) relates
to certain tracts of land under development, which, as of the end of 1992, had
reached their net realizable value.
 
     Depreciation and amortization was $23.4 million for 1993 and $21.3 million
for 1992 and operating expenses were $17.3 million for 1993 and $14.6 million
for 1992. This aggregate $4.8 million increase was primarily due to property
additions made by the Company during the past two years. Ad valorem taxes
charged to operations increased $1.5 million to $12.9 million in 1993 from $11.4
million in 1992, also as the result of the property additions mentioned above.
 
     Gains on sales of property and securities for 1993 relate to gains realized
as the results of fires at two of the Company's properties. The fires had no
material impact on the Company's current earnings.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, Weingarten Realty Management Company (the
"Management Company"), a separate but related company, was acquired by the
Company, thus allowing direct management of the Company's properties. The
Company also performs property management services for joint ventures in which
it participates. The acquisition had no material financial effect on the Company
because the additional salaries paid as a result of the merger were offset by
the various management fees no longer being paid to the Management Company.
 
     Beginning in the first quarter of 1994, the Company will adopt Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, which requires that marketable
securities be carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market. The adoption of
this standard will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
 
COMPARISON OF 1992 TO 1991
 
     Net income increased $2.1 million, or 11.8%, to $20.1 million ($1.15 per
share) in 1992 from $18.0 million ($1.08 per share) in 1991. Funds from
operations increased $4.4 million, or 12.0% to $40.7 million in 1992 from $36.4
million in 1991, primarily due to increased rental revenues.
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   17
 
     Rental revenues were $83.2 million for 1992 as compared to $74.5 million
for 1991. The $8.7 million difference represents an 11.8% increase. New
properties added through the Company's acquisition and development programs
contributed $6.7 million of the increase. The remainder stems from existing
properties and relates to increases in minimum rentals on renewals and increases
in reimbursements of ad valorem taxes and other operating expenses.
 
     Interest income decreased approximately $1.9 million in 1992 as compared
with 1991, primarily because of less interest income from the government
securities. The Company's remaining investment of $17.3 million in these
securities was sold at the end of the second quarter of 1992, after having been
held during all of 1991. These securities were sold because management had
concluded that the gain associated with this investment had been maximized. The
Company did not recognize interest income from various debt with an affiliate of
approximately $4.9 million and $4.7 million in 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
     The $.5 million increase in other income between years related primarily to
lease cancellation income, most of which was received during the second quarter
of 1992 as the result of a settlement with a prior tenant. The remainder of the
positive change in this line item was due to increased income recorded with
respect to the Company's unconsolidated equity investments in real estate
properties.
 
     Interest expense decreased $1.5 million in 1992 to $18.7 million, as
compared to $20.2 million in 1991. Of this decrease, $1.0 million related to a
decrease in average rate from 8.2% in 1991 to 7.8% in 1992. The remainder is due
to an increase in capitalized interest associated with the increased development
activity experienced by the Company. Average debt outstanding was relatively
stable between years in spite of the capital expenditures previously mentioned,
due to the $82.1 million of new proceeds associated with the 2 million common
share offering and the sale of the Company's remaining investment in government
securities.
 
     Depreciation and amortization was $21.3 million for 1992 and $19.0 million
for 1991 and operating expenses were $14.6 million for 1992 and $12.6 million
for 1991. This aggregate $4.3 million increase was primarily due to property
additions made by the Company during the past two years. Ad valorem taxes
charged to operations increased to $11.4 million in 1992 from $9.5 million in
1991. The $1.9 million increase was due to property additions as well as tax
rate increases.
 
     The increase between years of $.5 million in general and administrative
expenses was due to increases in executive compensation, professional fees and
state income taxes.
 
     The $1.8 million gains on sales property and securities is the result of a
$1.3 million gain realized upon the sale of the Company's remaining $17.3
million investment in government securities coupled with gains associated with
the sale of two small tracts of unimproved land. The extraordinary charge of
$1.2 million consisted of prepayment penalties incurred as a result of the
Company's election to pay off a number of its permanent loans.
 
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
 
     The rate of inflation remained modest during 1993 and, as such, was
inconsequential to the Company's operations. The Company has structured its
leases, however, in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should
significant inflation occur. Most of the leases contain percentage rent
provisions with the Company to receive rentals based on the tenants' gross
sales. Many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of
the leases through escalation provisions. In addition, many of the Company's
leases are for terms of less than ten years, which allows the Company to adjust
rental to changing market conditions when the leases expire. Most of the
Company's leases require the tenant to pay a large portion of operating
expenses. As a result of these lease provisions, increases due to inflation, as
well as tax rate increases which are usually anticipated to occur, generally do
not have a significant adverse effect upon the Company's operating results.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
 
                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
Weingarten Realty Investors:
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weingarten
Realty Investors as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of
consolidated income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Weingarten Realty Investors at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Operations of Weingarten Realty Investors, a Texas business trust, consist
of one business segment -- acquiring, developing and leasing of real estate,
primarily anchored shopping centers, in Texas and throughout the southwestern
part of the United States. The Company currently operates and intends to operate
in the future as a real estate investment trust ("REIT").
 
     Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
subsidiaries and its interest in 50% or more-owned joint ventures and
partnerships. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Joint ventures which are less than 50% owned are accounted for using
the equity method.
 
     Carrying charges, principally interest and ad valorem taxes, of land under
development and buildings under construction are capitalized as part of projects
under development and buildings and improvements to the extent that such charges
do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value.
 
     Property is carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method, generally over estimated useful
lives of 18-50 years for buildings and 10-20 years for parking lot surfacing and
equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed. Major replacements are
capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation is
removed from the accounts.
 
     Marketable debt securities, consisting of U.S. government agency guaranteed
pass-through certificates and U.S. Treasury Notes, are carried at amortized
cost. Premiums and discounts are amortized (accreted) to operations over the
estimated remaining lives of the securities using the constant yield method.
 
     Federal income taxes are not provided because the Company believes it
qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and,
therefore, applicable taxable income is included in the taxable income to its
shareholders. As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 95% of its
ordinary taxable income to its shareholders and meet certain other requirements.
Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes
principally because of differences in the timing of recognition of interest, ad
valorem taxes, depreciation, rental revenue and installment gains on sales of
property.
 
     Unamortized debt and lease costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the debt and over the lives of leases, respectively.
 
     Rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the
life of the lease for operating leases and over the lease terms using the
interest method for direct financing leases. Contingent rentals (payments for
taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessees and for an amount based on a
percentage of the tenants' sales) are estimated and accrued over the lease year.
 
     Income per common share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period and excludes the negligible dilutive
effect of shares issuable in connection with share options and awards.
 
     Cash flows are computed using the indirect method. For cash flow purposes,
the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of less
than three months as cash equivalents.
 
     Dollar amounts presented in the tabulations in the notes to consolidated
financial statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except per share
amounts.

     Principal due in the next five years (excluding amounts due under interim
debt), in millions, is $.8 in 1994, $.5 in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and $.6 in 1998.
The Company made cash payments for interest on debt, net of amounts capitalized,
in millions, of $9.4 in 1993, $18.3 in 1992 and $19.8 in 1991.
 
     At December 31, 1993, property under direct financing leases and other
property with carrying values aggregating $328 million and current and future
rentals from these properties and leases were used as collateral for the
Company's debt.
 
     Various debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, the most restrictive
of which requires the Company to produce annual consolidated distributable cash
flow, as defined in the applicable debt agreements, of not less than 170% of
interest payments, to limit the payment of dividends to no more than 95% of such
annual consolidated distributable cash flow and to limit short term debt (as
defined) to the greater of 33% of total debt or $75 million. Management believes
that the Company is in compliance with all restrictive covenants.
 
  Permanent and Interim Debt
 
     The Company generally classifies debt as permanent if the debt is payable
over an initial period of more than ten years and as interim if the debt is
payable over five years or less. Interim debt is typically used to provide funds
for the acquisition or development of properties, and is replaced by permanent
debt, subject to availability and relative costs.
 
     The Company has a revolving credit agreement with a bank for $80 million,
available through June 2004. Under the agreement, the lender has the option to
call and convert the outstanding debt to a term loan that would be payable over
approximately four years. During 1993, the balance outstanding under the
agreement
 
                                       22
<PAGE>   25
 
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
averaged about $14.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%; and
the maximum balance outstanding under the agreement was $62.5 million.
 
     The Company also has an additional $20 million revolving credit agreement
with another bank, available through May 1994. Funds advanced under the
agreement generally bear interest at the federal funds rate plus one percent,
without any obligation to maintain collected balances. Upon termination of the
agreement, the outstanding amount may be converted to a term loan payable over a
two-year period.
 
     During 1993, the balance outstanding under the agreement averaged $4.2
million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. The maximum balance
outstanding under the agreement was $20 million.
 
     These revolving credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and
conditions and do not materially restrict the Company's activities.
 
     In 1992, the Company purchased $40 million of interest rate swap contracts
which fix the average effective interest rate of an equal amount under the
Company's revolving credit agreements at an estimated 8.1% for periods maturing
in 2001 and 2004. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement up to
the $40 million notional amount of the interest rate swaps are not callable by
the lender as long as the swaps are owned by the Company. The Company is
currently paying a higher rate of interest than it is receiving under the swap
agreements, and thus currently has no financial exposure in the unlikely event
of default by the counterparty.
 
  Convertible Notes and Debentures
 
     In 1993, the Company converted all of its convertible notes and debentures
into common shares of beneficial interest. A total of 3.9 million shares were
issued during the year related to these conversions. Had all of the debt been
converted as of January 1, 1993, net income per common share would have been
$1.55 per share for the year ended December 31, 1993.

NOTE 4. LEASING OPERATIONS
 
  Leasing Arrangements
 
     The Company's lease terms range from less than one year for smaller tenant
spaces to thirty-five years for larger tenant spaces. In addition to minimum
lease payments, most of the leases provide for contingent rentals.
 
  Rentals under Operating Leases
 
     Future minimum rental income from non-cancelable operating leases at
December 31, 1993, in millions, is: $75.5 in 1994; $67.2 in 1995; $58.1 in 1996;
$49.1 in 1997; $42.4 in 1998 and $277.9 thereafter. The future minimum rental
amounts do not include estimates for contingent rentals. Such contingent
rentals, in millions, aggregated $21.4 in 1993, $19.5 in 1992 and $16.5 in 1991.

     At December 31, 1993, minimum lease payments to be received in each of the
five succeeding years, in millions, are: $1.9 in 1994 and 1995; $1.8 in 1996 and
1997 and $1.7 in 1998. The future minimum lease payments do not include amounts
for contingent rentals; contingent rental income on properties leased under
direct financing leases, in millions, was $.6 in 1993, $.8 in 1992 and $.6 in
1991.
 
NOTE 5. LEASE COMMITMENTS
 
  Operating Leases
 
     The Company leases land and a shopping center from the owners, and then
subleases these properties to other parties. Future minimum rentals under these
operating leases, in millions, are: $1.2 in 1994; $1.3 in 1995; $1.2 in 1996;
$1.1 in 1997; $1.0 in 1998 and $15.4 thereafter.
 
     Future minimum rental payments on these leases have not been reduced by
future minimum sublease rentals aggregating $15.8 million through 2017 that are
due under various noncancelable subleases. The following summarizes total rental
expenses and sublease rental revenue (excluding amounts for improvements
constructed by the Company on the leased land):

</TABLE>
 
  Capital Leases
 
     Leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and benefits of
ownership associated with the underlying property to the Company are considered
capital leases, and the present value of the required lease payments are
recorded as property and the related debt is recorded as obligations under
capital leases. The debt is amortized as each lease payment is made. Property
under capital leases, consisting of a shopping center aggregating $6.5 million,
is included in buildings and improvements at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
 
     Future minimum lease payments under these capital leases total $12.7
million, with annual payments due of $.6 million in 1994 through 1998, and $9.7
million thereafter. The amount of these total payments representing interest is
$6.4 million. Accordingly, the present value of the net minimum lease payments
is $6.1 million at December 31, 1993.
 
     The Company subleases this property to other parties. The minimum lease
payments discussed above have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals
aggregating $3.4 million due under non-cancelable

subleases. Minimum sublease rentals do not include estimates for contingent
rentals that aggregated $.2 million in 1993 and 1992 and $.1 million in 1991.
 
NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
     The Company and Weingarten Realty Management Company (the "Management
Company") were related parties during 1991 and 1992 because, prior to January 1,
1993, the Management Company was owned by directors and shareholders of the
Company. As the Company had only a few employees, its operations were primarily
performed by employees of the Management Company through a contract to lease,
manage and develop the Company's properties. The Company and WRI Holdings, Inc.
("Holdings") are related parties because they share certain directors and are
under common management. See Note 8 for related party information about
Holdings.
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the assets of the Management Company, which were
not material in relation to the Company's consolidated balance sheet, were
acquired by the Company through the assumption of less than $.1 million of net
liabilities from the shareholders of the Management Company. This event did not
have a significant effect on 1993 earnings because the additional salaries paid
as the result of this merger were offset by the various fees no longer being
paid to the Management Company.
 
     The Management Company charged the Company fees aggregating $8.3 million
and $8.0 million for 1992 and 1991, respectively, in connection with services
rendered under the management contract. Fees paid under the management contract
were generally based upon a specified percent of revenues, minimum lease rentals
of space leased and costs incurred for acquisition, construction and development
of the Company's properties. The Management Company owed the Company $1.3
million at December 31, 1992.
 
     The Company owns an interest in several joint ventures and partnerships.
Notes receivable from these entities totalled $10.1 million and $14.0 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and bear interest at 2.7% to 9.3% at
December 31, 1993 and are due at various dates through 2020.
 
     The Company's $80 million revolving credit agreement is with Texas Commerce
Bank National Association ("TCB").
 
NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
     The Company was contingently liable at December 31, 1993 for $1.2 million
of notes payable executed by various joint ventures and partnerships.
 
     The Company is committed to lend Holdings an additional $3.3 million. The
Company remains contingently liable for $1.5 million of notes payable by
Hospitality Venture which were transferred to Holdings in 1988.
 
     The Company is involved in various matters of litigation arising in the
normal course of business. While the Company is unable to predict with certainty
the amounts involved, the Company's management and counsel are of the opinion
that, when such litigation is resolved, the Company's resulting liability, if
any, will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.
 
NOTE 8. INVESTMENT IN MORTGAGE BONDS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM AN AFFILIATE
 
     Concurrent with the Company being organized as a REIT in 1984, certain
property and investments in joint ventures, which were considered to be
incompatible with a REIT's operation, and $3.5 million were transferred to
Holdings in exchange for $26.8 million of mortgage bonds. The transfer price for
the assets was based upon independent appraisals. The appraised values exceeded
the Company's carrying value of the assets; however, because Holdings is a
related party, the gain of $17.3 million was deferred by the Company. Holdings
currently owns three investments: a 50% interest in Hospitality Venture, which
owns and operates eight motor hotels in Florida and Alabama ("Hospitality");
unimproved land in a multi-use land development

</TABLE>
 
     Before 1988, Holdings was current on the payments of all interest;
accordingly, the Company had recognized interest income on all of Holdings' debt
at the stated interest pay rates. During the fourth quarter of 1988, Holdings'
cash flow and capital resources became insufficient to meet the full interest
requirements on the mortgage bonds. The accrual of interest income on the River
Pointe and Railwood mortgage bonds has been suspended and interest income on the
Hospitality mortgage bonds has been limited to Holdings' pro rata share of cash
flow from Hospitality Venture. Interest income from the mortgage bonds and notes
receivable recognized by the Company for financial reporting purposes, in
millions, aggregated $2.1 for 1993, and $1.6 for 1992 and 1991. At December 31,
1993 and 1992, accrued interest receivable from Holdings was $.4 million and $.3
million, respectively.
 
     The Company had an unrecorded receivable for interest of $22.3 million and
$17.1 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Of these amounts,
$5.4 million and $4.8 million represent the difference between the accrual rate
and the pay rate on the Railwood and River Pointe mortgage bonds at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. Interest income not recognized by the Company for
financial reporting purposes aggregated, in millions, $5.2, $4.9 and $4.7 for
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
     Management of the Company believes that the fair value of the security
collateralizing the debt from Holdings is greater than the net investment in
such debt (cost less related deferred gain) and that there would not be a charge
to operations if the Company were to foreclose on the debt. If foreclosure were
required, however, the net investment in such debt would become the Company's
basis of the repossessed assets. However, the Company does not currently
anticipate foreclosure on Holdings' properties due to certain restrictions
imposed on such assets in connection with the Company's REIT status.
Accordingly, the

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
Company's management presently does not believe that the net investment in the
mortgage bonds and notes receivable from Holdings has been impaired nor that a
reserve for any such impairment is currently required.
 
NOTE 9. SHARE OPTIONS AND AWARDS
 
     The Company has an incentive Share Option Plan (the "Plan") which expires
in December 1997. During 1991, the Company amended the Plan to add awards of
common shares of beneficial interest, at nominal cost to the recipient, in
addition to options. The Plan provides options and awards for a maximum of
500,000 common shares. The Company has an additional share option plan which
grants 100 share options to every employee of the Company, excluding officers,
upon completion of each five year interval of service. This plan, which expires
in 2002, provides options for a maximum of 100,000 common shares. For both of
the share option plans, options are granted to employees of the Company at an
exercise price equal to the quoted fair market value of the common shares on the
date the options are granted. All options and awards that are granted expire
upon termination of employment or ten years from the date of grant.
 
     Following is a summary of the option activity for the three years ended
December 31, 1993:

     During 1991, 56,000 common shares were granted as awards to certain key
officers of the Company and the Management Company. Through December 31, 1993,
42,000 of these common shares had vested and were issued; the remaining 14,000
common shares will vest in 1994. Compensation expense of $.6 million, $.4
million and $.5 million was recognized in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively,
relating to the share awards.
 
     At December 31, 1993, 238,884 common shares were available for the future
grant of options or awards and options for 123,267 shares were exercisable.
 
     On January 3, 1994, the Company issued 62,900 restricted shares and granted
434,400 share options under a compensatory Incentive Share Plan for key officers
of the Company. This plan, which expires in 2003, provides for a total of
500,000 shares, either in the form of restricted shares or options. The
restricted shares generally vest over a ten year period, with potential
acceleration of vesting due to appreciation in the market value of the Company's
shares. The share options vest over a five year period beginning two years after
the date of grant. Share options are granted at the market price at the date of
grant.

     During 1993, $123.0 million in convertible debentures and notes were
converted into 3.9 million common shares of beneficial interest. During 1992,
the Company converted $4.1 million of convertible debentures into .1 million
common shares and issued .4 million common shares valued at $14.6 million to a
partner for the purchase of the partner's interest in a joint venture. During
1991, the Company converted $3.6 million of convertible debentures into .1
million common shares and assumed $10.4 million of permanent debt in connection
with the acquisition of certain properties.
 
NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
Company, using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. However, considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market
data and develop the related estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company
could realize upon disposition of the financial instrument. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
the estimated fair value amounts.
 
     Cash and cash equivalents, accrued rent and accounts receivable, marketable
debt securities, notes receivable from joint ventures, partnerships and tenants,
interim debt and accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at amounts
which reasonably approximate their fair value.
 
     Mortgage bonds and notes receivable from an affiliate were not fair valued
because it is not practicable to reasonably assess the credit adjustment that
would be applied in the marketplace for such bonds and notes receivable.
However, management of the Company believes that the fair value of the security
collateralizing such bonds and notes receivable is greater than the net
investment in such instruments (cost less related deferred gain).

<PAGE>   31
 
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     Permanent debt with carrying values of $89.0 million has fair values of
$93.8 million, which were estimated based on interest rates currently available
to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
 
     Interest rate swap agreements are valued at an estimated unrealized net
loss of $5.6 million, which represents amounts at which they could be settled,
based upon estimates obtained from dealers.
 
     The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 1993. Although management
is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair
value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes
of these financial statements since that date, and current estimates of fair
value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.
 
NOTE 13. PENSION PLAN
 
     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the assets of the
Management Company, including a defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of its employees. This plan was merged with the plan of the
Company, effective January 1, 1993. The benefit formula for both pre-existing
plans is identical to the formula for the surviving merged plan.
 
     The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's compensation
during the last five years of service. The Company's funding policy is to make
annual contributions as required by applicable regulations.
 
     The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 1993.

                         SECOND AMENDED PROMISSORY NOTE

$20,000,000.00                Houston, Texas         January 1, 1993

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and as hereinafter specified, WRI HOLDINGS, INC.,
a Texas corporation ("Maker"), promises to pay to the order of WEINGARTEN
REALTY INVESTORS, a Texas real estate investment trust ("Payee"), at 2600
Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008 (or such other address as may be
designated in writing by Payee), in lawful money of the United States of
America, which shall be legal tender for the payment of all debts, public and
private, (i) the principal sum of TWENTY MILLION and NO/100 DOLLARS
($20,000,000.00), or so much thereof as may, from time to time, be advanced by
Payee pursuant to that certain Deficit Loan Agreement dated December 28, 1984,
between Maker and Weingarten Realty, Inc. ("WRI", predecessor-in-interest of
Payee), as amended by that certain First Amendment of Deficit Loan Agreement
and Modification of Interest Rate dated November 17, 1987, effective as of
September 30, 1987, between Maker and WRI, as further amended by that certain
Second Amendment of Deficit Loan Agreement and Modification of Promissory Note
dated August 1, 1991, effective as of January 1, 1991, between Maker and Payee
(collectively, the "Deficit Loan Agreement"); (ii) interest from the date
hereof until maturity upon the balance of the principal sum remaining unpaid
from time to time (such balance being referred to herein as the "Principal
Balance") (a) to cover the Interest Difference only on the Railwood Bond and
the River Pointe Bond, at the lesser of (A) the total of the prime rate
announced from time to time by Texas Commerce Bank National Association 

                                   -1-

<PAGE>   2
plus two percentage points per annum or (B) the highest lawful rate ("Maximum 
Rate") permitted by Applicable Law (as hereinafter defined) and (b) to cover 
the Interest Difference on the Hospitality Bond, at the Maximum Rate 
permitted by Applicable Law; and (iii) interest upon all past-due principal 
and accrued interest from maturity until paid at the Maximum Rate permitted 
by Applicable Law.

         All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Payee for the use, forbearance
or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full, so that
the maximum lawful rate of interest or the maximum amount of interest that may
be charged, contracted for or received under Applicable Law on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law from
time to time in effect and applicable to the indebtedness evidenced hereby for
so long as such indebtedness is outstanding hereunder.

         The term "Applicable Law," shall mean that law in effect from time to
time and applicable to this Note which lawfully permits the charging and
collection of the highest permissible lawful, non-usurious rate of interest on
this Note, including laws of the State of Texas and laws of the United States
of America. It is intended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Star. Ann., Art. 5069-1.04, as
amended, shall be included in the laws of the State of Texas in determining
Applicable Law, and for the purpose of applying said Article 5069-1.04 to this
Note, it is agreed between Maker and Payee that the interest ceiling applicable
to this Note under said Article 5069-1.04 shall be 

                                  -2-

<PAGE>   3
the quarterly rate ceiling. In no event shall the provisions of Article 5069 
Ch 15 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas (which regulates certain revolving 
credit loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts) apply to the loan 
evidenced hereby.

         The entire unpaid Principal Balance, together with all accrued, unpaid
interest thereon, shall be finally due and payable on the 28th day of December,
2004 if not sooner paid (the "Maturity Date"), and with interest computed from
and after the Maturity Date at the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law,
until all amounts due hereunder are paid in full.

         The Maker of this Note shall have the right to prepay all or any
portion of the Principal Balance of this Note at any time without notice or any
prepayment penalty. Any amounts so prepaid shall be applied, first, to accrued
interest and, next, to principal coming due in the inverse order of maturity.

         This Note shall be accelerated and become immediately due and payable,
at the option of the Payee or other holder hereof, without presentment, demand,
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or any other notice
(other than the notice set forth herein) to the Maker or any other person
obligated or to become obligated hereon upon default continuing for a period of
ten (10) calendar days after receipt of written notice to Maker of a particular
event of default then existing in the payment of any sum due hereon or default
continuing for a period of twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of written
notice to Maker of a particular event of default then existing under the terms
of any of the Security Instruments (hereafter referred to). Any notice provided
for hereunder shall be deemed to be delivered three (3) calendar days after
being deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, 

                                     -3-
<PAGE>   4

Certified Mail, return receipt requested, addressed to Maker at Maker's address 
given below, or at such other address as such party may have theretofore 
delivered in accordance herewith. Notice may also be given by telegram, 
messenger service or other personal delivery, and shall be deemed to be 
delivered when received.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Note, Payee
or other holder hereof may, at its option, without presentment or demand or any
further notice (other than as expressly set forth in the following sentence) to
the Maker or any other person obligated hereon, declare this Note, and all sums
due and payable hereunder, immediately due and payable, at any time after the
28th day of December, 1994. Payee or such other holder hereof shall deliver to
Maker or such other person obligated or to become obligated hereon notice of
such election to accelerate the maturity of this Note as provided for in the
immediately preceding sentence, by delivering to such Maker or other person
obligated hereon six (6) months' prior written notice thereof, such notice to
be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions hereinabove provided.

         Except as hereinabove expressly set forth, the Maker and all sureties,
guarantors and endorsers of this Note (i) waive demand, notice of intent to
accelerate, notice of acceleration, grace, protest, notice of protest and
presentment, and all other notices (except as otherwise expressly provided for
herein), (ii) agree that the Payee or other holder hereof shall not be required
first to institute suit or exhaust its remedies hereon against the Maker or
others liable to or to become liable hereon in order to enforce payment of this
Note by them, (iii) agree and consent that this Note may be renewed and the
time of payment extended, without notice and without 
                               
                               -4-
<PAGE>   5

releasing any of said parties, (iv) agree that the failure to exercise any 
option or election herein upon the occurrence of any event of default shall 
not be construed as a waiver of the right to exercise such option or election 
at any later date or upon the occurrence of a subsequent event of default, 
(v) agree that, without any notice, Payee may from time to time agree to 
substitute, exchange or release any part or parts of the property and interests 
securing the payment of this Note, with or without consideration, and 
(vi) agree that, without any notice, Payee may from time to time agree to any 
substitution, exchange or release of any party primarily or secondarily liable 
hereon.

         If this Note is collected by suit, through probate or bankruptcy court
or any other judicial proceedings, after default by the Maker, or if this Note
is not paid at maturity, howsoever such maturity may be brought about, and is
thereafter placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, then the Maker
promises to pay, as attorney's fees, and in addition to all other amounts owing
hereunder, a reasonable sum not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
Principal Balance and accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the time this Note
is placed in the hands of such attorney.

         Any action brought on this Note or the agreements or instruments
securing the same, regardless of where brought, shall be determined under the
laws of the State of Texas (and applicable federal law). All obligations
performable with respect to this Note shall be performable in Harris County,
Texas.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the apparent contrary herein
contained, it is expressly provided that in no case or event shall the
aggregate of (i) all "interest" on the unpaid Principal Balance, accrued or
paid from the date hereof 
                              -5-
<PAGE>   6
through the date of such calculation, and (ii) the aggregate of any other 
amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this Note or any other instrument 
evidencing, related to or securing this Note, which under Applicable Law, 
is or may be deemed to constitute interest upon the debt evidenced hereby 
from the date hereof through the date of such calculation, ever exceed the 
Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law on the Principal Balance of the debt 
evidenced by this Note from time to time remaining unpaid. In this connection 
it is expressly stipulated and agreed that it is the intent of the Payee and 
the Maker in the execution and delivery of this Note, and all other instruments 
evidencing or securing the indebtedness constituting this debt, to contract 
in strict compliance with Applicable Law from time to time in effect. In 
furtherance thereof, none of the terms of this Note, or any other such 
instruments, evidencing, related to or securing this Note, shall ever be 
construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for use, forbearance or
detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate permitted
by Applicable Law. The Maker or any guarantors, endorsers or other parties now
or hereafter becoming liable for the payment of this Note or any other
indebtedness incurred incident to this debt shall never be liable for interest
in excess of the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law, and the provisions
of this paragraph shall control over any other provisions of this Note, or any
other instrument evidencing, related to or securing this debt which may be in
apparent conflict herewith.


         Specifically and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it
is expressly provided that if under any circumstances the aggregate amounts
contracted for, charged or received on this Note prior to and incident to the
final maturity 
                                -6-
<PAGE>   7
include amounts which by law are deemed interest and which would exceed the 
maximum amount of interest which could lawfully have been collected on this 
debt, Maker stipulates that such amounts collected would have been and will be 
deemed to have been the results of a mathematical error on the part of both 
the Maker and holder of the Note, and that the party receiving such excess
payment if any has been received shall promptly refund the amount of such
excess (to the extent only of the excess of such interest payments above the
maximum amount which could lawfully have been contracted for, charged or
received) upon discovery of such error by the party receiving such payment. It
is hereby expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of both Maker and
holder to at all times comply with Applicable Law relating to this Note and the
instruments securing it, now or hereafter in effect, and any subsequent
judicial interpretation thereof to the extent that same are made applicable
thereto.

         This Note amends, restates, extends and renews that certain Promissory
Note, dated December 28, 1984, in the principal sum of Seven Million and No/100
Dollars ($7,000,000) ("Original Note") as amended, restated, extended and
renewed by that certain First Amended Promissory Note dated effective as of
January 1, 1991, in the principal sum of Ten Million and No/100 Dollars
($10,000,000.00) (the "First Amended Note") and extends and renews all advances
made pursuant to the Original Note and the First Amended Note. This Note is

                                FIRST AMENDMENT
                                       TO
                      AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT


         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT (the
"First Amendment") executed  9/1, 1993, but effective as of January 22, 1993,
is made by and between Weingarten Realty Investors (the "Trust"), a Texas real
estate investment trust which is the successor in interest to Weingarten
Realty, Inc. (the "Company "), a former Texas corporation, and Texas Commerce
Bank National Association (the "Bank"), a national banking association with its
principal place of business in Houston, Harris County, Texas.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Company and the Bank were parties to that certain Amended
and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of February 5, 1986 which agreement
amended and restated certain loan agreements between the Company and the Bank
dated November 29, 1984 and August 15, 1977 respectively;

         WHEREAS, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement was amended by that
certain First Amendment dated December 30, 1987 between the Company and the
Bank, by that certain Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement,
effective as of April 5, 1988 between the Trust and the Bank, by that certain
Waiver and Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated June 7,
1989 between the Trust and the Bank and by that certain Fourth Amendment to
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of March 30, 1990 between the
Trust and the Bank, and was amended and restated in its entirety by that
certain Amended and Restated Loan Agreement executed January 22, 1993 between
the Trust and the Bank (as so amended and restated, hereinafter referred to as
the "Loan Agreement");

         WHEREAS, the Trust has requested and the Bank has agreed, subject to
the terms and conditions of this First Amendment, that the facility fee payable
under Section 7.3 of the Loan Agreement be reduced from $300,000 per annum to
$250,000 per annum, and the Trust and the Bank therefore wish to amend the Loan
Agreement to, among other things, reflect such agreement that the facility fee
be so reduced;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Trust and the Bank hereby
agree as follows:

         1.  All capitalized terms which are defined in the Loan Agreement and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning herein as in the Loan
Agreement.
<PAGE>   2
         2.  Section 7.1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
said Section in its entirety and by inserting in lieu thereof the following:

                 7.1  Appraisal Fee. The Trust agrees to pay to the Bank a fee
         equal to the cost paid by the Bank to a third-party appraiser for each
         appraisal (a) obtained by the Bank pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section
         5.3, (b) on each Additional Property prior to its addition to the
         Borrowing Base and (c) that the Bank is required to obtain under the
         provisions of any law applicable to the Bank (including, without
         limitation, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
         Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended from time to time) or pursuant to
         the Bank's internal credit policies; provided however that in no event
         shall the Trust be obligated to pay an appraisal fee as to any
         particular Property more than once in any 24-month period unless the
         provisions of any such laws, or the Bank's internal credit policies
         applied to similar credits, require appraisal more often. The Bank
         shall provide to the Trust a list of proposed appraisers from which
         the Trust shall select an appraiser to perform such appraisals.  
         
         3. Section 7.3 of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety
and the following is hereby substituted in lieu thereof:

                 7.3  Facility Fee. The Trust agrees to pay to the Bank a
         facility fee on the Bank's commitment to make Revolving Credit Loans
         under Section 1.1 hereof or Facility II Loans under Section 3.1 hereof
         (whether or not principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Note or
         the Facility II Note are outstanding from time to time) in the amount
         of $250,000 per annum from January 22, 1993 until the Expiration Date,
         payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each April, July,
         October and January (but calculated with reference to the quarters
         ending on the last day of each March, June, September and December)
         during the term of this Agreement and on the Expiration Date; provided
         that, on such payment dates, a credit shall be applied in respect of
         the Trust's payment of the facility fee in an amount equal to (i) (A)
         the sum of the average collected balances for such period in all of
         the demand deposit accounts at the Bank included in the Weingarten
         relationship (which accounts shall be determined by the Bank in its
         sole discretion), less (B) balances required to support cash
         management fees not theretofore paid to the Bank in cash with respect
         to such accounts for such period (such balances to be computed in a
         manner consistent with the other calculations made pursuant to this
         Section 7.3) less (C) balances required to satisfy FDIC reserve
         requirements with respect to such accounts for such period,times (ii)
         the Earnings Credit Rate in effect at the time of determination;
         further provided that if such credit is not fully utilized in any such
         quarter, it may be carried forward and applied toward future payments
         of the facility fee for an additional four quarters, with the oldest
         credit being applied first toward such payment. For 
         
                                    -2-
<PAGE>   3
         
         example, if the total credit for the quarter ending June 1993 is 
         $100,000, no portion of the facility fee shall be payable in such 
         quarter and the $37,500 remaining credit which was not utilized in 
         such quarter may be carried forward and utilized until March 1994.
         
         4.  Section 9.3 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
said Section in its entirety and by inserting in lieu thereof the following:

                     9.3  Liens. At or prior to the date of each borrowing
         hereunder, the Bank shall have received (a) one or more deeds of trust
         or mortgages or supplements to deeds of trust or mortgages
         ("Mortgages") in form and substance acceptable to the Bank granting to
         the Bank a first lien on each item of Borrowing Base Property, (b) an
         opinion as to (i) the proper recordation of the Mortgage, (ii) the
         creation of a valid, binding and perfected lien on the property
         described in the Mortgage and (iii) the enforceability of the
         Mortgage, which opinion shall be in form and substance satisfactory to
         the Bank and prepared by attorneys approved by the Bank, (c) unless the
         provisions of Section 14 hereof are applicable, a mortgagee's policy
         of title insurance, satisfactory to the Bank showing that each such
         lien is a first lien subject to no exceptions other than for
         mechanics' and materialmen's liens (in the case of Borrowing Base
         Property upon which improvements are being constructed), and customary
         utility easements, rights-of-way, restrictions and the like which do
         not materially detract from the value or impair the use of such
         Borrowing Base Property, taxes not yet due or payable, leases existing
         at the time the Property is designated as Borrowing Base Property to
         tenants for space in such improvements, if any, and other minor
         matters acceptable to the Bank in its sole discretion, (d) or
         alternatively, if the provisions of Section 14 hereof are applicable,
         (i) a title commitment or title report (or a supplemental abstract of
         title) prepared through the time of recordation of the applicable
         Mortgages and (ii) a title opinion in form and substance satisfactory
         to the Bank, prepared by attorneys approved by the Bank, provided,
         however, that within a reasonable time following written demand
         therefor by the Bank, the Trust will furnish, and thereafter maintain
         in effect, mortgagee's title insurance policies on all Borrowing Base
         Properties in amounts at least equal to 75% of the values thereof;
         (e) a survey of each such Borrowing Base Property acceptable to the
         Bank, (f) an appraisal of each such Borrowing Base Property and (g)
         certificates of insurance evidencing a policy or policies of insurance
         on each Property included in the Borrowing Base Property, as required
         under Section 10.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
         all such documentation required to be delivered under this Section 9.3
         shall be delivered to the Bank on or before 60 days after the date of
         designation of any Additional Property as Borrowing Base Property
         pursuant to Section 5.4, 6.1, or 6.6 hereof.

                                                            Exhibit 10.18.1
                   
                   AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

         This Agreement and Amendment to Loan Agreement (this "Amendment")
dated as of March 31, 1993 between WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS (the
"Borrower"), a Texas real estate investment trust, and BARCLAYS BANK PLC (the
"Lender"), an English banking organization acting through its New York branch,
which has been authorized to do business in the State of New York;'

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

         WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Lender executed and delivered that
certain Loan Agreement (as amended and supplemented to the date hereof, the
"Loan Agreement") dated as of October 1, 1990; and

         WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Lender desire to amend the Loan
Agreement to (a) extend the Termination Date to June 1, 1994; (b) provide that
the Borrower will pay a commitment fee of 1/8% per annum on the difference
between the Revolving Commitment and the outstanding principal balance of the
Revolving Note; (c) provide that the Loans will be secured by perfected first
priority Liens on real Property with a value (as determined by the Lender in
its sole discretion) such that the ratio of the outstanding Loans to such value
will not exceed 65%; (d) establish a mechanism for the periodic appraisal of
such real Property; (e) modify the mechanism for the extension of the
Termination Date, and (f) amend the Loan Agreement in certain other respects;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements, representations and warranties herein set forth, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the Borrower and the Lender do hereby agree as follows:

         Section 1. The following definitions contained in Section 1 of the Loan
Agreement are hereby each amended to provide as follows:

                 Loan Documents shall mean this Agreement, the Notes, the Deeds
         of Trust, the Guaranty, all instruments, certificates and agreements
         now or hereafter executed or delivered to the Lender pursuant to any
         of the foregoing, and all amendments, modifications, renewals,
         extensions, increases and rearrangements of, and substitutions for,
         any of the foregoing.

                 Termination Date shall mean the earlier of (a) the date
         specified by the Lender in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof or (b)
         June 1, 1994; provided that if (1) the Borrower executes, acknowledges
         and delivers to the Lender multiple originals (at least one set for
         each Deed of Trust then existing, with one of such set for the 
         
<PAGE>   2

         Lender and one of such set for the Borrower) of a Renewal and Extension
         Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C during the March
         immediately preceding the then-current Termination Date and (2) the
         Lender executes, acknowledges and delivers to the Borrower one of such
         Renewal and Extension Agreements on or before the April 30 immediately
         before the then-current Termination Date, then the scheduled
         Termination Date shall be extended by one year.  Neither the Borrower
         nor the Lender shall be obligated to execute, acknowledge or deliver
         any Renewal and Extension Agreement, but each may do so at its sole
         discretion and the failure of either the Borrower or the Lender to
         execute, deliver and acknowledge any Renewal and Extension Agreement
         shall mean that the Termination Date shall not be extended by
         operation of this definition.

         Section 2. section 1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to add
thereto the following definitions:

                 Deed of Trust shall mean an instrument substantially
         in the form of Exhibit D and completed such that it is in Proper Form;
         provided that if the Property intended to be covered thereby is
         located in a jurisdiction other than the State of Texas, then the Deed
         of Trust covering such Property shall be an instrument in Proper Form.

                 Loan to Value Ratio shall mean, as of any date, the ratio
         (expressed as a percentage) of (a) the outstanding principal balance 
         of the Loans outstanding on such date to (b) the aggregate Value of 
         the Mortgaged Properties on such date.

                 Mortgaged Property shall mean all Property, whether now 
         existing or hereafter acquired, which is or is to become subject to 
         the Liens of a Deed of Trust; provided that such Property shall not 
         be considered "Mortgaged Property" for purposes of this Agreement 
         (although it shall still be subject to the Liens of the Deed of Trust)
         unless the Borrower shall have delivered to the Lender a legal opinion
         of independent counsel to the Borrower (or other evidence reasonably 
         satisfactory to the Lender) in Proper Form stating that the Lien of 
         such Deed of Trust is a perfected first priority Lien.

                 Value shall mean the fair market value of any Mortgaged 
         Property, as determined by the Lender from time to time in its sole 
         and absolute discretion. Each determination by the Lender of the 
         Value of a Mortgaged Property shall be binding and conclusive.

                                          -2-

<PAGE>   3
         Section 3. There are hereby added to the Loan Agreement new Sections
2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8, which shall provide in their entirety as follows:

                2.5. Commitment Fee.   In consideration of the Revolving
         Commitment, the Borrower agrees to pay a commitment fee (computed on
         the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year composed of
         360 days) of 1/8% per annum on the daily average difference between
         the Revolving Commitment and the outstanding principal balance of the
         Revolving Note, such fee to be due and payable in arrears on the last
         Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Termination Date. 
         All past due commitment fees shall bear interest at the Past Due Rate.

                2.6. Mortgaged Properties. The obligations of the Borrower
         under the Loan Documents shall be secured by Deeds of Trust on
         Mortgaged Properties selected by the Borrower. The Borrower may add
         Mortgaged Properties at any time and from time to time. The Borrower
         may request that the Lender release any Mortgaged Property at any time
         and from time to time, and the Lender shall promptly execute and
         acknowledge a release in Proper Form and deliver it to the Borrower,
         all at the Borrower's expense, if (a) the Loan to Value Ratio would
         not exceed after giving effect to such release and (b) no Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing.

                2.7. Appraisals. From time to time and at any time, the Lender
         shall determine the Value of such Mortgaged Property and give notice
         to the Borrower of such Value. The Borrower shall pay the Lender a fee
         of $1,500 plus the Lender's out-of-pocket travel costs in connection
         with each such determination, and such fee and expenses shall be due
         and payable five Business Days after presentation to the Borrower of a
         statement therefor; provided that the Lender shall present only one
         such statement with respect to a particular Mortgaged Property in any
         12-month period. Each determination of the Value of a Mortgaged
         Property by the Lender shall be for the Lender's exclusive benefit,
         and the Borrower shall not-and shall not allow any other Person to--
         rely upon such determination in any manner, and the Borrower will
         indemnify and hold the Lender harmless from all such reliance by the
         Borrower or any other Person.

                2.8. Loan to Value Ratio. Notwithstanding anything in any Loan
         Document to the contrary, the Lender shall have no obligation to make
         any Loan if the Loan to Value Ratio would exceed 65% after the making
         of such Loan. Furthermore, if the Loan to Value Ratio ever exceeds
         70%, then the Borrower shall prepay the Loans such that the Loan to
         Value Ratio does not exceed 65%; such prepayment shall be due and
         payable five Business Days after the 
         
                                          -3-

<PAGE>   4
         
         Lender gives the Borrower notice that the Loan to Value Ratio exceeds 
         65% (which notice may be implied by the Borrower's receipt of a notice 
         setting forth the value of a Mortgaged Property) and shall be applied 
         as set forth in the Note. Each such prepayment shall be applied first 
         to that portion of the Note bearing interest at the Fed Funds Rate 
         plus 1%, and then, notwithstanding the order of payment specified in 
         Section 2.4 hereof, to those portions of the Note bearing interest at 
         Quoted Rates in such order as will minimize the aggregate prepayment 
         premiums (as determined in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof) due in 
         connection with such prepayment.

         Section 4. Section 3.3 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to read
in its entirety as follows:

                 3.3. Term Loan. In addition to the matters described in
         Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, the obligation of the Lender to make the
         Term Loan is subject to the receipt by the Lender of the following,
         all duly executed and in Proper Form:  (a) the Term Note; (b)
         instruments supplementing all then-existing Deeds of Trust to provide
         that the Deeds of Trust now secure the Term Note; (c) a Secretary's
         Certificate from the Borrower; (d) a written statement from the
         Guarantors confirming that the Term Note is guaranteed by the
         Guaranty, and (e) a legal opinion from independent counsel for the
         Borrower acceptable to the Lender and to the effects set forth on
         Exhibit G.

         Section 5. Section 6.7(c) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:

                 (c) Investments in its Subsidiaries acquired after the date
         hereof, provided that each such Subsidiary (1) is directly or
         indirectly wholly owned by the Borrower and (2) executes a Guaranty
         Joinder, substantially in the form of Exhibit I, within 30 days after
         the date of such acquisition,

         Section 6. Exhibits. Exhibits C and D and Appendix II to the Loan
Agreement are hereby deleted, and there are hereby substituted therefor new
Exhibits C and D and Appendix II, which shall be identical to Exhibits C and D
and Appendix II, attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof.  There is
hereby added to the Loan Agreement a new Exhibit I, which shall be identical to
Exhibit I, attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof.

         Section 7. Conditions. This Amendment shall not become effective
until the Borrower shall have delivered to the Lender each of the following:

                 (a) a Secretary's Certificate of the Borrower;

                                -4-

<PAGE>   5
                 (b)  a writing from the Guarantors confirming that the
         Guaranty continues to guarantee the obligations of the Borrower under
         the Loan Documents; and

                 (c)  such other documents and information as the Lender may
         reasonably request.

         Section 8. Representations True; No Default.  The Borrower represents
and warrants that the representations and warranties contained in the Loan
Documents (after giving effect to any written disclosures delivered to the
Lender contemporaneously with the execution of this Amendment) are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof as though made on
and as of such date.  The Borrower hereby certifies that no event has occurred
and is continuing which constitutes a Default or an Event of Default.

         Section 9. Ratification. Except as expressly amended hereby, the Loan
Documents shall remain in full force and effect. The Loan Agreement, as hereby
amended, and all rights and powers created thereby or thereunder and under the
other Loan Documents are in all respects ratified and confirmed and remain in
full force and effect.

         Section 10. Definitions and References. Any term used herein which is
defined in the Loan Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall have the
meaning therein ascribed to it. The terms "Agreement" and "Loan Agreement" as
used in the Loan Documents or any other instrument, document or writing
furnished to the Lender by the Borrower and referring to the Loan Agreement
shall mean the Loan Agreement as hereby amended.

         Section 11. Expenses; Additional Information. The Borrower shall pay
to the Lender all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the execution
of this Amendment. The Borrower shall furnish to the Lender all such other

         Section 12. REIT. The Borrower is an unincorporated trust organized
under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act, as amended (the "Act").  The
obligations and liabilities of the Borrower created under the Loan Documents
shall be binding upon the Borrower only as a trust under the Act, and only upon
the Property of the Borrower. None of the shareholders, managers, officers,
employees or agents of the Borrower or holders of any beneficial interest in
the Borrower shall have any personal liability, in any manner whatsoever, for
the payment of any monies or the performance of the agreements made by the
Borrower under the Loan Documents.

         Section 13. Miscellaneous. This Amendment (a) shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lender and their respective
successors, assigns, receivers and trustees (provided that the Borrower shall
not assign its rights hereunder without the express prior written consent of
the Lender);
                                 -5-

<PAGE>   6
         (b) may be modified or amended only by a writing signed by each party;
(c) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Texas and the United States of America; (d) may be executed in several
counterparts, and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each
counterpart, when so executed and delivered, shall constitute an original
agreement, and all such separate counterparts shall constitute but one and the
same agreement, and (e) together with the other Loan Documents, embodies the
entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, consents and
understandings relating to such subject matter. The headings herein shall be
accorded no significance in interpreting this Amendment.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower and the Lender have caused this
Amendment to be signed by their respective duly authorized officers, effective
as of the date first above written.

authorized to do business in the State of New York;

                          W I T N E S S E T H :

             WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Lender executed and delivered that
certain Loan Agreement (as amended, supplemented and restated, the "Loan
Agreement") dated as of October 1, 1990;

             WHEREAS, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Borrower made that
certain promissory note (as renewed, extended and rearranged, the "Note") of
even date therewith and in the maximum principal amount of TWENTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($20,000,000.00);

             WHEREAS, the obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Agreement
and the Note are secured, among other security, by those certain instruments

described (including recordation data) on Annex I, attached hereto and hereby
made a part hereof; reference is here made to the Deeds of Trust for a
description of the collateral for such obligations and for all other purposes;

             WHEREAS, all of the liens, security interests, assignments and
other encumbrances securing such obligations, including but not limited to
those created by the Deeds of Trust, are referred to herein as the "Liens;"

             WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Lender desire to (a) extend the

agreements herein set forth, the Borrower and the Lender hereby agree as
follows:

             1.  Extension.  The stated maturity of the Note is hereby extended

COUNTY OF HARRIS


             THAT WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS ("Mortgagor"), a Texas real
estate investment trust, of 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Harris County,
Texas 77008, in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($10.00) to it in hand
paid by David J. Palans of 2425 West Loop South, Suite 1000, Houston, Harris
County, Texas 77027, hereinafter called "Trustee," the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, and of the further consideration, uses, purposes and
trusts herein set forth and declared, have GRANTED, SOLD and CONVEYED, and by
these presents do GRANT, SELL and CONVEY unto the Trustee, and also to the
Successor and Substitute Trustee as hereinafter provided, all of the following
described property, to wit:

             All those certain tracts or parcels of land which are more
particularly described in Exhibit A which is attached hereto and incorporated
by reference herein for all purposes, together with all improvements heretofore
or hereafter placed thereon by Mortgagor, including all heating, lighting,
cooling, ventilating, air conditioning, gas, electric and other fixtures and

also all leases, rentals, royalties, bonuses and income therefrom and together
with any after-acquired title of Mortgagor to the above described lands and
premises, and all and singular the rights and appurtenances to the same
belonging or in anywise incident or appertaining.  Mortgagor is the record

             The above-described property is subject to leases, if any,
covering tenants-in-possession, easements, if any, liens, if any, and all other

             TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the above described property and premises,
together with all and singular the rights, privileges, tenements, hereditaments
and appurtenances thereto in anywise incident or belonging unto the Trustee and
to his successors or substitutes in the Trust and unto his and their assigns
forever; hereby covenanting and agreeing to forever warrant and defend the
premises aforesaid and every part thereof unto the Trustee, his successors,
substitutes and assigns, against all persons whomsoever lawfully claiming or to
claim the same or any part thereof, for and upon thee following uses, trusts,
terms and conditions, to-wit:

<PAGE>   12
             WHEREAS, Mortgagor and BARCLAYS BANK PLC ("Mortgagee"), an English
banking organization operating through its New York Branch, 222 Broadway, 10th
Floor, New York, New York County, New York 10038, are parties to that certain
Loan Agreement (as the same has been and may hereafter be amended, supplemented
and restated, the "Loan Agreement") dated as of October 1, 1990;

             WHEREAS, Mortgagor has executed in favor of Mortgagee that certain
promissory note dated October 1, 1990, in the maximum principal amount of
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ($20,000,000.00), bearing interest at the rates therein
stated, principal and interest payable to the order of Mortgagee on the dates
stated therein and with a final scheduled maturity of June 1, 199 , which note,
together with all renewals, extensions, amendments, modifications and
replacements thereof and any other note that may be executed pursuant to the
Loan Agreement, is herein collectively called the "Note"; and

             WHEREAS, this conveyance is made for the security and enforcement
of the payment of the Note and indebtedness which may arise under this Deed of
Trust or under the Loan Agreement, all of the foregoing being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "indebtedness";

             Now, should the indebtedness, both principal and interest, be
promptly paid as the same shall become due and payable and should Mortgagor
strictly comply with all the conditions, requirements and agreements herein
provided, then this conveyance shall become null and of no further force and
effect, and shall be released at the cost and expense of Mortgagor.  But if
default is made in the punctual payment of the indebtedness, or any part
thereof, principal or interest, as the same shall become due and payable, or
should Mortgagor in any respect fail to promptly keep and perform any one or
more of the conditions, requirements or agreements herein provided to be kept
and performed by it, then, and in any such case, the whole amount of any
indebtedness remaining unpaid, shall, at the option of any holder or holders
thereof (or any part thereof) immediately mature and become payable; and
thereupon, or any time thereafter while the indebtedness or any part thereof
remains unpaid, it shall be the duty of the Trustee, on the request of any
holder or holders of the indebtedness or any part thereof (which request is
hereby presumed), to enforce this Trust; and after advertising the time, place
and terms of the sale for at least 21 days before the date of sale, by (a)
posting or causing to be posted written or printed notices thereof at the
courthouse door of each county wherein said real estate or any part thereof is
situated, and (b) filing or causing to be filed written or printed notices
thereof with the County Clerk of each county wherein said real estate or any
part thereof is situated, to sell the property hereby mortgaged, either as an
entirety or in parcels as the Trustee may elect (all rights to a marshalling of
assets or sale in inverse order of alienation being hereby waived) at a public
sale at auction at the courthouse of any county wherein the mortgaged
                                      -2-
                                   EXHIBIT D

real property or some part or parcel thereof may be situated (whether the parts
or parcels thereof, if any, in different counties are contiguous or not) on the
first Tuesday in any month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., to
the highest bidder for cash, and make due conveyance to the purchaser or
purchasers with general warranty, and the title to such purchaser or
purchasers, when so made by the Trustee, Mortgagor binds itself and its
successors, assigns, trustees and receivers to warrant and forever defend.  The
provisions hereof with respect to posting, filing and giving notices of sale
are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 51.002 of the Texas
Property Code as in force and effect on January 1, 1988, and in the event the
requirement for any notice under such Section 51.002 shall be eliminated or the
prescribed manner of giving same modified by future amendment to, or adoption
of any statute superseding such Section 51.002, the requirement for such
particular notice shall be deemed stricken from or modified in this Deed of
Trust in conformity with such amendment or superseding statute, effective as of
the effective date of same. The manner herein prescribed for serving or giving
any notice, other than that to be posted or caused to be posted by the Trustee,
shall not be deemed exclusive but such notice or notices may be given in any
other manner which may be permitted by applicable law. With the money arising
from such sale, the Trustee shall pay, first, all the expenses of advertising,
sale and conveyance, including a commission of five percent to himself, and
shall then pay to the holder or holders of the indebtedness the full amount of
principal and interest due and unpaid thereon, and the balance, if any, shall
be paid to Mortgagor, its successors, assigns, trustees and receivers; and said
sale shall forever be a perpetual bar against Mortgagor, its successors,
assigns, trustees and receivers and all other persons claiming by, through or
under any of them.  It is expressly agreed that all recitals in the conveyance
to the purchaser shall be conclusive evidence of the truth of the matters
therein stated, and all prerequisites to the sale shall be presumed to have
been performed. No notice of such sale or sales other than herein provided need
be given to Mortgagor or any other person.

             In case of the absence, death, inability, refusal or failure of
the Trustee herein named to act, or if Mortgagee shall desire, with or without
cause, to replace the Trustee herein named, a successor and substitute may be
named, constituted and appointed by Mortgagee, without other formality than an
appointment and designation in writing; and this conveyance shall vest in him,
as Trustee, the estate and title in all said premises, property and rights, and
he shall thereupon hold, possess and execute all the title, rights, powers and
duties herein conferred upon said Trustee named, and his conveyance to the
purchaser shall be equally valid and effective; and such right to appoint a
successor or substitute Trustee shall exist with respect to any successor and
substitute Trustee as well as the initial Trustee named herein. Mortgagee or
other holders of the indebtedness or any part thereof shall have equal right to
become purchaser at any Trustee's sale, being the

                                      -3-

highest bidder.  The right of sale hereunder shall be continuing and may be
exercised successively until all indebtedness secured hereby is paid or until
all the property included herein is sold.

             If foreclosure should be commenced by the Trustee, Mortgagee may
at any time before the sale direct the Trustee to abandon the sale, and may at
any time or times thereafter direct the Trustee to again commence foreclosure,
or Mortgagee may institute suit for the collection of all or any part of the
indebtedness and foreclosure of the lien of this Deed of Trust.  If Mortgagee
should institute suit for collection of said indebtedness and foreclosure of
the lien of this Deed of Trust, it may at any time before the entry of final
judgment dismiss the same, and require the Trustee to sell the property in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

             Mortgagor hereby ASSIGNS and TRANSFERS to Mortgagee all rents,
revenues and income from the mortgaged property, including all rents now due or
which may hereafter become due under all leases thereof, whether written or
verbal, now existing or hereafter made, as additional security for the
indebtedness secured hereby, and Mortgagee is given a prior and continuing lien
thereon. Mortgagor hereby appoints Mortgagee as its attorney to collect said
rents, revenues and income with or without suit, and apply same, less expenses
of collection, to said indebtedness, in such manner as Mortgagee may elect;
provided that except for collection of rents more than one month in advance of
when they become due and for the modification or cancellation of any lease
(subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Addendum) without the written
consent of Mortgagee, Mortgagor may exercise all acts of ownership and collect
all rents, revenues and income as if this instrument had not been executed
until a default occurs under the provisions of this instrument.  Mortgagee does
not assume and shall not be liable in respect of any obligation of the lessor
under any of said leases, and no liability shall attach to Mortgagee for
failure or inability to collect any rents, revenues and incomes hereby
assigned. Mortgagor shall not collect any rents under any of said leases more
than one month in advance of the time when they become due and will not modify
or cancel any of said leases (subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 of the
Addendum) without the express prior written consent of Mortgagee.

             Mortgagor covenants and agrees that so long as any of the
indebtedness remains unpaid they shall and will at their own cost and expense,
keep the property and premises herein described in good repair and condition,
and pay and discharge as they are or may become payable, and before they become
delinquent, any and all taxes and assessments that are or may become payable
thereon under any law, ordinance, or regulation, whether made by Federal,
State, Municipal or other lawful authority, and shall keep said property
insured against loss by fire, storm, gas explosion (if gas be used on said
premises) and other hazards and contingencies as may be required (both as to
amount and type of coverage) by Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of said
indebtedness, in a company or
                                     -4-

companies approved by Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of said
indebtedness, to whom the loss, if any, shall be payable and by whom the
policies shall be kept and shall promptly pay all bills for labor and materials
incurred in connection with the mortgaged property and shall never permit to be
fixed against the mortgaged property any lien even though inferior to the lien
hereof.  Due proof of payment before delinquency of all such taxes, assessments
and insurance premiums shall be furnished by Mortgagor to Mortgagee promptly
upon the making of such payments. And in case of default by Mortgagor in the
performance of any of the foregoing stipulations, and without waiving the right
to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness secured hereby because of such
default, the same may be performed by Mortgagee, or any other holder or holders
of said indebtedness or any part thereof for the account and at the expense of
the Mortgagor and any and all expenses incurred and paid in so doing shall be
payable by Mortgagor to Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of the
indebtedness or any part thereof incurring such expense, on demand with
interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date when the same was
so incurred or paid, and shall stand secured by and under this Deed of Trust in
like manner with the other indebtedness herein mentioned, and the amount and
nature of such expenses and time when paid shall be held fully established by
the affidavit of the Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of said indebtedness
or any part thereof or of his or their agent, or by certificate of any Trustee
acting hereunder.

             Should Mortgagor become insolvent or bankrupt; or should a
receiver of its property be appointed; or should Mortgagor intentionally damage
or attempt to remove any improvements upon said mortgaged real estate; or
should it be discovered after the execution and delivery of this Deed of Trust
that there is a defect in the title of or a lien or encumbrance of any nature
on said property prior to the lien hereof in favor of or for the benefit of any
person other than Mortgagee, or in case of an error or defect in the Loan
Agreement, the Note or this Deed of Trust or in the execution or the
acknowledgement thereof, or if a homestead claim be set up to said property or
any part thereof adverse to this Trust, and if Mortgagor shall fail for thirty
days after demand by Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of said
indebtedness, to correct such defects in the title or remove any such lien or
encumbrance of homestead claim, or to correct any error in said notes or this
Deed of Trust or its execution; then, upon any such default, failure or
contingency Mortgagee, or other holder or holders of said indebtedness, or any
part thereof shall have the option or right, without notice or demand, to
declare all or said indebtedness then remaining unpaid, immediately due and
payable and may immediately or at any time thereafter foreclose this Deed of
Trust by the power of sale herein contained or by suit, as such Mortgagee, or
other holder or holders of said indebtedness may elect.

             It is expressly agreed that any indebtedness at any time secured
hereby may be extended, rearranged or renewed, and that any part of the
security herein described may be waived or released without in anywise
altering, varying or diminishing the force, effect or lien of this Deed of
Trust; and this Deed of Trust shall continue as a first lien on all said lands
and premises and other property and rights covered hereby and not expressly
released, until all sums with interest and charges hereby secured are fully
paid; and no other security now existing or hereafter taken to secure the
payment of said indebtedness or any part thereof shall in any manner be
impaired or affected by the executing of this Deed of Trust; and no security
subsequently taken by Mortgagee or other holder or holders of said indebtedness
shall in any manner impair or affect the security given by this Deed of Trust;
and all security for the payment of said indebtedness of any part thereof shall
be taken, considered and held as cumulative.

             If any of the terms or provisions hereof or of any notes or other
evidence of the indebtedness secured hereby is susceptible of being construed
as binding or obligating Mortgagor or any other persons or concerns obligated,
either primarily or conditionally, for the payment of indebtedness secured
hereby, under any circumstances or contingencies whatsoever, to pay interest
in excess of that authorized by law, it is agreed that such terms or provisions
are a mistake in calculation or wording and, notwithstanding the same, it is
expressly agreed that neither Mortgagor nor any other person or concern
obligated in any manner on any such indebtedness shall ever be required or
obligated under the terms hereof, or under the terms of any such notes or other
evidence of the indebtedness or otherwise, to pay interest in excess of that
authorized by law.

             Mortgagor agrees for itself and any and all persons or concerns
claiming by, through or under it, that, if they or any one or more of them
shall hold possession of the above-described property or any part thereof
subsequent to foreclosure hereunder, they, or the parties so holding
possession, shall become and be considered as tenants at will of the purchaser
or purchasers at such foreclosure sale; and any such tenant failing or refusing
to surrender possession upon demand shall be guilty of forcible detainer and
shall be liable to such purchaser or purchasers for reasonable rental on said
premises, and shall be subject to eviction and removal, forcible or otherwise,
with or without process of law, and all damages which may be sustained by any
such tenant as a result thereof being hereby expressly waived.

             Mortgagor covenants and represents that the property hereinabove
mentioned and conveyed to the Trustee herein forms no part of any property
owned, used or claimed by it as a residence or a business homestead, or as
otherwise exempt from forced sale under the laws of the State of Texas.

             Mortgagor will not at any time insist upon or plead or in any
manner whatever claim or take the benefit or advantage of any stay or extension
law now or at any time hereafter in force in any locality where the mortgaged
property or any part thereof may or shall be situated nor will it claim, take
or insist on any benefit or advantage from any law, now or hereafter in force,
providing for the valuation or appraisement of the mortgaged property or any
part thereof before any sale or sales thereof to be made pursuant to any
provision herein contained, or to the decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, nor after any such sale or sales will they claim or exercise any
right conferred by any law now or at any time hereafter in force to redeem the
property so sold or any part thereof, and it hereby expressly waives all
benefit and advantage of any such law or laws, and waives the appraisement of
the mortgaged property or any part thereof, and it covenants that it will not
hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted and delegated
to the Trustee, but that it will suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law or laws had been made or enacted.

             Without limiting any of the provisions of this Deed of Trust,
Mortgagor, as Debtor, and referred to in this paragraph as "Debtor", expressly
GRANTS unto Mortgagee as Secured Party (and in this paragraph called "Secured
Party"), a security interest in all the properties hereinabove described
(including both those now and those hereafter existing) to the full extent that
such properties may be subject to the Texas Uniform Commercial Code (the
"UCC"). The security interest granted hereby also covers and includes all
contract rights, general intangibles and accounts (excluding, of course, bank
deposits) with respect to said properties and all products and proceeds of said
properties (said properties, contract rights, products and proceeds being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collateral" for the purposes of
this paragraph). Debtor covenants and agrees with Secured Party that:

             (a)  In addition to and cumulative of any other remedies granted
in this Deed of Trust to Secured Party or Trustee, Secured Party or Trustee
may, in event of default, proceed under the UCC as to all or any part of the
Collateral and shall have and may exercise with respect to the Collateral all
the rights, remedies and powers of a secured party under the UCC, including,
without limitation, the right and power to sell, at public or private sale or
sales, or otherwise dispose of, lease or use the Collateral and any part or
parts thereof in any manner authorized or permitted under the UCC after default
by a debtor, and to apply the proceeds thereof toward payment of any costs and
expenses and attorney's fees and legal expenses thereby incurred by Secured
Party, and toward payment of the indebtedness in such order or manner as
Secured Party may elect. Among the rights of Secured Party in the event of
default, and without limitation, Secured Party shall have the right to take
possession of the Collateral and to enter upon any premises where the same may
be situated for such purpose without being deemed guilty of trespass and
without liability for

                                      -7-
                                   EXHIBIT D

damages thereby occasioned, and to take any action deemed necessary or
appropriate or desirable by Secured Party, at its option and in its discretion,
to repair, refurbish or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale, lease or
other use or disposition as herein authorized. To the extent not prohibited by
law, Debtor expressly waives any notice of sale or other disposition of the
Collateral and any other rights or remedies of a debtor or formalities
prescribed by law relative to sale or disposition of the Collateral or exercise
of any other right or remedy of Secured Party existing after default hereunder;
and to the extent any such notice is required and cannot be waived, Debtor
agrees that if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor at the address
designated at the beginning of this Deed of Trust at least five days before the
time of the sale or disposition, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and
shall fully satisfy any requirement for giving of said notice.

             (b)  Secured Party is expressly granted the right, at its option,
to transfer at any time to itself or its nominee the Collateral, or any part
thereof, and to receive the monies, income, proceeds or benefits attributable
or accruing thereto and to hold the same as security for the indebtedness or to
apply it on the principal and interest or other amounts owing on any of the
indebtedness, whether or not then due, in such order or manner as Secured Party
may elect.  All rights to marshalling of assets of Debtor, including any such
rights with respect to the Collateral, are hereby waived.

             (c) All recitals in any instrument of assignment or any other
instrument executed by Secured Party incident to sale, transfer, assignment,
lease or other disposition or use of the Collateral or any part thereof
hereunder shall be full proof or the matters stated therein, and no other proof
shall be required to establish full legal propriety of the sale or other action
or of any fact, condition or thing incident thereto, and all prerequisites of
such sale or other action and of the fact, condition or thing incident thereto
shall be presumed conclusively to have been performed or to have occurred.

             (d)  Secured Party may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral
and make it available to Secured Party at a place to be designated by Secured
Party that is reasonably convenient to both parties.  All expenses of retaking,
holding, preparing for sale, lease or other use or disposition, selling,
leasing or otherwise using or disposing of the Collateral and the like which
are incurred or paid by Secured Party as authorized or permitted hereunder,
including also all attorneys' fees, legal expenses and costs, shall be added to

indebtedness which may arise under the Loan Agreement, now existing or
hereafter arising, including, but not limited to, the Term Note which is
described in the Loan Agreement, in the event the Term Note is executed by

                           ADDENDUM TO DEED OF TRUST

             The following provisions constitute an Addendum to a certain Deed 
of Trust and Security Agreement, dated as of       199  (the "Deed of Trust"), 
from Weingarten Realty Investors ("Mortgagor") to             , as Trustee, for
the use and benefit of Barclays Bank PLC ("Mortgagee"):

             (1)  That notwithstanding other provisions of this Mortgage, all
insurance proceeds recovered by Mortgagee on account of damage or destruction
to the premises (and all proceeds of any condemnation award recovered by
Mortgagee for any building or equipment taken or damaged), less the reasonable
cost, if any, to Mortgagee of such recovery, shall, upon the written request of
Mortgagor, be applied by Mortgagee to the payment of the cost of repairing,
restoring or rebuilding the property so damaged or destroyed or taken
(hereinafter referred to as the "work") and shall be paid out from time to time
to Mortgagor as the work progresses, but subject to the following conditions:

             (a)  In the event the cost of the work, estimated by Mortgagor,
shall exceed $10,000, the work shall be in charge of an architect or engineer
(who may be an employee of Mortgagor) and before Mortgagor commences any work,
other than temporary work to protect property or prevent interference with
business, Mortgagee shall have approved the plans and specifications for the
work to be submitted by Mortgagor, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and shall be given or deemed given if such plans and
specifications satisfy the requirements of any lease which shall have been
assigned to Mortgagee as additional security for the Note.

             (b)  Each request for payment shall be made on seven days' prior
notice to Mortgagee and shall be accompanied by a certificate to be made by
such architect or engineer, if one be required under clause (a) of this
Article, otherwise by an executive or fiscal officer of Mortgagor, stating (i)
that all of the work completed has been done in compliance with the approved
plans and specifications, if any be required under said clause (a); (ii) that
the sum requested is justly required to reimburse Mortgagor for pavements by
Mortgagor to, or is justly due to, the contractor, subcontractor,
materialmen, laborers, engineers, architects or other persons rendering
services or materials for the work (giving a brief description of such services
and materials) and that when added to all sums previously paid out by Mortgagee
does not exceed the value of the work done to the date of such certificate, and
(iii) that the amount of such proceeds remaining in the hands of Mortgagee will
be sufficient on completion of the work to pay for the same in full (giving in
such reasonable detail as Mortgagee may require an estimate of the cost of such
completion).

                                   EXHIBIT D

<PAGE>   22
             (c)  Each request shall be accompanied by waivers of lien
satisfactory to Mortgagee, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, covering
that part of the work for which payment or reimbursement is being requested and
by a search prepared by a title company or licensed abstractor or by other
evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee, in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
that there has not been filed with respect to the premises any mechanics' or
other lien or instrument for the retention of title in respect of any part or
the work nor discharged or bonded of record.

             (d) There shall be no default on the part of Mortgagor under this
Deed of Trust or the Loan Agreement.

             (e) The request for any payment after the work has been completed
shall be accompanied by a copy of any certificate or certificates required by
law to render occupancy of the premises legal.

             Upon the completion of the work and payment in full therefor, or
upon any failure on the part of Mortgagor promptly to commence to continue the
work (except in the case of brief discontinuances of ten days or less, or
in case such commencement or continuance is prevented by fire, strike, act of
God, shortage of labor or material, or other condition beyond Mortgagor's
control) or at any time upon request by Mortgagor, Mortgagee will apply the
amount of any such proceeds then or thereafter in the hands of Mortgagee to the
payment of any indebtedness secured by this Deed of Trust (to be applied first
to accrued interest, then to the last installments, without prepayment charge
or penalty); provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent Mortgagee
from applying at any time the whole or any part of such proceeds to the curing
of any default under this Deed of Trust or the Loan Agreement (if such default
shall have remained uncured within such time, if any, after notice as is
provided in such other instrument).

             (2) Mortgagor and any tenant or lessee under any lease, the
interest of the landlord or lessor under which has been collaterally assigned
to Mortgagee as additional security for the Note ("Assigned Lease") who has
such rights under such lessee's Assigned Lease, shall have the right, at its
own expense, to make such alterations, additions or changes in the improvements
on the mortgaged premises, both the interior and exterior (including without
limitation alterations and plumbing and electrical wiring), as it finds
convenient for its purposes, except that (a) such alterations, additions or
changes shall not structurally weaken the mortgaged buildings; (b) any exterior
alterations shall conform with the architecture of the mortgaged buildings;
(c) such alterations, additions or changes shall not diminish the value of the
mortgaged building; (d) all work will be done in a good and workmanlike manner,
and (e) such construction shall comply with all applicable building codes,
rules, regulations and ordinances and any provisions of any Assigned Lease or
restrictive covenants applicable to the premises affecting construction of such
alterations, additions and changes.

                                   EXHIBIT D


<PAGE>   23
             (3) This Deed of Trust is subordinate to those certain leases
(the "Assigned Leases") heretofore entered into between Mortgagor as landlord
or lessor, and certain parties as lessee or tenant, which leases cover portions
of the improvements situated on the land described herein and which leases are
assigned by this instrument to Mortgagee as additional security for the Note.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, exercise by any lessee of any right
granted to such lessee under an Assigned Lease (including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the right to make alterations or additions in such
lessee's premises) or performance by Mortgagor of any duty or obligation which
it may have as lessor under any Assigned Lease (including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, use of fire insurance proceeds or condemnation
proceeds for repair or restoration of any improvements leased under any
Assigned Lease, but not including the obligations, if any, to pay over to any
lessee any fire insurance proceeds or condemnation proceeds for the benefit of
the property or improvements of lessee) shall not be deemed to be a violation
of any provisions of this Mortgage, provided, of course, the provisions of
Paragraph 1 of this Addendum are complied with; and the provisions of this Deed
of Trust shall be deemed to permit exercise of any such right or performance of
any such obligation.

             (4) In the event of a failure by Mortgagor in the due observance
or performance of any covenant contained in this Deed of Trust, other than a
failure in the payment of any installment of principal or interest on the Note,
the Note shall not be deemed to be due and payable by reason of such failure
and such failure shall not be deemed to constitute a default thereunder unless
such failure continue for a period of 15 days after the giving of written
notice of such failure by Mortgagee to Mortgagor.

             (5) This Deed of Trust also specifically secures the performance
(other than by Mortgagee) of each and every covenant, agreement and undertaking
contained in the Loan Agreement and in those certain deeds of trust executed
pursuant to the Loan Agreement; and Mortgagor hereby expressly agrees that any
default (other than by Mortgagee) under the terms of the respective deeds of
trust securing the Note, including but not limited to any default in the
payment when due or any part of the indebtedness described therein, or any
default (other than by Mortgagee) in the performance or satisfaction of any
covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation contained in the Loan Agreement
if same is not cured within such time, if any, after notice as is provided in
such other instrument shall, for all purposes, constitute a default under the
provisions of this Deed of Trust and shall authorize the Mortgagee or other
holder or holders of the indebtedness to proceed as is the case of default in
the payment when due of such indebtedness. The term "deed of trust" as used in
this Paragraph and in any other instrument securing the indebtedness hereby
secured shall be deemed to include a mortgage in any form.

             (6) Notwithstanding  anything contained herein to the contrary,
consent of Mortgagee shall not be required for Mortgagor to execute any new
leases, or amend any existing leases, or

                                   EXHIBIT D
<PAGE>   24
terminate any leases, provided same is done in the ordinary course of
Mortgagor's business.

             (7) Reference is hereby made to the Loan Agreement for all
purposes, including Mortgagor's right to prepay the indebtedness and obtain
partial release of the collateral.

             (8) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, before any foreclosure sale pursuant to the terms and provisions of
this Deed of Trust, Mortgagee or any person chosen by it, at least 21 days
preceding the date of said sale, shall serve written notice of such proposed
sale by certified mail on each debtor obligated to pay the indebtedness and
obligations herein secured in accordance with the records of Mortgagee. Service
of such notice to each debtor shall be completed upon deposit of the notice,
enclosed in a postpaid wrapper, properly addressed to each debtor at the most
recent address as shown by the records of Mortgagee, at a post office or
official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal
Service. The affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts to the
effect that such service was completed shall be prima facie evidence of the
fact of service.

             Notice of the sale shall comply with all requirements of Section
51.002 of the Texas Property Code (as amended from time to time) and all other
applicable provisions of law. To the extent required by Section 51.002 of the
Texas Property Code (as amended from time to time), notice of the sale must
include a statement of the earliest time at which the sale will occur. The sale
must begin at the time stated in the notice of sale or not later than three
hours after that time.

             (9) With respect to the incurrence of certain liabilities
hereunder and the making of certain agreements by Mortgagor as herein stated,
such incurrence of liabilities and such agreements shall be binding upon
Mortgagor only as a trust formed under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust
Act pursuant to that certain Restated Declaration of Trust dated March 23,
1988, and only upon the assets of Mortgagor.  No Trust Manager or officer or
other holder of any beneficial interest in the Trust shall have any personal
liability for the payment of any indebtedness or other liabilities incurred by
Mortgagor hereunder or for the performance of any agreements made by Mortgagor
hereunder, nor for any other act, omission or obligation incurred by Mortgagor
or by the Trust Managers except, in the case of a Trust Manager, any liability
arising from such Trust Manager's own willful misfeasance or malfeasance or
negligence.

would constitute a default under any trust deed, deed of trust, loan agreement,
indenture or other agreement to which Maker is a party or by which Maker or any
of its property is bound. Maker hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Payee against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred as a result of any representation or
warranty made by Maker in this Section 2 proving to be untrue in any material
respect.

       3.  To the extent that the Note is inconsistent with the terms of this
Fifth Renewal, the Note is hereby modified and amended. Except as modified,
renewed and extended by this Fifth Renewal, the Note and the Security
Instruments remain unchanged and continues unabated and in full force and
effect as the valid and binding obligation of the Maker.

       4.  In conjunction with the extension, renewal and modification of the
Note and the Security Instruments, Maker hereby extends and renews the liens,
security interests, and assignments created and granted in the Security
Instruments until the indebtedness secured thereby, as so extended, renewed and
modified, has been fully paid, and agrees that such extension, renewal and
modification shall in no manner affect or impair the Note, the liens or
security interests securing same, and that said liens, security interests, and
assignments shall not in any manner be waived, the purpose of this Fifth
Renewal being simply to extend the time of payment of the loan evidenced by the
Note and any indebtedness secured by the Fifth Renewal and to carry forward all
liens and security interests securing the same, which are acknowledged by Maker
to be valid and subsisting.

       5.  Maker covenants and warrants that the Payee is not in default under
the Note, Security Instruments, or this Fifth Renewal (collectively referred to
as the "Loan Instruments") that there are no defenses, counterclaims or offsets
to such Loan Instruments; and that all of the provisions of the Loan
Instruments, as amended hereby, are in full force and effect.

       6.  Maker agrees to pay all costs incurred in connection with the
execution and consummation of this Fifth Renewal, including but not limited to,
all recording costs, the premium for an endorsement to the Mortgagee Policy of
Title Insurance insuring the validity and priority of the Original Deed of
Trust in form satisfactory to Payee, and the reasonable fees and expenses of
Payee's counsel.

       7.  If any covenant, condition, or provision herein contained is held to
be invalid by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the
invalidity of such covenant, condition, or provision shall not in any way
affect any other covenant, condition, or provision herein contained.

       8.  Payee is an unincorporated trust organized under the Texas Real
Estate Investment Trust Act. Neither the shareholders of Payee, nor its Trust
Managers, officers, employees, or other agents shall be personally,
corporately, or individually liable, in any manner whatsoever, for any debt,
act, omission, or obligation of Payee, and all persons having claims of any
kind whatsoever against Payee shall look solely to the property of Payee for
the enforcement of their rights (whether monetary or nonmonetary) against
Payee.

       EXECUTED the day and year first above written, but effective for all
purposes as of December 1, 1993.
