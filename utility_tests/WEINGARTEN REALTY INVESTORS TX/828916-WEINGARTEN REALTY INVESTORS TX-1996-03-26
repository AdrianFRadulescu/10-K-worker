ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     General.  Weingarten Realty Investors (the "Company"), an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act, and its
predecessor entity began the ownership and development of shopping centers and
other commercial real estate in 1948.  The Company is self-advised and self-
managed and, as of December 31, 1995, owned or had interests in 171 developed
income-producing real estate projects, 151 of which were shopping centers,
located in the Houston metropolitan area and in other parts of Texas and in
Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Kansas and
Nevada.  The Company's other commercial real estate projects included 17
industrial projects, two multi-family housing properties and one office
building, which serves as the Company's headquarters.  The Company's interests
in these projects aggregated approximately 18.0 million square feet of building
area and 77.1 million square feet of land area.  The Company also owned
interests in 24 parcels of unimproved land held for future development which
aggregated approximately 7.7 million square feet.

     The Company currently employs 151 persons, its principal executive offices
are located at 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008, and its phone
number is (713) 866-6000.

     Reorganizations.  In December 1984, the Company engaged in a series of
transactions primarily designed to enable it to qualify as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes for the 1985 calendar
year and subsequent years.  The Company contributed certain assets considered
unsuitable for ownership by the Company as a REIT and $3.5 million in cash to
WRI Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), a Texas corporation and a newly-formed
subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for voting and non-voting common stock of
Holdings (which was subsequently distributed to the Company's shareholders) and
$26.8 million of mortgage bonds.  For additional information concerning
Holdings, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at
page 28.

     On March 22, 1988, the Company's shareholders approved the conversion of
the Company's form of organization from a Texas corporation to an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act.  The
conversion was effected by the Company's predecessor entity, Weingarten Realty,
Inc., transferring substantially all of its assets and liabilities to the newly-
formed Company in exchange for common shares of beneficial interest, $.03 par
value ("Common Shares"), in the Company.  The shareholders of the corporation
received Common Shares for their shares of Common Stock of the corporation (on a
share-for-share basis), and the trust continues the business that was previously
conducted by the corporation.  The change did not affect the registrant's
assets, liabilities, management or federal income tax status as a REIT.

     Location of Properties.  Historically, the Company has emphasized
investments in properties located primarily in the Houston area.  Since 1987,
the Company has actively acquired properties outside of Houston.  Of the
Company's 195 properties which were owned as of December 31, 1995, 84 of its 171
developed properties and 18 of its 24 parcels of unimproved land were located in
the Houston metropolitan area.  In addition to these properties, the Company
owned 49 developed properties and 4 parcels of unimproved land located in other
parts of Texas. Because of the Company's investments in the Houston area, as
well as in other parts of Texas, the Houston and Texas economies affect, to some
degree, the business and operations of the Company.

     In 1995, the economies in Houston and Texas continued to grow, exceeding
the national average; the economy of the entire southwestern United States,
where the Company has its primary operations, also remained strong relative to
the national average.  A deterioration in the Houston or Texas economies could
adversely affect the Company.  However, the Company's centers are generally
anchored by grocery and drug stores under long-term leases, and such types of
stores, which deal in basic necessity-type items, tend to be less affected by
economic change.

                                       1

     Competition.  There are other developers and operators engaged in the
development, acquisition and operation of shopping centers and commercial
property who compete with the Company in its trade areas.  This results in
competition for both acquisitions of existing income-producing properties and
also for prime development sites. There is also competition for tenants to
occupy the space that the Company and its competitors develop, acquire and
manage.

     The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
tenants in its market areas are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance
of properties and that the Company's competitive advantages include the
favorable locations of its properties, its ability to provide a retailer with
multiple locations in the Houston area with anchor tenants and its practice of
continuous maintenance and renovation of its properties.

     Financial Information.  Certain additional financial information concerning
the Company is included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
located on pages 19 through 34 herein.

     General.  In 1995, no single property accounted for more than 3.2% of the
Company's total assets or 3.7% of gross revenues.  Three properties, in the
aggregate, represented approximately 8.5% of the Company's gross revenues for
the year ended December 31, 1995; otherwise, none of the remaining properties
accounted for more than 2.0% of the Company's gross revenues during the same
period.  The occupancy rate for all of the Company's improved properties as of
December 31, 1995 was 92.4%.

     Substantially all of the Company's properties are owned directly by the
Company (subject in certain cases to mortgages), although the Company's
interests in certain of its properties are held indirectly through its interests
in joint ventures or under long-term leases.  In the opinion of management of
the Company, its properties are well maintained and in good repair, suitable for
their intended uses, and adequately covered by insurance.

     Shopping Centers.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company owned, either
directly or through its interests in joint ventures, 151 shopping centers with
approximately 15.0 million square feet of building area.  The shopping centers
were located predominantly in Texas with other locations in Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Arizona, New Mexico, Maine, Tennessee, Nevada and Kansas.

     The Company's shopping centers are primarily community shopping centers
which range in size from 100,000 to 400,000 square feet, as distinguished from
small strip centers which generally contain 5,000 to 25,000 square feet and from
large regional enclosed malls which generally contain over 500,000 square feet.
Most of the centers do not have climatized common areas but are designed to
allow retail customers to park their automobiles in close proximity to any
retailer in the center.  The Company's centers are customarily constructed of
masonry, steel and glass and all have lighted, paved parking areas which are
typically landscaped with berms, trees and shrubs.  They are generally located
at major intersections in close proximity to neighborhoods which have existing
populations sufficient to support retail activities of the types conducted in
the Company's centers.

     The Company has approximately 2,900 separate leases with over 2,200
different tenants in its portfolio, including national and regional supermarket
chains, other nationally or regionally known stores (including drug stores,
discount department stores, junior department stores and catalog stores) and a
great variety of other regional and local retailers.  The large number of
locations offered by the Company and the types of traditional anchor tenants
help attract prospective new tenants.  Some of the national and regional
supermarket chains which are tenants in the Company's centers include
Albertson's, Fiesta, Jewel, Smith's Fleming Foods, H.E.B., Kroger Company,
Randall's Food Markets, Fry's Food Stores and Super Value Holdings.  In addition
to these supermarket chains, the Company's nationally and regionally known
retail store tenants include Eckerd, Walgreen and Osco drugstores; Kmart and
Wal-Mart discount stores; Bealls, Palais Royal and Weiner's junior department
stores; Marshall's, Office Depot, 50-Off, Office Max, Baby Superstore, Ross and
T.J. Maxx off-price specialty stores; Luby's, Piccadilly and Furr's ; Academy
sporting goods; Service Merchandise catalog stores; FAO Schwarz toy store; and
the following restaurant chains:  Arby's, Boston Chicken, Burger King, Champ's,
Church's Fried Chicken, Dairy Queen, Domino's, Jack-in-the-Box, Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Pistol Pete Pizza, CiCi Pizza, Long John Silver's, McDonald's, Olive
Garden, Outback Steakhouse, Pizza Hut, Shoney's, Steak & Ale, Taco Bell, and
Whataburger.  The Company also leases space in 3,000 to 10,000 square foot areas
to national chains such as the Limited Store, The Gap, One Price Stores, Tempo,
Eddie Bauer and Radio Shack.

     The Company's shopping center leases have lease terms generally ranging
from three to five years for tenant space under 5,000 square feet and from 10 to
35 years for tenant space over 10,000 square feet.  Leases with primary lease
terms in excess of 10 years, generally for anchor and out-parcels, frequently
contain renewal options which allow the tenant to extend the term of the lease
for one or more additional periods, each such period generally being of a
shorter duration than the primary lease term.  The rental rates paid during a
renewal period are generally based upon the rental rate for the primary term,
sometimes adjusted for inflation or for the amount of the tenant's sales during
the primary term.

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
     Most of the Company's leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of
fixed minimum rentals, the tenants' pro rata share of ad valorem taxes,
insurance (including fire and extended coverage, rent insurance and liability
insurance) and common area maintenance for the center (based on estimates of the
costs for such items) and for the payment of additional rentals based on a
percentage of the tenants' sales ("percentage rentals").  Utilities are
generally paid directly by tenants except where common metering exists with
respect to a center, in which case the Company makes the payments for the
utilities and is reimbursed by the tenants on a monthly basis.  Generally, the
Company's leases prohibit the tenant from assigning or subletting its space and
require the tenant to use its space for the purpose designated in its lease
agreement and to operate its business on a continuous basis.  Certain of the
lease agreements with major tenants contain modifications of these basic
provisions in view of the financial condition, stability or desirability of such
tenants.  Where a tenant is granted the right to assign or sublet its space, the
lease agreement generally provides that the original lessee will remain liable
for the payment of the lease obligations under such lease agreement.

     During 1995, the Company added approximately 1.3 million square feet to its
portfolio of shopping center properties through the acquisition of properties
and another .3 million square feet of space through development.  The Company
entered two new markets with acquisitions in Nevada and Kansas.  Four properties
representing .5 million square feet were acquired in Las Vegas, Nevada and two
acquisitions totaling .2 million square feet were completed in Kansas City,
Kansas.  Additionally, shopping centers were added to our existing portfolio in
the Houston metropolitan area and Albuquerque, New Mexico.  All of the Company's
new developments for 1995 were in Houston.

     Industrial Properties.  The Company currently owns a total of seventeen
industrial projects, all of which are located in the greater Houston area.
These projects include 65 buildings having a total of 2.8 million square feet of
building area situated on 6.8 million square feet of land.  These figures
include the Company's interests in four joint ventures. Major tenants of the
Company's industrial properties include Advo (a leading direct mail advertising
company), Pepsico's PFS division, Stone Container Corporation, Iron Mountain
Records Storage and Paul Arpin Van Lines.

     Five of such buildings, containing approximately .6 million square feet of
building space, are located in the Railwood Industrial Park, a master-planned
industrial park in northeast Houston, which offers full utilities, loading docks
and rail service in an architecturally controlled environment.

     During 1995, the Company acquired one office service center  representing
 .1 million square feet of industrial space.  This property is located in Houston
and had an average occupancy of 80.1% at the time of the acquisition.

     Office Building.  The Company owns a seven-story, 121,000 square foot
masonry office building with a detached, covered, three-level parking garage
situated on 171,000 square feet of land fronting on North Loop 610 West in
Houston.  The building serves as the Company's corporate headquarters.  Other
than the Company, the major tenant of the building is Charter Bank, which
occupies 22%.

     Multi-family Residential Properties.  At December 31, 1995, the Company
owned, through joint venture interests, two apartment projects located in
Houston and San Antonio, Texas.  The Company's percentage ownership represents
approximately 228 units of the projects' aggregate 723 units.  Both are garden-
type projects complemented by landscaping, recreational areas and adequate
parking.  These projects are managed by our joint venture partners, both of whom
are experienced apartment operators.  During 1995, a 110-unit project in
Louisiana in which the Company had a 50% joint venture interest was sold.

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
     Unimproved Land.  The Company owns, directly or through its interest in a
joint venture, 24 parcels of unimproved land aggregating approximately 7.7
million square feet of land area located in Texas and Louisiana.  These
properties include approximately 4.6 million square feet of land adjacent to
certain of the Company's existing developed properties, which may be used for
expansion of these developments, as well as approximately 3.1 million square
feet of land, which may be used for new development.  Almost all of these
unimproved properties are served by roads and utilities and are ready for
development.  Most of these parcels are suitable for development as shopping
centers, and the Company intends to emphasize the development of these parcels
for such purpose.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to its business, to which the Company is a party
or to which any of its properties are subject.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected
financial data appearing elsewhere in this report.  Historical results and
trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future
operations.

Weingarten Realty Investors owned and operated 151 anchored shopping centers, 17
industrial properties, two multi-family residential projects and one office
building at December 31, 1995.  Of the Company's 171 developed properties, 133
are located in Texas (including 84 in Houston and Harris County).  The Company's
remaining properties are located in Louisiana (10), Arizona (6), Arkansas (6),
New Mexico (5), Oklahoma (4), Nevada (4), Kansas (1), Maine (1) and Tennessee
(1).  The Company has  2,900 leases and 2,200 different tenants.  Leases for the
Company's properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over
twenty-five years for larger tenants; leases generally include minimum lease
payments and contingent rentals for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance
and for an amount based on a percentage of the tenants' sales.  The majority of
the Company's anchor tenants are supermarket chains, drugstore chains and other
retailers which generally sell basic necessity-type items.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

The Company anticipates that cash flows from operating activities will continue
to provide adequate capital for all principal payments as well as dividend
payments in accordance with REIT requirements, and that cash on hand, borrowings
under its existing credit facility, the use of corporate and project financing,
as well as other debt and equity alternatives will provide the necessary capital
to achieve growth.  Cash flows from operating activities as reported in the
Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows increased to $72.5 million for 1995 from
$64.3 million for 1994 and $56.7 million for 1993.

Cash dividends increased to $63.5 million in 1995, compared to $59.7 million in
1994 and $52.3 million in 1993.  The Company satisfied its REIT requirement of
distributing at least 95% of ordinary taxable income for each of the three years
ended December 31, 1995 and, accordingly, federal income taxes were not provided
in these years.  The Company's dividend payout ratio for 1995, 1994 and 1993
approximated 85.1%, 84.2% and 90.2%, respectively, of  funds from operations.
Recently, the Company's Board of Trust Managers approved an increase in the
quarterly dividend per common share from $.60 to $.62.

In 1995, the Company continued to expand its portfolio of income-producing
properties.  This growth resulted from acquisitions of existing properties, both
shopping centers and an industrial property, and development of new shopping
centers.  During the year, the Company purchased ten retail centers, its joint
venture partners' interests in two other retail centers and one industrial
project (office service center).  These acquisitions added 1.4 million square
feet of building area to the portfolio.  Six of the purchases were in new
markets for the Company, Las Vegas and Kansas City.  The Company also
substantially completed two new development projects and completed final phases
on two others, adding .3 million square feet of building area.   An additional
 .1 million square feet will be completed on two of the projects in early 1996.
Additionally, the Company has an ongoing program for maintaining and renovating
its existing portfolio of properties.  Capitalized expenditures for
acquisitions, new development and maintenance of the existing portfolio were, in
millions, $114.7, $100.5 and $91.0 during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Total debt outstanding at December 31, 1995 was $289.3 million compared to
$229.6 million at December 31, 1994, and $147.7 million at December 31, 1993.
In 1995, the Company increased total debt by $59.7 million primarily to fund
acquisition and new development programs.  One of the Company's acquisitions was
financed, in part, through the assumption of $2.9 million of debt at an interest
rate of 7.3%, and another through the issuance of 162,500 common shares.  The
remainder of the acquisitions and all new development were initially financed
through the use of revolving credit debt.

Following is the percentage of the Company's debt to equity and debt to total
market capitalization as of December 31:

         Debt to total market capitalization...       22%    19%    13% 
 
</TABLE>

During 1995, the Company  negotiated an increase in the amount available under
its unsecured credit agreement from $150 million to $200 million and added a
bank to the bank syndicate.  The Company also requested and received a one-year
extension of the three-year agreement, and intends to request the same extension
in 1996.

In the first quarter of 1995, the Company filed a $200 million shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows
for the issuance of debt or equity.  In May, the Company began selling unsecured
Medium Term Notes ("MTNs") under the shelf registration.  As of December 31,
1995, the Company had sold $116.5 million of  MTNs at a weighted average rate of
7.1% with an average term of nine years.  The Company continues to examine the
alternatives for fixed-rate debt, including the issuance of additional MTNs,
since it has no intention of issuing additional common equity in the near term.
During the second quarter, the Company funded a twenty-year, $28.0 million self-
amortizing loan with an insurance company bearing interest at 8.2%.  The
proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down amounts outstanding under
the Company's revolving credit facility.

In August, Hospitality Venture, which is 50% owned by an affiliate of the
Company, sold its interest in seven motor hotels.  The Company received from its
affiliate, WRI Holdings, Inc., $6.6 million in cash and substantive ownership of
a $3.5 million note receivable (a 50% interest in a $7.0 million note
receivable) in payment of outstanding mortgage bonds receivable and notes
receivable.  The purchaser of the hotels is the issuer of the three-year,
interest-only note receivable which bears interest at a rate of 14%.

In November, the Company sold its investment in U.S. Treasury Notes for $31.8
million. The Company generally borrowed funds under low-cost reverse repurchase
agreements for up to 98% of the value of the Treasury Notes, which served as
collateral for the borrowings. The amount of borrowings under reverse repurchase
agreements will be reduced prospectively to a maximum of 98% of the Company's
remaining $16 million investment in government securities. As a result of this
sale, the Company's remaining investment in marketable securities was
reclassified as "available for sale."

At December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately $122 million of funds
available to support the growth of the Company.  These funds were available
through a combination of $118 million available under the revolving credit
facility and $4 million of unencumbered government debt securities.
Additionally, the Company expects to continue to issue debt under its shelf
registration and to continually seek and evaluate other sources of capital.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

The Company considers funds from operations to be an alternate measure of the
performance of an equity REIT since such measure does not recognize depreciation
and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses. Management
believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating
income-producing real estate, which historically has not depreciated. The
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts defines funds from
operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate
assets less gains and losses on sales of property and securities. Funds from
operations do not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally
accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to
net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or to cash
flows as a measure of liquidity.

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
Funds from operations increased to $74.6 million in 1995 compared to $70.9
million in 1994 and $58.0 million in 1993. The majority of the increase relates
to the impact of the Company's acquisition and new development programs.  For
further information on the changes between years, see "Results of Operations"
below.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Rental revenues increased by 11.8% or $13.2 million from $112.2 million in 1994
to $125.4 million in 1995 and by 17.1% or $16.4 million from $95.8 million in
1993.  Of these increases, property acquisitions and new development contributed
$11.2 million in 1995 and $13.0 million in 1994.  Occupancy of the Company's
shopping centers decreased slightly from 93% at December 31, 1994 to 92% at the
end of 1995.  The Company's overall portfolio remained constant at 92%, while
the industrial portfolio increased to 94% from 88% at the end of 1994.  Since
occupancy rates have remained consistent during the periods, the remaining
portion of these increases in rental revenues is due primarily to increased
rental rates obtained from re-leasing and renewals of existing space.  The
Company completed 522 renewals or leases comprising 1.5 million square feet at
an average rental rate increase of 7.4%.  Net of capital costs for tenant
improvements, the increase averaged 4.4%.

Interest income was $5.3 million in 1995, $5.8 million in 1994 and $5.3 million
in 1993. The decrease in 1995 is the result of the Company selling $31.8 million
of its investment in marketable debt securities during the fourth quarter of
1995. The sale resulted in a gain of $.1 million. The increase in interest
income in 1994 was due to the purchase of $50 million in marketable debt
securities in March of 1993.

Equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships has increased
to $1.5 million in 1995 from $1.3 million in 1994 and  $1.1 million in 1993.
The increase in 1995 is due to improvements in the operating results from the
properties held in the joint ventures and partnerships. The increase in 1994 is
the result of additional investment during 1993 in entities accounted for under
the equity method.  Other income increased to $1.9 million in 1995 from $1.5
million in 1994 and $1.1 million in 1993. These increases were primarily due to
lease cancellation income.

Direct costs and expenses of operating the Company's properties (i.e., operating
and ad valorem tax expenses) increased to $37.7 million in 1995 from $34.8
million in 1994 and $30.2 million in 1993.  These increases are primarily due to
property acquired and developed during these periods.  Overall, direct operating
costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues have continually declined
from 32% in 1993 to 31% in 1994 and to 30% in 1995.  Depreciation and
amortization have increased to $30.1 million in 1995 from $26.8 million in 1994
and $23.4 million in 1993, also as a result of the properties acquired and
developed during these periods.

Interest incurred on debt outstanding during the periods increased by $7.2
million to $19.6 million in 1995 from $12.4 million in 1994. This was due to an
increase in the weighted average debt outstanding to $261.3 million in 1995 from
$181.6 million in 1994, and an increase in the weighted average interest rate to
7.4% in 1995 from 6.8% in 1994. Interest expense increased in 1995 by only $6.0
million due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized to $2.9 million
in 1995 from $1.7 million in 1994 as a result of increased development activity
during 1995. Comparing 1994 to 1993, interest incurred on debt outstanding
increased from $11.2 million in 1993 to $12.4 million in 1994. This was due to
an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding from $138.3 million in 1993
to $181.6 million in 1994, offset partially by a decrease in the weighted
average interest rate of 8.1% in 1993 to 6.8% in 1994. Interest expense
increased in 1994 by only $.6 million due to an increase in the amount of
interest capitalized as a result of additional projects under development during
1994 as compared to 1993.

The majority of the change in gains (loss) on sales of property and securities
from 1993 to 1994 related to the gains realized in 1993 as a result of fires at
two of the Company's properties; there were no similar occurrences in 1994.  The
fires had no material impact on the Company's earnings for 1993 or 1994.

As a result of the changes described above, net income increased 2.3% to $44.8
million in 1995 from $43.8 million in 1994 and by 21.0% from $36.2 million in
1993. Net income per common share increased to $1.69 in 1995 from $1.67 in 1994
and $1.50 in 1993.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

The rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in 1995.  The Company has
structured its leases, however, in such a way as to remain largely unaffected
should significant inflation occur.  Most of the leases contain percentage rent
provisions with the Company to receive rentals based on the tenants' gross
sales.  Many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of
the leases through escalation provisions.  In addition, many of the Company's
leases are for terms of less than ten years, which allows the Company to adjust
rentals to changing market conditions when the leases expire.  Most of the
Company's leases require the tenant to pay their proportionate share of
operating expenses.  As a result of these lease provisions, increases due to
inflation, as well as ad valorem tax rate increases which are usually
anticipated to occur, generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon
the Company's operating results.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Trust Managers and Shareholders of
Weingarten Realty Investors:

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weingarten
Realty Investors as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of
consolidated income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14.  These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Weingarten Realty Investors at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

Weingarten Realty Investors, a Texas real estate investment trust, is engaged in
the acquisition, development and management of real estate, primarily
neighborhood and community shopping centers, in Texas and throughout the
southwestern part of the United States.  The Company's major tenants include
supermarket chains, drugstore chains and other retailers who generally sell
basic necessity-type commodities.  The Company currently operates and intends to
operate in the future as a real estate investment trust ("REIT").

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
subsidiaries and its interest in 50% or more-owned joint ventures and
partnerships over which the Company exercises control. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in less
than 50% owned joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Revenue Recognition

Rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the lease for operating leases and over the lease terms using the interest
method for direct financing leases.  Contingent rentals (payments for taxes,
maintenance and insurance by the lessees and for an amount based on a percentage
of the tenants' sales) are estimated and accrued over the lease year.

Property

Real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, generally over
estimated useful lives of 18-50 years for buildings and 10-20 years for parking
lot surfacing and equipment. Major replacements are capitalized and the replaced
asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.
All other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred.

Issued in March of 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of," sets forth guidance on how to measure an impairment of long-
lived assets and when to recognize such an impairment. The adoption of this
pronouncement, effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 1996,
is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

Capitalization

Carrying charges, principally interest and ad valorem taxes, on land under
development and buildings under construction are capitalized as part of land
under development and buildings and improvements.

Deferred Charges

Unamortized debt and lease costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the debt and over the lives of leases, respectively.

Marketable Debt Securities

Premiums and discounts are amortized (accreted) to operations over the estimated
remaining lives of the securities using the constant yield method.  At December
31, 1994, the Company's investment in marketable securities was classified as
"held to maturity" and carried at amortized cost.  Upon the sale of certain
securities during the fourth quarter of 1995, the remaining investment was
reclassified as "available for sale."  At December 31, 1995, the securities were
carried at market with any unrealized gains or losses included as a component of
shareholders' equity.

                                       24

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make use of
estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial
statements as well as certain disclosures.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Per Share Data

Net income per common share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period and excludes the negligible dilutive
effect of shares issuable under benefit plans.

Statements of Cash Flows

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less as cash equivalents.  In 1995, the Company issued .2
million common shares of beneficial interest  valued at $6.3 million and assumed
$2.9 million of debt in connection with the purchase of property.  During 1994,
the Company issued .3 million common shares valued at $11.4 million and assumed
$13.4 million of debt in connection with the purchase of property.  During 1993,
$123.0 million in convertible debentures and notes were converted into 3.9
million common shares.

Reclassifications

Reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts to conform with the
current year presentation.

Note 2. Debt

The Company's debt consists of the following (in thousands):

revolving credit agreement and the reverse repurchase agreements were 6.5% and
6.1%, respectively.  The weighted average interest rate for the company's short-

thousands):

</TABLE>

Certain debt is collateralized by various direct financing leases or other
property and current and future rentals from these leases and properties.  At
December 31, 1995 and 1994, the carrying value of such property aggregated $177
million and $257 million, respectively.

The Company has an unsecured $200 million revolving credit agreement with a bank
syndicate. The agreement expires in November 1998, but the Company has an annual
option to request a one year extension of the agreement. All members of the bank
syndicate must agree to the requested extension or the agreement expires on the
scheduled date, at which time all loans outstanding under the credit agreement
become payable. The Company intends to request an extension of the agreement in
1996 and expects that the bank syndicate will agree to its request. During 1995,
the maximum balance and weighted average balance outstanding under this
agreement were $145 million and $85 million, respectively, at an average
interest rate of 6.8%. The revolving credit agreement is subject to normal
banking terms and conditions and does not adversely restrict the Company's
operations or liquidity.

In the first quarter of 1995, the Company filed a $200 million shelf
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows
for the issuance of debt or equity.  In May, the Company began selling unsecured
Medium Term Notes ("MTNs") under the shelf registration.  As of December 31,
1995, the Company had sold $116.5 million of MTNs at a weighted average rate of
7.1% with an average term of nine years.  At December 31, 1995, the unused
portion of the shelf registration totaled $83.5 million.

The Company made cash payments for interest on debt, net of amounts capitalized,
of $13.9 million in 1995, $10.1 million in 1994 and $9.4 million in 1993.

Various debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of
which requires the Company to produce annual consolidated distributable cash
flow, as defined by the agreements, of not less than 250% of interest payments,
to limit the payment of dividends to no more than 100% of the Company's annual
consolidated cash flow, to limit short-term debt (as defined) to the greater of
33% of total debt or $200 million (exclusive of reverse repurchase agreements)
and to maintain uncollateralized assets equal to at least 150% of unsecured
debt.  Management believes that the Company is in compliance with all
restrictive covenants.

                                       26

The Company has three interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional
amount of $40 million. Such contracts, which expire through 2004, have been
outstanding since their purchase. The Company intends to hold such contracts
through their expiration date and to use them as a means of fixing the interest
rate on a portion of the Company's variable-rate debt. The interest rate swaps
have an effective interest rate of 8.1%. The difference between the interest
received and paid on the interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense
as incurred. The interest rate swaps increased interest expense and decreased
net income as follows, in millions: $.8 in 1995, $1.4 in 1994 and $1.9 in 1993.
The interest rate swaps increased the average interest rate for the Company's
debt by the following amounts: .2% for 1995, .8% for 1994 and 1.3% for 1993. The
Company could be exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the
counterparty; however, the likelihood of such non-performance is remote.

Note 4. Leasing Operations

Leasing Arrangements

The Company's lease terms range from less than one year for smaller tenant
spaces to over twenty-five years for larger tenant spaces.  In addition to
minimum lease payments, most of the leases provide for contingent rentals.

Rentals under Operating Leases

Future minimum rental income from non-cancelable operating leases at December
31, 1995, in millions, is:  $99.7 in 1996; $88.3 in 1997; $76.9 in 1998; $65.4
in 1999; $54.2 in 2000 and $435.2 thereafter.  The future minimum rental amounts
do not include estimates for contingent rentals.  Such contingent rentals, in
millions, aggregated $26.8 in 1995, $24.6 in 1994 and $21.4 in 1993.

Property under Direct Financing Leases

Leases that are, in substance, the financing of an asset purchase by the party
leasing the property are recorded as property under direct financing leases.
The Company, in its capacity as lessor, has removed the leased property from its
books and recorded the future lease payments receivable using the following
components (in thousands):

                                                  ========   =======
</TABLE>

The Company recognized rental revenue from direct financing leases as follows,
in millions:  $1.9 in 1995; $1.5 in 1994 and $1.6 in 1993.  At December 31,
1995, minimum lease payments to be received in each of the five succeeding
years, in millions, are:  $1.8 in 1996 and 1997; $1.7 in 1998; $1.5 in 1999 and
$1.1 in 2000.  The future minimum lease payments do not include amounts for
contingent rentals; contingent rental income on properties leased under direct
financing leases, in millions, was $.7 in 1995, $.8 in 1994 and $.6 in 1993.

Note 5. Lease Commitments

The Company leases land and a shopping center from the owners, and then
subleases these properties to other parties.  Future minimum rentals under these
operating leases, in millions, are:  $1.4 in 1996; $1.3 in 1997 and 1998, $1.2
in 1999; $1.1 in 2000 and $19.6 thereafter.

Future minimum rental payments on these leases have not been reduced by future
minimum sublease rentals aggregating $14.7 million through 2017 that are due
under various non-cancelable subleases. Rental expense (including insignificant
amounts for contingent rentals) for operating leases aggregated, in millions:
$1.8 in 1995 and $1.6 in 1994 and 1993. Sublease rental revenue (excluding
amounts for improvements constructed by the Company on the leased land) from
these leased properties was as follows, in millions: $2.2 in 1995; $2.1 in 1994
and $2.0 in 1993.

Property under capital leases, consisting of a shopping center aggregating $6.5
million, is included in buildings and improvements at December 31, 1995 and
1994.

Future minimum lease payments under these capital leases total $9.2 million,
with annual payments due of $.2 million in each of 1996 through 2000, and $8.0
million thereafter.  The amount of these total payments representing interest is
$3.2 million.  Accordingly, the present value of the net minimum lease payments
is $6.0 million at December 31, 1995.

Note 6. Related Party Transactions

The Company has mortgage bonds and notes receivable of $15.9 million and $25.1
million, net of deferred gain of $5.5 million and $16.2 million, at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively, from WRI Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings").  The Company
and Holdings share certain directors and are under common management. These
receivables are collateralized by unimproved land and an investment in a joint
venture which owned and managed eight motor hotels ("Hospitality"). The bonds
and notes bear interest at rates of 16% and prime plus 1%, respectively.
However, due to its poor financial condition, Holdings reduced the payment of
interest to the Company in 1988 to the cash flow received from Hospitality and,
accordingly, the Company limited the recognition of interest income for
financial statement purposes to the same amount.

                                       28
<PAGE>
 
The Company does not anticipate receiving interest payments in excess of this
cash flow in the near term.  Interest income recognized for financial reporting
purposes was $1.2 million, $1.6 million and $2.1 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

During 1995, seven of the eight motor hotels owned by Hospitality were sold.
The Company received $6.6 million in cash and substantive ownership of a three-
year, interest-only $3.5 million note receivable from the purchaser which bears
interest at 14% per annum.  These proceeds were used to repay the $2.7 million
net investment (cost less related deferred gain) in the mortgage bonds secured
by the seven motels plus accrued interest and $7.4 million of notes receivable.
The Company did not recognize any of the previously deferred gain on the
transaction.

The Company had an unrecorded receivable for interest on the mortgage bonds of
$36.6 million and $28.6 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Interest income not recognized by the Company for financial reporting purposes
aggregated, in millions, $8.0, $6.3 and $5.2 for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Management of the Company believes that the fair market value of the security
collateralizing debt from Holdings is greater than the net investment in such
debt and that there would not be a charge to operations if the Company were to
foreclose on the debt. If foreclosure were required, the net investment in such
debt would become the Company's basis of the repossessed assets. However, the
Company does not currently anticipate foreclosure on Holdings' properties due to
certain restrictions imposed on such assets in connection with the Company's
REIT status. The Company's management does not presently believe that the net
investment in the mortgage bonds and notes receivable from Holdings has been
impaired.

The Company owns an interest in several joint ventures and partnerships. Notes
receivable from these entities bear interest at 8.5% to 10.5% at December 31,
1995 and are due at various dates through 2020. The Company recognized interest
income on these notes as follows, in millions: $1.1 in 1995; $.9 in 1994 and
$1.0 in 1993.

Texas Commerce Bank National Association ("TCB") is a significant participant in
and the agent for the banks that provide the Company's $200 million revolving
credit agreement.  The Company and TCB have two common directors.

NOTE 7. SHARE OPTIONS AND AWARDS

The Company has an incentive Share Option Plan which provides for the issuance
of options and share awards up to a maximum of 500,000 common shares and expires
in December 1997. The Company has an additional share option plan which grants
100 share options to every employee of the Company, excluding executive
officers, upon completion of each five year interval of service. This plan,
which expires in 2002, provides options for a maximum of 100,000 common shares.
For both of these share option plans, options are granted to employees of the
Company at an exercise price equal to the quoted fair market value of the common
shares on the date the options are granted. All options and awards that are
granted expire upon termination of employment or ten years from the date of the
grant.

In January 1994, the Company issued 62,900 restricted shares and granted 434,400
share options under a compensatory Incentive Share Plan for key officers of the
Company.  This plan, which expires in 2003, provides for a total of 500,000
shares, either in the form of restricted shares or options.  The restricted
shares generally vest over a ten-year period, with potential acceleration of
vesting due to appreciation in the market value of the Company's shares.  The
share options vest over a five-year period beginning two years after the date of
grant.  Share options were granted at the market price on the date of grant.
The Company recognized $.2 million of compensation expense relating to the
restricted shares in both 1995 and 1994.

At December 31, 1995, 314,884 common shares were available for the future grant
of options or awards and options for 189,000 shares were exercisable.

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company was contingently liable at December 31, 1995 for $1.2 million of
notes payable executed by various joint ventures and partnerships.

The Company is involved in various matters of litigation arising in the normal
course of business.  While the Company is unable to predict with certainty the
amounts involved, the Company's management and counsel are of the opinion that,
when such litigation is resolved, the Company's resulting liability, if any,
will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

In connection with the acquisition of certain property in exchange for the
Company's common shares in 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with the
seller under which the Company essentially guarantees that its common shares
would exceed a specified value on a certain future date. If the shares' market
value does not exceed the threshold specified in the agreement, the Company has
the option to pay the seller the difference in cash, issue additional common
shares (based upon the then market value of the shares) for the difference or
settle the difference by a combination of paying cash and issuing shares. The
Company has the option to settle the agreement in June 1996, December 1996 or
June 1997. If the Company had settled this agreement at December 31, 1995, the
cash settlement amount would have been $1.5 million or a maximum of 39,500
common shares would have been issued.

In connection with a property acquisition in 1995, the Company issued .2 million
common shares, and provided the seller with an option to put the shares back to
the Company or require the Company to provide a third party buyer of the shares
at a price of approximately $39 per share on May 1, 1996. The property acquired
was initially recorded based on $39 per share.

NOTE 9. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Federal income taxes are not provided because the Company believes it qualifies
as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders of the
Company include their proportionate taxable income in their individual tax
returns. As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 95% of its ordinary
taxable income to its shareholders and meet certain income source and investment
restriction requirements.

Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes
principally because of differences in the timing of recognition of interest, ad
valorem taxes, depreciation, rental revenue, pension expense and installment
gains on sales of property.  As a result of these differences, the book value of
the Company's net assets exceeds its tax basis by $34.0 million at December 31,
1995.

For federal income tax purposes, the cash dividends distributed to shareholders
are characterized as follows:

NOTE 10. PENSION PLAN

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its
employees.  The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's
compensation during the last five years of service. The Company's funding policy
is to make annual contributions as required by applicable regulations, however,
the Company has not been required to make contributions for any of the past
three years. The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company's balance sheet (in thousands):

NOTE 11. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The Company's investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 1995
consists of U.S. government agency guaranteed pass-through certificates which
mature through 2008. During 1995, the Company sold U.S. Treasury Notes with an
amortized cost of $31.8 million as determined using the specific identification
method and realized a gain of $.1 million. These securities, which were
classified as "held to maturity", were sold due to changes in market rates
coupled with a shift in the Company's philosophy regarding the holding of
marketable securities. The Company's remaining investment was reclassified to
"available for sale". At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the fair value of these
investments totaled $16.3 million and $45.8 million, respectively. The amortized
cost of the investments at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $16.4 million and
$49.9 million, respectively, and the related unrealized losses were $.1 million
and $4.1 million, respectively.

NOTE 12.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Disclosure of fair value was determined by the Company using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies as of December 31, 1995.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect
the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date, and current
estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
herein.  Unless otherwise described below, all other financial instruments are
carried at amounts which approximate their fair values.

Based on rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms
and average maturities, fixed-rate debt with a carrying value of $230.0 million
has a fair value of approximately $242.5 million at December 31, 1995.  The fair
value of the Company's variable-rate debt approximates its carrying value of
$59.3 million.

The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is based on the estimated
amounts the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at December
31, 1995.  If the Company had terminated these agreements at December 31, 1995,
the Company would have paid $5.0 million.

                                       32
<PAGE>
 
Fair value of the mortgage bonds and notes receivable from Holdings was not
determined because it is not practical to reasonably assess the credit
adjustment that would be applied in the marketplace for such bonds and notes
receivable.

NOTE 13.  PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company acquired ten retail
centers, its joint venture partners' interests in two other retail centers and
one industrial project.  The pro forma financial information for the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994 shown below is based on the historical statements of
the Company after giving effect to the acquisitions as if such acquisitions took
place on January 1, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  (In thousands, except per
share amounts)

<PAGE>
 
Supplemental Trust Indenture and the Second Supplemental Trust Indenture, being
called the "Trust Indenture"); and


     WHEREAS, the Bonds mature on December 28, 1995, and Maker and Payee now
propose to renew and extend the maturity date of the Bonds and to continue the
liens and priority of the Security Instruments as security for the payment of
the Bonds, as set forth more particularly herein; and


     WHEREAS, in consideration for the extension of the maturity of the Bonds,
Maker and Payee also desire to amend the terms of the Bonds to permit Payee to
call the maturity of the Bonds as more particularly set forth herein.


     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Maker and Payee hereby agree as
follows:


     1.  The Maker reaffirms its promise to pay to the order of the Payee, at
2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Suite 300, Houston, Texas 77008, the principal balance
due and owing on the Bonds, with interest accrued thereon, as provided in the
Bonds, except that the maturity date of the Bonds is hereby renewed and extended
to December 28, 1996, at which time the unpaid principal balance of the Bonds
plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable.


     All liens, pledges, and security interests securing the payment of the
Bonds, including, but not limited to, the liens, pledges and security interests
granted in the Trust Indenture and the Negative Pledge, are hereby renewed,
extended and carried forward to secure payment of the Bonds, as hereby amended,
and the Security Instruments are hereby amended to reflect that the maturity
date of the Bonds is December 28, 1996.


     2.  In consideration for the extension of the maturity of the Bonds as
provided herein, Maker and Payee hereby agree that the Bonds are further
modified and amended to insert the following provision as paragraph 15 of the
Bonds:


          "15.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Security,
          the Indenture, or any other documents evidencing, securing, or
          relating to the indebtedness evidenced by this Security, and without
          regard to the occurrence of any default or breach under the terms of
          this Security, the Indenture, or such other documents, Payee, at any
          time during the term of this Security, upon thirty (30) days prior
          written notice to Maker and the Trustee (as that term is defined in
          the Indenture), may declare the entire outstanding principal balance
          of this Security together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
          (whether such interest is evidenced by this Security or another
          instrument or promissory note) immediately due and payable without any
          penalty or premium.  Payee shall send 

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
          its notice of intention to declare such indebtedness due in accordance
          with the notice provisions of the Indenture. If this Security is owned
          by more than one owner, a majority of the owners of this Security (as
          determined by the principal amount owed to such owners) may declare
          the indebtedness evidenced by this Security due pursuant to the terms
          of this paragraph."


     3. Maker hereby represents and warrants to Payee that (a) Maker is the sole
legal and beneficial owner of the Trust Estate (as that term is defined in the
Trust Indenture); (b) Maker has the full power and authority to make the
agreements contained in this Second Renewal without joinder and consent of any
other party; and (c) the execution, delivery and performance of this Second
Renewal will not contravene or constitute an event which itself or which with
the passing of time or giving of notice or both would constitute a default under
any trust deed, deed of trust, loan agreement, indenture or other agreement to
which Maker is a party or by which Maker or any of its property is bound. Maker
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Payee against any loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees)
incurred as a result of any representation or warranty made by Maker in this
Section 3 proving to be untrue in any material respect.


     4. To the extent that the Bonds are inconsistent with the terms of this
Second Renewal, the Bonds are hereby modified and amended. Except as modified,
renewed and extended by this Second Renewal, the Bonds remain unchanged and
continue unabated and in full force and effect as the valid and binding
obligation of the Maker.


     5. In conjunction with the extension and renewal of the Bonds and the
Security Instruments, Maker hereby extends and renews the liens, pledges, and
security interests as created and granted in the Security Instruments until the
indebtedness secured thereby, as so extended and renewed, has been fully paid,
and agrees that such extension and renewal shall in no manner affect or impair
the Bonds or the liens, pledges, and security interests securing same, and that
said liens, pledges, and security interests shall not in any manner be waived.
The purpose of this Second Renewal is simply to extend the time of payment of
the obligation evidenced by the Bonds and any indebtedness secured by the
Security Instruments, as modified by this Second Renewal, to add the foregoing
call provision, and to carry forward all liens, pledges, and security interests
securing the same, which are acknowledged by Maker to be valid and subsisting.


     6. Maker covenants and warrants that the Payee is not in default under the
Bonds Security Instruments, or this Second Renewal (collectively referred to as
the "Loan Instruments") that there are no defenses, counterclaims or offsets to
such Loan Instruments; and that all of the provisions of the Loan Instruments,
as amended hereby, are in full force and effect.


     7. Maker agrees to pay all costs incurred in connection with the execution
and consummation of this Second Renewal, including but not limited to, all
recording costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of Payee's counsel.

                                       3

     8. If any covenant, condition, or provision herein contained is held to be
invalid by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
of such covenant, condition, or provision shall not in any way affect any other
covenant, condition, or provision herein contained.


     9.   Payee is the sole owner and holder of the Bonds.  Maker and Payee
acknowledge and agree that the outstanding principal balance of the Bonds as of
December 28, 1995 is $3,150,000.00.


     10. Payee is an unincorporated trust organized under the Texas Real Estate
Investment Trust Act. Neither the shareholders of Payee, nor its Trust Managers,
officers, employees, or other agents shall be personally, corporately, or
individually liable, in any manner whatsoever, for any debt, act, omission, or
obligation of Payee, and all persons having claims of any kind whatsoever
against Payee shall look solely to the property of Payee for the enforcement of
their rights (whether monetary or nonmonetary) against Payee.


     EXECUTED this day and year first above written, but effective for all
purposes as of December 28, 1995.

          other documents evidencing, securing, or relating to the indebtedness
          evidenced by the Securities, and without regard to the occurrence of
          any default or breach under the terms of this Indenture, the

or which with the passing of time or giving of notice or both would constitute a
default under any trust deed, deed of trust, loan agreement, indenture or other
agreement to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its
property is bound. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Trustee against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred as a result of any representation
or warranty made by the Company in this Section 4 proving to be untrue in any
material respect.


     5. To the extent that the Trust Indenture is inconsistent with the terms of
this Second Supplemental Indenture, the Trust Indenture is hereby modified and
amended. Except as modified, renewed and supplemented by this Second
Supplemental Indenture, the Trust Indenture remains unchanged and continues
unabated and in full force and effect as the valid and binding obligation of the
Company.

under the Trust Indenture, as supplemented by this Second Supplemental Indenture

counterclaims or offsets to the Bonds or the Indenture, and that all of the
provisions of the Bonds and the Indenture are in full force and effect.

execution and consummation of this Second Supplemental Indenture, including but
not limited to, all recording costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of

invalid by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
of such covenant, condition, or provision shall not in any way affect any other

$40,000,000.00                  Houston, Texas                  January 1, 1995


          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and as hereinafter specified, WRI HOLDINGS, INC.,
a Texas corporation ("Maker"), promises to pay to the order of WEINGARTEN REALTY
INVESTORS, a Texas real estate investment trust ("Payee"), at 2600 Citadel Plaza

writing by Payee), in lawful money of the United States of America, which shall
be legal tender for the payment of all debts, public and private, (i) the
principal sum of FORTY MILLION and NO/100 DOLLARS ($40,000,000.00), or so much
thereof as may, from time to time, be advanced by Payee pursuant to that certain
Deficit Loan Agreement dated December 28, 1984, between Maker and Weingarten

certain First Amendment of Deficit Loan Agreement and Modification of Interest
Rate dated November 17, 1987, effective as of September 30, 1987, between Maker
and WRI, as further amended by that certain Second Amendment of Deficit Loan

of January 1, 1991, between Maker and Payee, as further amended by that certain

as further amended by that certain Fourth Amendment of Deficit Loan Agreement
and Modification of Promissory Note of even date herewith, effective as of
January 1, 1995 (collectively, the "Deficit Loan Agreement"); (ii) interest from
the date hereof until maturity upon the balance of the principal sum remaining
unpaid from time to time (such balance being referred to

                                       1
<PAGE>
 
herein as the "Principal Balance") (a) to cover the Interest Difference only on
the Railwood Bond and the River Pointe Bond, at the lesser of (A) the total of
the prime rate announced from time to time by Texas Commerce Bank National
Association plus two percentage points per annum or (B) the highest lawful rate
("Maximum Rate") permitted by Applicable Law (as hereinafter defined) and (b) to
cover the Interest Difference on the Hospitality Bond, at the Maximum Rate
permitted by Applicable Law; and (iii) interest upon all past-due principal and
accrued interest from maturity until paid at the Maximum Rate permitted by
Applicable Law.

          All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Payee for the use, forbearance
or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall, to the extent permitted
by  Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the
full term of such indebtedness until payment in full, so that the maximum lawful
rate of interest or the maximum amount of interest that may be charged,
contracted for or received under Applicable Law on account of such indebtedness
does not exceed the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law from time to time
in effect and applicable to the indebtedness evidenced hereby for so long as
such indebtedness is outstanding hereunder.

          The term "Applicable Law," shall mean that law in effect from time to
time and applicable to this Note which lawfully permits the charging and
collection of the highest permissible lawful, non-usurious rate of interest on
this Note, including laws of the State of Texas and laws of the United States of
America.  It is intended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 5069-1.04, as

Applicable Law, and for the purpose of applying said Article 5069-1.04 to

<PAGE>
 
this Note, it is agreed between Maker and Payee that the interest ceiling
applicable to this Note under said Article 5069-1.04 shall be the quarterly rate
ceiling.  In no event shall the provisions of Article 5069 Ch 15 of the Revised
Civil Statutes of Texas (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts
and revolving tri-party accounts) apply to the loan evidenced hereby.

          The entire unpaid Principal Balance, together with all accrued, unpaid
interest thereon, shall be finally due and payable on the 28th day of December,
2004 if not sooner paid (the "Maturity Date"), and with interest computed from
and after the Maturity Date at the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law,
until all amounts due hereunder are paid in full.

          The Maker of this Note shall have the right to prepay all or any
portion of the Principal Balance of this Note at any time without notice or any
prepayment penalty.  Any amounts so prepaid shall be applied, first, to accrued
interest and, next, to principal coming due in the inverse order of maturity.

          This Note shall be accelerated and become immediately due and payable,
at the option of the Payee or other holder hereof, without presentment, demand,
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or any other notice
(other than the notice set forth herein) to the Maker or any other person
obligated or to become obligated hereon upon default continuing for a period of
ten (10) calendar days after receipt of written notice to Maker of a particular
event of default then existing in the payment of any sum due hereon or default
continuing for a period of twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of written
notice to Maker of a particular event of default then existing under the terms
of any of the Security Instruments (hereafter referred to). Any notice provided
for hereunder shall be deemed to

                                       3

be delivered three (3) calendar days after being deposited in the United States
Mail, postage prepaid, Certified Mail, return receipt requested, addressed to
Maker at Maker's address given below, or at such other address as such party may
have theretofore delivered in accordance herewith.  Notice may also be given by
telegram, messenger service or other personal delivery, and shall be deemed to
be delivered when received.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Note, Payee
or other holder hereof may, at its option, without presentment or demand or any
further notice (other than as expressly set forth in the following sentence) to
the Maker or any other person obligated hereon, declare this Note, and all sums
due and payable hereunder, immediately due and payable, at any time.  Payee or
such other holder hereof shall deliver to Maker or such other person obligated
or to become obligated hereon notice of such election to accelerate the maturity
of this Note as provided for in the immediately preceding sentence, by
delivering to such Maker or other person obligated hereon six (6) months' prior
written notice thereof, such notice to be delivered in accordance with the
notice provisions hereinabove provided.

          Except as hereinabove expressly set forth, the Maker and all sureties,
guarantors and endorsers of this Note (i) waive demand, notice of intent to
accelerate, notice of acceleration, grace, protest, notice of protest and
presentment, and all other notices (except as otherwise expressly provided for
herein), (ii) agree that the Payee or other holder hereof shall not be required
first to institute suit or exhaust its remedies hereon against the Maker or
others liable to or to become liable hereon in order to enforce payment of this
Note by them, (iii) agree and consent that this Note may be renewed and the time
of payment extended, without notice and without releasing any of said parties,
(iv) agree that

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
the failure to exercise any option or election herein upon the occurrence of any
event of default shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to exercise
such option or election at any later date or upon the occurrence of a subsequent
event of default, (v) agree that, without any notice, Payee may from time to
time agree to substitute, exchange or release any part or parts of the property
and interests securing the payment of this Note, with or without consideration,
and (vi) agree that, without any notice, Payee may from time to time agree to
any substitution, exchange or release of any party primarily or secondarily
liable hereon.

          If this Note is collected by suit, through probate or bankruptcy court
or any other judicial proceedings, after default by the Maker, or if this Note
is not paid at maturity, howsoever such maturity may be brought about, and is
thereafter placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, then the Maker
promises to pay, as attorney's fees, and in addition to all other amounts owing
hereunder, a reasonable sum not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
Principal Balance and accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the time this Note
is placed in the hands of such attorney.

          Any action brought on this Note or the agreements or instruments
securing the same, regardless of where brought, shall be determined under the
laws of the State of Texas (and applicable federal law).  All obligations
performable with respect to this Note shall be performable in Harris County,
Texas.

          Notwithstanding any provision to the apparent contrary herein
contained, it is expressly provided that in no case or event shall the aggregate
of (i) all "interest" on the unpaid Principal Balance, accrued or paid from the
date hereof through the date of such calculation, and (ii) the aggregate of any
other amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
Note or any other instrument evidencing, related to or securing this Note, which
under Applicable Law, is or may be deemed to constitute interest upon the debt
evidenced hereby from the date hereof through the date of such calculation, ever
exceed the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law on the Principal Balance of
the debt evidenced by this Note from time to time remaining unpaid.  In this
connection it is expressly stipulated and agreed that it is the intent of the
Payee and the Maker in the execution and delivery of this Note, and all other
instruments evidencing or securing the indebtedness constituting this debt, to
contract in strict compliance with Applicable Law from time to time in effect.
In furtherance thereof, none of the terms of this Note, or any other such
instruments, evidencing, related to or securing this Note, shall ever be
construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for use, forbearance or
detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate permitted
by Applicable Law.  The Maker or any guarantors, endorsers or other parties now
or hereafter becoming liable for the payment of this Note or any other
indebtedness incurred incident to this debt shall never be liable for interest
in excess of the Maximum Rate permitted by Applicable Law, and the provisions of
this paragraph shall control over any other provisions of this Note, or any
other instrument evidencing, related to or securing this debt which may be in
apparent conflict herewith.

          Specifically and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it
is expressly provided that if under any circumstances the aggregate amounts
contracted for, charged or received on this Note prior to and incident to the
final maturity include amounts which by law are deemed interest and which would
exceed the maximum amount of interest which could lawfully have been collected
on this debt, Maker stipulates that such amounts collected would have been and
will be deemed to have been the results of a mathematical

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
error on the part of both the Maker and holder of the Note, and that the party
receiving such excess payment if any has been received shall promptly refund the
amount of such excess (to the extent only of the excess of such interest
payments above the maximum amount which could lawfully have been contracted for,
charged or received) upon discovery of such error by the party receiving such
payment.  It is hereby expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of both
Maker and holder to at all times comply with Applicable Law relating to this
Note and the instruments securing it, now or hereafter in effect, and any
subsequent judicial interpretation thereof to the extent that same are made
applicable thereto.

          This Note amends, restates, extends, and renews (but is not in
novation of) that certain Promissory Note, dated December 28, 1984, in the
principal sum of Seven Million and No/100 Dollars ($7,000,000) ("Original Note")

contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Maker and Payee hereby agree as
follows:


     1.  The Maker reaffirms its promise to pay to the order of the Payee, at
2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Suite 300, Houston, Texas 77008, the principal balance
due and owing on the Note, with accrued interest thereon, as provided in the
Note, except that the maturity date of the Note is hereby amended and extended
until December 1, 1996, at which time the unpaid principal balance of the Note,
together with all accrued but unpaid interest, shall be due and payable.


     All liens securing the Note, including, but not limited to, the lien
created by the Original Deed of Trust, are hereby renewed, extended and carried
forward to secure payment of the Note, as hereby amended, and the Original Deed
of Trust is hereby amended to reflect that the maturity date of the Note is
December 1, 1996.  All other Security Instruments including, but not limited to,
the Original Loan Agreement, are likewise hereby modified and amended to reflect
the renewal and extension of the maturity date of the Note to December 1, 1996.


     2.  Maker hereby represents and warrants to Payee that (a) Maker is the
sole legal and beneficial owner of the Property; (b) Maker has the full power
and authority to make the agreements contained in this Seventh Renewal without
joinder and consent of any other party; and (c) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Seventh Renewal will not contravene or constitute an event
which itself or which with the passing of time or giving of notice or both would
constitute a default under any trust deed, deed of trust, loan agreement,
indenture or other agreement to which Maker is a party or by which Maker or any
of its property is bound.  Maker hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Payee against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred as a result of any representation or
warranty made by Maker in this Section 2 proving to be untrue in any material
respect.


     3.  To the extent that the Note is inconsistent with the terms of this
Seventh Renewal, the Note is hereby modified and amended.  Except as modified,
renewed and extended by this Seventh Renewal, the Note and the Security
Instruments remain unchanged and continue unabated and in full force and effect
as the valid and binding obligation of the Maker.


     4.  In conjunction with the extension, renewal and modification of the Note
and the Security Instruments, Maker hereby extends and renews the liens,
security interests, and assignments created and granted in the Security
Instruments until the indebtedness secured thereby, as so extended, renewed and
modified, has been fully paid, and agrees that such extension, renewal and
modification shall in no manner affect or impair the Note, the liens or security
interests securing same, and that said liens, security interests, and
assignments shall not in any manner be waived.  The purpose of this Seventh
Renewal is simply to extend the time of payment of the loan evidenced by the
Note and any indebtedness secured by the Security Instruments, as modified by
this Seventh Renewal, and to carry forward all liens and security interests
securing the same, which are acknowledged by Maker to be valid and subsisting.

                                       3

     5.  Maker covenants and warrants that the Payee is not in default under the
Note or Security Instruments, each as modified by this Seventh Renewal
(collectively referred to as the "Loan Instruments") that there are no defenses,
counterclaims or offsets to such Loan Instruments; and that all of the
provisions of the Loan Instruments, as amended hereby, are in full force and
effect.


     6.  Maker agrees to pay all costs incurred in connection with the execution
and consummation of this Seventh Renewal, including but not limited to, all
recording costs, the premium for an endorsement to the Mortgagee Policy of Title
Insurance insuring the validity and priority of the Original Deed of Trust in
form satisfactory to Payee, and the reasonable fees and expenses of Payee's
counsel.


     7.  If any covenant, condition, or provision herein contained is held to be
invalid by final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
of such covenant, condition, or provision shall not in any way affect any other
covenant, condition, or provision herein contained.


     8.  Payee is an unincorporated trust organized under the Texas Real Estate
Investment Trust Act.  Neither the shareholders of Payee, nor its Trust
Managers, officers, employees, or other agents shall be personally, corporately,
or individually liable, in any manner whatsoever, for any debt, act, omission,
or obligation of Payee, and all persons having claims of any kind whatsoever
against Payee shall look solely to the property of Payee for the enforcement of
their rights (whether monetary or nonmonetary) against Payee.


     EXECUTED this day and year first above written, but effective for all
purposes as of December 1, 1995.

          each Special Letter of Credit thereunder an amount not to EXCEED THE
          applicable Letter of Credit Amount (as defined in each Special Letter
          of Credit) then in effect (as the same may be adjusted in accordance
          with the terms of such Special Letter of Credit from time to time),
          which is initially, for the Series 1995 Lafayette Bonds, the sum of

          being an amount equal to $128,934.25, for an aggregate amount of
          principal and interest initially equal to $3,863,934.25, and for the
          Series 1995 Calcasieu Bonds, the sum of $1,990,000 in respect of the
          initial aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Series 1995
          Calcasieu Bonds plus 105 days of interest on the Bonds computed at the
                          ----
          rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum calculated on the basis of a

          aggregate amount of principal and interest initially equal to
          $2,058,695.89, in each case, less all amounts drawn under such Special
          Letters of Credit prior to such time, plus all increases and minus all
          decreases in accordance with paragraph 2 of such Special Letters of
          Credit prior to such time. A Full Drawing or Partial Drawing under a
          Special Letter of Credit in respect of an optional redemption of the
          Bonds pursuant to the Indenture shall require the consent of all
          Banks, as evidenced to the Trustee and the Credit Facility Trustee by
          written consent of the Agent. The maximum amount that may be drawn
          under each Special Letter of Credit is the applicable Letter of Credit
          Amount as calculated hereunder.

              (i) Upon the presentment of any draft for honor in connection with
          a Purchase Drawing under any Special Letter of Credit by the
          beneficiary thereof which the Issuing Bank determines is in compliance
          with the conditions for payment thereunder, the Issuing Bank shall
          promptly notify the Borrower, the Agent, and each Bank of the intended
          date of honor of such draft. In the event of a Purchase Drawing under
          a Special Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of such Letter
          of Credit, the Borrower hereby promises and agrees to pay to the Agent
          for the account of the Issuing Bank, notwithstanding paragraph (d) of
          this Section 2.03, by 9:00 A.M. (Houston, Texas time) on the 30th day
          after the date of honor of such Purchase Drawing (the "Payment Date"),
          the full amount of all principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on
          each Liquidity Bank Bond, plus the Interest Differential, if any, at
          such time (the "Purchase Price"), in immediately available funds,
          unless the Issuing Bank shall have been previously reimbursed for the
          amount thereof as a result of remarketing of such Liquidity Bank Bonds
          in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Remarketing
          Agreement before such date. Upon receipt of payment of an amount equal
          to the Purchase Price by the Agent for the account of the Issuing
          Bank, the Agent shall notify the Tender Agent to deliver the Liquidity
          Bank Bonds to the Borrower if such payment was made by

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
          or on behalf of the Borrower, and otherwise to the Remarketing Agent,
          in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Remarketing
          Agreement. Each Bank shall, notwithstanding any other provision of
          this Agreement (including the occurrence and continuance of a Default
          or an Event of Default), make available to the Agent for the benefit
          of the Issuing Bank an amount equal to its Pro Rata Percentage of the
          amount of the presented draft under the respective Special Letter of
          Credit on the date on which such draft shall have been honored by the
          Issuing Bank. If such amount is not in fact made available to the
          Agent by any such Bank on such date, then such Bank shall pay to the
          Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, on demand made by the
          Issuing Bank, in addition to such amount, an amount equal to the
          product of (i) the average daily Effective Federal Funds Rate per
          annum during the period referred to in clause (iii) of this sentence
          times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage of the amount
          -----
          of the presented draft times (iii) the number of days that elapse from
                                 -----
          the day the Issuing Bank has honored such draft to the date on which
          the amount equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage of the amount of
          the presented draft becomes immediately available to the Issuing Bank
          divided (iv) by 360. The Liquidity Bank Bonds shall, in accordance
          -------
          with the applicable Indenture, as of the date of payment of such
          draft, bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the
          lesser of (i) the Prime Rate per annum or (ii) the Maximum Rate. In
          the event that the Purchase Price for Liquidity Bank Bonds shall not
          have been paid by the Payment Date as required hereunder, and the
          Issuing Bank shall not have been otherwise reimbursed, the portion of
          the Purchase Price not paid or reimbursed, notwithstanding any other
          provision of this Agreement (including the occurrence and the
          continuance of a Default or an Event of Default), shall be deemed
          automatically and without any action by the Borrower to be an Advance
          in an amount equal to such portion of the Purchase Price not paid or
          reimbursed (including, without limitation, the Interest Differential,
          if any) which is immediately due and payable, bearing interest at a
          rate per annum equal to the lesser of the Prime Rate, plus 1.00% per
          annum, or the Highest Lawful Rate, and the Borrower shall be deemed to
          have purchased such Liquidity Bank Bonds. Such Advance shall be deemed
          a payment by Borrower of an amount equal to the Purchase Price to the
          Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank. The Agent shall promptly
          notify the Tender Agent to deliver the Liquidity Bank Bonds to the
          Agent for the benefit of Borrower to be held by the

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
          Agent as collateral securing such Advance. The Borrower hereby grants
          to the Agent, for the benefit of each Bank, a Lien on and a security
          interest in such Liquidity Bank Bonds, until such time as such Advance
          shall have been paid in full. Each drawing on a Special Letter of
          Credit other than a Purchase Drawing and the reimbursement obligation
          of the Borrower in respect thereof, shall, notwithstanding the
          delivery of Bonds in respect thereof to the Tender Agent as custodian
          for the Banks, be governed by paragraph (d) of this Section 2.03.
          Nothing in this paragraph (i) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
          diminish the Borrower's obligation under this Agreement to provide the
          funds for the payment of, or on demand to reimburse the Issuing Bank
          for payment of, any draft presented to, and duly honored by, the
          Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit at the time and in the manner
          provided under this Section 2.03 for each Letter of Credit, including
          without limitation, the Special Letters of Credit, and the automatic
          funding of an Advance as in this paragraph provided shall not
          constitute a cure or waiver of the Event of Default for failure to
          timely provide such funds as in this paragraph agreed.

             (j) Other than for purposes of calculation of the principal amount
          of Letters of Credit issued and outstanding under Section 2.01 of this
          Agreement, each drawing honored in accordance with Section 2.03(i)
          shall automatically reduce the Letter of Credit Amount of the
          applicable Special Letter of Credit; provided that (i) with respect to
          any Partial Drawing, the Letter of Credit Amount shall be
          automatically increased immediately following such payment by the
          amount paid for accrued interest on the Bonds (other than such
          interest component attributable to the Bonds, the principal of which
          was paid with the proceeds of such drawing) in connection therewith
          (provided that such automatic reinstatement shall be revoked upon
          notice from the Agent to the Credit Facility Trustee, at the request
          of the Majority Banks, of such revocation within seven (7) calendar
          days from and after the date on which such drawing was honored), and
          (ii) with respect to any Purchase Drawing, the Letter of Credit Amount
          shall be automatically increased by an amount equal to (x) the amount
          drawn by such Purchase Drawing upon reimbursement of such amount to
          the Issuing Bank, less (y) the portion of the amount in clause (x)
                            ----
          hereof representing principal and interest attributable to any
          Liquidity Bank Bonds, or Bonds held at such time in the name of the
          Borrower, the Issuer or the User. The Agent shall provide notice to
          the Credit Facility Trustee and the Trustee of receipt of funds in

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
          respect of reimbursement for each drawing under a Special Letter of
          Credit which has been honored by the Issuing Bank, specifying the date
          and amount of such reimbursement, and of the related drawing; provided
          that, failure to provide such notice shall not diminish the
          obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

              (k) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Special
          Letters of Credit shall be governed in all respects by the terms and
          provisions of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Third
          Amendment.

          proceeds of amounts paid to the Issuing Bank for reimbursement of a
          drawing under a Special Letter of Credit honored by the Issuing Bank
          shall be promptly thereafter distributed by the Agent to each Bank in
          accordance with such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage interest in such
          Special Letter of Credit for reduction of principal or interest
          outstanding, as the case may be, with respect to such Bank's
          participation in such drawing.

          (e) Section 7.12 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended by deleting
the first sentence following clause (iv) in said Section 7.12, and substituting
in lieu thereof the following:

          Notwithstanding the above, and in any event, except for (i) Guaranties
          by the Borrower of indebtedness or obligations of any Subsidiary, or
          (ii) Guaranties of any Subsidiary of indebtedness or obligations of

          of the Dugas Partnership In Commendam in respect of the Series 1995
          Lafayette Bonds and the Special Letter of Credit issued in connection
          therewith, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall enter into
          any Guaranty (other than checks deposited and/or endorsed in the
          ordinary course of business of the Borrower or any Subsidiary) unless
          (A) liability incurred by the Borrower or such Subsidiary under such
          Guaranty is secured and is for a Primary Obligor's indebtedness or
          other obligation, and (B) upon payment by the Borrower or such

          the Guaranty or, after compliance with

          applicable foreclosure proceedings specified by law or otherwise
          agreed upon, the Borrower or such Subsidiary will become subrogated to

22, 1994 (as it has been and may be hereafter amended or otherwise modified and
in effect from time to time, the "Credit Agreement");

          WHEREAS, the Banks and the Borrower wish to amend the Credit Agreement
to reduce the amount payable for the Unused Borrowing Commitment Fee, to add
Commerzbank as a lender under the Credit Agreement, and to amend certain related
provisions under the Credit Aareement:

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Banks, the Agent and the
Borrower agree as follows:

          (a) Section 2.04 (a) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended solely
for the period commencing retroactively on August 1, 1995, to and including
November 21, 1996 by:

              (i) deleting from the first line of the Unused Borrowing

of the Effective Date (as defined below) to delete the number "$80,000,000" in

          WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS (the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the
principal sum of $2,000,000, on the Stated Maturity Date specified above (or any
Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined on the reverse hereof) (each
such Stated Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date being hereinafter
referred to as the "Maturity Date") with respect to the principal repayable on
such date) and to pay interest thereon, at the Interest Rate per annum specified
above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment,
and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally
enforceable) at the Default Rate per annum specified above on any overdue
principal, premium and/or interest. The Company will pay interest in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an "Interest Payment
Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the
Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date; provided,
however, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Regular Record Date
(as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest
payments will commence on the second Interest Payment Date next succeeding the
Original Issue Date to the Holder of this Note on the Regular Record Date with
respect to such second Interest Payment Date. Interest on this Note will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or
"Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note
shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such
"Other/Additional Provisions".

          Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately
preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been
paid or duly provided for with respect to this Note) to, but excluding, the
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each,
an "Interest Period").  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions
described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the March 1 and
September 1 next preceding the March 15 and September 15 (whether or not a
Market Day, as defined below) Interest Payment Dates (the "Regular Record
Date"); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be
payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon
shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note ("Defaulted Interest")
will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date, and
shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close
of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to,
notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less
than 10 calendar days

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
prior to such Special Record Date, or shall be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner, all as more completely described in the Indenture applicable to
this Note.

          "Business Day", as used herein for any particular location, means each
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which
banking institutions in such location are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.

          Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest in
respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be
made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note
(and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, a duly completed
election form as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the Paying Agent Office
as the Company may determine; provided, however, that if such payment is to be
made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars as set forth below, such
payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account with a bank located in the Principal Financial Center of the country
issuing the Specified Currency (or, for Notes denominated in European Currency
Units ("ECUs"), to an ECU account) or other jurisdiction acceptable to the
Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated by the Holder hereof
at least five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank
has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note (and, if applicable, a
duly completed election form) is presented and surrendered at the aforementioned
Paying Agent Office in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such
funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Such designation shall be made
by filing the appropriate information with the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent
Office in The City of New York, and, unless revoked, any such designation made
with respect to this Note by its registered Holder will remain in effect with
respect to any further payments with respect to this Note payable to its Holder.
If a payment with respect to this Note cannot be made by wire transfer because
the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before
the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed  to the
Holder of this Note at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant
to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of
such a designation, such payment will be made within five Business Days of such
receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holder of this
Note.

          Payments of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the
Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by check mailed to the
address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
Security Register maintained at the Payment Agent Office; provided, however,
that a Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency specified above
is other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or
more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or
different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on
such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by
the Paying Agent not less than five calendar days prior to such Interest Payment
Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Paying Agent shall
remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

          If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that
is not a Market Day (as defined below), the required payment of principal,
premium, if any, and/or interest need not be made on such day, but may be made
on the next succeeding Market Day with the same force and effect as if made on
the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such
payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity
Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding
Market Day.

           As used herein, "Market Day" means:

           (a) for any Note other than a Note the repayment in respect of which
           is to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any
           Business Day in The City of New York;

           (b) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in a
           Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any Business Day in the
           Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing
           such Specified Currency which is also a Business Day in The City of
           New York; and

           (c) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in ECUs,
           any Business Day in The City of New York that is also not a day that
           appears as an ECU non-settlement day on the display designated as
           "ISDE" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or a day so
           designed by the ECU Banking Association) or, if the ECU non-
           settlement days do not appear on that page (and are not so
           designated), is not a day on which payments in ECUs cannot be settled
           in the international interbank market).

          "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country
issuing the Specified Currency in respect of which payment on the Notes is to be
made, except that with respect to U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, German
Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and ECUs, the Principal
Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

          The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency (or, if the
Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts, in such other coin or currency of the
country which issued the Specified Currency as at the time of such payment is
legal tender for the payment of such debts).  If the Specified Currency is other
than U.S. dollars, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted
by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into U.S.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note; provided, however, that the
Holder of this Note may elect to receive such amounts in the Specified Currency
pursuant to the provisions set forth below.

          Payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any
Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign
Currency Note") will be made in U.S. dollars if the registered Holder of such
Note on the relevant Regular Record Date, or at maturity, as the case may be,
has transmitted a written request for such payment in U.S. dollars to the Paying
Agent at the Paying Agent Office in The City of New York on or before such
Regular Record Date, or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be.
Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by cable,
telex, or other form of facsimile transmission. Any such request made for any
Note by a registered Holder will remain in effect for any further payments of
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Note payable to such
Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the relevant Regular Record
Date or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be. Holders of Notes
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars that are registered
in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether and how to elect to receive payments in U.S. dollars.

          The U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note who elects to receive payment in U.S. dollars will be based on the
highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate
Agent as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Market Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
Holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the
applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations
are not available on the second Market Day preceding the date of payment of
principal (and premium, if any) or interest for any Note, such payment will be
made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs associated with any
payment in U.S. dollars on any such Note will be borne by the Holder thereof by
deductions from such payment.

          A Holder of a Foreign Currency Note may elect to receive payment of
the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Note in the Specified
Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable
record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case
may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand-delivered or sent by cable,
telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  A Holder of a Foreign Currency
Note may elect to receive payment in the applicable Specified Currency for all
such principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and need not file a
separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until
revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such
revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record
Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity

Date, as the case may be, Holders of Foreign Currency Notes whose Notes are to
be held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee
to determine whether and how an election to receive payments in the applicable
Specified Currency may be made.

          If the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note is
payable in other than U.S. dollars and such Specified Currency (other than ECUs)
is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to
satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such payment
(including any such payment at maturity) in U.S. dollars on the basis of the
most recently available Exchange Rate. If the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on any Note is payable in ECUs, and the ECU is not available due to
the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of
the Company or the ECU is used neither as the unit of account of the European
Communities nor as the currency of the European Union, the Company will be
entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such
payment (including any such payment at maturity) in a component currency of the
ECU chosen by the Exchange Rate Agent.

          Any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York
received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City
time, on the second Market Day preceding the applicable payment date from three
recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent)
selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the quoting
dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of
Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which
the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange
costs will be borne by the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by deductions
from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments
will be made in the Specified Currency.

          If the applicable Specified Currency is not available for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency
Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond
the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its
obligations to the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by making such payment
in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Market
Day prior to such payment or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or
as otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.  The "Market
Exchange Rate" for a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars means the noon
dollar buying rate in The City of New York for the cable transfer for such
Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified,
as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

If payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note is required to be made in any
currency unit (e.g., ECU), and such currency unit is unavailable due to the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's
control, then the Company will be entitled, but not required, to make any
payments in respect of such Note in U.S. dollars until such currency unit is
again available.  The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed
on the basis of the equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars, which shall
be determined by the Company or its agent on the following basis.  The component
currencies of the currency unit for this purpose (collectively, the "Component
Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall  be the currency amounts
that were components of the currency unit as of the last day on which the
currency unit was used.  The equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars
shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Component
Currencies.  The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies
shall be determined by the Company or its agent on the basis of the most
recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency.

          If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component
Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.  If two or more
Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of
those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency.  If any Component Currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component
Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the
sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.

          All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent
shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set
forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified above, in the Addendum hereto,
which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on
the face hereof.

          Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit
under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                       SENIOR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A
                                  (Fixed Rate)


          This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the
"Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture,
dated as of May 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time
(the "Indenture"), between the Company and Texas Commerce Bank National
Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the
Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is
one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Due 9 Months or more from Date of Issue" (the "Notes").  All terms used but not
defined in this Note specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture.

          This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons.  Notes
denominated in U.S. dollars will be initially issued in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof, and Notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars
will be initially issued in denominations of the amount of the Specified
Currency for such Note equivalent, at the noon buying rate for cable transfers
in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") on the
first Market Day next preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer
to purchase such Note, to $1,000 and integral multiples thereof (or the
equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency for such Note). Interest rates
offered by the Company with respect to a Note may differ depending upon, among
other things, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes purchased in any
single transaction.

          This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless
otherwise provided on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the
following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the
Stated Maturity Date.

          This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company
on any date on and after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on
the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S.
$1,000 or the minimum authorized denomination (provided that any remaining
principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such minimum authorized
denomination, at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid
interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (each, a "Redemption
Date"), on notice given no more than

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture.  The "Redemption Price" shall initially be
the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof multiplied by the
unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption
Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face
hereof until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be
redeemed.  In the event of redemption of the Note in part only, a new Note of
like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms
as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of
the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the
face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or the minimum
authorized denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof
shall be a minimum authorized denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100%
of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest
accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (each, a "Repayment Date").  For
this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form
herein entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at
its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior
to the Repayment Date.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof
will be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new
Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same
terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note as specified on the
face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of
redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to (i) the
Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) as of the date of such event, plus (ii)
with respect to any redemption, the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any) minus 100% multiplied by
the Issue Price specified on the face hereof, net of any portion of such Issue
Price which has been paid prior to the Redemption Date, or the portion of the
Issue Price (or the net amount) proportionate to the portion of the unpaid
principal amount to be redeemed, plus (iii) any accrued interest to the date of
such event the payment of which would constitute qualified stated interest
payments within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.1273-1(c) under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The "Amortized Face
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Issue Price plus (ii) the
aggregate portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts
considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note
within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Code, whether denominated as
principal or interest, over the Issue Price) which shall theretofore have
accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section
1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the Original Issue Date to the date of
determination, minus (iii) any amount considered as part

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note which has been paid
from the Original Issue Date to the date of determination.

          If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire
indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with
respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set
forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time
outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Debt Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all such
Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Debt Securities, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders
of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon the Note.

          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in
respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin
or currency, herein prescribed.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the
Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office  or agency of the Company in any place where the
principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed
by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and
herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Notes of different authorized denominations but otherwise having the
same terms and conditions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the
same.

          No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

          Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

          The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely in such State.

          WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS (the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to      CEDE & CO.        , or registered
assigns, the principal sum of       $5,000,000         , on the Stated Maturity
Date specified above (or any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined
on the reverse hereof) (each such Stated Maturity Date, Redemption Date or
Repayment Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date") with
respect to the principal repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon, at
the Interest Rate per annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid
or duly made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable) at the Default Rate per annum specified
above on any overdue principal, premium and/or interest.  The Company will pay
interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above
(each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the
Maturity Date; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between
a Regular Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest
Payment Date, interest payments will commence on the second Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date to the Holder of this Note on the
Regular Record Date with respect to such second Interest Payment Date.  Interest
on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or
"Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note
shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such
"Other/Additional Provisions".

          Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately
preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been
paid or duly provided for with respect to this Note) to, but excluding, the
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each,
an "Interest Period").  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions
described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the March 1 and
September 1 next preceding the March 15 and September 15 (whether or not a
Market Day, as defined below) Interest Payment Dates (the "Regular Record
Date"); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be
payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon
shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note ("Defaulted Interest")
will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date, and
shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close
of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to,
notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less
than 10 calendar days

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
prior to such Special Record Date, or shall be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner, all as more completely described in the Indenture applicable to
this Note.

          "Business Day", as used herein for any particular location, means each
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which
banking institutions in such location are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.

          Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest in
respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be
made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note
(and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, a duly completed
election form as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the Paying Agent Office
as the Company may determine; provided, however, that if such payment is to be
made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars as set forth below, such
payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account with a bank located in the Principal Financial Center of the country
issuing the Specified Currency (or, for Notes denominated in European Currency
Units ("ECUs"), to an ECU account) or other jurisdiction acceptable to the
Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated by the Holder hereof
at least five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank
has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note (and, if applicable, a
duly completed election form) is presented and surrendered at the aforementioned
Paying Agent Office in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such
funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Such designation shall be made
by filing the appropriate information with the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent
Office in The City of New York, and, unless revoked, any such designation made
with respect to this Note by its registered Holder will remain in effect with
respect to any further payments with respect to this Note payable to its Holder.
If a payment with respect to this Note cannot be made by wire transfer because
the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before
the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed to the
Holder of this Note at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant
to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of
such a designation, such payment will be made within five Business Days of such
receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holder of this
Note.

          Payments of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the
Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by check mailed to the
address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
Security Register maintained at the Payment Agent Office; provided, however,
that a Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency specified above
is other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or
more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or
different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on
such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by
the Paying Agent not less than five calendar days prior to such Interest Payment
Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Paying Agent shall
remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

          If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that
is not a Market Day (as defined below), the required payment of principal,
premium, if any, and/or interest need not be made on such day, but may be made
on the next succeeding Market Day with the same force and effect as if made on
the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such
payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity
Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding
Market Day.

          As used herein, "Market Day" means:

          (a) for any Note other than a Note the repayment in respect of which
          is to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any
          Business Day in The City of New York;

          (b) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in a
          Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any Business Day in the
          Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing
          such Specified Currency which is also a Business Day in The City of
          New York; and

          (c) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in ECUs,
          any Business Day in The City of New York that is also not a day that
          appears as an ECU non-settlement day on the display designated as
          "ISDE" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or a day so
          designed by the ECU Banking Association) or, if the ECU non-settlement
          days do not appear on that page (and are not so designated), is not a
          day on which payments in ECUs cannot be settled in the international
          interbank market).

          "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country
issuing the Specified Currency in respect of which payment on the Notes is to be
made, except that with respect to U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, German
Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and ECUs, the Principal
Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

          The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency (or, if the
Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts, in such other coin or currency of the
country which issued the Specified Currency as at the time of such payment is
legal tender for the payment of such debts).  If the Specified Currency is other
than U.S. dollars, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted
by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into U.S.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note; provided, however, that the
Holder of this Note may elect to receive such amounts in the Specified Currency
pursuant to the provisions set forth below.

          Payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any
Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign
Currency Note") will be made in U.S. dollars if the registered Holder of such
Note on the relevant Regular Record Date, or at maturity, as the case may be,
has transmitted a written request for such payment in U.S. dollars to the Paying
Agent at the Paying Agent Office in The City of New York on or before such
Regular Record Date, or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be.
Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by cable,
telex, or other form of facsimile transmission. Any such request made for any
Note by a registered Holder will remain in effect for any further payments of
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Note payable to such
Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the relevant Regular Record
Date or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be. Holders of Notes
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars that are registered
in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether and how to elect to receive payments in U.S. dollars.

          The U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note who elects to receive payment in U.S. dollars will be based on the
highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate
Agent as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Market Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
Holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the
applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations
are not available on the second Market Day preceding the date of payment of
principal (and premium, if any) or interest for any Note, such payment will be
made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs associated with any
payment in U.S. dollars on any such Note will be borne by the Holder thereof by
deductions from such payment.

          A Holder of a Foreign Currency Note may elect to receive payment of
the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Note in the Specified
Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable
record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case
may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand-delivered or sent by cable,
telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  A Holder of a Foreign Currency
Note may elect to receive payment in the applicable Specified Currency for all
such principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and need not file a
separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until
revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such
revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record
Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
Date, as the case may be, Holders of Foreign Currency Notes whose Notes are to
be held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee
to determine whether and how an election to receive payments in the applicable
Specified Currency may be made.

          If the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note is
payable in other than U.S. dollars and such Specified Currency (other than ECUs)
is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to
satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such payment
(including any such payment at maturity) in U.S. dollars on the basis of the
most recently available Exchange Rate. If the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on any Note is payable in ECUs, and the ECU is not available due to
the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of
the Company or the ECU is used neither as the unit of account of the European
Communities nor as the currency of the European Union, the Company will be
entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such
payment (including any such payment at maturity) in a component currency of the
ECU chosen by the Exchange Rate Agent.

          Any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York
received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City
time, on the second Market Day preceding the applicable payment date from three
recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent)
selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the quoting
dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of
Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which
the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange
costs will be borne by the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by deductions
from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments
will be made in the Specified Currency.

          If the applicable Specified Currency is not available for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency
Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond
the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its
obligations to the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by making such payment
in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Market
Day prior to such payment or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or
as otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.  The "Market
Exchange Rate" for a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars means the noon
dollar buying rate in The City of New York for the cable transfer for such
Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified,
as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

                                      -7-

If payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note is required to be made in any
currency unit (e.g., ECU), and such currency unit is unavailable due to the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's
control, then the Company will be entitled, but not required, to make any
payments in respect of such Note in U.S. dollars until such currency unit is
again available.  The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed
on the basis of the equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars, which shall
be determined by the Company or its agent on the following basis.  The component
currencies of the currency unit for this purpose (collectively, the "Component
Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall  be the currency amounts
that were components of the currency unit as of the last day on which the
currency unit was used.  The equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars
shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Component
Currencies.  The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies
shall be determined by the Company or its agent on the basis of the most
recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency.

          If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component
Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.  If two or more
Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of
those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency.  If any Component Currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component
Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the
sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.

          All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent
shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set
forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified above, in the Addendum hereto,
which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on
the face hereof.

          Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit
under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                       SENIOR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A
                                  (Fixed Rate)


          This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the
"Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture,
dated as of May 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time
(the "Indenture"), between the Company and Texas Commerce Bank National
Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the
Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is
one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Due 9 Months or more from Date of Issue" (the "Notes").  All terms used but not
defined in this Note specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture.

          This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons.  Notes
denominated in U.S. dollars will be initially issued in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof, and Notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars
will be initially issued in denominations of the amount of the Specified
Currency for such Note equivalent, at the noon buying rate for cable transfers
in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") on the
first Market Day next preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer
to purchase such Note, to $1,000 and integral multiples thereof (or the
equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency for such Note). Interest rates
offered by the Company with respect to a Note may differ depending upon, among
other things, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes purchased in any
single transaction.

          This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless
otherwise provided on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the
following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the
Stated Maturity Date.

          This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company
on any date on and after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on
the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S.
$1,000 or the minimum authorized denomination (provided that any remaining
principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such minimum authorized
denomination, at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid
interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (each, a "Redemption
Date"), on notice given no more than

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture.  The "Redemption Price" shall initially be
the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof multiplied by the
unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption
Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face
hereof until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be
redeemed.  In the event of redemption of the Note in part only, a new Note of
like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms
as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of
the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the
face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or the minimum
authorized denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof
shall be a minimum authorized denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100%
of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest
accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (each, a "Repayment Date").  For
this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form
herein entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at
its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior
to the Repayment Date.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof
will be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new
Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same
terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note as specified on the
face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of
redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to (i) the
Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) as of the date of such event, plus (ii)
with respect to any redemption, the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any) minus 100% multiplied by
the Issue Price specified on the face hereof, net of any portion of such Issue
Price which has been paid prior to the Redemption Date, or the portion of the
Issue Price (or the net amount) proportionate to the portion of the unpaid
principal amount to be redeemed, plus (iii) any accrued interest to the date of
such event the payment of which would constitute qualified stated interest
payments within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.1273-1(c) under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The "Amortized Face
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Issue Price plus (ii) the
aggregate portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts
considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note
within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Code, whether denominated as
principal or interest, over the Issue Price) which shall theretofore have
accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section
1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the Original Issue Date to the date of
determination, minus (iii) any amount considered as part

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note which has been paid
from the Original Issue Date to the date of determination.

          If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire
indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with
respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set
forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time
outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Debt Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all such
Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Debt Securities, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders
of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon the Note.

          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in
respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin
or currency, herein prescribed.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the
Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office  or agency of the Company in any place where the
principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed
by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be

          WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS (the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the
principal sum of $10,000,000, on the Stated Maturity Date specified above (or
any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined on the reverse hereof)
(each such Stated Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date being
hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date") with respect to the principal
repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon, at the Interest Rate per
annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available
for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable) at the Default Rate per annum specified above on any
overdue principal, premium and/or interest. The Company will pay interest in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an
"Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next
succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date;
provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Regular
Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date,
interest payments will commence on the second Interest Payment Date next
succeeding the Original Issue Date to the Holder of this Note on the Regular
Record Date with respect to such second Interest Payment Date. Interest on this
Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or
"Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note
shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such
"Other/Additional Provisions".

          Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately
preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been
paid or duly provided for with respect to this Note) to, but excluding, the
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each,
an "Interest Period").  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions
described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the March 1 and
September 1 next preceding the March 15 and September 15 (whether or not a
Market Day, as defined below) Interest Payment Dates (the "Regular Record
Date"); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be
payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon
shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note ("Defaulted Interest")
will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date, and
shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close
of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to,
notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less
than 10 calendar days

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
prior to such Special Record Date, or shall be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner, all as more completely described in the Indenture applicable to
this Note.

          "Business Day", as used herein for any particular location, means each
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which
banking institutions in such location are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.

          Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest in
respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be
made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note
(and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, a duly completed
election form as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the Paying Agent Office
as the Company may determine; provided, however, that if such payment is to be
made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars as set forth below, such
payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account with a bank located in the Principal Financial Center of the country
issuing the Specified Currency (or, for Notes denominated in European Currency
Units ("ECUs"), to an ECU account) or other jurisdiction acceptable to the
Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated by the Holder hereof
at least five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank
has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note (and, if applicable, a
duly completed election form) is presented and surrendered at the aforementioned
Paying Agent Office in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such
funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Such designation shall be made
by filing the appropriate information with the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent
Office in The City of New York, and, unless revoked, any such designation made
with respect to this Note by its registered Holder will remain in effect with
respect to any further payments with respect to this Note payable to its Holder.
If a payment with respect to this Note cannot be made by wire transfer because
the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before
the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed  to the
Holder of this Note at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant
to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of
such a designation, such payment will be made within five Business Days of such
receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holder of this
Note.

          Payments of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the
Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by check mailed to the
address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
Security Register maintained at the Payment Agent Office; provided, however,
that a Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency specified above
is other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or
more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or
different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on
such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by
the Paying Agent not less than five calendar days prior to such Interest Payment
Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Paying Agent shall
remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

          If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that
is not a Market Day (as defined below), the required payment of principal,
premium, if any, and/or interest need not be made on such day, but may be made
on the next succeeding Market Day with the same force and effect as if made on
the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such
payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity
Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding
Market Day.

          As used herein, "Market Day" means:
          
          (a) for any Note other than a Note the repayment in respect of which
          is to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any
          Business Day in The City of New York;
          
          (b) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in a
          Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any Business Day in the
          Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing
          such Specified Currency which is also a Business Day in The City of
          New York; and
          
          (c) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in ECUs,
          any Business Day in The City of New York that is also not a day that
          appears as an ECU non-settlement day on the display designated as
          "ISDE" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or a day so
          designed by the ECU Banking Association) or, if the ECU non-
          settlement days do not appear on that page (and are not so
          designated), is not a day on which payments in ECUs cannot be settled
          in the international interbank market).

          "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country
issuing the Specified Currency in respect of which payment on the Notes is to be
made, except that with respect to U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, German
Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and ECUs, the Principal
Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

          The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency (or, if the
Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts, in such other coin or currency of the
country which issued the Specified Currency as at the time of such payment is
legal tender for the payment of such debts).  If the Specified Currency is other
than U.S. dollars, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted
by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into U.S.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
 
dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note; provided, however, that the
Holder of this Note may elect to receive such amounts in the Specified Currency
pursuant to the provisions set forth below.

          Payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any
Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign
Currency Note") will be made in U.S. dollars if the registered Holder of such
Note on the relevant Regular Record Date, or at maturity, as the case may be,
has transmitted a written request for such payment in U.S. dollars to the Paying
Agent at the Paying Agent Office in The City of New York on or before such
Regular Record Date, or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be.
Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by cable,
telex, or other form of facsimile transmission. Any such request made for any
Note by a registered Holder will remain in effect for any further payments of
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Note payable to such
Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the relevant Regular Record
Date or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be. Holders of Notes
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars that are registered
in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether and how to elect to receive payments in U.S. dollars.

          The U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note who elects to receive payment in U.S. dollars will be based on the
highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate
Agent as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Market Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
Holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the
applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations
are not available on the second Market Day preceding the date of payment of
principal (and premium, if any) or interest for any Note, such payment will be
made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs associated with any
payment in U.S. dollars on any such Note will be borne by the Holder thereof by
deductions from such payment.

          A Holder of a Foreign Currency Note may elect to receive payment of
the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Note in the Specified
Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable
record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case
may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand-delivered or sent by cable,
telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  A Holder of a Foreign Currency
Note may elect to receive payment in the applicable Specified Currency for all
such principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and need not file a
separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until
revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such
revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record
Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
Date, as the case may be, Holders of Foreign Currency Notes whose Notes are to
be held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee
to determine whether and how an election to receive payments in the applicable
Specified Currency may be made.

          If the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note is
payable in other than U.S. dollars and such Specified Currency (other than ECUs)
is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to
satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such payment
(including any such payment at maturity) in U.S. dollars on the basis of the
most recently available Exchange Rate. If the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on any Note is payable in ECUs, and the ECU is not available due to
the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of
the Company or the ECU is used neither as the unit of account of the European
Communities nor as the currency of the European Union, the Company will be
entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such
payment (including any such payment at maturity) in a component currency of the
ECU chosen by the Exchange Rate Agent.

          Any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York
received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City
time, on the second Market Day preceding the applicable payment date from three
recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent)
selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the quoting
dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of
Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which
the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange
costs will be borne by the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by deductions
from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments
will be made in the Specified Currency.

          If the applicable Specified Currency is not available for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency
Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond
the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its
obligations to the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by making such payment
in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Market
Day prior to such payment or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or
as otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.  The "Market
Exchange Rate" for a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars means the noon
dollar buying rate in The City of New York for the cable transfer for such
Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified,
as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

                                      -7-

If payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note is required to be made in any
currency unit (e.g., ECU), and such currency unit is unavailable due to the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's
control, then the Company will be entitled, but not required, to make any
payments in respect of such Note in U.S. dollars until such currency unit is
again available.  The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed
on the basis of the equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars, which shall
be determined by the Company or its agent on the following basis.  The component
currencies of the currency unit for this purpose (collectively, the "Component
Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall  be the currency amounts
that were components of the currency unit as of the last day on which the
currency unit was used.  The equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars
shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Component
Currencies.  The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies
shall be determined by the Company or its agent on the basis of the most
recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency.

          If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component
Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.  If two or more
Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of
those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency.  If any Component Currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component
Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the
sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.

          All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent
shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set
forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified above, in the Addendum hereto,
which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on
the face hereof.

          Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by

                       SENIOR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A
                                  (Fixed Rate)


          This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the
"Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture,
dated as of May 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time
(the "Indenture"), between the Company and Texas Commerce Bank National
Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the
Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is
one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Due 9 Months or more from Date of Issue" (the "Notes").  All terms used but not
defined in this Note specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture.

          This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons.  Notes
denominated in U.S. dollars will be initially issued in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof, and Notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars
will be initially issued in denominations of the amount of the Specified
Currency for such Note equivalent, at the noon buying rate for cable transfers
in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") on the
first Market Day next preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer
to purchase such Note, to $1,000 and integral multiples thereof (or the
equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency for such Note). Interest rates
offered by the Company with respect to a Note may differ depending upon, among
other things, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes purchased in any
single transaction.

          This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless
otherwise provided on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the
following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the
Stated Maturity Date.

          This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company
on any date on and after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on
the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S.
$1,000 or the minimum authorized denomination (provided that any remaining
principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such minimum authorized
denomination, at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid
interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (each, a "Redemption
Date"), on notice given no more than

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture.  The "Redemption Price" shall initially be
the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof multiplied by the
unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption
Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face
hereof until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be
redeemed.  In the event of redemption of the Note in part only, a new Note of
like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms
as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of
the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the
face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or the minimum
authorized denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof
shall be a minimum authorized denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100%
of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest
accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (each, a "Repayment Date").  For
this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form
herein entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at
its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior
to the Repayment Date.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof
will be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new
Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same
terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note as specified on the
face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of
redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to (i) the
Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) as of the date of such event, plus (ii)
with respect to any redemption, the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any) minus 100% multiplied by
the Issue Price specified on the face hereof, net of any portion of such Issue
Price which has been paid prior to the Redemption Date, or the portion of the
Issue Price (or the net amount) proportionate to the portion of the unpaid
principal amount to be redeemed, plus (iii) any accrued interest to the date of
such event the payment of which would constitute qualified stated interest
payments within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.1273-1(c) under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The "Amortized Face
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Issue Price plus (ii) the
aggregate portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts
considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note
within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Code, whether denominated as
principal or interest, over the Issue Price) which shall theretofore have
accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section
1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the Original Issue Date to the date of
determination, minus (iii) any amount considered as part

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note which has been paid
from the Original Issue Date to the date of determination.

          If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire
indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with
respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set
forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time
outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Debt Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all such
Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Debt Securities, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders
of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon the Note.

          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in
respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin
or currency, herein prescribed.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the
Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office  or agency of the Company in any place where the
principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed
by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and
herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Notes of different authorized denominations but otherwise having the
same terms and conditions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the
same.

          No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

          Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

          The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely in such State.

          WEINGARTEN REALTY INVESTORS (the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to      CEDE & CO.        , or registered
assigns, the principal sum of       $2,000,000         , on the Stated Maturity
Date specified above (or any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined
on the reverse hereof) (each such Stated Maturity Date, Redemption Date or
Repayment Date being hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date") with
respect to the principal repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon, at
the Interest Rate per annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid
or duly made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable) at the Default Rate per annum specified
above on any overdue principal, premium and/or interest.  The Company will pay
interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above
(each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the
Maturity Date; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between
a Regular Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest
Payment Date, interest payments will commence on the second Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date to the Holder of this Note on the
Regular Record Date with respect to such second Interest Payment Date.  Interest
on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or
"Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note
shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such
"Other/Additional Provisions".

          Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately
preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been
paid or duly provided for with respect to this Note) to, but excluding, the
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each,
an "Interest Period").  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions
described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the March 1 and
September 1 next preceding the March 15 and September 15 (whether or not a
Market Day, as defined below) Interest Payment Dates (the "Regular Record
Date"); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be
payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon
shall be payable.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for
on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note ("Defaulted Interest")
will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date, and
shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close
of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to,
notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less
than 10 calendar days

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
prior to such Special Record Date, or shall be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner, all as more completely described in the Indenture applicable to
this Note.

          "Business Day", as used herein for any particular location, means each
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which
banking institutions in such location are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.

          Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest in
respect of this Note due on the Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be
made in immediately available funds upon presentation and surrender of this Note
(and, with respect to any applicable repayment of this Note, a duly completed
election form as contemplated on the reverse hereof) at the Paying Agent Office
as the Company may determine; provided, however, that if such payment is to be
made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars as set forth below, such
payment will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account with a bank located in the Principal Financial Center of the country
issuing the Specified Currency (or, for Notes denominated in European Currency
Units ("ECUs"), to an ECU account) or other jurisdiction acceptable to the
Company and the Paying Agent as shall have been designated by the Holder hereof
at least five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that such bank
has appropriate facilities therefor and that this Note (and, if applicable, a
duly completed election form) is presented and surrendered at the aforementioned
Paying Agent Office in time for the Paying Agent to make such payments in such
funds in accordance with its normal procedures.  Such designation shall be made
by filing the appropriate information with the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent
Office in The City of New York, and, unless revoked, any such designation made
with respect to this Note by its registered Holder will remain in effect with
respect to any further payments with respect to this Note payable to its Holder.
If a payment with respect to this Note cannot be made by wire transfer because
the required designation has not been received by the Paying Agent on or before
the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed  to the
Holder of this Note at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant
to which such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Paying Agent's receipt of
such a designation, such payment will be made within five Business Days of such
receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the Holder of this
Note.

          Payments of interest due on any Interest Payment Date other than the
Maturity Date to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by check mailed to the
address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
Security Register maintained at the Payment Agent Office; provided, however,
that a Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or, if the Specified Currency specified above
is other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency) or
more in aggregate principal amount of Notes (whether having identical or
different terms and provisions) will be entitled to receive interest payments on
such Interest Payment Date by wire transfer of immediately available

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by
the Paying Agent not less than five calendar days prior to such Interest Payment
Date.  Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Paying Agent shall
remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

          If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that
is not a Market Day (as defined below), the required payment of principal,
premium, if any, and/or interest need not be made on such day, but may be made
on the next succeeding Market Day with the same force and effect as if made on
the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such
payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity
Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding
Market Day.

          As used herein, "Market Day" means:

          (a) for any Note other than a Note the repayment in respect of which
          is to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any
          Business Day in The City of New York;

          (b) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in a
          Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, any Business Day in the
          Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing
          such Specified Currency which is also a Business Day in The City of
          New York; and

          (c) for a Note the payment in respect of which is to be made in ECUs,
          any Business Day in The City of New York that is also not a day that
          appears as an ECU non-settlement day on the display designated as
          "ISDE" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or a day so
          designed by the ECU Banking Association) or, if the ECU non-settlement
          days do not appear on that page (and are not so designated), is not a
          day on which payments in ECUs cannot be settled in the international
          interbank market).

          "Principal Financial Center" means the capital city of the country
issuing the Specified Currency in respect of which payment on the Notes is to be
made, except that with respect to U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, German
Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and ECUs, the Principal
Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Sydney, Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

          The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency (or, if the
Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts, in such other coin or currency of the
country which issued the Specified Currency as at the time of such payment is
legal tender for the payment of such debts).  If the Specified Currency is other
than U.S. dollars, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted
by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into U.S.

                                      -5-

dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note; provided, however, that the
Holder of this Note may elect to receive such amounts in the Specified Currency
pursuant to the provisions set forth below.

          Payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any
Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign
Currency Note") will be made in U.S. dollars if the registered Holder of such
Note on the relevant Regular Record Date, or at maturity, as the case may be,
has transmitted a written request for such payment in U.S. dollars to the Paying
Agent at the Paying Agent Office in The City of New York on or before such
Regular Record Date, or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be.
Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or sent by cable,
telex, or other form of facsimile transmission. Any such request made for any
Note by a registered Holder will remain in effect for any further payments of
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Note payable to such
Holder, unless such request is revoked on or before the relevant Regular Record
Date or the date 15 days before maturity, as the case may be. Holders of Notes
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars that are registered
in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether and how to elect to receive payments in U.S. dollars.

          The U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note who elects to receive payment in U.S. dollars will be based on the
highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate
Agent as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Market Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
Holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which the
applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such bid quotations
are not available on the second Market Day preceding the date of payment of
principal (and premium, if any) or interest for any Note, such payment will be
made in the Specified Currency. All currency exchange costs associated with any
payment in U.S. dollars on any such Note will be borne by the Holder thereof by
deductions from such payment.

          A Holder of a Foreign Currency Note may elect to receive payment of
the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Note in the Specified
Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable
record date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case
may be.  Such written request may be mailed or hand-delivered or sent by cable,
telex or other form of facsimile transmission.  A Holder of a Foreign Currency
Note may elect to receive payment in the applicable Specified Currency for all
such principal, premium, if any, and interest payments and need not file a
separate election for each payment.  Such election will remain in effect until
revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such
revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record
Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity

                                      -6-

Date, as the case may be, Holders of Foreign Currency Notes whose Notes are to
be held in the name of a broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee
to determine whether and how an election to receive payments in the applicable
Specified Currency may be made.

          If the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note is
payable in other than U.S. dollars and such Specified Currency (other than ECUs)
is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to
satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such payment
(including any such payment at maturity) in U.S. dollars on the basis of the
most recently available Exchange Rate. If the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on any Note is payable in ECUs, and the ECU is not available due to
the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of
the Company or the ECU is used neither as the unit of account of the European
Communities nor as the currency of the European Union, the Company will be
entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of such Note by making such
payment (including any such payment at maturity) in a component currency of the
ECU chosen by the Exchange Rate Agent.

          Any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a Holder of a Foreign
Currency Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York
received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City
time, on the second Market Day preceding the applicable payment date from three
recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent)
selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the quoting
dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of
Foreign Currency Notes scheduled to receive U.S. dollar payments and at which
the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract.  All currency exchange
costs will be borne by the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by deductions
from such payments.  If three such bid quotations are not available, payments
will be made in the Specified Currency.

          If the applicable Specified Currency is not available for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to a Foreign Currency
Note due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond
the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its
obligations to the Holder of such Foreign Currency Note by making such payment
in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second Market
Day prior to such payment or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate or
as otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.  The "Market
Exchange Rate" for a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars means the noon
dollar buying rate in The City of New York for the cable transfer for such
Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified,
as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

If payment in respect of a Foreign Currency Note is required to be made in any
currency unit (e.g., ECU), and such currency unit is unavailable due to the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's
control, then the Company will be entitled, but not required, to make any
payments in respect of such Note in U.S. dollars until such currency unit is
again available.  The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed
on the basis of the equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars, which shall
be determined by the Company or its agent on the following basis.  The component
currencies of the currency unit for this purpose (collectively, the "Component
Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall  be the currency amounts
that were components of the currency unit as of the last day on which the
currency unit was used.  The equivalent of the currency unit in U.S. dollars
shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Component
Currencies.  The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies
shall be determined by the Company or its agent on the basis of the most
recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency.

          If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component
Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.  If two or more
Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of
those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency.  If any Component Currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component
Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the
sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.

          All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent
shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.

          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set
forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified above, in the Addendum hereto,
which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on
the face hereof.

          Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit
under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                       SENIOR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A
                                  (Fixed Rate)


          This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the
"Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture,
dated as of May 1, 1995, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time
(the "Indenture"), between the Company and Texas Commerce Bank National
Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the
Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is
one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Due 9 Months or more from Date of Issue" (the "Notes").  All terms used but not
defined in this Note specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture.

          This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons.  Notes
denominated in U.S. dollars will be initially issued in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof, and Notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars
will be initially issued in denominations of the amount of the Specified
Currency for such Note equivalent, at the noon buying rate for cable transfers
in The City of New York for such Specified Currency (the "Exchange Rate") on the
first Market Day next preceding the date on which the Company accepts the offer
to purchase such Note, to $1,000 and integral multiples thereof (or the
equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency for such Note). Interest rates
offered by the Company with respect to a Note may differ depending upon, among
other things, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes purchased in any
single transaction.

          This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless
otherwise provided on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the
following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the
Stated Maturity Date.

          This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company
on any date on and after the Redemption Commencement Date, if any, specified on
the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S.
$1,000 or the minimum authorized denomination (provided that any remaining
principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such minimum authorized
denomination, at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid
interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (each, a "Redemption
Date"), on notice given no more than

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Redemption Date and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture.  The "Redemption Price" shall initially be
the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof multiplied by the
unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed.  The Initial Redemption
Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face
hereof until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be
redeemed.  In the event of redemption of the Note in part only, a new Note of
like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms
as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of
the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the
face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or the minimum
authorized denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof
shall be a minimum authorized denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100%
of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest
accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (each, a "Repayment Date").  For
this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form
herein entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at
its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior
to the Repayment Date.  Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof
will be irrevocable.  In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new
Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same
terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
presentation and surrender hereof.

          If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note as specified on the
face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of
redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to (i) the
Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) as of the date of such event, plus (ii)
with respect to any redemption, the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted
by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any) minus 100% multiplied by
the Issue Price specified on the face hereof, net of any portion of such Issue
Price which has been paid prior to the Redemption Date, or the portion of the
Issue Price (or the net amount) proportionate to the portion of the unpaid
principal amount to be redeemed, plus (iii) any accrued interest to the date of
such event the payment of which would constitute qualified stated interest
payments within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.1273-1(c) under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The "Amortized Face
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Issue Price plus (ii) the
aggregate portions of the original issue discount (the excess of the amounts
considered as part of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note
within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(2) of the Code, whether denominated as
principal or interest, over the Issue Price) which shall theretofore have
accrued pursuant to Section 1272 of the Code (without regard to Section
1272(a)(7) of the Code) from the Original Issue Date to the date of
determination, minus (iii) any amount considered as part

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
of the "stated redemption price at maturity" of this Note which has been paid
from the Original Issue Date to the date of determination.

          If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire
indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with
respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set
forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a
majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time
outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Debt Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all such
Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture.  Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of
not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Debt Securities, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders
of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon the Note.

          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in
respect of this Note at the times, places and rate or formula, and in the coin
or currency, herein prescribed.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein and herein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the
Security Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office  or agency of the Company in any place where the
principal hereof and any premium or interest hereon are payable, duly endorsed
by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and
herein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Notes of different authorized denominations but otherwise having the
same terms and conditions, as requested by the Holder hereof surrendering the
same.

          No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

          Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

          The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely in such State.

     The ratios of earnings to fixed charges were computed by dividing earnings
by fixed charges. The ratios of funds from operations before interest expense to
fixed charges were computed by dividing funds from operations before interest
expense by fixed charges. For these purposes, earnings is defined as income
before extraordinary charge plus fixed charges (excluding interest costs
capitalized). Funds from operations before interest expense is defined as net
income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and
extraordinary charge, less gains (loss) on sales of property and securities plus
interest on indebtedness. Fixed charges consist of interest on indebtedness
(including interest costs capitalized), amortization of debt costs and the
portion of rent expense representing an interest factor.
