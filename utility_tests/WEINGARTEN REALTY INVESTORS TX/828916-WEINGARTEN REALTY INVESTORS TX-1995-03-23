ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

     General.  Weingarten Realty Investors (the "Company"), an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act and its
predecessor entity began the ownership and development of shopping centers and
other commercial real estate in 1948.  The Company, as of December 31, 1994,
owned or had interests in 161 developed income-producing real estate projects,
141 of which were shopping centers, located in the Houston metropolitan area and
in other parts of Texas and in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Arizona, Maine and Tennessee.  The Company's other commercial real estate
projects included sixteen industrial projects, three multi-family housing
properties and one office building, which serves as the Company's headquarters.
The Company's interests in these projects aggregated approximately 16.3 million
square feet of building area and 71.2 million square feet of land area.  The
Company also owned interests in 24 parcels of unimproved land held for future
development which aggregated approximately 8.3 million square feet.

     The Company currently employs 163 persons, its principal executive offices
are located at 2600 Citadel Plaza Drive, Houston, Texas 77008, and its phone
number is (713) 866-6000.

     Reorganizations.  In December 1984, the Company engaged in a series of
transactions primarily designed to enable it to qualify as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes for the 1985 calendar
year and subsequent years.  The Company contributed certain assets considered
unsuitable for ownership by the Company as a REIT and $3.5 million in cash to
WRI Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), a Texas corporation and a newly-formed
subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for voting and non-voting common stock of
Holdings (which was subsequently distributed to the Company's shareholders) and
$26.8 million of mortgage bonds.  For additional information concerning
Holdings, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at
page 26.

     On March 22, 1988, the Company's shareholders approved the conversion of
the Company's form of organization from a Texas corporation to an unincorporated
trust organized under the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act.  The
conversion was effected by the Company's predecessor entity, Weingarten Realty,
Inc., transferring substantially all of its assets and liabilities to the newly-
formed Company in exchange for common shares of beneficial interest, $.03 par
value ("Common Shares"), in the Company.  The shareholders of the corporation
received Common Shares for their shares of Common Stock of the corporation (on a
share-for-share basis), and the trust continues the business that was previously
conducted by the corporation.  The change did not affect the registrant's
assets, liabilities, management or federal income tax status as a REIT.

     Management Services.  Through December 31, 1992, the Company contracted
with Weingarten Realty Management Company (the "Management Company"), whereby
the Management Company performed certain services for the Company as an
independent contractor.  The Management Company provided leasing and management
services with respect to the operation of substantially all of the Company's
properties including collecting rent, making repairs, cleaning and providing
maintenance.  In addition, the Management Company performed acquisition and
development services for the Company such as conducting feasibility studies on
properties subject to purchase, constructing additional improvements on its
existing properties, developing new properties or renovating existing
improvements.  The Management Company paid all operating expenses of the
properties out of the rents collected from such properties and was required to
maintain books and records and to furnish to the Company monthly and annual
financial reports and annual budgets for each property.   The Management Company
was paid a fee under the management agreement for managing the Company's
properties based on gross revenues from the Company's income producing
properties and was paid additional fees for leasing services and for certain
additional services specifically requested by the Company, including market
research, advertising and promotion, development, acquisition and management
information services.  The Management Company was also reimbursed for certain of
its costs and expenses.  The Company continues to be "self-advised" and is now
self-managed.

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Management Company was acquired by the
Company, thereby allowing direct management of its properties.  This transaction
was completed based on a favorable private letter ruling by the Internal Revenue
Service.  It formally integrated the management personnel of the Company with
management personnel previously employed by the Management Company.  The
combination had no material effect on the Company's operations or financial
position.

                                       1

     Location of Properties.  Historically, the Company has emphasized
investments in properties located primarily in the Houston area.  Since 1987,
the Company has actively acquired properties outside of Houston.  Of the
Company's 185 properties which were owned as of December 31, 1994, 81 of its 161
developed properties and 18 of its 24 parcels of unimproved land were located in
the Houston metropolitan area.  In addition to these properties, the Company
owned 48 developed properties and 4 parcels of unimproved land located in other
parts of Texas.  Because of the Company's investments in the Houston area, as
well as in other parts of Texas, the Houston and Texas economies affect, to some
degree, the business and operations of the Company.

     The 1994 economic performance of the southwestern United States in which
the Company has its primary operations improved over 1993; however, this
improvement still generally lagged the national economy.  A deterioration in the
Houston or Texas economies could adversely affect the Company.  However, the
Company's centers are generally anchored by grocery and drug stores under long-
term leases, and such types of stores tend to be less affected by economic
change.

     Competition.  There are other developers and operators engaged in the
development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers and commercial
property who compete with the Company in its trade areas.  This results in
competition for both acquisitions of existing income-producing properties and
also for prime development sites.  There is also competition for tenants to
occupy the space that the Company and its competitors develop, acquire and
manage.

     The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
tenants in its market areas are location, price, anchor tenants and maintenance
of properties and that the Company's competitive advantages include the
favorable locations of its properties, its ability to provide a retailer with
multiple locations in the Houston area with anchor tenants and its practice of
continuous maintenance and renovation of its properties.

     Financial Information.  Certain additional financial information concerning
the Company is included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
located on pages 17 through 32 herein.

     General.  In 1994, no single property accounted for more than 3.3% of the
Company's total assets or 4.1% of gross revenues.  Three properties, in the
aggregate, represented approximately 9.5% of the Company's gross revenues for
the year ended December 31, 1994; otherwise, none of the remaining properties
accounted for more than 2.4% of the Company's gross revenues during the same
period.  The occupancy rate for all of the Company's improved properties as of
December 31, 1994 was 91.9%.

     Substantially all of the Company's properties are owned directly by the
Company (subject in certain cases to mortgages), although the Company's
interests in certain of its properties are held indirectly through its interests
in joint ventures or under long-term leases.  In the opinion of management of
the Company, its properties are well maintained and in good repair, suitable for
their intended uses, and adequately covered by insurance.

     Shopping Centers.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company owned, either
directly or through its interests in joint ventures, 141 shopping centers with
approximately 13.3 million square feet of building area.  The shopping centers
were located predominantly in Texas with other locations in Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Arizona, New Mexico, Maine and Tennessee.

     The Company's shopping centers are primarily community shopping centers
which range in size from 100,000 to 400,000 square feet, as distinguished from
small strip centers which generally contain 5,000 to 25,000 square feet and from
large regional enclosed malls which generally contain over 500,000 square feet.
Most of the centers do not have climatized common areas but are designed to
allow retail customers to park their automobiles in close proximity to any
retailer in the center.  The Company's centers are customarily constructed of
masonry, steel and glass and all have lighted, paved parking areas which are
typically landscaped with berms, trees and shrubs.  They are generally located
at major intersections in close proximity to neighborhoods which have existing
populations sufficient to support retail activities of the types conducted in
the Company's centers.

     The Company has approximately 2,600 separate leases with over 1,900
different tenants in its portfolio, including national and regional supermarket
chains, other nationally or regionally known stores (including drug stores,
discount department stores, junior department stores and catalog stores) and a
great variety of other regional and local retailers.  The large number of
locations offered by the Company and the types of traditional anchor tenants
help attract prospective new tenants.  Some of the national and regional
supermarket chains which are tenants in the Company's centers include
Albertson's, Fiesta, Jewel, Smith's Fleming Foods, H.E.B., Kroger Company,
Randall's Food Markets, Rice Food Markets and Super Value Holdings.  In addition
to these supermarket chains, the Company's nationally and regionally known
retail store tenants include Eckerd, Walgreen and Osco drugstores; Kmart and
Wal-Mart discount stores; Bealls, Palais Royal and Weiner's junior department
stores; Marshall's, Office Depot, 50-Off, Office Max, Baby Superstore, Ross and
T.J. Maxx off-price specialty stores; Luby's, Piccadilly, Furr's and Wyatt
cafeterias; Academy sporting goods; Service Merchandise catalog stores; and the
following restaurant chains:  Arby's, Boston Chicken, Burger King, Champ's,
Church's Fried Chicken, Dairy Queen, Domino's, Jack-in-the-Box, Kentucky Fried
Chicken, China Coast, Pistol Pete Pizza, CiCi Pizza, Long John Silver's,
McDonald's, Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse, Pizza Hut, Shoney's, Steak & Ale,
Taco Bell, and Whataburger.  The Company also leases space in 3,000 to 10,000
square foot areas to national chains such as Clothestime, The Gap, One Price
Stores, Tempo, Payless Shoes (a division of the May Company) and Radio Shack.

     The Company's shopping center leases have lease terms generally ranging
from three to five years for tenant space under 5,000 square feet and from 10 to
35 years for tenant space over 10,000 square feet.  Leases with primary lease
terms in excess of 10 years, generally for anchor and out-parcels,  frequently
contain renewal options which allow the tenant to extend the term of the lease
for one or more additional periods, each such period generally being of a
shorter duration than the primary lease term.  The rental rates paid during a
renewal period are generally based upon the rental rate for the primary term,
sometimes adjusted for inflation or for the amount of the tenant's sales during
the primary term.

     Most of the Company's leases provide for the monthly payment in advance of
fixed minimum rentals, the tenants' pro rata share of ad valorem taxes,
insurance (including fire and extended coverage, rent insurance and liability
insurance) and common area maintenance for the center (based on estimates of the
costs for such items) and for the payment of additional rentals based on a
percentage of the tenants' sales ("percentage rentals").  Utilities are
generally paid directly by tenants except where common metering exists with
respect to a center, in which case the Company makes the payments for the
utilities and is reimbursed by the tenants on a monthly basis.  Generally, the
Company's leases prohibit the tenant from assigning or subletting its space and
require the tenant to use its space for the purpose designated in its lease
agreement and to operate its business on a continuous basis.  Certain of the
lease agreements with

                                       8

<PAGE>
 
major tenants contain modifications of these basic provisions in view of the
financial condition, stability or desirability of such tenants. Where a tenant
is granted the right to assign or sublet its space, the lease agreement
generally provides that the original lessee will remain liable for the payment
of the lease obligations under such lease agreement.

     During 1994, the Company added approximately .8 million square feet to its
portfolio of shopping center properties through the acquisition of properties
and another .1 million square feet of space through development.  The Company
continued to acquire shopping center properties outside the Houston metropolitan
area.  Four properties representing .5 million square feet were acquired in
Phoenix, Arizona.  Additionally, shopping centers were added to our existing
portfolio in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, San Antonio and College Station, Texas.
All of the Company's new developments for 1994 were in Houston.

     Industrial Properties.  The Company currently owns a total of sixteen
industrial projects, all of which are located in the greater Houston area.
These projects include 58 buildings having a total of 2.7 million square feet of
building area situated on 6.4 million square feet of land.  These figures
include the Company's interests in three joint ventures. Major tenants of the
Company's industrial properties include Advo (a leading direct mail advertising
company), Pepsico's PFS division, Stone Container Corporation, Iron Mountain
Records Storage and Paul Arpin Van Lines.

     Four of such buildings, containing approximately .6 million square feet of
building space, are located in the Railwood Industrial Park, a master-planned
industrial park in northeast Houston, which offers full utilities, loading docks
and rail service in an architecturally controlled environment.

     During 1994, the Company acquired two projects representing .3 million
square feet of industrial space.  These properties are located in Houston and
had an average occupancy of 85% at the time of the acquisition.  Additionally,
through a joint venture, the Company added 64,000 square feet (our 50%
ownership) of mini-warehouse space.  These two properties were developed, and
are managed by our joint venture partner, an experienced mini-warehouse
operator.  The properties were completed in the third and fourth quarter of
1994.

     Office Building.  The Company owns a seven-story, 121,000 square foot
masonry office building with a detached, covered, three-level parking garage
situated on 171,000 square feet of land fronting on North Loop 610 West in
Houston.  The building serves as the Company's corporate headquarters.  Other
than the Company, the major tenant of the building is Charter Bank, which
occupies 22%.

     Multi-family Residential Properties.  At December 31, 1994, the Company
owned, through joint venture interests, three apartment projects located in
Houston and San Antonio, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana.  The Company's
percentage ownership represents approximately 283 units of the projects'
aggregate 833 units.  All are garden-type projects complemented by landscaping,
recreational areas and adequate parking.  These projects are managed by our
joint venture partners, all of whom are experienced apartment operators.
Subsequent to December 31, 1994, the joint venture which owned the property in
Louisiana sold the project.  The Company owned a 50% interest in the joint
venture.

     Unimproved Land.  The Company owns, directly or through its interest in
joint ventures, 24 parcels of unimproved land aggregating approximately 8.3
million square feet of land area located in Texas and Louisiana.  These
properties include approximately 5.0 million square feet of land adjacent to
certain of the Company's existing developed properties, which may be used for
expansion of these developments, as well as approximately 3.3 million square
feet of land, which may be used for new development.  Almost all of these
unimproved properties are served by roads and utilities and are ready for
development.  Most of these parcels are suitable for development as shopping
centers, and the Company intends to emphasize the development of these parcels
for such purpose.


ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary
routine litigation incidental to its business, to which the Company is a party

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected
financial data appearing elsewhere in this report.  Historical results and
trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future
operations.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

  Weingarten Realty Investors owned and operated 141 anchored shopping centers,
16 industrial properties, 3 multi-family residential projects, and one office
building at December 31, 1994.  Of the Company's 161 developed properties, 129
are located in Texas (including 81 in Houston and Harris County).  The Company's
remaining properties are located in Louisiana (11), Arizona (6), Arkansas (6),
Oklahoma (4), New Mexico (3), Maine (1) and Tennessee (1).  The Company has over
2,600 leases and 1,900 different tenants.  Leases for the Company's properties
range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over twenty five years for
larger tenants; leases generally include minimum lease payments and contingent
rentals for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance and for an amount based
on a percentage of the tenants' sales.  The Company's revenues and occupancy
rates are directly affected by the square footage leased and the business
environment and conditions of the markets in which the Company owns and operates
its properties.  The Company's results of operations are also significantly
affected by the property operating expenses, cost of capital and acquisition and
development of additional properties.  Following is a summary of selected key
indicators (in thousands, except for percentages):

   Interest rate.....................................       6.8%       8.1%       7.8%
</TABLE>

  The Company considers the renewal rental rate as one of the best indicators
for changes in overall rental rates for the Company's properties.  The rate
presented herein is the percentage change in the weighted average rental rate
for shopping center space renewed by existing non-anchor tenants.  Renewals of
anchor tenants are excluded from the computation, because their leases are of a
much longer term (and therefore, generally result in significant increase upon
renewal) and the extensive space leased by anchors could significantly skew the
overall average rate.

  The 1994 economic performance of the southwestern United States in which the
Company has its primary operations improved over 1993; however, this improvement
still generally lagged the national economy.  The overall economic conditions of
these areas can be illustrated through increases in total retail sales (as
distinguished from same store sales), and leading economic indicators as
published:

ACQUISITION AND NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

  Since occupancy rates have remained constant and rental rates have only shown
modest increases in the past three years, increases in revenues are mainly due
to the acquisition and new development of additional properties.  Such
activities had the following effects (in thousands) on the Company's rental
revenues from:

  In the above schedule, "base property" includes property acquired or developed
before 1992 and "acquired and developed property" includes property acquired or
developed during 1992 through 1994.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Rental revenues increased by 17.2% or $16.4 million from $95.8 million in 1993
to $112.2 million in 1994 and by 12.4% or $10.6 million from $85.2 million in
1992 to $95.8 million in 1993.  Of these increases, property acquisitions and
new development contributed $13.0 million in 1994 and $10.3 million in 1993.
Since occupancy rates have remained consistent during the periods, the remaining
portion of these increases is due primarily to increased rental rates obtained
from re-leasing and renewals of existing space.

  Interest income was $3.4 million in 1992, $5.3 million in 1993 and $5.8
million in 1994.  This increased income is mainly the result of investing
approximately $50 million of excess funds from a stock offering in March 1993 in
marketable debt securities.

  Equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships has
increased from $.7 million in 1992 to $1.1 million in 1993 to $1.3 million in
1994.  These increases are the result of additional investment in entities
accounted for under the equity method.  Other income increased from $.6 million
in 1992 to $1.1 million in 1993 to $1.5 million in 1994.  These increases were
primarily due to lease cancellation income.

  Direct costs and expenses of operating the Company's properties (i.e.,
depreciation and amortization, operating and ad valorem tax expenses) increased
from $47.3 million in 1992 to $53.6 million in 1993 to $61.6 million in 1994.
These increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during
these periods.  Overall, direct operating costs and expenses as a percent of
rental revenues have remained relatively constant at 56% in 1992 and 1993 and
55% in 1994.

  Interest incurred on debt outstanding during the periods increased from $11.2
million in 1993 to $12.4 million in 1994.  This increase was due to an increase
in the weighted average debt outstanding from $138.3 million in 1993 to $181.6
million in 1994, offset partially by a decrease in the weighted average interest
rate of 8.1% in 1993 to 6.8% in 1994.  Interest expense increased in 1994 by
only $.6 million due to the decrease in the average interest rate mentioned
above and an increase in the amount of interest capitalized as a result of
additional projects under development during 1994.  Interest incurred on debt
outstanding decreased from $20.7 million in 1992 to $11.2 million for 1993.
This decrease was due almost entirely to a decrease of $129.4 million in the
weighted average amount of debt outstanding as a result of the use of proceeds
from a public offering of common shares that were used to reduce debt and the
conversion of all the Company's convertible debt during 1993.  The Company
capitalized $.9 million less interest in 1993 than in 1992 due to reduced levels
of development in 1993.  As a result, interest expense decreased from $18.7
million in 1992 to $10.0 million in 1993.

  The majority of the change in gains (loss) on sales of property and securities
from 1993 to 1994 related to the gains realized in 1993 as a result of fires at
two of the Company's properties; there were no similar occurrences in 1994.  The
fires had no material impact on the Company's earnings for 1993 or 1994.  The
$1.8 million gain in 1992 was the result of selling the Company's investment in
government backed debt securities and two small tracts of undeveloped land.
Additionally, the Company had a $1.2 million extraordinary charge for the early
retirement of debt in 1992; no such charges occurred in 1993 or 1994.

  As a result of these changes, net income increased from $20.1 million in 1992
to $36.2 million (an 80.1% increase) in 1993 to $43.8 million (a 21.0% increase)
in 1994.  Net income per common share increased from $1.15 in 1992 to $1.50 (a
30.4% increase) in 1993 to $1.67 (an 11.3% increase) in 1994.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

  The Company considers funds from operations (defined by the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income plus depreciation and
amortization, less gains (loss) on sales of property and securities) to be an
alternate measure of the performance of any equity REIT since such measure does
not recognize depreciation and amortization expenses as operating expenses.
Management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in
evaluating income-producing real estate, which historically has not depreciated.
Funds from operations do not represent cash flows from operations as defined by
generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance
or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

  Funds from operations increased to $70.9 million in 1994 compared to $58.0
million in 1993 and $40.7 million in 1992.  The majority of the increase relates
to the impact of the Company's acquisitions and new development programs.  For
further information on the changes between years, see "Results of Operations"
above.


CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

  The Company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will continue
to provide adequate capital for all principal payments as well as dividend
payments in accordance with REIT requirements, and that cash on hand, borrowings
under its existing credit facilities, the use of corporate and project
financing, as well as other debt and equity alternatives will provide the
necessary capital to achieve growth.  Cash flow from operating activities as
reported in the Statements  of Consolidated Cash Flows increased to $65.5
million for 1994 from $57.6 million for 1993 and $38.3 million for 1992.

  Cash dividends increased to $59.7 million in 1994, compared to $52.3 million
in 1993 and $36.2 million in 1992.  The Company satisfied its REIT requirement
of distributing at least 95% of ordinary taxable income for each of the three
years ending December 31, 1994 and, accordingly, federal income taxes were not
provided in these years.  The Company's dividend payout ratio for 1994 and 1993
approximated 84.2% and 90.2% of the 1994 and 1993 funds from operations (defined
as net income plus depreciation and amortization, less gains (loss) on sales of
property and securities), respectively.  Recently, the Company's Board of Trust
Managers approved an increase in the quarterly dividend per common share from
$.57 to $.60.

  In 1994, the Company continued to expand its portfolio of income-producing
properties.  This growth resulted from  acquisitions of existing properties,
both shopping centers and industrial property, and development of new shopping
centers.  The Company added, in millions, $100.5, $91.0 and $61.9 of new
property during 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

  Total debt outstanding at December 31, 1994 was $229.6 million compared to
$147.7 million at December 31, 1993, and $243.6 million at December 31, 1992.
In 1994, the Company increased total debt $81.9 million primarily to fund the
acquisition and new development programs.  Three of the Company's acquisitions
were financed, in part, through the assumption of $13.4 million of debt with
interest rates ranging from 7.5 to 9.75%.  The remainder of the purchase price
of the acquisitions was financed through the use of revolving credit debt and
the issuance of 300,000 common shares.

  Following is the percentage of the Company's debt to equity and debt to total
capitalization as of December 31:

</TABLE> 

  During 1994, the Company replaced its two existing secured bank revolving
credit agreements totaling $100 million with a new syndicated bank agreement.
This new $150 million revolver, in addition to being unsecured, is also at a
more favorable rate.  The agreement has an initial three year term with an
annual option to request a one year extension.  The Company is currently
negotiating with the syndicate to increase the amount available under the credit
agreement.

  At December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately $63 million of funds
available to support the growth of the Company.  These funds were available
through a combination of $4 million available under the revolving line of
credit,

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
$29 million of unencumbered government debt securities and a $30 million
closed but unfunded loan from  an insurance company.

  In 1993, the Company had reduced total debt by calling all $123 million of
outstanding convertible note and debenture issues.  The issues were converted
into 3.9 million common shares, all of which had a beneficial anti-dilutive
effect on earnings per share.  During March 1993, the Company raised $113
million of new capital through an equity offering of 2.8 million common shares.
Although a large portion of these proceeds was initially used to reduce short-
term revolving credit debt, the proceeds were ultimately the primary source of
the Company's capital needs for the year.  Approximately $91.0 million was
invested in new assets, consisting of acquisitions totaling 1.3 million square
feet, the development of new shopping centers and capital improvements to
existing properties.


EFFECTS OF INFLATION

  The rate of inflation was on the rise in 1994, but was inconsequential to the
Company's operations.  The Company has structured its leases, however, in such a
way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur.  Most of
the leases contain percentage rent provisions with the Company to receive
rentals based on the tenants' gross sales.  Many leases provide for increasing
minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions.
In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than ten years,
which allows the Company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions when
the leases expire.  Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay a
large portion of operating expenses.  As a result of these lease provisions,
increases due to inflation, as well as tax rate increases which are usually
anticipated to occur, generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon
the Company's operating results.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Operations of Weingarten Realty Investors, a Texas business trust, consist of
one business segment--acquiring, developing and leasing of real estate,
primarily community shopping centers, in Texas and throughout the southwestern
part of the United States.  The Company currently operates and intends to
operate in the future as a real estate investment trust ("REIT").

  Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
subsidiaries and its interest in 50% or more-owned joint ventures and
partnerships.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.  Joint ventures, effectively owned more than 20%, but less than 50%,
are accounted for using the equity method.

  Carrying charges, principally interest and ad valorem taxes, of land under
development and buildings under construction are capitalized as part of projects
under development and buildings and improvements to the extent that such charges
do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value.

  Property is carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges.  Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method, generally over estimated useful
lives of 18-50 years for buildings and 10-20 years for parking lot surfacing and
equipment.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed.  Major replacements are
capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation is
removed from the accounts.

  Marketable debt securities (held-to-maturity), consisting of U. S. government
agency guaranteed pass-through certificates and U.S. Treasury Notes, are carried
at amortized cost.  Premiums and discounts are amortized (accreted) to
operations over the estimated remaining lives of the mortgage-backed securities
using the constant yield method.

  Unamortized debt and lease costs are amortized primarily on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the debt and over the lives of leases, respectively.

  Rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life
of the lease for operating leases and over the lease terms using the interest
method for direct financing leases.  Contingent rentals (payments for taxes,
maintenance and insurance by the lessees and for an amount based on a percentage
of the tenants' sales) are estimated and accrued over the lease year.

  Income per common share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period and excludes the negligible dilutive
effect of shares issuable in connection with share options and awards.

  Cash flows are computed using the indirect method.  For cash flow purposes,
the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of less
than three months as cash equivalents.

  Dollar amounts presented in the tabulations in the notes to consolidated
financial statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except per share
amounts.

  Reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts to conform with the
current year presentation.

  At December 31, 1994, the variable interest rate for notes payable under the
revolving credit agreement and the reverse repurchase agreement was 6.8% and
6.7%, respectively.  The weighted average interest rate for the Company's short

  Scheduled principal payments on the Company's debt (excluding $145.0 million
potentially due under the Company's revolving credit agreement in 1997 and $16.2
million of reverse repurchase agreements) are due during the following years:

<TABLE>

               1995...............  $ 9,410

               1997...............      770

               Thereafter.........    3,642
</TABLE>

  Certain debt is collateralized by various direct financing leases or other
property and current and future rentals from these leases and properties.  At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, the carrying value of such property aggregated $257
million and $328 million, respectively.

  The Company has an unsecured $150 million revolving credit agreement with a
bank syndication (the "Banks").  Although the agreement expires in November
1997, the Company has an annual option to request a one year extension of the
agreement.  Unless all of the banks in the syndication agree to the requested
extension by the Company, the agreement expires on the scheduled date and all
loans outstanding under the credit agreement are payable on the agreement's
expiration.  The Company intends to request an extension of the agreement in
1995 and expects that the Banks will agree to their request.  During 1994, the
maximum balance and weighted average balance outstanding under this agreement
was $145 million and $98 million, (at 6.3%) respectively.  The revolving credit
agreement is subject to normal banking terms and conditions and does not
adversely restrict the Company's operations or liquidity.

  The Company made cash payments for interest on debt, net of amounts
capitalized, of $10.1 million in 1994, $9.4 million in 1993 and $18.3 million in
1992.

  Various debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of
which requires the Company to produce annual consolidated distributable cash
flow, as defined by the agreements, of not less than 250% (2.5 times) of
interest payments, to limit the payment of dividends to no more than 100% of the
Company's annual consolidated cash flow, to limit short term debt (as defined)
to the greater of 33% of total debt or $200 million and uncollateralized assets
must be at least 150% of unsecured debt.  Management believes that the Company
is in compliance with all restrictive covenants.

  In October 1992, the Company purchased three interest rate swap contracts with
an aggregate notional amount of $40 million.  Such contracts, which expire
through 2004, have been outstanding since their purchase.  The Company intends
to hold such contracts through their expiration date and to use them as a means
of fixing a portion of the Company's variable rate debt.  The interest rate
swaps have an effective interest rate of 8.1%.  The difference between the
interest received and paid on the interest rate swaps is recognized as interest
expense as incurred.  The interest rate swaps increased interest expense and
decreased net income as follows, in millions:  $1.4 in 1994, $1.9 in 1993 and
$.3 in 1992.  The interest rate swaps increased the average interest rate for
the Company's debt by the following amounts:  .8% for 1994, 1.3% for 1993 and
.1% for 1992.  The Company currently has no financial exposure, in the unlikely
event of default by the counterparty, because the Company has paid a higher rate
of interest than it has received under these agreements.

NOTE 4.  LEASING OPERATIONS
 
 Leasing Arrangements

  The Company's lease terms range from less than one year for smaller tenant
spaces to thirty-five years for larger tenant spaces.  In addition to minimum
lease payments, most of the leases provide for contingent rentals.

 Rentals under Operating Leases

  Future minimum rental income from non-cancelable operating leases at December
31, 1994, in millions, is:  $83.3 in 1995; $73.5 in 1996; $63.0 in 1997; $54.5
in 1998; $46.4 in 1999 and $349.4 thereafter.  The future minimum rental amounts
do not include estimates for contingent rentals.  Such contingent rentals, in
millions, aggregated $24.6 in 1994, $21.4 in 1993 and $19.5 in 1992.

 Property under Direct Financing Leases

  Leases that are, in substance, the financing of an asset purchase by the party
leasing the property are recorded as property under direct financing leases.
The Company, in its capacity as lessor, has removed the leased property from the
books and recorded the future lease payments receivable using the following
components:

  The Company recognized rental revenue from direct financing leases as follows,
in millions:  $1.5 in 1994; $1.6 in 1993 and $2.0 in 1992.  At December 31,
1994, minimum lease payments to be received in each of the five succeeding
years, in millions, are:  $1.9 in 1995; $1.8 in 1996 and 1997; $1.7 in 1998 and
$1.5 in 1999.  The future minimum lease payments do not include amounts for
contingent rentals; contingent rental income on properties leased under direct
financing leases, in millions, was $.8 in 1994, $.6 in 1993 and $.8 in 1992.


NOTE 5.   LEASE COMMITMENTS

 Operating Leases

  The Company leases land and a shopping center from the owners, and then
subleases these properties to other parties.  Future minimum rentals under these
operating leases, in millions, are:  $1.4 in 1995; $1.3 in 1996; $1.2 in 1997
and 1998; $1.1 in 1999 and $14.9 thereafter.

  Future minimum rental payments on these leases have not been reduced by future
minimum sublease rentals aggregating $15.7 million through 2017 that are due
under various non-cancelable subleases.  Rental expense (including insignificant
amounts for contingent rentals) for operating leases aggregated, in millions:
$1.6 in 1994; $1.6 in 1993 and $1.5 in 1992.  Sublease rental revenue (excluding
amounts for improvements constructed by the Company on the leased land) from
these leased properties were as follows, in millions:  $2.1 in 1994; $2.0 in
1993 and $1.6 in 1992.

 Capital Leases

  Leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership
associated with the underlying property to the Company are considered capital
leases, and the present value of the required lease payments are recorded as
property and the related debt is recorded as obligations under capital leases.
The debt is amortized as each lease payment is made.  Property under capital
leases, consisting of a shopping center aggregating $6.5 million, is included in
buildings and improvements at December 31, 1994 and 1993.
 
  Future minimum lease payments under these capital leases total $12.2 million,
with annual payments due of $.6 million in 1995 through 1999, and $9.3 million
thereafter.  The amount of these total payments representing interest is $6.1
million.  Accordingly, the present value of the net minimum lease payments is
$6.0 million at December 31, 1994.

  The Company subleases this property to other parties.  The minimum lease
payments discussed above have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals
aggregating $3.2 million due under non-cancelable subleases.  Minimum sublease
rentals do not include estimates for contingent rentals that aggregated
approximately $.2 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992.


NOTE 6.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  The Company and Weingarten Realty Management Company (the "Management
Company") were related parties during 1992 because the Management Company was
owned by directors and shareholders of the Company.  As the Company had only a
few employees, its operations were primarily performed by employees of the
Management Company through a contract to lease, manage and develop the Company's
properties.  The Company and WRI Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings") are related parties
because they share certain directors and are under common management.  See Note
8 for related party information about Holdings.

  Effective January 1, 1993, the assets of the Management Company, which were
not material in relation to the Company's consolidated balance sheet, were
acquired by the Company through the assumption of less than $.1 million of net
liabilities from the shareholders of the Management Company.  This event did not
have a significant effect on 1993 earnings because the additional salaries paid
as the result of this merger were offset by the various fees no longer being
paid to the Management Company.

  The Management Company charged the Company fees aggregating $8.0 million for
1992, in connection with services rendered under the management contract.  Fees
paid under the management contract were generally based upon

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
a specified percent of revenues, minimum lease rentals of space leased and costs
incurred for acquisition, construction and development of the Company's
properties.
 
  The Company owns an interest in several joint ventures and partnerships.
Notes receivable from these entities  bear interest at 4.0% to 10.5% at December
31, 1994 and are due at various dates through 2020.  The Company recognized
interest income on these notes aggregating, in millions:  $.9 in 1994; $1.0 in
1993 and $.7 in 1992.

  Texas Commerce Bank National Association ("TCB") is a significant participant
in and the agent for the Banks that provide the Company's $150 million
syndicated revolving credit agreement.  The Company and TCB have two common
directors.


NOTE 7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  The Company was contingently liable at December 31, 1994 for $1.2 million of
notes payable executed by various joint ventures and partnerships.

  The Company is committed to lend Holdings an additional $5.2 million.  The
Company remains contingently liable for $.9 million of notes payable by
Hospitality Venture which were transferred to Holdings in 1988.

  The Company is involved in various matters of litigation arising in the normal
course of business.  While the Company is unable to predict with certainty the
amounts involved, the Company's management and counsel are of the opinion that,
when such litigation is resolved, the Company's resulting liability, if any,
will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position.

  In connection with the acquisition of certain property in exchange for the
Company's common shares in 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with the
seller under which the Company essentially guarantees that its shares  would
exceed a specified value on a certain future date.  If the shares' market value
does not exceed the threshold specified in the agreement, the Company has the
option to pay the seller the difference in cash, issue additional shares (based
upon the then market value of the shares) for the difference or settle the
difference by a combination of paying cash and issuing shares.  The Company has
the option to settle the agreement in June 1996, December 1996 or June 1997.  If
the Company had settled this agreement at December 31, 1994, the cash settlement
amount would have been $1.5 million or a maximum of 40,561 shares would have
been issued.  The settlement amount would be considered additional consideration
paid for the property, and would have been included in the basis of the
property, provided such additional basis would not make the carrying value of
the property exceed its fair market value.


NOTE 8.   INVESTMENT IN MORTGAGE BONDS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM AN AFFILIATE

  Concurrent with the Company being organized as a REIT in 1984, certain
property and investments in joint ventures, which were considered to be
incompatible with a REIT's operation and $3.5 million were transferred to
Holdings in exchange for $26.8 million of mortgage bonds.  The transfer price
for the assets was based upon independent appraisals.  The appraised values
exceeded the Company's carrying value of the assets; however, because Holdings
is a related party, the gain of $17.3 million was deferred by the Company.
Holdings currently owns three investments:  a 50% interest in Hospitality
Venture, which owns and operates eight motor hotels in Florida and Alabama
("Hospitality"); unimproved land in a multi-use land development north of
Houston ("River Pointe") and unimproved land in a major industrial park in
Houston ("Railwood").

</TABLE>

  Before 1988, Holdings was current on the payments of all interest;
accordingly, the Company had recognized interest income on all the Holdings debt
at the stated interest pay rates.  During the fourth quarter of 1988, Holdings'
cash flow and capital resources became insufficient to meet the full interest
requirements on the mortgage bonds.  The accrual of interest income on the River
Pointe and Railwood mortgage bonds has been suspended and interest income on the
Hospitality mortgage bonds has been limited to Holdings' pro rata share of cash
flow from Hospitality Venture.  Interest income from the mortgage bonds and
notes receivable recognized by the Company for financial reporting purposes, in
millions, aggregated $1.6 for 1994, $2.1 for 1993 and $1.6 for 1992.  At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, accrued interest receivable from Holdings was $.2
million and $.4 million, respectively.

  The Company had an unrecorded receivable for interest of $28.6 million and
$22.3 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Of these amounts,
$6.0 million and $5.4 million represent the difference between the accrual rate
and the pay rate on the Railwood and River Pointe mortgage bonds at 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Interest income not recognized by the Company for financial
reporting purposes aggregated, in millions, $6.3, $5.2 and $4.9 for 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

  Management of the Company believes that the fair market value of the security
collateralizing debt from Holdings is greater than the net investment in such
debt (cost less related deferred gain) and that there would not be a charge to
operations if the Company were to foreclose on the debt.  If foreclosure were
required,  the net investment in such debt would become the Company's basis of
the repossessed assets.   However, the Company does not currently anticipate
foreclosure on Holdings' properties due to certain restrictions imposed on such
assets in connection with the Company's REIT status.  The Company's management
presently does not believe that the net investment in the mortgage bonds and
notes receivable from Holdings has been impaired nor that a reserve for any such
impairment is currently required.

 
NOTE 9.  FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

  Federal income taxes are not provided because the Company believes it
qualifies as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Shareholders of the Company include their proportionate taxable income in their

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
individual tax returns.  As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 95% of
its ordinary taxable income to its shareholders and meet certain income source
and investment restriction requirements.

  Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes
principally because of differences in the timing of recognition of interest, ad
valorem taxes, depreciation, rental revenue, pension expense and installment
gains on sales of property.  As a result of these differences, the book value of
the Company's net assets exceeds its tax basis by $30.8 million at December 31,
1994.  Such differences of books over (under) tax are primarily due to the
following, in millions:  $50.6  for property basis and depreciation and ($19.1)
for additional interest income recognized for tax purposes on Holdings' debt.

  For federal income tax purposes, the cash dividends distributed to
shareholders are characterized as follows:

NOTE 10.  SHARE OPTIONS AND AWARDS

  The Company has an incentive Share Option Plan (the "Plan") which expires in
December 1997.  During 1991, the Company amended the Plan to add awards of
shares of beneficial interest, at nominal cost to the recipient, in addition to
options.  The Plan provides options and awards for a maximum of  500,000 common
shares.  The Company has an additional share option plan which grants 100 share
options to every employee of the Company, excluding executive officers, upon
completion of each five year interval of service.  This plan, which expires in
2002, provides options for a maximum of 100,000 common shares.  For both of the
share option plans, options are granted to employees of the Company at an
exercise price equal to the quoted fair market value of the common shares on the
date the options are granted.  All options and awards that are granted expire
upon termination of employment or ten years from the date of the grant.

  Following is a summary of the option activity of the Plans for the three years
ended December 31, 1994:

  On January 3, 1994, the Company issued 62,900 restricted shares and granted
434,400 share options under a compensatory Incentive Share Plan for key officers
of the Company.  This plan, which expires in 2003, provides for a total of
500,000 shares, either in the form of restricted shares or options.  The
restricted shares generally vest over a ten year period, with potential
acceleration of vesting due to appreciation in the market value of the Company's
shares.  The share options vest over a five year period beginning two years
after the date of grant.  Share options were granted at the market price on the
date of grant.  The Company recognized $.2 million in compensation expense
during 1994 relating to the restricted shares.

  During 1991, 56,000 shares of beneficial interest were granted as awards to
certain key officers of the Company and the Management Company.  All of these
common shares had vested and were issued at December 31, 1994.  Compensation
expense relating to the share awards aggregated, in millions, $.5 in 1994, $.6
in 1993 and $.4 in 1992.

NOTE 13.  FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

  The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the
Company, using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies as of December 31, 1994.  However, considerable judgment is
necessary to interpret market data and develop the related estimates of fair
value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize upon disposition of the
asset.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies
may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  Unless
otherwise described below, all other financial instruments of the Company are
carried at amounts which approximate their fair values.

  Marketable debt securities held-to-maturity have an estimated market value of
$45.8 million.  Such securities include $16.5 million of U.S. government agency
guaranteed pass-through certificates which mature through 2008 and $29.3 million
of U.S. Treasury Notes which mature in 2000.  The Company estimates that these
securities will mature, in millions, as follows:  $1.5 in 1995; $38.1 in 1996
through 2000 and $10.3 thereafter.

  Mortgage bonds and notes receivable from an affiliate were not fair valued
because it is not practicable to reasonably assess the credit adjustment that
would be applied in the marketplace for such bonds and notes receivable.
However, management of the Company believes that the fair value of the security
collateralizing such bonds and notes receivable is greater than the net
investment in such instruments (cost less related deferred gain).

  Fixed rate debt with carrying values of $102.3 million have fair values of
$103.3 million, which were estimated based on interest rates currently available
to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The Company believes that the carrying value of its $127.3 million of variable
rate debt is equivalent to its fair value.

  Interest rate swap agreements are valued at amounts at which they could be
settled.  Settlement amounts are based upon estimates obtained from dealers.  If
the Company had settled these agreements with the counterparty at December 31,
1994, the Company would have received $.4 million from the counterparty.

  The fair value estimates represented herein are based on pertinent information
available to management as of December 31, 1994.  Although management is not
aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value
amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of
these financial statements since that date, and current estimates of fair value
may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.


NOTE 14.  PENSION PLAN

  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company acquired the assets of the Management
Company, including a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of
its employees.  This plan was merged with the plan of the Company, effective
January 1, 1993.  The benefit formula for both pre-existing plans is identical
to the formula for the surviving merged plan.

                                       30
<PAGE>
 
  The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's compensation
during the last five years of service.  The Company's funding policy is to make
annual contributions as required by applicable regulations.

  The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized
in the Company's balance sheet at:

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed
 Charges.....................  1.68x  1.72x  1.89x  3.94x  4.16x
 
Ratio of Funds from
 Operations Before Interest
 Expense to Fixed
 Charges.....................  2.42x  2.52x  2.82x  5.83x  6.10x
</TABLE>

     The ratios of earnings to fixed charges were computed by dividing earnings
by fixed charges.  The ratios of funds from operations before interest expense
to fixed charges were computed by dividing funds from operations before interest
expense by fixed charges.  For these purposes, earnings is defined as income
before extraordinary charge plus fixed charges (excluding interest costs
capitalized).  Funds from operations before interest expense is defined as net
income plus depreciation and amortization and extraordinary charge, less gains
(loss) on sales of property and securities plus interest on indebtedness.  Fixed
charges consist of interest on indebtedness (including interest costs
capitalized), amortization of debt costs and the portion of rent expense
representing an interest factor.
