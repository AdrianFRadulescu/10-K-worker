                                                                          2

     l. Publications:

     The Value Line Investment Survey is a weekly investment related
periodical that in addition to various timely articles on current economic,
financial and investment matters ranks common stocks for future relative
performance based on computer-generated statistics of financial results and
stock market performance. The key evaluations for each stock covered are
"Timeliness(TM)" and "Safety." "Timeliness(TM)" relates to the probable
relative price performance of a stock over the next six to twelve months, as
compared to the rest of the approximately l,7OO covered stocks. Rankings are
updated each week and range from Rank l for the expected best performing
stocks to Rank 5 for the expected poorest performers. "Safety" rankings are a
measure of risk and are based primarily on the issuer's relative financial
strength and the stock's price stability. "Safety" ranges from Rank l for the
least risky stocks to Rank 5 for the riskiest. Value Line employs
approximately 90 analysts and statisticians who prepare articles of interest
for each periodical and who evaluate stock performance and provide future
earnings estimates and quarterly written evaluations with weekly updates when
relevant. The annual subscription price of The Value Line Investment Survey
is $525.

    The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey provides full-page profiles of 1500
mutual funds and condensed coverage of an additional 550 funds. Every two
weeks subscribers receive an updated issue, containing about 150 fund
reports, plus a "Performance & Index" providing current rankings and
performance figures for the full universe of more than 2,000 funds. The Value
Line Mutual Fund Survey also includes semi-annual profiles and analyses on
100 of the nation's major fund families. Additionally, subscribers receive a
12-page periodical monthly newsletter, containing articles of general
interest to subscribers and readers "The Value Line Mutual Fund Advisor,"
with articles on investment trends and issues concerning mutual fund
investors. Funds are ranked for both risk and overall risk-adjusted
performance using strictly quantitative means. A large binder is provided to
house the periodic fund reports. A second binder is provided to full-term
subscribers for the periodical monthly newsletter. The annual subscription
price of The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey is $295.

     The Company instituted on-line distribution of individual one-page reports
from The Value Line Investment Survey and The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey
through the CompuServe on-line network.

     The Value Line No-Load Fund Advisor is a periodical monthly newsletter
for investors who wish to manage their own portfolios of no- and low-load,
open-end mutual funds. Each issue features strategies for maximizing total
return, with special attention given to tax considerations. Also featured are
in-depth interviews with noted portfolio managers, model portfolios for a
range of investor profiles, and information about retirement planning,
industry news, and listings (with descriptions) of new funds worthy of
further consideration. A full statistical review, including latest
performance, rankings, and sector weightings, is updated each month on 600
leading no-load and low-load funds. The annual subscription price of The
Value Line No-Load Fund Advisor is $107.

                                                                          3

      The Value Line Investment Survey - Canadian Edition is a periodical
weekly investment related publication that ranks 110 stocks (75 Canadian and
35 foreign) for future relative performance utilizing the Value Line
Timeliness(TM) Ranking System, similar to the Investment Survey. The
publication is marketed exclusively in Canada. The annual subscription price
of The Value Line Investment Survey - Canadian Edition is $260 (Canadian).

    The Value Line OTC Special Situations Service, published periodically 24
times a year, concentrates on fast-growing, smaller companies whose stocks
are perceived by Company analysts as having exceptional appreciation
potential. The annual subscription price of The Value Line OTC Special
Situations Service is $390.

    The Value Line Options Survey, a periodical weekly service published 48
times a year, evaluates and ranks for future performance the most active
options listed on United States exchanges (approximately 8,000). The annual
subscription price of The Value Line Options Survey is $445. An electronic
version of this publication, The Value Line Daily Options Survey was
introduced during the latter part of fiscal 1995.

      The Value Line Convertibles Survey, a periodical weekly service
published 48 times a year, evaluates and  ranks for future market performance
approximately 58O convertible securities (bonds and preferred stocks) and
approximately 75 warrants. The annual subscription price of The Value Line
Convertibles Survey is $625.

      The Value Line Industry Review, a periodical monthly publication now
available only in electronic form,  evaluates 104 industry groups for
relative performance. Providing detailed and extensive sector analysis, it is
designed to meet the needs of professional portfolio managers. The annual
subscription price of The Value Line Industry Review is $1,075.

      The Total Return Service is a customized data service derived from The
Value Line Industry  Review publication. It was developed to help publicly
traded companies meet the SEC's mandated executive-compensation disclosure
requirements. The service consists of a line graph comparing the total return of
a public company's stock over the last five years to a published equity market
index and a published or constructed industry index.

      The Expanded Edition of The Value Line Investment Survey was introduced by
the Company in  April 1995. It provides detailed descriptions of 1,800
additional small- and medium-capitalization stocks, many listed on NASDAQ,
beyond the 1,700 stocks of larger- capitalization companies traditionally
covered in The Value Line Investment Survey.

      Like the Standard Edition, the Expanded Edition has its own "Summary &
Index" providing updated ranks and other data, as well as "screens" of key
financial performance measures. The "Ratings and Reports" section, providing
updated reports on about 140 stocks each week, has been organized to correspond
closely to the industries reviewed in the Standard Edition of The Value Line
Investment Survey. A new combined Index, published quarterly, allows the
subscriber to locate easily a specific stock among the 3,500 stocks covered.

                                                                          4

<PAGE>


     The Expanded Edition includes a number of new as well as standard features:


- -    A new Performance Ranking System incorporates many of the elements of the
Value Line Timeliness/TM Ranking System, modified to accommodate the 1,800
stocks in the Expanded Edition. The Performance/TM Rank is based on earnings
growth and price momentum and is designed to predict relative price performance
over the next six to 12 months.

- -    An expanded Business Section provides detail about companies, focusing on
business lines and strategies.

- -    An enlarged Assets and Liabilities Section provides long-term statistics
and a more complete balance sheet on each company.

- -    New Total-Return Statistics provide an "at a glance" look at a particular
stock's performance -- appreciation plus dividends -- over the past three
months, six months, and one, three, and five years.

     The principal difference between the Expanded Edition and the Standard
Edition is that the Expanded Edition does not include financial forecasts or
analysts' comments. This modification has allowed Value Line to offer this
service at a low price.

     The cost of the Expanded Edition to current subscribers is $125 per year
and $650 per year for new subscribers combining both Editions.


     2.  Electronic Products:

     VALUE/SCREEN III is a data and software service for screening common
stocks. It is intended for use by investors with personal computers and is sold
primarily to retail investors. It provides extensive financial data on about

    The investment advisory contracts between each of the Value Line Funds and
the Company provide that the Company will render investment research, advice,
and supervision to the funds. These contracts must be approved annually in
accordance with statutory procedures. The Company furnishes each fund with its
investment program, subject to such fund's fundamental investment policies and
to control and review by such fund's Board of Directors or Trustees. Each
contract also provides that the Company will furnish, at its expense, various
administrative services, office space, equipment, and administrative personnel
necessary for managing the affairs of the funds. Advisory fee rates vary among
the funds and may be subject to certain limitations. Each mutual fund may use
"Value Line" in its name only so long as the Company acts as its investment
adviser.

    Value Line Asset Management ("VLAM"), a division of the Company,  manages
pension funds and institutional and individual portfolios by utilizing the
techniques developed for The Value Line Investment Survey. VLAM has varied
investment advisory agreements with its clients which call for payments to the
Company calculated on the basis of the market value of the securities portfolio
under management.

                                                                          6

C.  Operating Subsidiaries:

    1.  Vanderbilt Advertising Agency, Inc.:

    Vanderbilt Advertising places advertising for the Company's publications,
investment advisory services, and mutual funds. Commission income generated by
Vanderbilt Advertising serves to reduce the Company's advertising expenses.


    2.  Compupower Corporation:

    The Company owns approximately 99.9% of the outstanding stock of Compupower
Corporation. Compupower provides computerized subscription fulfillment services
for the Company and for other publishers. For the year ended April 3O, l995,
approximately 24% of Compupower's revenues were derived from services rendered
to the Company.


    3.  Value Line Securities, Inc.:

    Value Line Securities, Inc. ("VLS") is registered as a broker-dealer under
the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. VLS acts as the underwriter and distributor of the
Value Line Funds. Shares of the Value Line Funds are sold to the public without
a sales charge (i.e., on a "no-load" basis), and VLS derives no revenue from
such sales. Since l986, VLS has effected listed portfolio brokerage transactions
for certain of the Value Line Funds, clearing such transactions on a fully
disclosed basis through unaffiliated broker-dealers who receive a portion of the
gross commissions.


D.  Other Businesses.

    The Company publishes the Value Line Arithmetic Composite and the Value Line
Geometric Composite, daily indices of the stock market performance of the
approximately l,7OO common stocks contained in The Value Line Investment Survey.
The calculation of both indices is done by a firm unaffiliated with the Company.
Futures contracts based upon fluctuations in the Value Line Arithmetic Composite
are traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade, and options on the Index are
traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The Company receives fees in
connection with these activities.


E.  Investments.

    The Company invests in the Value Line Funds and in other marketable
securities.

                                                                          7

<PAGE>


F.  Employees.

    At July 13, 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 375 persons.

    The Company, its affiliates, and its officers, directors, and employees may
from time to time own securities which are also held in the portfolios of the
Value Line Funds or recommended in the Company's publications. The Company has
imposed rules upon itself and such persons requiring monthly reports of
securities transactions for their respective accounts and restricting trading in
various types of securities in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest.


G.  Assets.

      The Company's assets identifiable to each of its principal business
segments were as follows:

H.  Competition.

      The investment management and the investment information and
publications industries are very competitive. There are many competing firms
and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these
industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than
the Company. The Company believes it employs one of the world's largest
independent securities research organizations and that it publishes the
world's largest investment service periodically in terms of number of
subscriptions and annual revenues.

                                                                          8

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


                               Operating Results

     The Company's fiscal 1995 earnings were the fourth highest historical
earnings results. This accomplishment comes after three consecutive years of
record earnings. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1995 were
$23,168,000 or $2.32 per share compared with net earnings of $28,902,000 or
$2.90 per share for fiscal year 1994 and net earnings of $27,723,000 or $2.78
per share for fiscal year 1993. The decrease in net earnings for fiscal 1995
from the fiscal 1994 level was primarily due to a decline in Income from
Securities Transactions (formerly called Investment Income) of $7,047,000,
including losses of $4,980,000 related to the Company's strategy of realizing
capital losses in order to reduce income taxes. The $1,550,000 expended in
support of The Value Line Cash Fund also contributed to the decrease.

                                                                          11

<PAGE>


     Revenues of $79,094,000 for fiscal 1995 compare to revenues of $82,050,000
and $78,401,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Publication revenues of $55,912,000 for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 1995 decreased 3.3% from fiscal 1994. The decrease in publications
revenues is primarily a result of the decline in subscription levels for the
Value Line Investment Survey due to the uncertain financial market conditions
that existed during the first three quarters of fiscal 1995. Revenues from the
Company's publications for fiscal 1994 of $57,830,000 increased 3.0% from fiscal
1993 with the increase largely attributable to a higher average level of
subscriptions to the Value Line Investment Survey. Investment management fees
and services revenues of $23,182,000 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1995
decreased 4.3% from the fiscal 1994 level. The decrease in fiscal 1995 was
primarily a result of a 6.5% decline in the average annual assets under
management in the Value Line mutual funds during the fiscal year. Mutual fund
net assets under management at April 30, 1995 were approximately equal to the
net assets under management at April 30, 1994. Investment management fees and
services revenues for fiscal 1994 increased $1,945,000 or 8.7% from the 1993
levels as a result of an increase in the average level of assets under
management in the Company's mutual funds. Mutual fund assets under management at
fiscal year end 1994 increased during the year from $2.9 billion to $3.0
billion.

Expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1995, exclusive of the
non-recurring expense of $1,550,000, were $47,884,000, a decrease of $1,702,000
or 3.4% over last year's level of $49,586,000. Advertising expenses of
$14,749,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 1995 decreased $3,596,000 from
expenses of $18,345,000 for the comparable period in fiscal 1994. The decrease
in advertising expenses resulted from management's decision to cut back
marketing expenditures during uncertain financial market conditions and increase
sales efforts during improved financial market conditions. Salaries and employee
benefit expenses of $18,935,000 for the twelve months of fiscal 1995 were
$1,662,000 above the prior level of $17,273,000 primarily as a result of the
additional staff in support of the Mutual Fund Survey and the cost of
replacement staff and recruiting fees at Compupower and the Company's investment
management and research divisions. Office and administration expenses of
$8,003,000 increased $838,000 or 11.70% from the prior year's level as a result
of a $445,000 increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with
the new office facility and the computer hardware upgrade, $315,000 of
accelerated amortization resulting from a decision to upgrade the fulfillment
software at Compupower and an increase in professional fees. These increases
were offset by a reduction in rent expense of $767,000 or 34% and the receipt of
$617,000 in partial settlement of a lawsuit. Fiscal 1994 expenses also include
the receipt of $408,000 of proceeds from a partial settlement of this lawsuit.
Expenses for fiscal 1994 increased $1,852,000 as compared with fiscal 1993. The
net increase is a result of increased advertising for the Value Line Investment
Survey, the promotional effort and associated personnel costs incurred in
launching the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, offset by a $3,050,000 expense
incurred in fiscal 1993 related to the Company's relocation.

                                                                          12

<PAGE>


     Income from Securities Transactions of $8,659,000 for the fiscal year
ended April 30, 1995 decreased by $7,047,000 or 44.87% from $15,706,000 at
April 30, 1994. In addition to a $764,000 decrease in capital gains produced
by the Hedge, Tilt and Stem portfolios, the Company also incurred losses of
$4,980,000 related to its tax planning strategy. Sales of mutual fund shares,
unrelated to the tax planning strategy, have produced $326,000 of capital
losses this year as compared to a $101,000 gain last fiscal year. The decline
was largely the result of a decision to liquidate an investment in one of the
Company's mutual funds during the latter part of fiscal 1995 in order to
redeploy these assets in other investment vehicles. Investment income in
fiscal 1994 was $15,706,000, an increase of 10.4% from fiscal 1993. The
increase was principally a result of a higher level of capital gains from the
Company's portfolio of marketable securities.



                        Liquidity and Capital Resources


     The Company has liquid resources which are used in its business totaling
$208,324,000 at April 30, 1995. In addition to $90,311,000 in working capital,
the Company has marketable securities with a market value of $118,013,000, that,
although classified as non-current assets are also readily marketable as the
need for capital arises. The Company has entered into agreements to sell and
repurchase U.S. Government Agency debt securities included in working capital
with a market value of $39,099,000 at April 30, 1995. The repurchase obligations
of $36,994,000 have been entered into on a short term basis. The securities,
currently available for sale, mature during calendar year 1997 and are readily
marketable should management decide to liquidate the Company's holdings and
related obligations. The Company's cash position, including its investment in
The Value Line Cash Fund has increased $30,696,000 at April 30, 1995 largely as
a result of the liquidation of certain of the Company's equity and fixed income
holdings in the Value Line Mutual Funds. The holdings in these funds were
sold primarily to realize certain tax benefits during fiscal 1995.

     Management believes that the Company's cash and other liquid asset
resources used in its business, together with future cash flows from operations,
will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations.

     Management anticipates no significant borrowing requirements during fiscal
1995 other than the short term refinancing of the repurchase obligations.
                                                                          13

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of
Value Line, Inc.


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Value Line,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at April 30, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to above also
included an audit of the Financial Statement Schedules listed in Item 14(a) of
this Form 10-K. In our opinion, these Financial Statement Schedules present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

                                 Value Line, Inc.
                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Note 1-Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

  Value Line, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated in New York State and
carries on the investment periodicals and related publications and investment
management activities formerly performed by Arnold Bernhard & Co., Inc. (the
"Parent") which owns approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding common
stock of the Company.

  Principles of consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Revenue recognition:  Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the
terms of the subscriptions which range from three months to three years.
Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by servicing
subscriptions after the date of the balance sheet is shown as unearned
revenue. The unearned revenue shown on the balance sheet is a noncurrent
deferred credit. This classification recognizes that the fulfillment of this
commitment will require the use of significantly less current assets than the
amount of the unearned revenues and, accordingly, combining it with current
liabilities would significantly understate the liquidity position of the
Company.

  Investment management fees are recorded as revenue as the related services
are performed.

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase:

The Company has entered into agreements to sell and repurchase U.S.
Government Agency debt securities. The securities are recorded at market
value and are included in "Short-term securities available for sale" on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Valuation of Securities:

  Effective May 1, 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). As a result of adopting SFAS
115, the Company changed the method by which it values its long-term
securities portfolio, which consists of shares of the Value Line Mutual
Funds, and short-term securities portfolio, which the Company classifies as
available for sale, from the lower of aggregate cost or market to market
value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of
applicable taxes, as a separate component of Shareholders' Equity. Realized
gains and losses on sales of the securities are recorded in earnings on trade
date and are determined on the identified cost method. SFAS 115 cannot be
retroactively applied to the financial statements of periods prior to May 1,
1994.

  Trading securities, which consist of securities held by Value Line
Securities, Inc., the Company's broker-dealer subsidiary, and certain
adjustable rate preferred shares held by the Company, are valued at market
with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.

  Goodwill:  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of net assets acquired and is being amortized over a period of 40
years.

                                 Value Line, Inc.
                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

  Earnings per share:  Earnings per share are based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding
during each year.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short term
liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months to be
cash and cash equivalents. As of April 30, 1995 and 1994, cash equivalents
included $41,503,000 and $10,266,000, respectively, invested in the Value
Line money market funds.

  Reclassification:  Certain prior year amounts disclosed in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation.

Note 2-Supplementary Cash Flow Information:

  Cash payments for income taxes were $12,974,000, $20,171,000, and
$18,123,000, in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Interest payments of
$1,315,000, $183,000 and $201,000 were made in 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

Note 3-Related Party Transactions:

  The Company acts as investment adviser and manager for fifteen open-end
investment companies known as the Value Line Family of Funds (see Note 4).
The Company earns investment management fees calculated based upon the
average daily net asset values of the respective funds.  The Company also
earns brokerage commission income, net of clearing fees, on securities
transactions executed by Value Line Securities, Inc. on behalf of the funds
and other advisory clients of the Company that are cleared on a fully
disclosed basis through non-affiliated brokers.  For the years ended April

Note 15-Net Capital:

The Company's wholly owned broker/dealer subsidiary, Value Line Securities,
Inc.,  is subject to the net capital provisions of Rule 15c3-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the maintenance of minimum
net capital of $100,000 and requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined,
shall not exceed fifteen times net capital, as defined.  Additionally,
dividends may only be declared if aggregate indebtedness is less than twelve
times net capital.

At April 30, 1995, Value Line Securities', Inc. net capital, as defined, of
$39,331,748 exceeded required net capital by $38,550,090 and the ratio of
aggregate indebtedness to net capital was .30 to 1.

                    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 16-Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and
        Concentration of Credit Risk:

The Company executes, as agent, securities transactions on behalf of the
Value Line mutual funds.  If either the mutual fund or a counterparty fail to
perform, the Company may be required to discharge the obligations of the
nonperforming party.  In such circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss
if the market value of the security is different from the contract value of
the transaction.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual
commitments, principally financial futures contracts for securities indices.
Financial futures contracts provide for the delayed delivery of financial
instruments for which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified
future date, at a specified price or yield.  The contract or notional amount
of these contracts reflects the extent of involvement the Company has in
these contracts. At April 30, 1995, the underlying notional value of such
commitments was $5,942,625.  Risk arises from the potential inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in
securities values.  The Company limits its credit risk associated with such
instruments by entering exclusively into exchange traded futures contracts.

  No single customer accounted for a significant portion of the Company's
sales in 1995, 1994 or 1993, nor accounts receivable for 1995 or 1994.

Note 17-Estimated Fair Value of Financial and Derivative Instruments:

  Statement of Accounting Standards No. 119, "Disclosure About Derivative
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires
disclosure of information regarding derivative instruments, which include
financial index futures contracts.

  Derivative instruments held for trading purposes are reflected at fair
value at April 30, 1995. The fair value and the average fair value of
derivative instruments at April 30, 1995 and for the year then ended consists
of liabilities of $332,925 and $50,102, respectively.

  Net trading gains related to equity securities aggregated $5,227,790 for
the year ended April 30, 1995. Net trading losses related to derivative
financial instruments amounted to $570,552 for the year ended April 30, 1995.

Note 18-Mutual Fund Support Expenses:

  On June 28, 1994, the Company purchased, as part of its investment
management operations for which it receives fee income, U.S. Government
Agency notes with a market value as of that date of $38,615,000 from the
Value Line Cash Fund, for which it is the investment adviser. In order to
maintain a $1.00 per share net asset value, as part of the same
transaction, the Company reimbursed the Value Line Cash Fund $1,550,000 for
losses the Fund incurred on the sale which the Company may recoup in the
future.
