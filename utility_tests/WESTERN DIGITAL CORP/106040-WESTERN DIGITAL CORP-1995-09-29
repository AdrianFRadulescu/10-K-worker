                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
     Western Digital Corporation (the "Company" or "Western Digital") designs,
manufactures and sells hard drives for the personal computer ("PC") market. The
Company is one of the five largest independent manufacturers of hard drives. The
Company's principal drive products are 3.5-inch form factor hard drives with
storage capacities from 540 megabytes ("MBs") to 1.6 gigabytes ("GBs"),
including the Caviar AC31600, a 1.6 GB drive, that began initial volume
shipments in May 1995.
 
     The hard drive market is highly cyclical and is characterized by
significant price erosion over the life of a product, periodic rapid price
declines due to industry over-capacity or other competitive factors,
technological changes, changing market requirements and requirements for
significant expenditures for product development. The Company's strategy in
response to these conditions is to increase market share by achieving time-
to-market leadership with new product introductions while minimizing its fixed
cost structure and maximizing the utilization of its assets. The Company
implements this strategy, in part, by capitalizing on its expertise in control
and communication electronics to deliver greater storage capacity per disk from
components widely available in the commercial market, such as disks and heads,
and to provide a high degree of commonality of component parts among its hard
drive products.
 
     The Company also designs and sells an array of microcomputer products
("MCP") consisting of integrated circuits ("ICs") and board products which
perform or enhance graphics and input/output ("I/O") functions in PCs and other
computer systems. The Company's MCP focus is to bring to market superior
graphical user interface and I/O control products through its applications
knowledge and integrated circuit design capability.
 
     The Company sells its products through its worldwide direct sales force to
PC manufacturers, resellers and distributors. The Company's direct sales
organization is structured so that each customer is served by a single sales
team which markets the Company's entire product line. The Company's OEM
(original equipment manufacturer) customers include AST Research, Compaq
Computer, Dell Computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Gateway 2000,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and NEC. The Company's reseller and distributor customers
include Best Buy, Computer City, Comp USA, Egghead, Incredible Universe,
Lechmere, Office Depot, Radio Shack and Walmart.
 
     In December 1993, the Company sold its Irvine, California silicon wafer
fabrication facility and certain other tangible assets to Motorola, Inc. The
Company has entered into various silicon wafer supply agreements since the sale
of the facility and anticipates that it will enter into additional supply
arrangements with other companies in the future. During 1995, the Company
converted its facility in Malaysia from an IC assembly and test facility to a
hard drive manufacturing facility. The Company has obtained independent
contractors to supply finished ICs that were previously supplied by this
facility. However, a disruption in the supply of wafers or finished ICs for any
reason could have a material adverse impact on the Company -- see
"Manufacturing."
 
     The rapid increase in industry demand for hard drive units has, on
occasion, resulted in shortages of certain key components used in the
manufacture of hard drives. If certain components continue to remain in short
supply in the future, these component shortages could have a material adverse
impact on the Company -- see "Manufacturing."
 
     The Company's principal executive offices are located at 8105 Irvine Center
Drive, Irvine, California 92718, and its telephone number is (714) 932-5000.
Effective July 1, 1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to
a 52 or 53-week year ending on the Saturday nearest June 30. Accordingly, the
1995 fiscal year ended on July 1, whereas the previous fiscal years ended on
June 30. All general references herein to years relate to fiscal years unless
otherwise noted.

MARKETS
 
     The Company sells its hard drive products to manufacturers of desktop and
notebook PCs and to selected resellers and distributors. The market for the
Company's products is characterized by short product life cycles and a
continuing demand for increasingly cost-effective, high-performance products. In
addition, the hard drive market has in recent years experienced periods of
extraordinarily competitive price discounting which produced significant
operating losses for a number of competitors in this market, including Western
Digital.
 
     The rapid increase in PC performance and storage requirements and the need
for PC manufacturers to differentiate their products have increased the demand
for higher capacity products. At the same time, intense price competition among
PC manufacturers requires that hard drive suppliers meet aggressive cost targets
in order to become high-volume suppliers. The market for PC hard drives is
segmented by type of computer (portable, desktop), form factor (2.5-inch,
3.5-inch) and storage capacity (currently up to 1.6 GBs). The segment of the PC
market currently generating the largest requirements for hard drives is the
desktop segment which uses 3.5-inch drives ranging in capacity from 540 MBs to
1.6 GBs. In addition, the Company anticipates that the market for portable and
desktop PCs will accelerate as technological advancements increase their
functionality and as user acceptance expands.
 
     The Company sells its I/O control products to manufacturers of
high-performance PCs and high-performance hard drives. This market is
characterized by rapid new product introduction and an increasing demand for
higher performance, lower cost ICs. The Company also sells its graphics add-in
boards in the retail market to PC end-users under its Paradise(R) brand name.
 
PRODUCTS
 
     Revenues from hard drive products were $1.9, $1.4 and $1.0 billion for
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Revenues from microcomputer products were
$191.0, $160.0 and $178.0 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
HARD DRIVE PRODUCTS
 
     Technology.  Hard drives are used to record, store and retrieve digital
data. They are faster than floppy disk, tape and optical disk drives and cost
less than semiconductor memory. Commonly quoted measures of hard drive
performance are storage capacity, average seek time (the average time to move
the heads from one track to another), data transfer rate (the rate at which data
are transferred between the drive and the host computer) and spindle rotational
speed.
 
     Product Offerings.  The Company's current line of hard drive products
consists of the Caviar(R) family of low-profile drives which includes 1-inch
high, 3.5-inch form factor models for desktop applications and 2.5-inch form
factor models for portable computer applications. Each of these drives features
CacheFlowTM, the Company's proprietary adaptive disk caching system which
significantly enhances the drive's read/write performance as measured by the
rate at which it can deliver data to or receive it from the computer. An
additional common feature is the Company's proprietary drive control and
communication electronic circuitry called Architecture II, which spans the
Company's entire 3.5-inch Caviar product line. Architecture II features Enhanced
IDE (integrated drive electronics) technology, which provides the desktop
marketplace the key attributes of the SCSI (small computer systems interface)
interface while retaining the focus on ease-of-use, compatibility and overall
lower cost of connection advantages, all of which are the traditional strengths
of IDE. The Company believes that the commonality of control and communication
electronics featured in all of the Caviar hard drives facilitates customer
qualification of successive product models, reduces risk of inventory
obsolescence, and allows the Company to place larger orders for components,
resulting in reduced component cost.

MICROCOMPUTER PRODUCTS
 
     I/O Products.  The Company supplies control electronics to certain
manufacturers of high-performance, high-capacity hard drives and other storage
peripherals utilizing the SCSI bus interface. These manufacturers of SCSI disk,
tape and optical drives utilize the Company's storage control chip sets for
their logic and control electronics. The Company recently introduced a new
family of products which provide the user access to SCSI capabilities for PCs
which use the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus. The Company also
supplies products which provide high-speed fibre channel fabric communications.
 
     Multimedia Products.  The Company supplies a family of RocketCHIPTM brand
name graphics ICs and Paradise brand name add-in cards to the desktop and
portable PC markets. Graphics ICs and Paradise add-in cards provide enhanced
video graphics array ("Super VGA") functionality. These products allow major
enhancements in display resolution and color depth quality and incorporate a
Windows acceleration feature, which provides faster display of icons and other
graphics features in the Windows operating system without the need for new PC
hardware.
 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
     The Company sells its products primarily to PC manufacturers, and, to a
lesser extent, resellers and distributors through its worldwide direct sales
force. The Company's direct sales organization is structured so that each
customer is served by a single sales team. Each sales team is responsible for
marketing the Company's entire product line and providing timely feedback to
engineering regarding the customer's new product requirements. This promotes
early identification of and response to the customer's full range of product
needs. Later, in the production stage, the team focus enables the Company to
provide timely product delivery and effective service. Many of the Company's OEM
customers purchase both hard drives and MCP products from the Company. These
customers include AST Research, Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Digital
Equipment Corporation, Gateway 2000, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and NEC. While Western
Digital believes its relationships with key customers are very good, the
concentration of sales to a relatively small number of major customers presents
a business risk that loss of one or more accounts could adversely affect the
Company's operating results. During 1995, sales to Gateway 2000 accounted for
11% of revenues. During 1994, sales to Gateway 2000 and IBM each accounted for
12% of revenues. During 1993, sales to Gateway 2000 and IBM accounted for 13%
and 11% of revenues, respectively.
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   5
 
     The Company also sells its products through its direct sales force to
selected resellers, which include major distributors, mass merchandisers and
value-added resellers. These customers include Best Buy, Computer City, Comp
USA, Egghead, Incredible Universe, Lechmere, Office Depot, Radio Shack and
Walmart. In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company's reseller
agreements provide for price protection for unsold inventories that the
resellers may have at the time of changes in published price lists, and, under
certain circumstances, stock rotation for slow-moving items. These agreements
may be terminated by either party upon written notice and, in the event of
termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase such inventories.
 
     Western Digital maintains sales offices and technical support in the United
States, Europe and Asia. The Company's international sales, which include sales
to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, represented 43%, 44%, and 43% of
revenues for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Sales to international customers
may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations.
 
     For information concerning sales by geographic region, see Note 8 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated herein by reference.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company devotes substantial resources to research and development in
order to develop new products and improve existing products. The Company also
focuses its engineering efforts to coordinate its product design and
manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a
cost-effective and timely manner. The Company's research and development
expenses totaled $130.8, $112.8 and $101.6 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
 
     The market for the Company's products is subject to rapid technological
change and short product life cycles. To remain competitive, the Company must
anticipate the needs of the market and successfully develop and introduce new
products in a timely fashion. If not carefully planned and executed, the
introduction of new products may adversely affect sales of existing products and
increase risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, new products typically
have lower initial manufacturing yields and higher initial component costs than
more mature products. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to
successfully complete the design and introduction of new products, manufacture
the products at acceptable yields and costs, effectively manage product
transitions or obtain significant orders for these products.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
     The Company assembles hard drives in its plants in Singapore and Malaysia
and the Company recently began expansion of its hard drive manufacturing
facility in Malaysia. These plants have complete responsibility for all hard
drives in volume production, including manufacturing, engineering, purchasing,
inventory management, assembly, test, quality assurance and shipping of finished
units. The Company purchases most of the standard mechanical components and
micro controllers for its hard drives from external suppliers, although the
Company does manufacture a substantial portion of the media for its hard drives
in its Santa Clara, California facility.
 
     The Company experiences fluctuations in manufacturing yields that can
materially affect the Company's operations, particularly in the start-up phase
of new products or new manufacturing processes. With the continued pressures to
shorten the time required to introduce new products, the Company must accelerate
production learning curves to shorten the time to achieve acceptable
manufacturing yields and costs. No assurance can be given that the Company's
operations will not be adversely affected by these fluctuations or that it can
shorten its new product development cycles or manufacturing learning curves
sufficiently to achieve these objectives in the future.
 
     As a result of the sale of its wafer fabrication facility in December 1993
and conversion of its Malaysia IC assembly and test facility to a hard drive
manufacturing plant, the Company has entered into various agreements with
multiple vendors to purchase fabricated wafers and has also obtained
arrangements with
 
                                        5
<PAGE>   6
 
independent contractors to supply finished ICs that were previously supplied by
the Company's Malaysia facility. However, a disruption in the supply of wafers
or finished ICs for any reason could have a material adverse impact on the
Company.
 
     Because the Company has manufacturing facilities located in Singapore and
Malaysia, the Company is subject to certain foreign manufacturing risks such as
changes in government policies, high employee turn-over, political risk,
transportation delays, tariffs, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
import, export, exchange and tax controls. To date, exposure to such risks has
not had a material effect on the Company's business, consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
 
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES
 
     The principal components used in the manufacture of the Company's hard
drives are read/write heads (both thin film and MIG) and related head stack
assemblies, media, micro controllers, spindle motors and mechanical parts used
in the head-disk assembly. The Company also uses standard semiconductor
components such as logic, memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other
manufacturers as well as proprietary semiconductor circuits manufactured for the
Company and a wide variety of other parts, including connectors, cables and
switches.
 
     A number of the components used by the Company are available from a single
or limited number of outside suppliers. Some of these materials may periodically
be in short supply, and the Company has, on occasion, experienced temporary
delays or increased costs in obtaining these materials. An extended shortage of
required materials and supplies could have an adverse effect upon the revenue
and earnings of the Company. In addition, the Company must allow for significant
lead times when procuring certain materials and supplies. The Company has more
than one available source of supply for most of its required materials. Where
there is only one source of supply, the Company believes that a second source
could be obtained within a reasonable period of time. However, no assurance can
be given that the Company's results of operations would not be adversely
affected until a new source could be located.
 
     The Company purchases substantially all of its thin film head requirements
for hard drives from Read-Rite Corporation. The Company also uses MIG heads for
certain products, which are supplied by several vendors. Any significant
disruption in the supply of these components could have an adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations.
 
     In December 1993, the Company sold its Irvine, California silicon wafer
fabrication facility -- see "General." From 1990 until the sale, the Company
manufactured silicon wafers in the Irvine facility. The Company also buys wafers
fabricated by other companies. Since the sale of the wafer fabrication facility,
the Company has obtained various outside sources to manufacture its
semiconductor wafer requirements. The Company has also obtained independent
contractors to supply finished ICs that were previously supplied by the
Company's Malaysia facility. The Company converted its Malaysia IC assembly and
test facility to a hard drive manufacturing plant in 1995 in response to the
increasing unit demand for hard drive products. However, a disruption in the
supply of wafers or finished ICs for any reason could have a material adverse
impact on the Company.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The PC industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by
significant price erosion over the life of a product, periodic rapid price
declines due to industry over-capacity or other competitive factors,
technological changes, changing market requirements, occasional shortages of
materials, dependence upon a limited number of vendors for certain components,
dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel and significant
expenditures for product development. The hard drive market in particular has
been subject to recurring periods of severe price competition. Certain of the
Company's competitors have greater financial and other resources and broader
product lines than the Company with which to compete in this environment.
 
     In general, the unit price for a given product in all of the Company's
markets decreases over time as increases in industry supply and cost reductions
occur and as technological advancements are achieved. Cost
 
                                        6

reductions are primarily achieved as volume efficiencies are realized, component
cost reductions are achieved, experience is gained in manufacturing the product
and design enhancements are made. Competitive pressures and customer
expectations result in these cost improvements being passed along as reductions
in selling prices. At times, the rate of general price decline is accelerated
when some competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity, liquidate excess
inventories and/or to gain market share. The hard drive industry has experienced
all of these effects on pricing during the past three fiscal years.
 
     The Company believes that proprietary hard drive, semiconductor, and
board-level design technology, close technical relationships with key OEM
customers and vendors, diverse product lines, competitive pricing, adequate
capital resources and worldwide low cost/high volume manufacturing capabilities
are key factors for successfully competing in its market areas. The Company's
principal competitors in the hard drive industry are Conner Peripherals, Maxtor,
Quantum and Seagate Technology, and large computer manufacturers such as IBM
that manufacture drives for use in their own products and for sale to others. In
other market areas the Company competes with a variety of companies including
Adaptec, Chips and Technologies, Cirrus Logic, LSI Logic, S3 Incorporated, Tseng
Labs and VLSI Technology.
 
     The Company also competes with companies offering products based on
alternative data storage and retrieval technologies. Technological advances in
magnetic, optical, flash or other technologies, could result in the introduction
of competitive products with performance superior to and prices lower than the
Company's products, which could adversely affect the Company's results of
operations.
 
BACKLOG
 
     At July 1, 1995, the Company's backlog, consisting of orders scheduled for
delivery within the next twelve months, aggregated approximately $425.8 million,
compared with a backlog at June 30, 1994 which aggregated approximately $223.1
million. Historically, a substantial portion of the Company's orders have been
for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order. The Company's
sales are made under contracts and purchase orders that, under industry
practice, may be canceled with relatively short notice to the Company, subject
to payment of certain costs, or modified by customers to provide for delivery at
a later date. Also, certain of the Company's sales to OEMs are made under
"just-in-time" delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
commitments by the customer. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the
Company's revenue and profit.
 
PATENTS AND LICENSES
 
     Although the Company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications
in process, the Company believes that the successful manufacture and marketing
of its products generally depends more upon the experience, technical know-how
and creative ability of its personnel rather than upon ownership of patents.
 
     The Company pays royalties under several patent licensing agreements that
require periodic payments. From time to time, the Company receives claims of
alleged patent infringement from patent holders which typically contain an offer
to grant the Company a license. It is the Company's policy to evaluate each
claim and, if appropriate, to enter into licensing arrangements. Although patent
holders commonly offer such licenses, no assurance can be given that licenses
will be offered or that the terms of any offered license will be acceptable to
the Company. No assurance can be given that failure to obtain a license would
not adversely affect the Company's business, consolidated financial position or
results of operations -- see "Legal Proceedings."
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     As of July 1, 1995, the Company employed a total of 7,647 full-time
employees, of whom 803 were engaged in engineering, 526 in sales and
administration and 442 in manufacturing in the United States. The Company
employed 1,592 employees at its hard drive manufacturing facility in Malaysia,
4,157 at its hard drive manufacturing facility in Singapore, and 127 at its
international sales offices.
 
                                        7
<PAGE>   8
 
     Many of the Company's employees are highly skilled, and the Company's
continued success depends in part upon the ability to attract and retain such
employees. In an effort to attract and retain such employees, the Company
continues to offer employee benefit programs which it believes are at least
equivalent to those offered by its competitors. Despite these programs, the
Company has, along with most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times
in hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. In critical areas, the
Company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs
until full-time employees could be recruited. The Company has never experienced
a work stoppage, none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor
organization and the Company considers its employee relations to be good.
 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
     The Company's headquarters are located in a 358,000 square foot building in
Irvine, California. This building houses management, research and development,
administrative and sales personnel and is leased to the Company pursuant to an
agreement expiring in June 2000. The Company's hard drive manufacturing
facilities are located in Singapore and Malaysia. The Singapore facility
consists of several buildings totaling approximately 297,000 square feet. These
buildings are leased to the Company pursuant to several agreements expiring from
November 1996 through August 1997. The 88,000 square foot Malaysia facility is
owned by the Company and located in Kuala Lumpur. The Company recently acquired
an adjacent parcel of land in Malaysia to expand its hard drive manufacturing
facility. In addition, the Company leases office space in Mountain View and San
Jose, California and in Rochester, Minnesota for research and development
activities, and in Santa Clara, California for media processing activities.
 
     The Company also leases office space in various other locations throughout
the world primarily for sales and technical support. The Company's present
facilities are adequate for its current needs, although the process of upgrading
its facilities to meet technological and market requirements is expected to
continue.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The Company was sued by Amstrad plc ("Amstrad") in December 1992 in Orange
County Superior Court. The complaint alleges that hard drives supplied by the
Company in 1988 and 1989 were defective and caused damages to Amstrad of $186.0
million for out-of-pocket expenses, lost profits, injury to Amstrad's reputation
and loss of goodwill. The Company filed a counterclaim for $3.0 million in
actual damages plus exemplary damages in an unspecified amount. The Company
believes that it has meritorious defenses to Amstrad's claims and intends to
vigorously defend itself against the Amstrad lawsuit.
 
     The Company was sued in March 1993 in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California by Conner Peripherals, Inc. ("Conner"). The
suit alleges that the Company infringes five Conner patents and seeks damages
(including treble damages) in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. If
Conner were to prevail in its claims, the Company could be enjoined from using
any of the Conner patents found to be valid and infringed that are the subject
of this action as well as held liable for past infringement damages. The amount
of such damages, if any, could be material. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to Conner's claims and intends to defend itself against the
Conner lawsuit. The Company has also filed a suit alleging that Conner infringes
two of the Company's patents.
 
     The Company was sued in December 1994 by Rodime plc ("Rodime") in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. The suit
alleges that the Company infringes one of Rodime's patents which relates to
3.5-inch hard drives. Based on the opinion of patent counsel, the Company
believes that the broad claims of the Rodime patent, if scrutinized in court,
will not withstand an attack on validity and believes the Company has not
infringed any valid claim of the Rodime patent. If Rodime were to prevail on its
claim, the Company could be held liable for damages for past infringement. The
damages, if any, are uncertain but could be material. The Company believes that
it has meritorious defenses to Rodime's claims and intends to vigorously defend
itself against the Rodime lawsuit.
 
     The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims
arising in connection with its business. There can be no assurance that such
legal proceedings and claims would be resolved without any material adverse
effect on the Company's business, consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
 
                                        8
<PAGE>   9
 
     It is management's opinion, however, that none of the above mentioned legal
proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. The costs of
defending such litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome.

                   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON SCHEDULES
 
The Board of Directors
Western Digital Corporation:
 
     Under date of July 17, 1995, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets
of Western Digital Corporation as of July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 1, 1995, as
contained in the 1995 Annual Report to shareholders. These consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 1995. In connection with our audits of
the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the
related consolidated financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial
statement schedule based on our audits.
 
     In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                                FISCAL YEAR 1996

                  WESTERN DIGITAL SHORT-TERM BONUS PLAN SUMMARY

                              PURPOSE
                              --------------------------------------------------

                              The purpose of the plan is to focus participants
                              on achieving key financial and strategic
                              objectives at the corporate and business unit
                              levels that will lead to the creation of value for
                              the Company's shareholders and provide
                              participants the opportunity to earn significant
                              awards, commensurate with performance.

                              ELIGIBILITY
                              --------------------------------------------------

                              Plan eligibility is extended to all employees of
                              Western Digital and selected employees of its
                              domestic subsidiaries who are in, or who are hired
                              or promoted into, salary grades 68 and above (or
                              equivalent) on or before January 1, 1996.

                              Employees of Western Digital and its domestic
                              subsidiaries who are in salary grades 67 or below
                              (or equivalent) are eligible for awards generated
                              by a secondary bonus pool.

                              DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN
                              --------------------------------------------------

                              The 1996 Short-Term Bonus Plan will pay cash
                              awards to participants for the achievement of
                              predetermined performance goals. Each participant
                              will be assigned a target bonus percentage, which
                              when multiplied by the participant's annual base
                              salary as of June 30, 1996, will determine the
                              target bonus payout.

                              Predetermined performance goals will be
                              established and approved by the Compensation
                              Committee of the Board before the end of the first
                              quarter of the fiscal year.

                              The actual performance achieved will determine the
                              actual percentage used to calculate the award at
                              the end of the plan year, with the size of the
                              actual award varying between 0% and 200% of the
                              target award.

                              In addition, individual awards may be adjusted
                              upward or downward by the Chief Executive Officer
                              from the amount generated by the formula. The
                              Chief Executive Officer's award may be adjusted
                              upward or downward by the Compensation Committee.

                              OPERATION OF THE PLAN
                              --------------------------------------------------

Performance Measures:         Performance will be measured at the corporate and
                              business unit levels. Performance measures that
                              will be used in the plan are as follows:

                              -  Operating profit
                              -  Operating return on operating assets
                                 (OROA) relative to direct competitors
                              -  Business unit financials 
                              -  Linearity

                              -  Quality

1996 Goals and Weighting:     Each business unit will have its own goals at the 
                              corporate and/or business unit level, and each
                              goal will have an assigned weighting. These goals
                              and their definitions and weightings are detailed
                              in Schedule A.

                              The percentage of target bonus opportunity earned
                              (before discretionary adjustments) will vary from
                              the target bonus opportunity based on actual
                              performance achieved relative to the performance
                              goals shown in Schedule A.

                              ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

                              the preset percentage cap will be made by the

                                   individuals also participate in Western
                                   Digital's Profit Sharing Plan.

Extraordinary Events:         The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may
                              adjust the basis upon which performance is
                              measured to reflect the impact of significant
                              changes that include, but are not limited to,
                              unbudgeted acquisitions/divestitures, unusual or
                              extraordinary accounting items, or significant,
                              unplanned changes in the economic or regulatory
                              environment.

Termination:                  Participants must be employed by the Company at 
                              the end of the plan year to receive an award. If a
                              participant terminates for reason of retirement,
                              total and permanent disability, or death, the
                              Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay
                              prorated awards based upon the percentage of the
                              year worked.

Partial Year Participation:   The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may
                              pay prorated awards to people hired or promoted
                              into eligible positions after July 1, 1995.

Deferred Payout:              At the beginning of the plan year, the participant
                              may elect to defer payout of all or part of the
                              award in accordance with Western Digital's
                              Deferred Compensation Plan. The deferred amount
                              will be credited with a rate in accordance with
                              Western Digital's Deferred Compensation Plan.

Payout of Award:              Awards will be paid in cash as soon as possible 
                              following the end of the plan year or in
                              accordance with the participant's deferral
                              election. In addition, an amount will be deducted
                              from the award and contributed

                              Plan. This amount will be based upon a percentage
                              of salary, and the percentage will be the same as
                              that used by all participants in the Western
                              Digital Profit Sharing Plan to determine the
                              contributions that they will make to the Western
                              Digital Savings and Profit Sharing Plan.

Secondary Pool:               Secondary award pools will be created for 
                              employees in salary grades 67 or below (or
                              equivalent) for all corporate and business units.
                              The formula used to generate a secondary pool for
                              each unit is as follows:

                                                    Pool =

                                    Formula generated result [0% to 200%]

                                                     x

                              (1.67% of grades 64-67 salaries + 1% of grades 63
                              and below salaries)

                WESTERN DIGITAL LONG-TERM RETENTION PLAN

                    Purpose
                    ---------------------------------------------------------
                    The purpose of the plan is to retain participants by 
                    providing a significant incremental opportunity for capital
                    accumulation and to focus participants on increasing the 
                    value of Western Digital (the "Company") stock.
 
                    Eligibility
                    ----------------------------------------------------------
                    Plan eligibility is extended to a limited group of 
                    employees who are considered to be critical to the future 
                    success of the Company.

                    Description of the Plan
                    ----------------------------------------------------------
                    A "base amount" will be established for each participant. 
                    The base amount will fluctuate with Western Digital's stock
                    price and awards will vest and be paid out over a four year
                    period from the date the base amount is established, as 
                    follows (subject to continued employment):

                    Operation of the Plan
                    -----------------------------------------------------------
Effective Date of   July 1, 1995. Initial base amounts will be established and 
the Plan:           vesting will begin as of this date.
                    
Award Pool:         The Board of Directors, without the participation or vote 
                    of any Directors who are or who during the past twelve 
                    months have been employees of the Company or any of its 
                    subsidiaries, will establish an overall amount that is 
                    available for awards.

Establishment of    The initial base amount for elected officers of the Company 
Base Amount:        will be recommended by the Compensation Committee of the 
                    Board of Directors and approved by the Board of Directors 
                    without the participation or vote of any Directors who are 
                    or during the previous twelve months have been employees of 
                    the Company or


                                          1
<PAGE>   2
                    any of its subsidiaries. The base amounts for all other
                    participants will be determined by the Chief Executive
                    Officer. These base amounts will be subject to the overall
                    amount available in the award pool. The value of the 
                    unvested portions of the base amounts will vary based on the
                    Company's stock price performance. 

Valuation Date:     The valuation date will be the date on which the Company's
                    stock price performance will be measured for payout
                    purposes. A new valuation date will occur on January 1 and
                    July 1 of each year.

Crediting Rate:     The value of the unvested portion of the base amount will
                    increase or decrease semi-annually on the plan's valuation
                    date in accordance with the changes in the Company's stock
                    price.

                    To desensitize the plan from the effects of short-term highs
                    or lows in the stock price, the stock price used to
                    determine the crediting rate will be an average of the daily
                    closing stock prices over the 12 months immediately prior to
                    the valuation date, compared to the previous valuation
                    date's average 12-month stock price.

                    Example:

                    July 1, 1995, Account Balance                      $400,000
                    July 1, 1995, Average 12 Month Stock Price           $15.00
                    January 1, 1996, Average 12 Month Stock Price        $16.50
                    Stock Price Change = ($16.50 - $15.00/$15.00           +10%
                    January 1, 1996, Account Balance =
                        $500,000 + ($400,000 x 10%)                    $440,000

                    Additional Provisions
                    ------------------------------------------------------------

                    additional base amount is determined on any date other than

                    commence vesting as of the most recent valuation date, and
                    will be valued as if the additional base amount had been

                    date, and will be valued as if the base amount had been
                    determined on the most recent valuation date.

Charge in Control:       In the event of a "Change of Control" (as defined in
                         the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, all unvested
                         base amounts will be vested immediately prior to the
                         effectiveness thereof.


Deferred Payout:         Within one year of the establishment of any base
                         amounts under the plan, the participant may elect to
                         defer payout of any or all of the three individually
                         vesting portions of the base amount in accordance with
                         the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. After each
                         portion of any base amount vests and if the participant
                         has elected to defer payout of that vested portion, it
                         will be credited to the participant's account under the
                         Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and administered
                         pursuant thereto.


Payout of Award:         The payout will be in cash only upon vesting of each
                         portion of any base amount or in accordance with the
                         participant's deferral election. No vesting will occur
                         after termination of a participant's employment for any
                         reason.

                         If the Company's tax deduction for any payout under
                         this plan would be disallowed under Internal Revenue
                         Code Section 162(m), the Company may, in its sole
                         discretion, defer payment of the excess amount, but
                         only to the extent that, and for so long as, the
                         Company's tax deduction for the payment would be
                         disallowed under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).
                         Amounts that are deferred for this reason will accrue
                         interest at a rate in accordance with the Company's
                         Deferred Compensation Plan.


Administration:          The Plan will be administered by the Compensation
                         Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, which
                         shall have the power to construe the Plan and to
                         delegate ministerial responsibilities to the Company.

                           WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION
                         SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN

                                   ARTICLE 1.

                                  INTRODUCTION

         Western Digital Corporation previously established the Western Digital
Corporation Savings and Investment Plan (the "Predecessor Plan") effective
October 1, 1984, for the benefit of certain of its employees.

         Effective August 20, 1986, the Adaptive Data Systems, Inc. Employee
Savings and Investment Plan was merged into the Predecessor Plan.

         Effective July 1, 1987, the Western Digital Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") and the Faraday Electronics, Inc. Profit
Sharing-Salary Savings Plan and Trust were merged into the Predecessor Plan and
the resulting Predecessor Plan was renamed the Western Digital Corporation
Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

         Effective July 1, 1987, the Predecessor Plan was amended and restated
to incorporate the provisions of the merged plans and to make various plan
design changes. That restatement was intended to be a continuation of the
Predecessor Plan.

         Effective September 7, 1989 the Verticom Savings and Retirement Plan
was merged into the Predecessor Plan.

         Effective May 10, 1991, the Predecessor Plan was split into two plans,
one consisting of the provisions relating to the ESOP Fund (as defined in
Section 1.16 of the Predecessor Plan) and the other consisting of provisions
relating to the remaining portion of the Predecessor Plan (the "401(k)
Portion"). Effective that same date, the 401(k) Portion was spun off from the
remaining portion of the Predecessor Plan and renamed the "Western Digital
Corporation Savings Plan" (the "Plan"). The remaining portion of the Predecessor
Plan was renamed the "Western Digital Corporation Employee Stock Ownership
Plan".

         The Plan was amended and restated as of May 10, 1991 to reflect the
spin-off and the continuation of the 401(k) Portion of the Predecessor Plan. The
Plan subsequently was amended by the First Amendment (executed December 23,
1992), the Second Amendment (executed March 23, 1993), the Third Amendment
(executed March 24, 1994), the Fourth Amendment (executed March 24, 1994), the
Fifth Amendment (executed November 1, 1994) and the Sixth Amendment (executed
concurrently with the execution of this Restatement of the Plan as of the date
of execution hereof). This Restatement incorporates all amendments through and
including the Sixth Amendment.


                                       1

         The Plan is intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) as a profit
sharing plan and Section 401(k) as a cash or deferred arrangement.

         The purpose of the Plan is to enable participating employees to share
in Employer profits and to accumulate additional capital for retirement through
a convenient method of regular savings in a tax-efficient manner and matching
Employer Contributions.

         Although this Restatement reflects provisions of the Plan as in effect
as of the date of execution hereof, the effective date of any provision of the
Plan affected by amendment of the Plan shall be as set forth in such amendment.

                  of such benefits, such as cash-out of credits generated under

                  2.9.5. Solely for purposes of Article 15. (relating to certain
         limitations on annual additions to or benefits from qualified plans)
         and Article 19. (relating to top-heavy plans), the term "Compensation"
         shall mean wages within the meaning of Section 3401(a) of the Code and
         any other payments of compensation to the Employee by the Employer (in
         the course of the Employer's trade or business) for which the Employer
         is required to furnish the Employee a written statement under Sections
         6041(d) and 6051(a)(3) of the Code; provided, however, that such
         "Compensation" shall not include any amounts paid or reimbursed by the
         Employer for moving expenses incurred by the Employee, but only to the
         extent that at the time of payment it is reasonable to believe that
         these amounts are deductible by the Employee under Section 217 of the
         Code. For Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 1991, for
         purposes of applying the limitations of Article 15., Compensation for a
         Limitation Year, as defined in Subsection 15.1.2., is the Compensation
         actually paid or includible in gross income during such Limitation
         Year.

                  2.9.6. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by law,
         "Compensation" for any Plan Year that begins on or after July 1, 1989
         shall not exceed the annual compensation limit in effect under Section
         401(a)(17) of the Code on the January 1 coinciding with or immediately
         preceding the first day of such Plan Year, as provided in this
         Subsection.

                           2.9.6.1. For any Plan Year that begins on or after
                  January 1, 1994 such limit shall be $150,000, as that amount
                  is adjusted in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the
                  Code.

                           2.9.6.2. For any Plan Year that begins on or after
                  July 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1994, such limit shall be
                  $200,000, as that amount is adjusted at the same time and in
                  the same manner as under Section 415(d) of the Code.

                           2.9.6.3. In no event shall this Plan be deemed to
                  violate the annual limitation on Compensation under this
                  Subsection solely because such limitation is applied
                   

                                       6
<PAGE>   13

                  separately to Compensation taken into account for a Plan
                  Year for purposes of Section 4.2.1., 4.2.2., 4.4. and 5.9.

                           2.9.6.4. If Compensation for a period of less than
                  twelve (12) months is taken into account for any Plan Year,
                  then, to the extent required by regulations under Section
                  401(a)(17) of the Code, the otherwise applicable annual
                  Compensation limit provided under this Subsection 2.9.6. is
                  reduced in the same proportion as the reduction in the
                  twelve-month period. However, no proration shall be required
                  solely because Compensation taken into account for a Plan Year
                  includes only Compensation paid for periods during which the
                  Employee is an Active Participant (including a portion of a
                  Compensation year corresponding to a period of Active
                  Participation).

                           2.9.6.5. For purposes of the annual Compensation
                  limit provided under this Subsection, the family aggregation
                  rules of Section 414(q)(6) of the Code shall apply to an
                  Employee who is a five percent (5%) owner or one of the
                  top-ten highest paid Employees, except in applying such rules,
                  the term "family member" shall include only the Spouse and any
                  of the Employee's lineal descendants who have not attained age
                  19 before the close of the year. If, as a result of the
                  application of such rules the limit is exceeded, then, the
                  limit shall be prorated among the affected individuals in
                  proportion to each such individual's Compensation as
                  determined under this Subsection prior to the application of
                  this limit.

consecutive twelve-month period used for purposes of determining whether an
Employee is to be credited with a Year of Vesting or Eligibility Service, or a

         be credited with a Year of Eligibility Service or a Break in such
         Service, the Computation Period shall be the twelve-month period
         commencing on the Employee's Employment Commencement Date and the first
         day of any Plan Year commencing thereafter.

                  2.10.2. For purposes of determining whether an Employee is to
         be credited with a Year of Vesting Service or a Break in such Service,
         the Computation Period shall be the Plan Year.

         2.11. DISABILITY. "Disability" shall mean any physical or mental
condition which renders a person unable to engage in any substantial gainful
activity for the Company or an Affiliated Company for which he is reasonably
fitted by education, training, or experience. A physical or mental condition

effective as of the date on which the Participant qualifies for such payments.

         treated as a Maternity or Paternity Absence only if the Employee claims
         that such absence qualifies as a Maternity or Paternity Absence and
         furnishes such proof and information regarding such absence as the
         Administration Committee reasonably requires.

                  A Maternity or Paternity Absence shall be recognized solely
         for purposes of determining whether or not an Employee has incurred a
         Break in Service. Accordingly, such a Maternity or Paternity Absence

         3.1. ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE.

                 3.1.1. Each Eligible Employee who was a Participant in the
         Predecessor Plan on the date immediately preceding the Effective Date
         will automatically be a Participant in this Plan on the Effective
         Date, and any Pre-Tax Contribution election under the Predecessor Plan
         will apply to this Plan until changed according to Section 4.3.

                 3.1.2. Each other Eligible Employee will become a Participant
         on the date which is the later of his Employment Commencement Date or
         the date he becomes an Eligible Employee.  Each Participant is
         responsible for designating a beneficiary under the Plan and for
         designating the manner in which such Participant's Accounts are
         invested.  In the absence of any designation the Administration
         Committee shall apply such provisions of the Plan as pertain to a
         failure to designate a beneficiary or as pertain to failure to
         designate an investment selection, as the case may be, and neither the
         Administration Committee nor any other Plan representative shall have
         an obligation to monitor such designations.

                 3.1.3. A Participant will first be eligible to make Pre-Tax
         Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions as provided in Section

         provisions of Article 4. by making an election in form and manner
         satisfactory to the Administration Committee.

                 3.2.2.  The Administration Committee may, in its discretion,
         prescribe such rules relating to elections to participate and/or
         contribute as it deems necessary or appropriate to promote the orderly
         and efficient administration of the Plan.

         3.3. CHANGE IN STATUS. If an Active Participant is transferred from
one Employer to another Employer, he shall automatically become an Active
Participant under the Plan with such other Employer if he continues to be an
Eligible Employee; further, he shall continue to be a Participant with respect
to his Accounts at the date of transfer during the period that he is a
Participant under the Plan with such Employer.  If an Active Participant
becomes an ineligible Employee and therefore becomes ineligible to continue to



                                       21
<PAGE>   28
be an Active Participant because he is no longer an Eligible Employee, he shall
continue to be a Participant with respect to his Accounts at the date of his
change of status during the period of his subsequent employment as an
ineligible Employee.

         3.4. REEMPLOYMENT. A Participant who incurs a Severance and who again

Eligible Employee who elects to contribute to this Plan to verify that amounts
of his contributions are in accordance with his election, and investment of
such contributions is in accordance with his investment designation.

         accordance with Section 3.2., shall be effective as of the Entry date
         next following the date on which the election is properly made and is

         be given effect to the extent administratively practicable.

                 4.1.2. A Participant's contribution election shall remain in
         effect until it is modified, revoked or terminated, pursuant to
         Section 4.3., or until the Active Participant ceases to be an Eligible

         4.2. PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS. Participant contribution
amounts shall be subject to the limitations of this Section 4.2., in addition

         his election to make Pre-Tax Contributions is in effect.  Such maximum
         percentage shall, however, be reduced by the amount of After-Tax
         Contributions contributed by such Active Participant, in accordance
         with such rules as the Committee may prescribe.

                 4.2.2. AFTER-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS. The amount of an Active
         Participant's After-Tax Contributions shall be in whole percentage
         amounts of from one percent (1%) to fourteen percent (14%) of the
         Active Participant's Compensation for each payroll period for which
         his election to make After-Tax Contributions is in effect.  Such

         with such rules as the Committee may prescribe.  No Employer Matching
         Contributions are made with respect to a Participant's After-Tax
         Contributions.

                 4.2.3. In general, no Active Participant shall be permitted to
         make Pre-Tax Contributions in excess of the dollar limitation on the
         exclusion of elective deferrals from the Participant's gross income
         under Section 402(g) of the Code, as in effect with respect to the
         taxable year of the Participant (hereinafter referred to as the

         elective deferrals, within the meaning of Code Section 402(g)(3),
         under all plans of the Employer and any Affiliated Company, exceed the
         Deferral Limitation for any reason, such excess elective deferrals,
         and any income or loss allocable thereto, shall be returned to the

         Participant may modify his contribution election in accordance with
         such rules as the Administration Committee shall prescribe.  Such
         modification, made in accordance with Section 3.2. shall be effective
         as of the Entry date next following the date on which the modification
         is properly made and is received by the Administration Committee.

         during which the election is properly made and is received by


                                       24

         to the extent administratively practicable.  A revocation shall remain
         in effect throughout that Plan Year and all subsequent Plan Years
         until the Participant makes a new contribution election pursuant to
         Section 4.1.

                 4.3.3. A Participant's contribution election automatically
         shall terminate if he ceases to be an Eligible Employee.  If he again

         contributions.

                 4.3.4. The Administration Committee may prescribe such rules
         as it deems necessary or appropriate regarding the modification,
         revocation or termination of an Active Participant's contribution
         election.

         4.4. LIMITATION ON PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS BY HIGHLY COMPENSATED
EMPLOYEES. With respect to each Plan Year, Participant Pre-Tax Contributions
under the Plan for the Plan Year shall not exceed the limitations on
contributions on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees under Section 401(k) of
the Code, as provided in this Section. In the event that Pre-Tax Contributions
under this Plan on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees for any Plan Year
exceed the limitations of this Section for any reason, such excess
contributions and any income or loss allocable thereto shall be returned to the
Participant as provided in Section 4.5.

                 4.4.1. The Pre-Tax Contributions by a Participant for a Plan
         Year shall satisfy the Average Deferral Percentage test set forth in
         4.4.1.1.1. below, or the alternative Average Deferral Percentage test
         set forth in 4.4.1.1.2. below, and to the extent required by
         regulations under Code Section 401(m), also shall satisfy the test
         identified in 4.4.1.2. below:

                          4.4.1.1. BASIC TEST.

                                  4.4.1.1.1. The "Actual Deferral Percentage"
                          for Eligible Employees who are Highly Compensated
                          Employees shall not be more than the "Actual Deferral
                          Percentage" of all other Eligible Employees
                          multiplied by 1.25, or

                                  4.4.1.1.2. The excess of the "Actual Deferral
                          Percentage" for Eligible Employees who are Highly
                          Compensated Employees over the "Actual Deferral
                          Percentage" for all other Eligible Employees shall
                          not be more than two percentage points, and the
                          "Actual Deferral Percentage" for Highly Compensated
                          Employees shall not be more than the "Actual Deferral
                          Percentage" of all other Eligible Employees
                          multiplied by 2.00.

                          4.4.1.2. MULTIPLE USE TEST. Average Contribution
                 Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees eligible to
                 participate in this Plan and a plan of the Company or an
                 Affiliated Company that is subject to the limitations of
                 Section 401(m) of the Code including, if applicable, this
                 Plan, shall be reduced in accordance with Section 5.10., to
                 the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of Treasury
                 Regulations Section 1.401(m)-2.

                 4.4.2. For the purposes of the limitations of this Section,
         the following definitions shall apply:

                          4.4.2.1. "Actual Deferral Percentage" means, with
                 respect to Eligible Employees who are Highly Compensated
                 Employees and all other Eligible Employees for a Plan Year,
                 the average of the Deferral Percentages, calculated separately
                 for each Eligible Employee in such group.

                          4.4.2.2. "Deferral Percentage" means for any Eligible
                 Employee the ratio of the amount of Pre-Tax Contributions
                 under the Plan allocated to each Eligible Employee for such
                 Plan Year to such Employee's "Compensation" for such Plan
                 Year.  An Eligible Employee's Pre-Tax Contributions may be
                 taken into account for purposes of determining his Deferral
                 Percentage for a particular Plan Year only if such Pre-Tax
                 Contributions are allocated to the Eligible Employee as of a
                 date within that Plan Year.  For purposes of this rule, an
                 Eligible Employee's Pre-Tax Contributions shall be considered
                 allocated as of a date within a Plan Year only if (A) the
                 allocation is not contingent upon the Eligible Employee's
                 participation in the Plan or performance of services on any
                 date subsequent to that date, and (B) the Pre-Tax Contribution
                 is actually paid to the Trust no later than the end of the
                 twelve month period immediately following the Plan Year to
                 which the contribution relates.  In accordance with
                 regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, Employer
                 contributions on behalf of an Active Participant that satisfy
                 the requirements of Code Section 401(k)(3)(D)(ii) may also be
                 taken into account for the purpose of determining the Deferral
                 Percentage of such Active Participant.

                          4.4.2.3. "Eligible Employee" includes any Employee
                 directly or indirectly eligible to make Pre-Tax Contributions
                 at any time during the Plan Year, including any otherwise
                 Eligible Employee during a period of suspension due to a
                 hardship withdrawal, as prescribed by the Secretary of the
                 Treasury in regulations under Code Section 401(k).





                                       26
<PAGE>   33
                          4.4.2.4. "Compensation" means Compensation determined
                 by the Administration Committee in accordance with the
                 requirements of Section 414(s) of the Code, including, to the
                 extent elected by the Administration Committee, amounts
                 deducted from an Employee's wages or salary that are
                 excludable from income under Sections 125 and 402(a)(8) of the
                 Code.

                 4.4.3. In the event that as of the last day of a Plan Year
         this Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or 410(b) of
         the Code only if aggregated with one or more other plans which include
         arrangements under Code Section 401(k), then this Section shall be
         applied by determining the Actual Deferral Percentage of Eligible
         Employees as if all such plans were a single plan, in accordance with
         regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section
         401(k) of the Code.

                 4.4.4. For the purposes of this Section, the Deferral
         Percentage for any Highly Compensated Employee who is a participant
         under two or more Code Section 401(k) arrangements of the Company or
         an Affiliated Company shall be determined by taking into account the
         Highly Compensated Employee's Compensation under each such arrangement
         and contributions under each such arrangement which qualify for
         treatment under Code Section 401(k), in accordance with regulations
         prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 401(k) of
         the Code.

                 4.4.5. If an Eligible Employee (who is also a Highly
         Compensated Employee) is subject to the family aggregation rules in
         Section 2.22., the combined Deferral Percentage for the family group
         (which is treated as one Highly Compensated Employee) shall be the
         Deferral Percentage determined by combining the Pre-Tax Contributions,
         amounts treated as Pre-Tax Contributions under Code Section
         401(k)(3)(D)(ii), and Compensation of all eligible family members.

                 4.4.6. For purposes of this Section, the amount of Pre-Tax
         Contributions by a Participant who is not a Highly Compensated
         Employee for a Plan Year shall be reduced by any Pre-Tax Contributions
         in excess of the Deferral Limitation which have been distributed to
         the Participant under Section 4.6., in accordance with regulations
         prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 401(k) of
         the Code.

                 4.4.7. The determination of the Deferral Percentage of any
         Participant shall be made after applying the provisions of Section
         15.5. relating to certain limits on Annual Additions under Section 415
         of the Code.





                                       27
<PAGE>   34
                 4.4.8. The determination and treatment of Pre-Tax
         Contributions and the Deferral Percentage of any Participant shall
         satisfy such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary
         of the Treasury.

                 4.4.9. The Administration Committee shall keep or cause to
         have kept such records as are necessary to demonstrate that the Plan
         satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(k) and the regulations
         thereunder, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
         of the Treasury.

         4.5. PROVISIONS FOR DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS BY
HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

                 4.5.1. The Administration Committee shall determine, as soon
         as is reasonably possible following the close of each Plan Year, if
         the Actual Deferral Percentage test is satisfied for the Plan Year.
         If, pursuant to the determination by the Administration Committee, any
         or all of a Highly Compensated Employee's Pre-Tax Contributions must
         be reduced to enable the Plan to satisfy the Actual Deferral
         Percentage test, then any excess Pre-Tax Contributions by a Highly
         Compensated Employee, and any income or loss allocable thereto shall,
         if administratively feasible, be distributed to the Participant not
         later than two and one-half (2-1/2) months following the close of the
         Plan Year in which such excess Pre-Tax Contributions were made, but in
         any event no later than the close of the first Plan Year following the
         Plan Year in which such excess Pre-Tax Contributions were made (after
         withholding any applicable income taxes due on such amounts).
         Recharacterization of excess Pre-Tax Contributions as Participant
         after-tax contributions shall not be permitted.

                 4.5.2. The Administration Committee shall determine the amount
         of any excess Pre-Tax Contributions by Highly Compensated Employees
         for a Plan Year by application of the leveling method set forth in
         Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(2) under which the Deferral
         Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee who has the highest such
         percentage for such Plan Year is reduced to the extent required (i) to
         enable the Plan to satisfy the Actual Deferral Percentage test, or
         (ii) to cause such Highly Compensated Employee's Deferral Percentage
         to equal the Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee
         with the next highest Deferral Percentage.  This process shall be
         repeated until the Plan satisfies the Actual Deferral Percentage test.
         For each Highly Compensated Employee, the amount of excess Pre-Tax
         Contributions shall be equal to the total Pre-Tax Contributions (plus
         any amounts treated as Pre-Tax Contributions) made or deemed to be
         made by such Highly Compensated Employee (determined prior to the
         application of the foregoing provisions of this Subsection 4.5.2.)
         minus the amount determined by multiplying the Highly Compensated
         Employee's Deferral Percentage (determined after application of the 
         foregoing provisions of this Subsection 4.5.2.) by his Compensation.


                                       28
<PAGE>   35
                 4.5.3. The determination and correction of excess Pre-Tax
         Contributions of a Highly Compensated Employee whose Deferral
         Percentage is determined under the family aggregation rules in Section
         4.4. shall be accomplished by reducing the Deferral Percentage as
         required under Subsections 4.5.1. and 4.5.2. above and allocating the
         excess Pre-Tax Contributions for the family unit in proportion to the
         Pre-Tax Contributions of each family member that are combined to
         determine the Deferral Percentage.

                 4.5.4. For purposes of satisfying the Average Contribution
         Percentage test, income and loss allocable to a Participant's excess
         Matching Contributions, as determined under 4.5.2. and 4.5.3. above,
         may be determined by any reasonable method, provided the method does
         not violate Code Section 401(a)(4), is used consistently for all
         Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for
         the Plan Year, and is used by the Plan for allocating income and loss
         to Participants' accounts.  If there is a loss allocable to the
         excess, the amount to be forfeited or distributed shall be the excess
         contribution amount adjusted to reflect such loss.

                 4.5.5. To the extent required by regulations under Section
         401(k) or 415 of the Code, any excess Pre-Tax Contributions with
         respect to a Highly Compensated Employee shall be treated as Annual
         Additions under Article 15. for the Plan Year for which the excess
         Pre-Tax Contributions were made, notwithstanding the distribution of
         such excess in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

         4.6. PROVISIONS FOR RETURN OF ANNUAL PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS
OF THE DEFERRAL LIMITATION. In the event Participant's elective deferrals,
within the meaning of Code Section 402(g)(3), for any calendar year exceed the
Deferral Limitation, such excess elective deferrals shall be returned to the
Participant as provided in this Section 4.6.

                 4.6.1. In the event that due to error or otherwise, a
         Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions under this Plan for any calendar
         year exceed the Deferral Limitation for such calendar year (without
         regard to elective deferrals under any other plan), the Administration
         Committee shall notify the Plan of the amount of the excess Pre-Tax
         Contributions, and such excess Pre-Tax Contributions, together with
         income or loss allocable thereto, shall be distributed to the
         Participant on or before the first April 15 following the close of the
         calendar year in which such excess Pre-Tax Contributions were made.


                                       29
<PAGE>   36
                 4.6.2. If in any calendar year, a Participant makes Pre-Tax
         Contributions under this Plan and additional elective deferrals,
         within the meaning of Code Section 402(g)(3), under any other plan
         maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company, and the combined
         total amount of the Participant's elective deferrals under this Plan
         and all such other plans exceed the Deferral Limitation, the Employer
         and each Affiliated Company maintaining a plan under which the
         Participant made any elective deferrals shall notify the affected
         plans, and corrective distributions of the excess elective deferrals,
         and any income or loss allocable thereto, shall be made from one or
         more such plans, to the extent determined by the Employer and each
         Affiliated Company.  All corrective distributions of excess elective
         deferrals shall be made on or before the first April 15 following the
         close of the calendar year in which the excess elective deferrals were
         made.

                 4.6.3. Income or loss on Pre-Tax Contributions in excess of
         the Deferral Limitation shall be calculated in accordance with 4.5.4.,
         except that if the Plan Year is not the calendar year, calculations of
         allocable income and loss shall be made with reference to income and
         loss allocable for the calendar year rather than the Plan Year, and
         based upon the Participant's account balance as of the last day of the
         calendar year.

                 4.6.4. The Administration Committee shall not be liable to any
         Participant (or his Beneficiary, if applicable) for any losses caused
         by misestimating the amount of any Pre-Tax Contributions in excess of
         the limitations of this Article 4. and any income or loss allocable
         to such excess.

                 4.6.5. In accordance with rules and procedures as may be
         established by the Committee, a Participant may submit a claim to the
         Committee in which he certifies in writing the specific amount of his
         Pre-Tax Contributions for the preceding calendar year which, when
         added to amounts deferred for such calendar year under any other plans
         or arrangements described in Section 401(k), 408(k) or 403(b) of the
         Code (other than a plan maintained by the Company or an Affiliated
         Company), will cause the Participant to exceed the Deferral Limitation
         for the calendar year in which the deferral occurred.  To the extent
         the amount specified by the Participant does not exceed the amount of
         the Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions under the Plan for the
         applicable calendar year, the Committee shall treat the amount
         specified by the Participant in his claim as a Pre-Tax Contribution in
         excess of the Deferral Limitation for such calendar year and return
         such excess and any income or loss allocable thereto to the
         Participant, as provided in 4.6.1. above.  In the event that for any
         reason such Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions in excess of the
         Deferral Limitation for any calendar year are not distributed to the
         Participant by the time prescribed in 4.6.1. above, such excess shall


                                       30
<PAGE>   37
         be held in the Participant's Pre-Tax Contribution Account until 
         distribution can be made in accordance with the provisions of this 
         Plan.

                 4.6.6.   To the extent required by regulations under Section
         402(g) or 415 of the Code, Pre-Tax Contributions with respect to a
         Participant in excess of the Deferral Limitation shall be treated as
         Annual Additions under Article 15. for the Plan Year for which the
         excess Pre-Tax Contributions were made, unless such excess is
         distributed to the Participant in accordance with the provisions of
         this Section.

         4.7. CHARACTER OF AMOUNTS CONTRIBUTED AS PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS. Unless
otherwise specifically provided to the contrary elsewhere in this Plan, Pre-Tax
Contributions pursuant to a Participant's contribution election described above
in Section 4.1. (and which qualify for treatment under Code Section 401(k) and
are contributed to the Trust Fund pursuant to Article 6.) shall be treated, for
federal and state income tax purposes, as Employer contributions.

         4.8. PARTICIPANT ROLLOVER CONTRIBUTIONS. To the extent permissible
under Code Section 402(c), all or part of a distribution from a plan that
satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a), or from an individual
retirement account which is attributable solely to a rollover contribution
within the meaning of Code Section 408(d)(3), may be rolled over into this Plan
by any Active Participant and credited to a Rollover Account established for
such Active Participant in accordance with rules which the Administration
Committee shall prescribe from time to time.  Any rollover contributions in
accordance with this Section shall not be subject to distribution except as
expressly provided under the terms of this Plan.  No rollover shall be accepted
which is not in cash, except that in the case of an amount consisting in whole
or in part of Stock distributable from the from the Western Digital Corporation
Employee Stock Ownership Plan following and on account of the termination of
such Plan, such requirement that a rollover be in cash shall not preclude the
acceptance of such rollover amount.  Any shares of Stock rolled into this Plan
pursuant to this Section 4.8. shall be subject to rules set forth in this Plan
regarding Stock, and the Administration Committee may establish such accounts
or subaccounts as it deems appropriate to reflect such shares of Stock.

         4.9. PLAN-TO-PLAN TRANSFERS. No amounts held under another plan that
is qualified under Code Section 401(a) may be transferred directly from the
trustee of that plan to the Trustee of this plan, except in the case of a
merger of this plan with another plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) in
accordance with Code Sections 401(k), 411(d)(6) and 414(l).

                             EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         5.1. DETERMINATION OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. Subject to the
requirements and restrictions of this Article 5. and Articles 4. and 15., and
subject also to the amendment or termination of the Plan or the suspension or
discontinuance of contributions as provided herein, Employer contributions to
the Plan shall be determined in accordance with this Article 5.

         5.2. PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS. The Employer shall make a Pre-Tax
Contribution on behalf of each Active Participant who is an Eligible Employee
of such Employer in an amount equal to the amount of the Pre-Tax Contribution
elected by the Active Participant in accordance with Article 4., provided such
Pre-Tax Contribution qualifies for tax treatment under Code Section 401(k).  A
Pre-Tax Contribution on behalf of an Active Participant for a payroll period
shall be paid to the Trustee and allocated to the Active Participant's Pre-Tax
Contribution Account as soon as administratively practicable following the last
day of such payroll period, but in no event later than ninety (90) days
following the last day of the payroll period.

         5.3. BASIC MATCHING CONTRIBUTION.

                 5.3.1. As of the last day of a contribution cycle (as such
         term is defined in 5.3.4. below), the Employer shall make a Basic
         Matching Contribution on behalf of each "Eligible Participant," as
         defined in Subsection 5.3.3. below, who is an Eligible Employee of
         such Employer.  A Basic Matching Contribution on behalf of an Eligible
         Participant under this Section 5.3. shall be in an amount equal to
         fifty percent (50%) of the Eligible Participant's Pre-Tax
         Contributions for the contribution cycle which do not exceed five
         percent (5%) of the Eligible Participant's Compensation for the
         contribution cycle.

                 5.3.2. Any Basic Matching Contributions for a contribution
         cycle shall be paid to the Trustee and allocated to the Eligible
         Participant's Matching Contributions Account as soon as practicable
         following the last day of such contribution cycle.

                 5.3.3. For purposes of this Section 5.3., "Eligible
         Participant" means for any contribution cycle, each Eligible Employee
         of the Employer who is an Active Participant throughout and on the
         last day of such contribution cycle.

                 5.3.4. For purposes of this Section 5.3., the term
         "contribution cycle" shall mean each calendar month, or, to the extent
         determined by the Administration Committee, a shorter period of time,
         including, but not limited to, a payroll period.

                 5.3.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors,
         in its sole discretion, may suspend Basic Matching Contributions on a
         prospective basis only, provided prior written notice is given to all
         affected Participants.

         5.4. SUPPLEMENTAL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AND QUALIFIED NONELECTIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS.

                 5.4.1. As of the last day of a Plan Year, the Board of
         Directors may determine, in its sole discretion, that each Employer
         shall make a Supplemental Matching Contribution on behalf of each
         "Eligible Participant," as defined in this Subsection 5.4.1., who is
         an Eligible Employee of such Employer.  Any Supplemental Matching
         Contribution under this Subsection 5.4.1. shall be allocated among the
         Matching Contribution Accounts of Eligible Participants in the same
         proportion that each Eligible Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions for
         the Plan Year bears to the Pre-Tax Contributions of all such Eligible
         Participants for the Plan Year which do not exceed five percent (5%)
         of each Eligible Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year.  For
         purposes of this Subsection 5.4.1., "Eligible Participant" means for a
         Plan Year, each Eligible Employee of the Employer who is an Active
         Participant as of the last day of such Plan Year and is credited with
         a Year of Vesting Service during such Plan Year.  Any Supplemental
         Matching Contributions for a Plan Year under this Subsection 5.4.1.
         shall be paid to the Trustee and allocated to the Eligible
         Participant's Matching Contributions Account as soon as practicable
         following the last day of such Plan Year.  Unless the Company
         determines that Supplemental Matching Contributions shall be made for
         a Plan Year in accordance with this Subsection 5.4.1., no such
         Supplemental Matching Contributions shall be made for such Plan Year.

                 5.4.2. As of the last day of a Plan Year, the Board of
         Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that each Employer
         shall make a Qualified Matching Contribution on behalf of "Eligible
         Participants," as defined in this Subsection 5.4.2., which
         contribution shall be a "qualified matching contribution," within the
         meaning of regulations under Section 401(k) of the Code.  Any such
         "qualified matching contribution" shall be allocated among the
         Matching Contribution Accounts of Eligible Participants in the same
         proportion that each Eligible Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions for
         the Plan Year bears to the Pre-Tax Contributions of all such Eligible
         Participants for the Plan Year.  For purposes of Subsection 5.4.2.,
         "Eligible Participant" means for a Plan Year, an Eligible Employee of
         an Employer who is an Active Participant and has been designated by
         the Board of Directors as an Eligible Participant for such Plan Year
         with respect to a "qualified matching contribution."  Any such
         designation in accordance with this Subsection 5.4.2. shall satisfy
         the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 401(a)(4) of the Code.
         Any Qualified Matching Contributions for a Plan Year under


                                       33
<PAGE>   40
         this Subsection 5.4.2. shall be paid to the Trustee and allocated to
         the Eligible Participant's Matching Contributions Account as soon as
         practicable following the last day of such Plan Year.  Unless the
         Company determines that Qualified Matching Contributions shall be made
         for a Plan Year in accordance with this Subsection 5.4.2., no such
         Qualified Matching Contributions shall be made for such Plan.

                 5.4.3. As of the last day of a Plan Year, the Company in its
         sole discretion may determine that each Employer shall make an
         additional Employer contribution for such Plan Year in an amount to be
         determined by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this
         Subsection 5.4.3.

                          5.4.3.1. Any Employer contributions under this
                 Subsection 5.4.3. shall be designated as "qualified
                 nonelective contributions," within the meaning of regulations
                 under Section 401(k) of the Code.  Unless the Company
                 determines that Employer contributions shall be made for a
                 Plan Year in accordance with this Subsection 5.4.3., no
                 Employer contributions shall be made for such Plan Year under
                 this Subsection 5.4.3.

                          5.4.3.2. Any Employer contributions for a Plan Year
                 in accordance with this Subsection 5.4.3. shall be allocated
                 as of the last day of such Plan Year to the Pre-Tax
                 Contributions Accounts of Eligible Participants, in accordance
                 with the following rules:

                                  5.4.3.2.1. Such contributions shall first be
                          allocated to the Pre-Tax Contributions Account of the
                          Eligible Participant with the lowest Compensation for
                          the Plan Year in an amount sufficient to cause the
                          Deferral Percentage (as defined in Paragraph
                          4.4.2.2.) of the Participant to equal the maximum
                          percentage of Compensation an Active Participant is
                          permitted to contribute to the Plan for the Plan Year
                          as a Pre-Tax Contribution in accordance with
                          Subsection 4.2.1.

                                  5.4.3.2.2. Such contributions shall then be
                          allocated in the amount described above to the
                          Eligible Participant with the next lowest
                          Compensation, and such allocations shall continue in
                          the same manner until a sufficient amount has been
                          allocated to the Pre-Tax Contributions Accounts of
                          Eligible Participants to satisfy the Actual Deferral
                          Percentage test with the smallest aggregate Employer
                          contribution.

                          5.4.3.3. If, by the deadline for making "qualified
                 nonelective contributions" to the Plan under Treasury
                 Regulations 1.401(k)-1(b)(4)(i)(A)(2), the Company does not
                 have sufficient data or is unable to determine exactly the
                 


                                       34
<PAGE>   41
                 smallest amount of qualified nonelective contributions
                 necessary to satisfy the Actual Deferral Percentage test in
                 accordance with the provisions of Subparagraph 5.4.3.2.2.,
                 the Company may estimate such amount and add a cushion
                 sufficient to ensure that the test will be met.  Under these
                 circumstances, qualified nonelective contributions shall be
                 allocated as provided in Subparagraphs 5.4.3.2.1. and
                 5.4.3.2.2., except that allocations under Subparagraph
                 5.4.3.2.2. shall continue until the aggregate estimated
                 amount of such contributions is completely allocated.

                          5.4.3.4. For purposes of this Subsection 5.4.3.,
                 "Eligible Participant" means any Participant who has
                 Compensation for the Plan Year, who is not a Highly
                 Compensated Employee, and who is eligible to receive an
                 allocation of the Employer contribution pursuant to the
                 provisions of Paragraph 5.4.3.2.

         5.5. PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS.

                 5.5.1. As of the last day of any Plan Year commencing on or
         after July 1, 1994, the Board of Directors may, in its sole
         discretion, determine that each Employer shall make a Profit Sharing
         Contribution for such Plan Year on behalf of "Eligible Participants,"
         as defined in this Subsection 5.5.1., in an amount to be determined by
         the Board.  Any Profit Sharing Contribution made in accordance with
         this Subsection 5.5.1. shall be allocated as of the last day of a Plan
         Year to the Profit Sharing Contributions Account of each Eligible
         Participant in the same proportion that the Eligible Participant's
         Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the Compensation of all
         Eligible Participants for the Plan Year, up to four percent (4%) of
         each Eligible Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year.  For
         purposes of this Subsection 5.5.1., "Eligible Participant" means for a
         Plan Year, each individual who is an Eligible Employee of the Employer
         as of the last day of the Plan Year.  Unless the Company determines
         that Profit Sharing Contributions shall be made for a Plan Year in
         accordance with this Subsection 5.5.1., no Profit Sharing
         Contributions shall be made for such Plan Year under this Subsection
         5.5.1.  With respect to periods prior to the Plan Year beginning July
         1, 1994, contributions by the Employer shall be governed by provisions
         of this Plan as in effect with respect to such periods.

                 5.5.2. "Compensation" for purposes of the allocation of a
         Profit Sharing Contribution in accordance with this Section 5.5. shall
         mean "Compensation" as defined in Subsection 2.9.2.

         5.6. TIMING OF EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. In no event shall any Employer
contributions under this Article 5. for any Plan Year be made later than the



                                       35
<PAGE>   42
time prescribed by law for the deduction of such contributions for purposes of
the Employer's Federal income tax, as determined by the applicable provisions of
the Code.

         5.7. APPLICATION OF FORFEITURES. Any non-vested portion of a
Participant's Matching Contributions Account or Profit Sharing Contributions
Account that is forfeited as provided in Subsection 9.4.1. shall be credited to
a Forfeiture Account and applied as provided in 5.7.1. and 5.7.2. below.  Any
Matching Contributions forfeited in accordance with Section 5.10. or 5.11.
shall be applied as provided in 5.7.3. below.

                 5.7.1. Any non-vested Matching Contributions credited to a
         Forfeiture Account during a Plan Year shall be applied first to
         restore Matching Contribution amounts previous forfeited, as provided
         in Subsection 9.4.2., and then shall be allocated as of the last day
         of such Plan Year among Matching Contribution Accounts of Participants

                          5.7.1.1. who are actively employed as Eligible
                 Employees on the last day of the Plan Year,

                          5.7.1.2. who have completed one thousand (1,000)
                 Hours of Service in such Plan Year, and

                          5.7.1.3. who have Pre-Tax Contribution Accounts as of
                 the last day of such Plan Year,

         in proportion to each Participant's Compensation for such Plan Year.

                 5.7.2. Any non-vested Profit Sharing Contribution amounts
         credited to a Forfeiture Account during a Plan Year shall first be
         applied to restore any Profit Sharing Contributions amounts previously
         forfeited, as provided in Subsection 9.4.2. and then shall be
         allocated as of the last day of such Plan Year among Profit Sharing
         Contribution Accounts of Participants who are eligible to share in an
         allocation of any Profit Sharing Contribution as of the last day of
         such Plan Year in proportion to each Participant's Compensation for
         the Plan Year.  "Compensation" for purposes of the allocation of
         forfeitures of Profit Sharing Contributions shall mean "Compensation"
         as defined in Subsection 2.9.2.

                 5.7.3. Any Matching Contributions forfeited by a Participant
         in accordance with Section 5.10. or 5.11. shall be applied to reduce
         future Matching Contributions by such Participant's Employer.

         5.8. REQUIREMENT FOR PROFITS.

                 5.8.1. Any contributions by an Employer under this Plan (other
         than Pre-Tax Contributions), shall be made only from current or
         accumulated net profits.

                 5.8.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Employer does not
         have sufficient current or accumulated net profits in any period to
         make the applicable contribution, then the Board of Directors, in its
         sole discretion, may determine that the Employer will make the
         contribution notwithstanding the lack of current or accumulated net
         profits, provided, however, the Plan is designed to qualify as a
         profit sharing plan for purposes of Section 401(a), et seq. of the
         Code.

                 5.8.3. The term current or accumulated net profits means the
         net income of the Employer determined in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting principles and methods consistently applied.

         5.9. SPECIAL LIMITATIONS ON 401(m) CONTRIBUTIONS. With respect to each
Plan Year, any employer matching contributions, as defined in Section 401(m) of
the Code, or employee After-Tax Contributions, as defined in regulations under
Section 401(m) of the Code, under the Plan for the Plan Year (hereafter
referred to collectively as "401(m) Contributions") shall not exceed the
limitations on such contributions by or on behalf of Highly Compensated
Employees under Section 401(m) of the Code, as provided in this Section. In the
event that 401(m) Contributions under this Plan by or on behalf of Highly
Compensated Employees for any Plan Year exceed the limitations of this Section
for any reason, such excess 401(m) Contributions and any income or loss
allocable thereto shall be disposed of in accordance with Section 5.10.

                 5.9.1. 401(m) Contributions by and on behalf of Participants
         for a Plan Year shall satisfy the Average Contribution Percentage test
         set forth in 5.9.1.1.1. below or the alternative Average Contribution
         Percentage test set forth in 5.9.1.1.2. below, and to the extent
         required by regulations under Code Section 401(m), shall satisfy the
         test identified in 5.9.1.2. below.

                          5.9.1.1. BASIC TEST.

                                  5.9.1.1.1. The Average Contribution
                          Percentage for Eligible Employees who are Highly
                          Compensated Employees shall not be more than the
                          Average Contribution Percentage of all other Eligible
                          Employees multiplied by 1.25, or

                                  5.9.1.1.2. The excess of the Average
                          Contribution Percentage for Eligible Employees who
                          are Highly Compensated Employees over the Average
                          Contribution Percentage for all other Eligible
                          Employees shall not be more than two (2) percentage
                          points, and the Average Contribution Percentage for


                                       37
<PAGE>   44
                          the Highly Compensated Employees shall not be more
                          than the Average Contribution Percentage of all other
                          Eligible Employees multiplied by 2.00.

                          5.9.1.2. MULTIPLE USE TEST. The Average Contribution
                 Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees eligible to
                 participate in this Plan and a plan of the Employer or an
                 Affiliated Company that satisfies the requirements of Section
                 401(k) of the Code, including, if applicable, this Plan, shall
                 be reduced to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements
                 of Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(m)-2 or similar such
                 rule relating to the multiple use of the alternative test
                 described in 5.9.1.1.2. above.

                 5.9.2. For purposes of this Article 5., the following
         definitions shall apply:

                          5.9.2.1. "Average Contribution Percentage" means,
                 with respect to a group of Eligible Employees for a Plan Year,
                 the average of the Contribution Percentage, calculated
                 separately for each Eligible Employee in such group.

                          5.9.2.2. The "Contribution Percentage" means for any
                 Eligible Employee the percentage determined by dividing the
                 sum of 401(m) Contributions under the Plan on behalf of each
                 Eligible Employee for such Plan Year, by such Eligible
                 Employee's Compensation for such Plan Year in accordance with
                 regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under
                 Code Section 401(m).  An after-tax contribution shall be taken
                 into account for a Plan Year if it is paid to the Trust during
                 the Plan Year or paid to an agent of the Plan and transmitted
                 to the Trust within a reasonable period after the end of the
                 Plan Year. A matching contribution shall be taken into account
                 for a Plan Year only if it is (A) made on account of a
                 Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions or after-tax contributions
                 for the Plan Year; (B) allocated to the Participant's matching
                 contributions account during that Plan Year; and (C) actually
                 paid to the Trust no later than the end of the twelve month
                 period immediately following the Plan Year to which the
                 contribution relates.  To the extent determined by the
                 Administration Committee and in accordance with regulations
                 issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code Section
                 401(m)(3), Pre-Tax Contributions on behalf of an Eligible
                 Employee and any qualified nonelective contributions, within
                 the meaning of Code Section 401(m)(4)(C), on behalf of an
                 Eligible Employee may also be taken into account for purposes
                 of calculating the Contribution Percentage of such Eligible
                 Employee, but shall not otherwise be taken into account.
                 However, if matching contributions are taken into account





                                       38
<PAGE>   45
                 for purposes of determining the Actual Deferral Percentage of
                 an Eligible Employee for a Plan Year under Section 4.4. then
                 such matching contributions shall not be taken into account
                 under this Section.

                          5.9.2.3. "Eligible Employee" means any Eligible
                 Employee directly or indirectly eligible to contribute to the
                 Plan, including any otherwise Eligible Employee during a
                 period of suspension due to a Hardship withdrawal, in
                 accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
                 Treasury under Code Section 401(k).

                          5.9.2.4. "Compensation" means Compensation determined
                 by the Administration Committee in accordance with Section
                 414(s) of the Code, including to the extent determined by the
                 Administration Committee, amounts deducted from an Employee's
                 wages or salary that are not currently includable in the
                 Employee's gross income by reason of the application of Code
                 Section 402(a)(8) or 125.

                 5.9.3. In the event that as of the last day of a Plan Year
         this Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 410(b) of the Code
         only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more
         other plans satisfy the requirements of Section 410(b) of the Code
         only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Section shall be applied
         by determining the Contribution Percentages of Eligible Employees as
         if all such plans were a single plan, in accordance with regulations
         prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 401(m) of
         the Code.

                 5.9.4. For the purposes of this Section, the Contribution
         Percentage for any Eligible Employee who is a Highly Compensated
         Employee under two or more Code Section 401(a) plans of an Employer or
         an Affiliated Company to the extent required by Code Section 401(m),
         shall be determined in a manner taking into account the participant
         contributions and matching contributions for such Eligible Employee
         under each of such plans.

                 5.9.5. If an Eligible Employee (who is also a Highly
         Compensated Employee) is subject to the family aggregation rules in
         Section 2.22., the combined Average Contribution Percentage for the
         family group (which is treated as one Highly Compensated Employee)
         shall be the Average Contribution Percentage determined by combining
         the 401(m) Contributions, amounts treated as matching contributions
         under Code Section 401(m)(3), and Compensation of all the eligible
         family members.

                 5.9.6. The determination of the Contribution Percentage of any
         Participant shall be made after first applying the provisions of
         Section 15.5. relating to certain limits on Annual Additions under
         Section 415 of the Code, then applying the provisions of Section 4.6.
         relating to the return of Pre-Tax Contributions in excess of the     



                                       39
<PAGE>   46
         Deferral Limitation, then applying the provisions of Section 4.5.
         relating to certain limits under Section 401(k) of the Code imposed on
         Pre-Tax Contributions of Highly Compensated Employees and last,
         applying the provisions of Section 5.11. relating to the forfeiture of
         matching contributions attributable to excess deferrals or
         contributions.

                 5.9.7. The determination and treatment of the Contribution
         Percentage of any Participant shall satisfy such other requirements as
         may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

                 5.9.8. The Administration Committee shall keep or cause to
         have kept such records as are necessary to demonstrate that the Plan
         satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(m) and the regulations
         thereunder, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
         of the Treasury.

         5.10. PROVISIONS FOR REDUCTION OF EXCESS 401(m) CONTRIBUTIONS BY OR ON
BEHALF OF HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

                 5.10.1. The Administration Committee shall determine, as soon
         as is reasonably possible following the close of the Plan Year, if
         401(m) Contributions by or on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees
         satisfy the Average Contribution Percentage test for such Plan Year.
         If, pursuant to the determination by the Administration Committee,
         401(m) Contributions by or on behalf of a Highly Compensated Employee
         must be reduced to enable the Plan to satisfy the Average Contribution
         Percentage test, then the Administration Committee shall take the
         following steps:

                          5.10.1.1. First, any excess After-Tax Contributions
                 that were not matched by matching contributions, and any
                 income or loss allocable thereto, shall be distributed to the
                 Highly Compensated Employee.

                          5.10.1.2. Second, if any excess remains after the
                 provisions of 5.10.1.1. above are applied, to the extent
                 necessary to eliminate the excess, any matching contributions
                 on behalf of the Highly Compensated Employee, any
                 corresponding After-Tax Contributions, and any income or loss
                 allocable thereto, shall be forfeited, to the extent
                 forfeitable under the Plan, or distributed to the Highly
                 Compensated Employee, to the extent non-forfeitable under the
                 Plan (after withholding any applicable income taxes on such
                 amounts).

                          5.10.1.3. If administratively feasible, excess 401(m)
                 Contributions including any income or loss allocable thereto,
                 which are distributable under this Section 5.10., shall be
                 distributed to Highly Compensated Employees within two and
                 one-half (2-1/2) months following the close of the Plan Year 
    


                                       40
<PAGE>   47
                 for which the excess Contributions were made, but in any event
                 no later than the end of the first Plan Year following the Plan
                 Year for which the excess Contributions were made,
                 notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan.

                          5.10.1.4. Any amounts of excess matching
                 contributions forfeited by Highly Compensated Employees under
                 this Section, including any income or loss allocable thereto,
                 shall be applied in accordance with Section 5.7.

                 5.10.2. The Administration Committee shall determine the
         amount of any excess 401(m) Contributions made by or on behalf of
         Highly Compensated Employees for a Plan Year by application of the
         leveling method set forth in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
         1.401(m)-1(e)(2) under which the Contribution Percentage of the Highly
         Compensated Employee who has the highest such percentage for such Plan
         Year is reduced, to the extent required (i) to enable the Plan to
         satisfy the Average Contribution Percentage test, or (ii) to cause
         such Highly Compensated Employee's Contribution Percentage to equal
         the Contribution Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee with
         the next highest Contribution Percentage.  This process shall be
         repeated until the Plan satisfies the Average Contribution Percentage
         test.  For each Highly Compensated Employee, the amount of excess
         401(m) Contributions shall be equal to the total 401(m) Contributions
         (plus any amounts treated as matching contributions) made on behalf of
         such Highly Compensated Employee (determined prior to the application
         of the foregoing provisions of this Subsection 5.10.2.) minus the
         amount determined by multiplying the Highly Compensated Employee's
         Contribution Percentage (determined after the application of the
         foregoing provisions of this Subsection 5.10.2.) by his Compensation.

                 5.10.3. The determination and correction of excess 401(m)
         Contributions made by and on behalf of a Highly Compensated Employee
         whose Average Contribution Percentage is determined under the family
         aggregation rules in Section 5.9. shall be accomplished by reducing
         the Average Contribution Percentage as required under Subsections
         5.10.1. and 5.10.2. above and allocating the excess 401(m)
         Contributions for the family unit in proportion to the 401(m)
         Contributions of each family member that are combined to determine the
         Average Contribution Percentage.

                 5.10.4. For purposes of satisfying the Average Contribution
         Percentage test, income or loss allocable to a Participant's excess
         401(m) Contributions, as determined under 5.10.2. above, shall be
         determined in accordance with any reasonable method used by the Plan
         for allocating income or loss to Participant Accounts, provided such
         


                                       41
<PAGE>   48
         method does not discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Employees
         and is consistently applied to all Participants for all corrective
         distributions under the Plan for a Plan Year.  The Administration
         Committee shall not be liable to any Highly Compensated Employee (or
         his Beneficiary, if applicable) for any losses caused by misestimating
         the amount of any excess 401(m) Contributions on behalf of a Highly
         Compensated Employee and the income or loss attributable to such
         excess.

                 5.10.5. To the extent required by regulations under Section
         401(m) or 415 of the Code, any 401(m) Contributions in excess of the
         limitations of Section 5.9. forfeited by or distributed to a Highly
         Compensated Employee in accordance with this Section shall be treated
         as an Annual Addition under Article 15. for the Plan Year for which
         the excess contribution was made, notwithstanding such forfeiture or
         distribution.

         5.11. FORFEITURE OF MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXCESS
DEFERRALS OR CONTRIBUTIONS. To the extent any Matching Contributions allocated
to a Participant's Matching Contributions Account are attributable to excess
Pre-Tax Contributions required to be distributed to the Participant in
accordance with Section 4.5. or 4.6., such Matching Contributions, including
any income or loss allocable thereto, shall be forfeited, notwithstanding that
such Matching Contributions may otherwise be non-forfeitable under the terms of
the Plan.  Any Matching Contributions forfeited by a Participant in accordance
with this Section 5.11. shall be applied to reduce future Matching
Contributions by such Participant's Employer.

         5.12. IRREVOCABILITY. An Employer shall have no right or title to, nor
interest in, the contributions made to the Trust Fund, and no part of the Trust
Fund shall revert to an Employer except that on and after the Effective Date
funds may be returned to the Employer as follows:

                 5.12.1. In the case of an Employer contribution which is made
         by a mistake of fact, that contribution (and any income or loss
         allocable to such contribution) may be returned to the Employer within
         one (1) year after it is made.

                 5.12.2. All Employer contributions are hereby conditioned upon
         the Plan initially satisfying all of the requirements of Code Section
         401(a) and Section 401(k).  If the Plan does not initially qualify, at
         the Company's written election the Plan or any portion thereof may be
         revoked and any or all such contributions with respect to the portion
         revoked may be returned to the Employer within one year after the date
         of IRS denial of the initial qualification of the Plan.  Upon such a
         revocation the affairs of the Plan and Trust shall be terminated and
         wound up as the Company shall direct.


                                       42
<PAGE>   49
                 5.12.3. All contributions to the Trust Fund are conditioned on
         deductibility under Code Section 404. In the event a deduction is
         disallowed for any such contribution such contribution shall be
         returned to the Employer.

         5.13. MAKE-UP CONTRIBUTIONS. In addition to other Employer
contributions described in this Article 5., the Employer may make special
make-up contributions to the Plan, if necessary.  A make-up contribution will
be necessary if there are insufficient forfeitures under the Plan to restore a
Participant's Matching Contribution Account or Profit Sharing Account as
provided in Section 9.5., if a Participant or Beneficiary's Accounts must be
reinstated according to Section 18.2., or if a mistake or omission in the
allocation of contributions is discovered and cannot be corrected by revising
prior allocations.

                                     FUNDING

        6.1. IN GENERAL. The Company has entered into a Trust Agreement with a
Trustee creating the Trust Fund. Such Trust Agreement provides for the
administration of the Trust Fund by the Trustee. The Trust Fund shall be
invested in accordance with provisions of Article 7. and the Trust Agreement and
shall be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of Participants or their
Beneficiaries. The Company by action of the Board of Directors shall select such
Trustee and may, without further reference to or action by any Participant, from
time to time

                  6.1.1. enter into such further agreements with the Trustee or
        other parties and make such amendments to the Trust Agreement or said
        further agreements as it may deem necessary or desirable to carry out
        the Plan,

                  6.1.2. designate a successor Trustee or successor Trustees,
        and

                  6.1.3. take such other steps and execute such other
        instruments as it may deem necessary or desirable to put the Plan into
        effect or to carry out the provisions thereof.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

                                   INVESTMENTS

        7.1. INVESTMENTS OF CONTRIBUTIONS. Contributions by and on behalf of a
Participant shall be invested in accordance with the Participant's investment
designations in one or more Investment Funds established by the Administration
Committee for this purpose. The Administration Committee in its discretion,
shall from time to time determine the Investment Funds that shall be available
to Participants, which funds shall include a fund invested in Stock, and may
include one or more mutual funds or similar pooled investments.

        7.2.  INVESTMENT IN EMPLOYER SECURITIES.

                  7.2.1. Notwithstanding the establishment of separate
        Investment Funds, up to one hundred percent (100%) of the assets of the
        Plan may be invested in Stock, and up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
        the assets of the Plan may be invested in Company Debentures; provided,
        however, immediately following any acquisition of Company Debentures,
        not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the Plan shall
        be invested in "marketable obligations" (as such term is defined in
        Section 407(e) of ERISA) of the Company or an Affiliated Company.

                  7.2.2. The term "Company Debentures" shall mean any debenture
        of the Company which constitutes "qualifying employer securities," as
        defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA.

                  7.2.3. To the extent all or a portion of a Participant's
        Accounts are invested in Stock, such Accounts shall reflect the number
        of whole and fractional shares of Stock.

        7.3. PARTICIPANT INVESTMENT DESIGNATIONS. In accordance with rules of
uniform application which the Administration Committee may from time to time
adopt and subject to any limitations set forth below in this Article 7., each
Participant shall have the right to designate one or more of the Investment
Funds for the investment of his Accounts under the Plan, in accordance with the
following rules:

                  7.3.1. Investment of contributions by and on behalf of a
        Participant in any Investment Fund and transfer of a Participant's
        Account balances between Investment Funds shall be in such whole
        percentage increments as the Administration Committee may determine from
        time to time.

                  7.3.2. A Participant may make a new investment designation
        which shall apply to (i) the amount standing to his credit in his
        Accounts, effective as of any Valuation Date; and (ii) future
        contributions to his Accounts, effective as of any Valuation Date by  
        


                                       45

<PAGE>   52

        giving written notice to the Administration Committee to the extent
        required by the Administration Committee prior to the effective date of
        the change.

                  7.3.3. Investment Funds may, from time to time, hold cash or
        cash equivalent investments (including interests in any fund maintained
        by the Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement) resulting from
        investment transactions relating to the property of said Fund; provided,
        however, that neither the Administration Committee, the Company, the
        Employer, the Trustee or any other person shall have any duty or
        responsibility to cause such Funds to be held in cash or cash equivalent
        investments for investment purposes. In the case of any Investment Fund
        under the management and control of an Investment Manager appointed by
        the Administration Committee in accordance with Section 11.3., neither
        the Administration Committee, the Company, the Employer, the Trustee,
        nor any other person shall have any responsibility or liability for
        investment decisions made by such Investment Manager.

                  7.3.4. In the event a Participant fails to make an investment
        designation in accordance with this Article 7., contributions by and on
        behalf of the Participant shall be invested in a fixed interest fund.

        7.4. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS. The Trustee may acquire Stock in the open
market or from the Company or any other person, including a party in interest.
No commission will be paid in connection with the Trustee's acquisition of Stock
from a party in interest. Neither the Company, nor the Committee, nor any
Trustee have any responsibility or duty to time any transaction involving Stock
in order to anticipate market conditions or changes in Stock value. Neither the
Company, nor the Committee nor any Trustee have any responsibility or duty to
sell Stock held in the Trust Fund in order to maximize return or minimize loss.

        7.5. RIGHTS, WARRANTS, OR OPTIONS. Subject to the provisions applicable
to voting rights in Section 7.6., and unless otherwise directed by the
Committee, stock rights (including warrants and options) issued with respect to
Stock will be exercised by the Trustee on behalf of Participants to the extent
that cash is available. Unless otherwise directed by the Committee, rights which
cannot be exercised because of the lack of cash will be sold and the proceeds
will be invested in Stock.

        7.6. VOTING OF STOCK. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to
the contrary, the Trustee shall not vote Stock held in the Trust on any matter
presented for a vote by the stockholders of the Company except in accordance
with timely directions received by the Trustee either from the Committee or from
Participants, depending on who has the right to direct the voting of such stock
as provided in the following provisions of this Section 7.6.


                                       46
<PAGE>   53

                  7.6.1. All stock held in the Trust Fund shall be voted by the
        Trustee as the Committee directs in its absolute discretion, except as
        provided in this Subsection 7.6.1.

                           7.6.1.1. If the Company has a registration-type class
                  of securities (as defined in Section 409(e)(4) of the Code),
                  then with respect to all corporate matters, (i) each
                  Participant shall be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the
                  voting of all Stock allocated and credited to his Accounts and
                  (ii) each Participant who is an Eligible Employee shall be
                  entitled to direct the Trustee as to the voting of a portion
                  of all Stock not allocated to the Accounts of Participants,
                  with such portion equal to the total number of shares of such
                  unallocated Stock multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
                  which is the number of shares of Stock allocated to the
                  Accounts of such Participant and the denominator of which is
                  the total number of shares of Stock allocated to the Accounts
                  of all Participants.

                           7.6.1.2. If the Company does not have a
                  registration-type class of securities (as defined in Section
                  409(e)(4) of the Code), then only with respect to such matters
                  as the approval or disapproval of any corporate merger
                  consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification,
                  liquidation, dissolution, sale of substantially all assets of
                  trade or business, or such similar transactions as may be
                  prescribed in Treasury Regulations, (i) each Participant shall
                  be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the voting of all
                  Stock allocated and credited to his Accounts and (ii) each
                  Participant who is an Eligible Employee shall be entitled to
                  direct the Trustee as to the voting of a portion of all Stock
                  not allocated to the Accounts of Participants, with such
                  portion determined in the same manner as under Paragraph
                  7.6.1.1. above.

                  7.6.2. All Participants entitled to direct such voting shall
        be notified by the Company, pursuant to its normal communications with
        shareholders, of each occasion for the exercise of such voting rights
        within a reasonable time before such rights are to be exercised. Such
        notification shall include all information distributed to shareholders
        either by the Company or any other party regarding the exercise of such
        rights. To the extent that a Participant shall fail to direct the
        Trustee as to the exercise of voting rights arising under any Stock
        credited to his Accounts, such Stock shall not be voted. The Trustee
        shall maintain confidentiality with respect to the voting directions of
        all Participants.

                  7.6.3. Each Participant shall be a named fiduciary (as that
        term is defined in ERISA Section 402(a)(2)) with respect to Stock for
        which he has the right to direct the voting under the Plan but solely
        


                                       47

        for the purpose of exercising voting rights pursuant to this Section
        7.6. or certain Offers pursuant to Section 7.11.

                  7.6.4. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction shall
        issue an opinion or order to the Plan, the Company or the Trustee, which
        shall, in the opinion of counsel to the Company or the Trustee,
        invalidate under ERISA, in all circumstances or in any particular
        circumstances, any provision or provisions of this Section regarding the
        manner in which Stock held in the Trust shall be voted or cause any such
        provision or provisions to conflict with ERISA, then, upon notice
        thereof to the Company or the Trustee, as the case may be, such invalid
        or conflicting provisions of this Section shall be given no further
        force or effect. In such circumstances the Trustee nevertheless shall
        not vote Stock held in the Trust unless required under such order or
        opinion but shall follow instructions received from Participants, to the
        extent such instructions have not been invalidated. To the extent
        required to exercise any residual fiduciary responsibility with respect
        to voting, the Trustee shall take into account in exercising its
        fiduciary judgment, unless it is clearly imprudent to do so, directions
        timely received from Participants, as such directions are most
        indicative of what is in the best interests of Participants. Further,
        the Trustee, in addition to taking into consideration any relevant
        financial factors bearing on any such decision, shall take into
        consideration any relevant nonfinancial factors, including, but not
        limited to, the continuing job security of Participants as employees of
        the Company or any of its subsidiaries, conditions of employment,
        employment opportunities and other similar matters, and the prospect of
        the Participants and prospective Participants for future benefits under
        the Plan.

        7.7. VALUATION OF STOCK. When it is necessary to value Stock held by the
Plan, the value will be the current fair market value of the Stock, determined
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

        If the Stock is publicly traded, its fair market value will be based on
the most recent closing price in public trading, as determined by the Trustee.

        If the Stock cannot be valued on the basis of its closing price in
recent public trading, its fair market value will be determined by the Company
in good faith based on all relevant factors for determining the fair market
value of securities. Relevant factors include an independent appraisal by a
person who customarily makes such appraisals, if an appraisal of the fair market
value of the Stock as of the relevant date was obtained.

        In the case of a transaction between the Plan and an Employer or
another party in interest, the fair market value of the Stock must be determined
as of the date of the transaction rather than as of some other Valuation Date


                                       48

<PAGE>   55

occurring before or after the transaction. In other cases, the fair market
value of the Stock will be determined as of the most recent Valuation Date.

        7.8. ALLOCATION OF STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SPLITS. Stock received by the
Trust as a result of a Stock split or Stock dividend on Stock held in
Participants' Pretax Deferral Accounts, Matching Contribution Accounts, and
Rollover Accounts will be allocated as of the Valuation Date coincident with or
following the date of such split or dividend, to each Participant who has such
an Account. The amount allocated will bear substantially the same proportion to
the total number of shares received as the number of shares in the Participant's
Pretax Deferral Account, Matching Contribution Account and/or Rollover Account
bears to the total number of shares allocated to such Accounts of all
Participants immediately before the allocation. The shares will be allocated to
the nearest thousandth of a share.

        7.9. REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS. Upon direction of the Committee, cash
dividends may be reinvested as soon as practicable by the Trustee in shares of
Stock for Participants' Accounts. Cash dividends may be reinvested in Stock
purchased as provided in Section 7.4. or purchased from the Accounts of
Participants who receive cash distributions.

        7.10. ALLOCATION OF DIVIDENDS OTHER THAN STOCK DIVIDENDS. At the
direction of the Committee, dividends in cash or in property other than Stock
which are actually received by the Trust during a Plan Year may be applied by
the Trustee to the purchase of Stock, as provided in Section 7.9. Dividends in
property other than Stock which are received by the Trustee with respect to
Stock held by the Trust may, to the extent practicable, be sold or exchanged for
the ultimate purpose of acquiring additional Stock.

        Stock purchased by the Trustee for the Trust out of dividends and out
of the proceeds of rights or warrants sold (or exercised, to the extent of the
bargain element if such exercise is made with Employer contributions) will be
allocated, as of the Valuation Date coincident with or following the date such
shares were purchased, to the Account of each Participant who has an Account on
such Valuation Date.

        Stock purchased with dividends on Stock held in Participants' Matching
Contribution Accounts, Pre-Tax Contributions Accounts, and Rollover Accounts
will be allocated to each Participant's Matching Contributions Account, Pre-Tax
Contributions Account and Rollover Account.

        Shares allocated to an Account in accordance with this Section 7.10.
will be allocated in an amount which bears substantially the same proportion to
the total number of shares purchased as the ratio that the number of shares in
such Account on the Valuation Date immediately preceding such purchase bears to
the total number of shares that were allocated to such Accounts of all



                                       49

<PAGE>   56

Participants on such preceding Valuation Date (disregarding the shares that
were distributed to Participants as of such preceding Valuation Date).

        Shares allocated under this Section will be allocated to the nearest
thousandth of a share.

        7.11. CERTAIN OFFERS FOR STOCK. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Plan to the contrary, in the event an offer shall be received by the
Trustee (including, but not limited to, a tender offer or exchange offer within
the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as from time to time amended
and in effect) to acquire any or all shares of Stock held by the Trust (an
"Offer"), whether or not such Stock is allocated to Participants' Accounts, the
discretion or authority to sell, exchange or transfer any of such shares shall
be determined in accordance with the following rules:

                  7.11.1. The Trustee shall not sell, exchange or transfer any
        of such Stock pursuant to such Offer except to the extent, and only to
        the extent that the Trustee is timely directed to do so in writing (i)
        with respect to any Stock held by the Trustee subject to such Offer and
        allocated to the Accounts of any Participant, by each Participant to
        whose Accounts any of such shares are allocated and (ii) with respect to
        any Stock held by the Trustee subject to such Offer and not allocated to
        the Accounts of any Participant, by each Participant who is an Eligible
        Employee with respect to a number of shares of such unallocated Stock
        equal to the total number of shares of such unallocated Stock multiplied
        by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Stock
        allocated to the Accounts of such Participant and the denominator of
        which is the total number of shares of Stock allocated to the Accounts
        of all Participants.

                 Upon timely receipt of such instructions, the Trustee shall,
        subject to the provisions of Subsections 7.11.3. and 7.11.12. of this
        Section, sell, exchange or transfer pursuant to such Offer, only such
        shares as to which such instructions were given. The Trustee shall use
        its best efforts to communicate or cause to be communicated to each
        Participant the consequences of any failure to provide timely
        instructions to the Trustee.

                 In the event, under the terms of an Offer or otherwise, any
        shares of Stock tendered for sale, exchange or transfer pursuant to such
        Offer may be withdrawn from such Offer, the Trustee shall follow such
        instructions respecting the withdrawal of such securities from such
        Offer in the same manner and the same proportion as shall be timely
        received by the Trustee from the Participants entitled under this
        Paragraph to give instructions as to the sale, exchange or transfer of
        securities pursuant to such Offer.

                  7.11.2. In the event that an Offer for fewer than all of the
        shares of Stock held by the Trustee in the Trust shall be received by
        


                                       50

<PAGE>   57



        the Trustee, each Participant shall be entitled to direct the Trustee
        as to the acceptance or rejection of such Offer (as provided by
        Subsection 7.11.1. of this Section) with respect to the largest portion
        of such Stock as may be possible given the total number or amount of
        shares of Stock the Plan may sell, exchange or transfer pursuant to
        the Offer based upon the instructions received by the Trustee from all
        other Participants who shall timely instruct the Trustee pursuant to
        this Paragraph to sell, exchange or transfer such shares pursuant to
        such Offer, each on a pro rata basis in accordance with the maximum
        number of shares each such Participant would have been permitted to
        direct under Subsection 7.11.1. had the Offer been for all shares of
        Stock held in the trust.

                  7.11.3. In the event an Offer shall be received by the Trustee
        and instructions shall be solicited from Participants in the Plan
        pursuant to Subsection 7.11.1. of this Section regarding such Offer, and
        prior to termination of such Offer, another Offer is received by the
        Trustee for the securities subject to the first Offer, the Trustee shall
        use its best efforts under the circumstances to solicit instructions
        from the Participants to the Trustee (i) with respect to securities
        tendered for sale, exchange or transfer pursuant to the first Offer,
        whether to withdraw such tender, if possible, and, if withdrawn, whether
        to tender any securities so withdrawn for sale, exchange or transfer
        pursuant to the second Offer and (ii) with respect to securities not
        tendered for sale, exchange or transfer pursuant to the first Offer,
        whether to tender or not to tender such securities for sale, exchange or
        transfer pursuant to the second Offer. The Trustee shall follow all such
        instructions received in a timely manner from Participants in the same
        manner and in the same proportion as provided in Subsection 7.11.1. of
        this Section. With respect to any further Offer for any Stock received
        by the Trustee and subject to any earlier Offer (including successive
        Offers from one or more existing offerors), the Trustee shall act in the
        same manner as described above.

                  7.11.4. With respect to any Offer received by the Trustee, the
        Trustee shall distribute, at the Company's expense, copies of all
        relevant material, including, but not limited to, material filed with
        the Securities and Exchange Commission with such Offer or regarding such
        Offer, and shall seek confidential written instructions from each
        Participant who is entitled to respond to such Offer pursuant to
        Subsections 7.11.1., 7.11.2. or 7.11.3. The identities of Participants,
        the amount of Stock allocated to their Accounts, and the Compensation of
        each Participant shall be determined from the list of Participants
        delivered to the Trustee by the Committee which shall take all
        reasonable steps necessary to provide the Trustee with the latest
        possible information.


                                       51

<PAGE>   58



                  7.11.5. The Trustee shall distribute and/or make available to
        each Participant who is entitled to respond to an Offer pursuant to
        Subsections 7.11.1., 7.11.2. or 7.11.3. an instruction form to be used
        by each such Participant who wishes to instruct the Trustee. The
        instruction form shall state that (i) if the Participant fails to return
        an instruction form to the Trustee by the indicated deadline, the Stock
        with respect to which he is entitled to give instructions will not be
        sold, exchanged or transferred pursuant to such Offer, (ii) the
        Participant will be a named fiduciary (as described in Subsection
        7.11.10. below) with respect to all shares for which he is entitled to
        give instructions, and (iii) the Company acknowledges and agrees to
        honor the confidentiality of the Participant's instructions to the
        Trustee.

                  7.11.6. Each Participant may choose to instruct the Trustee in
        one of the following two ways: (i) not to sell, exchange or transfer any
        shares of Stock for which he is entitled to give instructions, or (ii)
        to sell, exchange or transfer all Stock for which he is entitled to give
        instructions. The Trustee shall follow up with additional mailings and
        postings of bulletins, as reasonable under the time constraints then
        prevailing, to obtain instructions from Participants not otherwise
        responding to such requests for instructions. Subject to Subsection
        7.11.3., the Trustee shall then sell, exchange or transfer shares
        according to instructions from Participants, except that shares for
        which no instructions are received shall not be sold, exchanged or
        transferred.

                  7.11.7. The Company shall furnish former Participants who have
        received distributions of Stock so recently as to not be shareholders of
        record with the information given to Participants pursuant to
        Subsections 7.11.4., 7.11.5., and 7.11.6. of this Section. The Trustee
        is hereby authorized to sell, exchange or transfer pursuant to an Offer
        any such Stock in accordance with appropriate instructions from such
        former Participants.

                  7.11.8. Neither the Committee nor the Trustee shall express
        any opinion or give any advice or recommendation to any Participant
        concerning the Offer, nor shall they have any authority or
        responsibility to do so. The Trustee has no duty to monitor or police
        the party making the Offer; provided, however, that if the Trustee
        becomes aware of activity which on its face reasonably appears to the
        Trustee to be materially false, misleading, or coercive, the Trustee
        shall demand promptly that the offending party take appropriate
        corrective action. If the offending party fails or refuses to take
        appropriate corrective action, the Trustee shall communicate with
        affected Participants in such manner as it deems advisable.

                  7.11.9. The Trustee shall not reveal or release a
        Participant's instructions to the Company, its officers, directors,
        


                                       52

<PAGE>   59

        employees, or representatives. If some but not all Stock held by the
        Trust is sold, exchanged, or transferred pursuant to an Offer, the
        Company, with the Trustee's cooperation, shall take such action as is
        necessary to maintain the confidentiality of Participant's records,
        including, without limitation, establishment of a security system and
        procedures which restrict access to Participant records and retention of
        an independent agent to maintain such records. If an independent
        record-keeping agent is retained, such agent must agree, as a condition
        of its retention by the Company, not to disclose the composition of any
        Participant Accounts to the Company, its officers, directors, employees,
        or representatives. The Company acknowledges and agrees to honor the
        confidentiality of Participants' instructions to the Trustee.

                  7.11.10. Each Participant shall be a named fiduciary (as that
        term is defined in ERISA Section 402(a)(2)) with respect to Stock
        allocated to his Accounts under the Plan and with respect to his
        pro-rata portion of the unallocated Stock for which he is entitled to
        issue instructions in accordance with Subsection 7.11.1. of this Section
        solely for purposes of exercising the rights of a shareholder with
        respect to an Offer pursuant to this Section 7.11. and voting rights
        pursuant to Section 7.6.

                  7.11.11. To the extent that an Offer results in the sale of
        Stock in the Trust, the Committee shall instruct the Trustee as to the
        investment of the proceeds of such sale.

                  7.11.12. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction shall
        issue to the Plan, the Company or the Trustee an opinion or order, which
        shall, in the opinion of counsel to the Company or the Trustee,
        invalidate, in all circumstances or in any particular circumstances, any
        provision or provisions of this Section regarding the determination to
        be made as to whether or not Stock held by the Trustee shall be sold,
        exchanged or transferred pursuant to an Offer or cause any such
        provision or provisions to conflict with securities laws, then, upon
        notice thereof to the Company or the Trustee, as the case may be, such
        invalid or conflicting provisions of this Section shall be given no
        further force or effect. In such circumstances the Trustee shall not
        sell, exchange or transfer Stock held in the Trust unless required under
        such order or opinion, but shall follow instructions received from
        Participants, to the extent such instructions have not been invalidated
        by such order or opinion. To the extent required to exercise any
        residual fiduciary responsibility with respect to such sale, exchange or
        transfer, the Trustee shall take into account in exercising its
        fiduciary judgment, unless it is clearly imprudent to do so, directions
        timely received from Participants, as such directions are most
        indicative of what action is in the best interests of Participants.
        Further, the Trustee, in addition to taking into consideration any
        


                                       53
<PAGE>   60
        

        relevant financial factors bearing on any such decision, shall take into
        consideration any relevant nonfinancial factors, including, but not
        limited to, the continuing job security of Participants as employees of
        the Company or any Affiliate, conditions of employment, employment
        opportunities and other similar matters, and the prospect of the
        Participants and prospective Participants for future benefits under the
        Plan.

                                     VESTING

        8.1. VESTED INTEREST IN PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS ACCOUNT, ROLLOVER ACCOUNT,
AND PROFIT SHARING ACCOUNT. Each Participant shall at all times have one hundred
percent (100%) Vested Interest in the value of his Pre-Tax Contributions
Account, his Rollover Account, and, effective for individuals who complete an
Hour of Service for any payroll period commencing after May 31, 1995 and to the
extent a forfeiture of such Participant's Profit Sharing Account has not
occurred prior to the completion of such Hour of Service and is not subject to
restoration in accordance with Section 9.5., his Profit Sharing Account under
the Plan.

        8.2. DETERMINATION OF VESTED INTEREST IN MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ACCOUNT.
A Participant shall acquire a Vested Interest in the value of his Matching
Contributions Account (and in his profit Sharing Account to the extent not
vested as provided in Section 8.1.) in accordance with the following provisions
of this Section 8.2.

                  8.2.1. The Vested Interest of each Participant in the value of
        his Matching Contributions Account shall be determined as provided in
        the following table:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

            Number of Full Years
             of Vesting Service       Vested Interest
            --------------------      ---------------
          <S>                         <C>
                    Under 1                   0%
          At least 1, less than 2            20%
          At least 2, less than 3            40%
          At least 3, less than 4            60%
          At least 4, less than 5            80%
                   5 or more                100%

</TABLE>


        Fractional Years of Service shall not be taken into account.

                  8.2.2. In addition, a Participant shall be one hundred percent
        100% vested in the value of his Matching Contributions Account upon
        attainment of Normal Retirement Age while employed by the Employer or an
        Affiliated Company or upon an earlier Severance due to death or
        Disability.

                  8.2.3. Any Matching Contributions that have been designated as
        "qualified matching contributions" within the meaning of regulations
        under Section 401(k) of the Code shall be one hundred percent (100%)
        vested when paid to the Trustee, notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary in this Plan.


                                       55

<PAGE>   62

                  8.2.4. If a Participant who incurs a Severance receives a
        distribution from an Account at a time when the Participant does not
        have a one hundred percent (100%) Vested Interest in the value of such
        Account, and again becomes an Active Participant, upon restoration of
        the non-vested portion of the Account in accordance with Section 9.5.:

                           8.2.4.1. such non-vested portion shall be established
                  as a separate Account as of the date of distribution, and

                           8.2.4.2. at any relevant time the Participant's
                  Vested Interest in the value of such separate Account shall be
                  equal to an amount ("X") determined by the formula:

                                 X = P(AB + D) - D

        For purposes of applying the formula above: P is the nonforfeitable
        percentage at the relevant time, AB is the Account balance at the
        relevant time, and D is the amount of the prior distribution.

                  8.2.5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 8.2.1.
        above, any Years of Vesting Service completed by a Participant after he
        incurs at least five (5) consecutive Breaks in Service shall not be
        taken into account for purposes of determining his Vested Interest in
        the value of his Matching Contributions Account and Profit Sharing
        Contributions Account prior to his incurring such five (5) consecutive
        Breaks in Service.

        8.3. AMENDMENT OF VESTING SCHEDULE. If the vesting schedule under the
Plan is amended or if the Plan is amended in any way that directly or indirectly
affects the computation of a Participant's Vested Interest, each Participant who

                            PAYMENT OF PLAN BENEFITS

        9.1.  DISTRIBUTION UPON RETIREMENT.

                  9.1.1. Upon a Participant's Severance on or after he attains
        Normal Retirement Age such Participant shall be entitled to a
        distribution of his Distributable Benefit as provided in Section 9.5. as
        soon as administratively feasible following the Valuation Date
        determined in accordance with Section 10.2. In no event shall
        distribution be made later than the sixtieth day after the later of the
        close of the Plan Year in which occurs the Severance, or the close of
        the Plan Year in which the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age
        unless the Participant makes a written election to defer payment to his
        "Required Beginning Date" as defined in accordance with 9.1.3. below.

                  9.1.2. If the Participant continues in the service of the
        Employer after he attains Normal Retirement Age, he shall continue to
        participate in the Plan in the same manner as Participants who have not
        attained Normal Retirement Age.

                  9.1.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distribution of a
        Participant's Distributable Benefit shall be made not later than his
        "Required Beginning Date" as determined in accordance with this
        Subsection:

                           9.1.3.1. Except as provided in 9.1.3.2. below, a
                  Participant's "Required Beginning Date" shall mean the April 1
                  following the calendar year in which the Participant attains
                  age 70 1/2, whether or not such Participant has incurred a
                  Severance or whether or not the Participant consents to the
                  distribution. The Participant's Distributable Benefit
                  determined as of the December 31 of the calendar year in which
                  occurs his Required Beginning Date and the December 31 of each
                  subsequent calendar year shall be distributed no later than
                  the December 31 of the next following calendar year.

                           9.1.3.2. Except in the case of a Participant who is a
                  "5-percent owner" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(9) of
                  the Code, "Required Beginning Date" for a Participant who
                  attained age 70 1/2 prior to January 1, 1988 shall mean the
                  April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which the
                  Participant attains age 70-1/2, or the calendar year in which
                  the Participant incurs a Severance.

        9.2.  DISTRIBUTION UPON DEATH PRIOR TO PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.

                  9.2.1. Upon the death of a Participant prior to the payment of
        his Distributable Benefit, the Administration Committee shall direct the
        

                                       57

<PAGE>   64

        Trustee to make a distribution of such Distributable Benefit as provided
        in Section 9.5., to the Beneficiary designated by the deceased
        Participant, or otherwise entitled to such Distributable Benefit, as
        provided in Section 9.9.

                  9.2.2. Distribution of a Participant's Distributable Benefit
        shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the later of
        (i) the Valuation Date determined in accordance with Section 10.2., or
        (ii) the date all facts required by the Administration Committee to be
        established as a condition of payment shall have been established to the
        satisfaction of the Administration Committee, but in any event within
        five (5) years of the Participant's death.

        9.3.  DISTRIBUTION UPON DISABILITY.

                  9.3.1. If a Participant incurs a Disability prior to his
        Severance, distribution of his Distributable Benefit shall be made as
        provided in Section 9.5. as soon as administratively practicable after
        the later of (i) the Valuation Date determined in accordance with
        Section 10.2., or (ii) the date the Participant's Disability has been
        determined by the Administration Committee.

                  9.3.2. If a Participant incurs a Disability prior to his
        attainment of Normal Retirement Age, the requirements of Section 9.4.
        relating to written consent to a distribution in excess of $3500 shall
        be applicable.

        9.4.  SEVERANCE PRIOR TO NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE.

                  9.4.1. If a Participant incurs a Severance prior to attainment
        of Normal Retirement Age for any reason other than death, distribution
        of his Distributable Benefit before Normal Retirement Age shall be made
        as provided in Section 9.5. after receipt by the Administration
        Committee of all required documentation, as follows:

                           9.4.1.1. In the case of a Participant whose
                  Distributable Benefit has at no time ever exceeded $3,500,
                  distribution shall be made as soon as administratively
                  practicable following the Valuation Date coinciding with or
                  immediately following such Participant's Severance, whether or
                  not the Participant consents to such distribution. The
                  preceding provisions of this Subsection 9.4.1.1. shall not be
                  interpreted or applied to preclude the administrative practice
                  of effecting distribution as of the last day of a month,
                  quarter or other period not less frequent than annual, of all
                  distributions to be made pursuant to this Subsection 9.4.1.1.
                  with respect to Severances occurring during such period.

                           9.4.1.2. In the case of a Participant whose
                  Distributable Benefit has at any time ever exceeded $3,500,
                  distribution shall be made as soon as administratively
                  practicable following the Valuation Date coinciding with or
                  next following the later of (A) the Valuation Date determined
                  in accordance with Section 10.2., or (B) the receipt by the
                  Administration Committee of the consent of the Participant to
                  the distribution in accordance with 9.4.1.4. below.

                           9.4.1.3. If a Participant described in 9.4.1.2. above
                  fails to consent to distribution of the Participant's
                  Distributable Benefit prior to the first Valuation Date that
                  occurs at least ninety (90) days following the Participant's
                  Severance Date, such a Participant shall be deemed to have
                  made an election to defer distribution to Normal Retirement
                  Age, unless prior to Normal Retirement Age and in accordance
                  with 9.4.1.2. above, the Participant submits a request for an
                  earlier distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions
                  of this Subsection 9.4.1.3., no distribution shall occur on or
                  after Normal Retirement Age unless and until the Participant
                  submits an application, in form and manner satisfactory to the
                  Committee, distribution of the Participant's Distributable
                  Benefit, except in connection with a distribution required by
                  Code Section 401(a)(9) as provided in Section 9.1.3.

                           9.4.1.4. Any written consent by a Participant to
                  receive distribution of the Participant's Distributable
                  Benefit prior to Normal Retirement Age shall not be valid
                  unless such consent is made both (A) after the Participant
                  receives a written notice advising him of his right to defer
                  distribution to Normal Retirement Age and (B) within the
                  ninety (90) day period ending on the Participant's "Benefit
                  Starting Date." The notice to the Participant advising him of
                  his right to defer distribution shall be given no less than
                  thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the
                  Participant's Benefit Starting Date; provided, however, that a
                  Participant who receives the notice may waive the thirty (30)
                  day notice period by making an affirmative election to receive
                  or commence payment prior to the expiration of such thirty
                  (30) day period. For purposes of this Paragraph 9.4.1.4.,
                  "Benefit Starting Date" shall mean the first day of the first
                  period for which the Participant's Distributable Benefit is
                  paid.

                  9.4.2. If a Participant who incurs a Severance does not have a
        100% Vested Interest in any Account as of such Severance, the portion of
        such Participant's Account which is not vested as of such Severance
        shall be held in such Account, subject to forfeiture in accordance with
        Section 9.5.



                                       59

<PAGE>   66

                  9.4.3. To the extent permissible under Section 401(k)(10) of
        the Code, if a Participant ceases to be an Employee by reason of the
        sale or other disposition by the Employer or an Affiliated Company of
        either (i) substantially all of the assets used by the Employer, or an
        Affiliated Company, as the case may be, in a trade or business to an
        unrelated corporation, or (ii) the interest of the Employer or an
        Affiliated Company, as the case may be, in a subsidiary to an unrelated
        entity or individual, such Participant shall be entitled to distribution
        of his Distributable Benefit as if, for purposes of this Plan only, such
        event constitutes a Severance.

         9.5.  FORFEITURES; RESTORATION.

                  9.5.1. Subject to the provisions of 9.5.3. below, any
        non-vested portion of a Participant's Accounts shall be forfeited as of
        the earlier of the date the Participant's Distributable Benefit is paid
        to him as provided in Section 9.4., or the date the Participant incurs
        five (5) consecutive Breaks in Service. For purposes of this Section, if
        the value of a Participant's Distributable Benefit is zero, the
        Participant shall be deemed to have received payment of his
        Distributable Benefit.

                  9.5.2. Any non-vested portion of a Participant's Accounts
        which is forfeited in accordance with 9.5.1. above shall be applied as
        provided in Section 5.7.

                  9.5.3. In accordance with such rules as the Administration
        Committee may prescribe, there shall be restored to the Participant's
        Account the dollar value of any non-vested portion of such a
        Participant's Account which was forfeited upon payment of the
        Participant's Distributable Benefit in accordance with Subsection 9.4.1.
        prior to the date on which he incurs five (5) consecutive Breaks in
        Service; provided, however, that such restoration shall be made only in
        the case of the Participant's reemployment as an Eligible Employee prior
        to incurring five (5) consecutive Breaks in Service. The determination
        of the dollar value of the forfeited portion of the Participant's
        Account required to be restored to the Participant shall be made as of
        the Valuation Date the Participant's Account was valued for purposes of
        determining his Distributable Benefit, as provided in Article 10. No
        adjustment in the dollar value of the forfeited amounts shall be made
        for any gains or losses of the Trust Fund, between the applicable
        Valuation Date and the restoration of the dollar value of the forfeited
        portion of the Participant's Account. Restored amounts shall be paid
        from the Forfeiture Account, or if forfeitures are not available, the
        Employer shall make an additional contribution for this purpose.

        9.6. FORM OF PAYMENT OF DISTRIBUTABLE BENEFIT. Payment of a
Participant's Distributable Benefit under this Article 9. shall be made in a


                                       60

<PAGE>   67

lump sum consisting of whole shares of Stock held in the Participant's Accounts
and in cash with respect to the remaining portion of the Participant's Accounts;
provided, however, effective for distributions made on or after April 1, 1992, a
Participant may elect payment of his Distributable Benefit either (a) in cash,
or (b) in whole shares of Stock with the value of fractional shares paid in
cash. To the extent that a Participant elects payment of his Distributable
Benefit in cash and such payment is attributable to Stock held in the
Participant's Accounts, such Stock shall be sold by the Trustee as soon as
practicable after communication to the Trustee of the Participant's election to
receive cash with respect to such shares, and the amount distributable to the
Participant shall be equal to the proceeds of such sale, after deduction of any
expenses associated with the sale, if any.

        9.7. IN-SERVICE WITHDRAWALS. To the extent permissible under the
provisions of this Section, while still an Employee or on an approved Leave of
Absence, a Participant may make a withdrawal of his Vested Interest in his
Accounts in the Plan.

                  9.7.1. A Participant may make a withdrawal of his Pre-Tax
        Contributions from his Rollover Account, from his Vested Interest in his
        Matching Contributions Account, and from his Vested Interest in his
        Profit Sharing Contributions Account in accordance with rules of uniform
        application which the Administration Committee may from time to time
        prescribe.

                  9.7.2. Unless otherwise provided in this Section, no
        Participant may make a withdrawal prior to a determination by the
        Administration Committee that such Participant has a Hardship need in
        excess of $500, and such withdrawal is necessary on account of such
        Hardship need as provided in this Section 9.7. Any determination of
        Hardship shall be in accordance with regulations promulgated under
        Section 401(k) of the Code, and to the extent determined by the
        Administration Committee, may be determined in accordance with either
        Subsection 9.7.3. or Subsection 9.7.4. below. In no event shall a
        Participant be permitted to make an in-service withdrawal of any amounts
        attributable to Matching Contributions that are designated as "qualified
        matching contributions" or Profit Sharing Contributions that are
        designated as "nonelective contributions," as defined in regulations
        issued under Section 401(k) of the Code, except for Hardship reasons.

                  9.7.3. The existence of a Participant's Hardship and the
        amount required to meet the need created by the Hardship may be
        determined by the Administration Committee on the basis of facts and
        circumstances, and in accordance with rules of uniform application which
        the Administration Committee may from time to time prescribe. A
        distribution shall not be treated as necessary to satisfy a Hardship
        need of a Participant to the extent the amount of the distribution is in
        

                                       61

<PAGE>   68

        excess of the amount required to relieve the Hardship need or to the
        extent that the Hardship need may be satisfied from other resources
        reasonably available to the Participant. The amount of a Hardship need
        may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income
        taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the
        distribution. A distribution generally may be treated as necessary on
        account of a Hardship need of a Participant if the Administration
        Committee reasonably relies on the Participant's written representations
        to the Administration Committee, unless the Committee has actual
        knowledge to the contrary, that the Hardship need cannot be relieved:

                           9.7.3.1. through reimbursement or compensation by
                  insurance or otherwise,

                           9.7.3.2. by reasonable liquidation of assets, if such
                  liquidation would not itself cause an immediate and heavy
                  financial need,

                           9.7.3.3. by the cessation of the Participant's
                  contributions to the Plan, or

                           9.7.3.4. by other distributions or non-taxable loans
                  from plans of the Employer or any other employer, or by
                  borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable commercial
                  terms.

         For purposes of determining a Hardship need, a Participant's resources
         shall be deemed to include those assets of his Spouse and minor
         children that are reasonably available to the Participant.

                  9.7.4. A Hardship distribution may be considered as necessary
        to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of the Employee only
        if:

                           9.7.4.1. The distribution is not in excess of the
                  amount of the Hardship need of the Participant. The amount of
                  the Hardship need may include any amounts necessary to pay
                  federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably
                  anticipated to result from the distribution.

                           9.7.4.2. The Employee has obtained all distributions,
                  other than Hardship distributions, and all nontaxable (at the
                  time of the loan) loans under all plans maintained by the
                  Employer.

                           9.7.4.3. The Employee's Pre-Tax Contributions under
                  this Plan and any elective contributions and employee
                  contributions under all qualified and nonqualified plans of
                  deferred compensation maintained by the Employer, including a
                  stock option, stock purchase, or similar plan, or a cash or
                  deferred arrangement that is part of a cafeteria plan


                                       62

                  within the meaning of Code Section 125, will be suspended
                  under the terms of each such plan, or in accordance with the
                  terms of an otherwise legally enforceable agreement, for at
                  least twelve (12) months after the receipt of the Hardship
                  distribution.

                           9.7.4.4. The Plan and all other plans maintained by
                  the Employer limit the Employee's elective contributions for
                  the Employee's taxable year immediately following the taxable
                  year of the Hardship distribution to the Deferral Limitation
                  under Section 402(g) of the Code for such taxable year minus
                  the amount of such Employee's elective contributions for the
                  taxable year of the Hardship distribution.

        For purposes of determining a Hardship need, a Participant's resources
        shall be deemed to include those assets of his Spouse and minor children
        that are reasonably available to the Participant.

                  9.7.5. The amount of a Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions
        Account which is available for a Hardship withdrawal on any date will
        not exceed the lesser of

                           9.7.5.1. the value of the Account in the Predecessor
                  Plan on December 31, 1988, plus the dollar amount of Pre-Tax
                  Contributions added to such Account under the Predecessor Plan
                  and this Plan on and after January 1, 1989 minus all amounts
                  withdrawn from the Account under the Predecessor Plan and this
                  Plan since January 1, 1989, or

                           9.7.5.2. the value of the Account on the date as of
                  which the withdrawal will occur.

                  9.7.6. A Participant may request a withdrawal by submitting a
        written request for such withdrawal in a form satisfactory to the
        Administration Committee, together with any supporting documentation
        which the Administration Committee in its sole discretion may require.
        The maximum amount subject to any withdrawal under this Section shall be
        determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately
        preceding the Administration Committee's determination authorizing the
        withdrawal. To the extent permitted under this Section, any withdrawal
        of a Participant's Vested Interest in the value of his Accounts shall be
        made from such Accounts in the following order of priority: After-Tax
        Contributions Account, Pre-Tax Contributions Account, Rollover Account,
        Matching Contributions Account, and Profit Sharing Contributions
        Account. Any unmatched Pre-Tax Contributions shall be withdrawn before
        matched Pre-Tax Contributions.

<PAGE>   70

                  9.7.7. The Administration Committee shall not limit the number
        of withdrawals a Participant shall be permitted to make, provided the
        requirements of this Section are satisfied.

                  9.7.8. If a Participant makes an in-service withdrawal from an
        Account at a time when the Participant does not have a one hundred
        percent (100%) Vested Interest in the value of such Account, and the
        Participant may increase his Vested Interest in the Account:

                           9.7.8.1. such Account shall be established as a
                  separate Account as of the date of distribution, and

                           9.7.8.2. at any relevant time the Participant's
                  Vested Interest in the value of such separate Account shall be
                  equal to an amount ("X") determined by the formula:

                                 X = P(AB + D) - D

        For purposes of applying the formula above: P is the nonforfeitable
        percentage at the relevant time, AB is the Account balance at the
        relevant time, and D is the amount of the withdrawal.

        9.8. LOANS. From time to time, the Administration Committee may
establish a Participant loan program under the Plan in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.

                  9.8.1. The implementation of a Participant loan program shall
        be subject to the adoption by the Administration Committee of written
        rules and procedures governing the operation of such loan program, to
        the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Labor
        under Section 408(b)(1)(C) of ERISA. The written rules and procedures of
        the Participant loan program shall form a part of the Plan and shall
        include, but need not be limited to, the following: (i) the identity of
        the person or positions authorized to administer the Participant loan
        program; (ii) a procedure for applying for loans; (iii) the basis on
        which loans will be approved or denied; (iv) any limitations on the
        types and amounts of loans offered; (v) the procedure under the loan
        program for determining a reasonable rate of interest; (vi) the types of
        collateral which may secure a Participant loan; and (vii) the events
        constituting default and the steps that will be taken to preserve Plan
        assets in the event of such default.

                  9.8.2. In addition to such other requirements as may be
        imposed by applicable law, any Participant loan shall bear a reasonable
        rate of interest, shall be adequately secured by proper collateral, and
        shall be repaid within a specified period of time according to a written
        repayment schedule that calls for substantially level amortization over
        the term of the loan.


                                       64

<PAGE>   71

                  9.8.3. In no event shall the principal amount of a loan
        hereunder, at the time the loan is made, together with the outstanding
        balance of all other loans to the Participant under this Plan, exceed
        the lesser of:

                           9.8.3.1. fifty percent (50%) of the value of the
                  Participant's vested interest in his Accounts under this Plan,
                  or

                           9.8.3.2. fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), reduced by
                  the excess (if any) of

                                    9.8.3.2.1. the highest outstanding balances
                           of loans from the Plan during the one-year period
                           ending on the day before the date on which such loan
                           was made, over

                                    9.8.3.2.2. the outstanding balance of loans
                           from the Plan on the date on which such loan was
                           made.

                  9.8.4. To the extent required to comply with the requirements
        of Section 401(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, loans hereunder shall
        be made in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.

        9.9.  DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.

                  9.9.1. Subject to the provisions of 9.9.2. below, each
        Participant shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary or
        Beneficiaries to receive his interest in the Trust Fund in the event of
        his death before receipt of his entire interest in the Trust Fund. This
        designation is to be made on the form prescribed by and delivered to the
        Administration Committee. Subject to the provisions of 9.9.2. below, a
        Participant shall have the right to change or revoke any such
        designation by filing a new designation or notice of revocation with the
        Administration Committee, and no notice to any Beneficiary nor consent
        by any Beneficiary shall be required to effect any such change or
        revocation.

                  9.9.2. If a Participant designates a Beneficiary and on the
        date of his death has a Spouse who is not such Beneficiary, no effect
        shall be given to such designation unless such Spouse has consented or
        thereafter consents in writing to such designation, the consent
        acknowledges the effect of the designation and the consent is witnessed
        by a notary public. A Spouse's consent to a Beneficiary designation is
        not required under the following circumstances:

                           9.9.2.1. if it is established to the satisfaction of
                  the Administration Committee that there is no Spouse; or

                           9.9.2.2. if the Participant's Spouse cannot be
                  located; or


                                       65

<PAGE>   72

                           9.9.2.3. because of other circumstances under which a
                  Spouse's consent is not required in accordance with applicable
                  Treasury or Department of Labor Regulations.

                 The Administration Committee shall have absolute discretion as
        to whether the consent of a Spouse shall be required. The provisions of
        this Section shall not be construed to place upon the Company or the
        Administration Committee any duty or obligation to require the consent
        of a Spouse for the purpose of protecting the rights or interests of
        present or former Spouses of Participants, except to the extent required
        to comply with Code Section 401(a)(11) or Section 205 of ERISA.

                  9.9.3. If a deceased Participant shall have failed to
        designate a Beneficiary, or if the Administration Committee shall be
        unable to locate a designated Beneficiary after reasonable efforts have
        been made, or if for any reason (including but not limited to
        application of the rules in 9.9.2. above) the designation shall be
        legally ineffective, or if the Beneficiary shall have predeceased the
        Participant without effectively designating a successor Beneficiary, any
        distribution required to be made under the provisions of this Plan shall
        commence within one (1) year after the Participant's death to the person
        or persons included in the highest priority category among the
        following, in order of priority:

                           9.9.3.1. The Participant's surviving Spouse;

                           9.9.3.2. The Participant's surviving children,
                  including adopted children and children of deceased children,
                  per stirpes;

                           9.9.3.3. The Participant's surviving parents in equal
                  shares;

                           9.9.3.4. The Participant's brothers and sisters, and
                  nephews and nieces who are children of deceased brothers and
                  sisters, per stirpes; or

                           9.9.3.5. The Participant's estate.

                 The determination by the Administration Committee as to which
        persons, if any, qualify within the foregoing categories shall be final
        and conclusive upon all persons. Notwithstanding the preceding
        provisions of this Section, distribution made pursuant to this Section
        shall be made to the Participant's estate if the Administration
        Committee so determines in its discretion.

                  9.9.4. In the event that the deceased Participant was not a
        resident of California at the date of his death, the Administration
        Committee, in its discretion, may require the establishment of ancillary
        administration in California. In the event that a Participant shall 
        


                                       66

<PAGE>   73

        predecease his Beneficiary and on the subsequent death of the
        Beneficiary a remaining distribution is payable under the applicable
        provisions of this Plan, the distribution shall be payable in the same
        order of priority categories as set forth above but determined with
        respect to the Beneficiary, subject to the same provisions concerning
        non-California residency, the unavailability of an estate representative
        and/or the absence of administration of the Beneficiary's estate as are
        applicable on the death of the Participant.

                  9.9.5. The Administration Committee shall not be required to
        authorize any payment to be made to any person following a Participant's
        death, whether or not such person has been designated by the Participant
        as a Beneficiary, if the Administration Committee determines that the
        Plan may be subject to conflicting claims in respect of said payment for
        any reason, including, without limitation, the designation or
        continuation of a designation of a Beneficiary other than the
        Participant's Spouse without the consent of such Spouse to the extent
        such consent is required by Section 401(a)(11) of the Code. In the event
        the Administration Committee determines in accordance with this Section
        not to make payment to a designated Beneficiary, the Administration
        Committee shall take such steps as it determines appropriate to resolve
        such potential conflict.

        9.10. FACILITY OF PAYMENT. If any payee under the Plan is a minor or if
the Administration Committee reasonably believes that any payee is legally
incapable of giving a valid receipt and discharge for any payment due him, the
Administration Committee may have the payment, or any part thereof, made to the
person (or persons or institution) whom it reasonably believes is caring for or
supporting the payee, unless it has received due notice of claim therefor from a
duly appointed guardian or committee of the payee. Any payment shall be a
payment from the Accounts of the payee and shall, to the extent thereof, be a
complete discharge of any liability under the Plan to the payee.

        9.11. PAYEE CONSENT. To the extent required to comply with Code Section
411(a)(11), the Administration Committee shall require each Participant or other
payee to consent to any payment of a Participant's Accounts.

        9.12.  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTRIBUTION.

                  9.12.1. The Administration Committee or Trustee, or both, may
        require the execution and delivery of such documents, papers and
        receipts as the Administration Committee or Trustee may determine
        necessary or appropriate in order to establish the fact of death of the
        deceased Participant and of the right and identity of any Beneficiary or
        other person or persons claiming any benefits under this Article 9.


                                       67

<PAGE>   74

                  9.12.2. The Administration Committee or the Trustee, or both,
        may, as a condition precedent to the payment of death benefits
        hereunder, require an inheritance tax release and/or such security as
        the Administration Committee or Trustee, or both, may deem appropriate
        as protection against possible liability for state or federal death
        taxes attributable to any death benefits.

                  9.12.3. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 9.
        regarding the time within which a Participant's Distributable Benefit
        will be paid, if, in the opinion of the Administration Committee there
        are or reasonably may be conflicting claims or other legal impediments
        to the payment of such Distributable Benefit to a payee, such payment
        may be delayed for so long as is necessary to resolve such conflict,
        potential conflict, or other legal impediment, but not beyond the date
        permitted by applicable law.

        9.13.  NOTICE OF RIGHT TO ELECT DIRECT ROLLOVER.

                  9.13.1. At least thirty (30) days, but not more than ninety
        (90) days, before an eligible rollover distribution is made, each
        Participant shall be given written notice of any right he may have
        to elect a direct rollover of his/her eligible rollover distribution in
        accordance with this Section 9.13.; provided, however, that a
        Participant who receives the notice may waive the thirty (30) day notice
        requirement by making an affirmative election to make or not to make a
        direct rollover of all or a portion of his distributable benefit.

                  9.13.2. To the extent required by Section 401(a)(31) of the
        Code a Participant whose Plan benefit becomes payable in an "eligible
        rollover distribution," as defined below, shall be entitled to make an
        election for a direct rollover of all or a portion of the taxable
        portion of such benefit to an "eligible retirement plan," as defined in
        below. For purposes of this Section 9.13., a Participant who makes a
        direct rollover election in accordance with this Section 9.13. shall be
        deemed to have received payment of his benefit as of the date
        payment is made from the Plan.

                  9.13.3. For purposes of this Section 9.13.,

                           9.13.3.1. an "eligible rollover distribution" shall
                  mean any distribution of all or any portion of a Participant's
                  Plan benefit, except that an eligible rollover distribution
                  shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of
                  substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
                  than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the
                  Participant or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
                  the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary,
                  or for a specified period of ten years or more; any
                  distribution to the extent such distribution is required 
                  


                                       68

<PAGE>   75


                  under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any
                  distribution that is not includible in gross income
                  (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized
                  appreciation with respect to employer securities), and

                           9.13.3.2. an "eligible retirement plan" shall mean
                  any plan described in Code Section 402(c)(8)(B), the terms of
                  which permit the acceptance of a direct transfer from a
                  qualified plan.

                  9.13.4. A Participant's direct rollover election under this
        Section shall be made in accordance with rules and procedures
        established by the Committee and shall specify the dollar or percentage
        amount of the direct rollover, the name and address of the eligible
        retirement plan selected by the Participant and such additional
        information as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate in order to
        implement the Participant's election. It shall be the Participant's
        responsibility to confirm that the eligible retirement plan designated
        in the direct rollover election will accept the eligible rollover
        distribution. The Committee shall be entitled to effect the direct
        rollover based on its reasonable reliance on information provided by the
        Participant, and shall not be required to independently verify such
        information, unless it is clearly unreasonable not to do so.

                  9.13.5. If a Participant whose benefit becomes payable fails
        to file a direct rollover election with the Committee within sixty (60)
        days after receipt of the direct rollover notice, or if the Committee is
        unable to effect the rollover within a reasonable time after the
        election is filed with the Committee due to the failure of the
        Participant to take such actions as may be required by the eligible
        retirement plan before it will accept the rollover, the Participant's
        benefit shall be paid to him in accordance with applicable
        provisions of this Plan, after withholding any applicable income taxes
        and no direct rollover shall be made.

                  9.13.6. To the extent required by Section 401(a)(31) of the
        Code, if all or a portion of a Participant's benefit is payable to
        his surviving Spouse in an eligible rollover distribution, or to a
        former Spouse in accordance with a "qualified domestic relations order,"
        such surviving Spouse or former Spouse shall be entitled to elect a
        direct rollover of all or a portion of such distribution to an
        individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity in
        accordance with the provisions of this Section.

                              VALUATION OF ACCOUNTS

        10.1. ALLOCATION OF PLAN EARNINGS OR LOSSES. As of each Valuation Date,
the Administration Committee will determine the net investment gain or loss,
after adjustment for applicable expenses, if any, of each Investment Fund since
the immediately preceding Valuation Date.

        10.2. VALUE OF PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS FOR DISTRIBUTION. For purposes of
payment of a Participant's Distributable Benefit following a Severance for any
reason, the value of a Participant's Accounts shall be determined in accordance
with Section 10.1. and rules prescribed by the Administration Committee,
subject, however, to the following provisions:

                 10.2.1. Subject to 10.2.2. below, in the case of any Severance
        including death, the value of a Participant's Accounts under the Plan
        shall be determined by reference to the Valuation Date immediately
        following both (i) the occurrence of an event entitling the Participant
        to a distribution, and (ii) the receipt by the Administration Committee
        of the properly completed application of the Participant (or his
        Beneficiary) for payment of the Participant's Distributable Benefit with
        respect to such event.

                 10.2.2. The value of a Participant's Accounts shall be
        increased or decreased (as appropriate) by any contributions,
        withdrawals or distributions properly allocable under the terms of this
        Plan to his Accounts that occurred on or after the applicable Valuation
        Date or which, for any other reason were not otherwise reflected in the
        valuation of his Accounts on such Valuation Date.

        11.14. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  11.14.1. To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall
        indemnify each member of the Board of Directors and the Administration

        Plan, against expenses (including any amount paid in settlement)
        reasonably incurred by him in connection with any claims against him by
        reason of his conduct in the performance of his duties under the Plan,
        except in relation to matters as to which he acted fraudulently or in
        bad faith in the performance of such duties. The preceding right of
        indemnification shall pass to the estate of such a person.

                  11.14.2. The preceding right of indemnification shall be in
        addition to any other right to which the Board member or Administration

        member of the Administration Committee, or any other fiduciary under
        this Plan.

                  11.15.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of
        satisfying its indemnity obligations under Section 11.14., the Company
        may (but need not) purchase and pay premiums for one or more policies of

                  11.16.2. The Administration Committee shall not cause the Plan

              PLAN TERMINATION AND DISCONTINUANCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS

        13.1. PLAN TERMINATION.

                  13.1.1. Subject to the following provisions of this Section
        13.1., the Board of Directors may terminate the Plan and the Trust
        Agreements at any time by an instrument in writing executed in the name
        of the Administration Committee, and delivered to the Trustee.

                  13.1.2. The Plan and Trust Agreements may terminate if the
        Company merges into any other corporation, if as the result of the
        merger the entity of the Company ceases, and the Plan is terminated
        pursuant to the rules of Section 12.1.

                  13.1.3. Upon and after the effective date of the termination,
        an Employer shall not make any further contributions under the Plan and
        no contributions need be made by the Employer applicable to the Plan
        Year in which the termination occurs, except as may otherwise be
        required by applicable law.

                  13.1.4. The rights of all affected Participants to benefits
        accrued to the date of termination of the Plan, to the extent funded as
        of the date of termination, shall automatically become fully vested as
        of that date, to the extent required to comply with the requirements of
        Code Section 411.

        13.2. DISCONTINUANCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS.

                  13.2.1. In the event an Employer decides it is impossible or
        inadvisable for business reasons to continue to make Profit Sharing
        Contributions under the Plan, the Employer may discontinue contributions
        to the Plan. Upon and after the effective date of this discontinuance,
        the Employer shall not make any further Profit Sharing Contributions
        under the Plan and no Profit Sharing Contributions need be made by the
        Employer with respect to the Plan Year in which the discontinuance
        occurs, except as may otherwise be required by applicable law.

                  13.2.2. The discontinuance of Profit Sharing Contributions on
        the part of an Employer shall not terminate the Plan as to the funds and
        assets then held by the Trustee, or operate to accelerate any payments
        of distributions to or for the benefit of Participants or Beneficiaries,
        and the Trustee shall continue to administer the Trust Fund in
        accordance with the provisions of the Plan until all of the obligations
        under the Plan shall have been discharged and satisfied.


                                       79

<PAGE>   86

                  13.2.3. However, if this discontinuance of Profit Sharing
        Contributions shall cause the Plan to lose its status as a qualified
        plan under Code Section 401(a), the Plan shall be terminated in
        accordance with the provisions of this Article 13.

                  13.2.4. On and after the effective date of a complete
        discontinuance of an Employer's contributions, the rights of all
        affected Participants to benefits accrued to that date, to the extent
        funded as of that date, shall automatically become fully vested as of
        that date, to the extent required by Code Section 411.

        13.3. RIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS. In the event of the termination of the
Plan, for any cause whatsoever, all assets of the Plan, after payment of
expenses, shall be used for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their
Beneficiaries and no part thereof shall be returned to the Company, except as
provided in Section 5.12. of this Plan.

        13.4. TRUSTEE'S DUTIES ON TERMINATION.

                  13.4.1. Upon the termination of the Plan, the Trustee shall
        proceed as soon as administratively practicable, but in any event within
        six months from the effective date, to reduce all of the assets of the
        Trust Fund to cash and/or common stock and other securities in such
        proportions as the Administration Committee shall determine (after
        approval by the Internal Revenue Service, if necessary or desirable,
        with respect to any portion of the assets of the Trust Fund held in
        common stock or securities of the Company).

                  13.4.2. After first deducting the estimated expenses for
        liquidation and distribution chargeable to the Trust Fund, and after
        setting aside a reasonable reserve for expenses and liabilities
        (absolute or contingent) of the Trust, the Administration Committee
        shall make required allocations of items of income and expense to the
        Accounts.

                  13.4.3. Following these allocations, the Trustee shall
        promptly, after receipt of appropriate instructions from the
        Administration Committee, distribute in accordance with Section 9.5. to
        each former Participant a benefit equal to the amount credited to his
        Accounts as of the date of completion of the liquidation.

                  13.4.4. The Trustee and the Administration Committee shall
        continue to function as such for such period of time as may be necessary
        for the winding up of this Plan and for the making of distributions in
        accordance with the provisions of this Plan.

<PAGE>   87

                  13.4.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions to
        Participants upon Plan termination in accordance with this Section 13.4.
        shall not be made if the Employer establishes or maintains a "successor
        plan" as defined in regulations issued under Section 401(k)(10) of the
        Code. In the event benefits are not distributable upon the termination
        of the Plan, the Administration Committee shall direct the Trustee to
        transfer such benefits to the successor plan in accordance with
        regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

        13.5. PARTIAL TERMINATION.

                  13.5.1. In the event of a partial termination of the Plan
        within the meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3), the interests of affected
        Participants in the Trust Fund, as of the date of the partial
        termination, shall become nonforfeitable as of that date.

                  13.5.2. That portion of the assets of the Plan affected by the
        partial termination shall be used exclusively for the benefit of the
        affected Participants and their Beneficiaries, and no part thereof shall
        otherwise be applied.

                  13.5.3. With respect to Plan assets and Participants affected
        by a partial termination, the Administration Committee and the Trustee
        shall follow the same procedures and take the same actions prescribed in
        this Article 13. in the case of a total termination of the Plan.

        13.6. FAILURE TO CONTRIBUTE. The failure of an Employer to contribute to
the Trust in any year, if contributions are not required under the Plan for that
year, shall not constitute a complete discontinuance of contributions to the
Plan.

                            APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS

        14.1. APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS. The Administration Committee may require
any person claiming benefits under the Plan to submit an application therefor,
together with such documents and information as the Administration Committee may
require. In the case of any person suffering from a disability which prevents
the claimant from making personal application for benefits, the Administration
Committee may, in its discretion, permit another person acting on his behalf to
submit the application.

                          LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS

        15.1. GENERAL RULE.

                  15.1.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
        this Plan the total Annual Additions under this Plan to a Participant's
        Plan Accounts for any Plan Year shall not exceed the lesser of:

                           15.1.1.1. Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) (or if
                  greater, one-fourth (1/4) of the defined benefit dollar
                  limitation set forth in Section 415(b) of the Code as in
                  effect for the Limitation Year); or

                           15.1.1.2. Twenty-five percent of the Participant's
                  total Compensation from the Employer and any Affiliated
                  Companies for the year, excluding amounts otherwise treated as
                  Annual Additions under Section 15.2.1.

                  15.1.2. For purposes of this Article 15., the Employer has
        elected a "Limitation Year" corresponding to the Plan Year.

        15.2. ANNUAL ADDITIONS.

                  15.2.1. For purposes of Section 15.1., the term "Annual
        Additions" shall mean, for any Plan Year, the sum of (i) the amount
        credited to the Participant's Accounts from Profit Sharing Contributions
        for such Plan Year; (ii) any Employee contributions for the Plan Year;
        and (iii) any amounts described in Sections 415(l)(1) or 419(A)(d)(2) of
        the Code. The term "Employee Contributions," for purposes of the
        preceding sentence, shall mean amounts considered contributed by the
        Employee and which do not qualify for tax deferral treatment under
        Section 401(k) of the Code.

                  15.2.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
        Section, the Annual Addition for any Limitation Year beginning before
        January 1, 1987 shall not be recomputed to treat all Employee
        contributions as Annual Additions.

        15.3. OTHER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. If the Employer or an Affiliated
Company is contributing to any other defined contribution plan (as defined in
Section 415(i) of the Code) for its Employees, some or all of whom may be
Participants in this Plan, then contributions to the other plan shall be
aggregated with contributions under this Plan for the purposes of applying the
limitations of Section 15.1.

<PAGE>   91

        15.4. COMBINED PLAN LIMITATION (DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN). In the event a
Participant hereunder also is a participant in any qualified defined benefit
plan (within the meaning of Section 415(k) of the Code) of the Employer or an
Affiliated Company, then the benefit payable under such defined benefit plan, or
any of them, shall be reduced for so long and to the extent necessary to provide
that the sum of the "defined benefit fraction" and the "defined contribution
fraction" for any Plan Year, as defined below, shall not exceed 1.

                  15.4.1. "Defined Benefit Fraction" shall be a fraction, the
        numerator of which is the projected benefit of a Participant under all
        qualified defined benefit plans adopted by the Employer or an Affiliated
        Company expressed as either an annual straight life annuity or a
        qualified joint and survivor annuity providing the maximum permissible
        survivor benefit (determined as of the close of the Plan Year), and the
        denominator of which is the lesser of (i) the maximum dollar amount
        otherwise allowable for such Plan Year under applicable law times 1.25
        or (ii) the percentage of compensation limit for such Plan Year times
        1.4.

                  15.4.2. "Defined Contribution Fraction" shall be a fraction,
        the numerator of which is the sum of the annual addition of the
        Participant's account under this Plan and any other defined contribution
        plans adopted by the Employer or an Affiliated Company for each Plan
        Year, and the denominator of which is the lesser for each such Plan Year
        of (i) maximum Annual Addition which could have been made under this
        Plan and any other defined contribution plans adopted by the Employer or
        an Affiliated Company for such Plan Year and for each prior Plan Year of
        service with the Employer or an Affiliated Company times 1.25 or (ii)
        the amount determined under the percentage of compensation limit for
        such Plan Year times 1.4.

        15.5. ADJUSTMENTS FOR EXCESS ANNUAL ADDITIONS. In general, Annual
Additions for any Plan Year under this Plan and any other defined contribution
plan (as defined in Code Section 414(i)) or defined benefit plan (as defined in
Code Section 414(j)) maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company will be
determined so as to avoid Annual Additions in excess of the limitations set
forth in Sections 15.1. through 15.4. However, if as a result of a reasonable
error in estimating the amount of the Annual Additions to a Participant's
Accounts under this Plan, such Annual Additions (after giving effect to the
maximum permissible adjustments under the other plans) exceed the applicable
limitations described in Sections 15.1. through 15.4., such excess Annual
Additions shall be corrected as follows:

                  15.5.1. If the Participant made any voluntary after-tax
        contributions to this or any other defined contribution plan that is
        maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company, which after-tax
        contributions were not matched by matching contributions, within the
        meaning of Code Section 401(m), such after-tax contributions shall be  
        


                                       85

<PAGE>   92

        returned to the Participant to the extent of any excess Annual 
        Additions.

                  15.5.2. If excess Annual Additions remain after the
        application of the above rule, if the Participant made any Pre-Tax
        Contributions to this or any other defined contribution plan that is
        maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company, which Pre-Tax
        Contributions were not matched by matching contributions, within the
        meaning of Code Section 401(m), such Pre-Tax Contributions shall be
        returned to the Participant to the extent of any excess Annual
        Additions.

                  15.5.3. If excess Annual Additions remain after the
        application of the above rule, if the Participant made any after-tax
        contributions to this or any other defined contribution plan that is
        maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company, which after-tax
        contributions were matched by matching contributions, within the meaning
        of Code Section 401(m), any such after-tax contributions shall be
        returned to the Participant and any matching contributions attributable
        thereto shall be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate any
        remaining excess Annual Additions.

                  15.5.4. If excess Annual Additions remain after the
        application of the above rule, if the Participant made any Pre-Tax
        Contributions to this or any other defined contribution plan that is
        maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company, which Pre-Tax
        Contributions were matched by matching contributions, within the meaning
        of Code Section 401(m), any such Pre-Tax Contributions shall be returned
        to the Participant and any matching contributions attributable thereto
        shall be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate any remaining
        excess Annual Additions.

                  15.5.5. If excess Annual Additions remain after the
        application of the above rule, any other Profit Sharing Contributions
        shall be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate any remaining
        excess Annual Additions.

        15.6. DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS. Any
excess Annual Additions attributable to Profit Sharing Contributions on behalf
of a Participant for any Plan Year, other than Pre-Tax Contributions returned to
the Participant in accordance with Section 15.5., shall be held unallocated in a
suspense account for the Plan Year and applied to reduce the Profit Sharing
Contributions for the succeeding Plan Year, or Years, if necessary. No
investment gains or losses shall be allocated to a suspense account established
for this purpose.

        15.7. AFFILIATED COMPANY. For purposes of this Article 15., the status
of an entity as an Affiliated Company shall be determined by reference to the
percentage tests set forth in Code Section 415(h).

                            RESTRICTION ON ALIENATION

        16.1. GENERAL RESTRICTIONS AGAINST ALIENATION.

                  16.1.1. The interest of any Participant or Beneficiary in the
        income, benefits, payments, claims or rights hereunder, or in the Trust
        Fund shall not in any event be subject to sale, assignment,
        hypothecation, or transfer. Each Participant and Beneficiary is
        prohibited from anticipating, encumbering, assigning, or in any manner
        alienating his or her interest under the Trust Fund, and is without
        power to do so, except as may otherwise be provided for in the Trust
        Agreement. The interest of any Participant or Beneficiary shall not be
        liable or subject to his debts, liabilities, or obligations, now
        contracted, or which may be subsequently contracted. The interest of any
        Participant or Beneficiary shall be free from all claims, liabilities,
        bankruptcy proceedings, or other legal process now or hereafter incurred
        or arising; and the interest or any part thereof, shall not be subject
        to any judgment rendered against the Participant or Beneficiary.

                  16.1.2. In the event any person attempts to take any action
        contrary to this Article 16., that action shall be void and the Company,
        the Employer, the Administration Committee, the Trustees and all
        Participants and their Beneficiaries, may disregard that action and are
        not in any manner bound thereby, and they, and each of them separately,
        shall suffer no liability for any disregard of that action, and shall be
        reimbursed on demand out of the Trust Fund for the amount of any loss,
        cost or expense incurred as a result of disregarding or of acting in
        disregard of that action.

                  16.1.3. The preceding provisions of this Section 16.1. shall
        be interpreted and applied by the Administration Committee in accordance
        with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(13) as construed and
        interpreted by authoritative judicial and administrative rulings and
        regulations.

        16.2. NONCONFORMING DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER COURT ORDER.

                  16.2.1. In the event that a court with jurisdiction over the
        Plan and the Trust Fund shall issue an order or render a judgment
        requiring that all or part of a Participant's interest under the Plan
        and in the Trust Fund be paid to a spouse, former spouse and/or children
        of the Participant by reason of or in connection with the marital
        dissolution and/or marital separation of the Participant and the spouse,
        and/or some other similar proceeding involving marital rights and
        property interests, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.1.
        the Administration Committee may, in its absolute discretion, direct the
        applicable Trustee to comply with that court order or judgment and
        distribute assets of the Trust Fund in accordance therewith.


                                       87

<PAGE>   94

                  16.2.2. The Administration Committee's decision with respect
        to compliance with any such court order or judgment shall be made in its
        absolute discretion and shall be binding upon the Trustee and all
        Participants and their Beneficiaries, provided, however, that the
        Administration Committee in the exercise of its discretion shall not
        make payments in accordance with the terms of an order which is not a
        qualified domestic relations order or which the Administration Committee
        determines would jeopardize the continued qualification of the Plan and
        Trust under Section 401 of the Code. Nothing in this Plan shall prevent
        the Administration Committee from honoring a domestic relations order as
        a qualified domestic relations order solely because it requires payment
        to an alternate payee prior to the date the Participant attains age
        fifty (50).

                  16.2.3. Neither the Plan, the Company, an Employer, the
        Administration Committee nor the Trustee shall be liable in any manner
        to any person, including any Participant or Beneficiary, for complying
        with any such court order or judgment.

                  16.2.4. Nothing in this Section 16.2. shall be interpreted as
        placing upon the Company, an Employer, the Administration Committee or
        any Trustee any duty or obligation to comply with any such court order
        or judgment. The Administration Committee may, if in its absolute
        discretion it deems it to be in the best interests of the Plan and the
        Participants, determine that any such court order or judgment shall be
        resisted by means of judicial appeal or other available judicial remedy,
        and in that event the Trustee shall act in accordance with the
        Administration Committee's directions.

                  16.2.5. The Administration Committee shall adopt procedures
        and provide notifications to a Participant and alternate payees in
        connection with a qualified domestic relations order, to the extent
        required under Code Section 414(p).

                                 PLAN AMENDMENTS

        17.1. AMENDMENTS. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors may
at any time, and from time to time, amend the Plan by an instrument in writing
executed in the name of the Company and delivered to the applicable Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment shall be made at any time, the
effect of which would be:

                  17.1.1. To cause any assets of the Trust Fund to be used for
        or diverted to purposes other than providing benefits to the
        Participants and their Beneficiaries, and defraying reasonable expenses
        of administering the Plan, except as provided in Section 5.12.;

                  17.1.2. To have any retroactive effect so as to deprive any
        Participant or Beneficiary of any accrued benefit to which he would be
        entitled under this Plan if his employment were terminated immediately
        before the amendment, to the extent so doing would contravene Code
        Section 411(d)(6);

                  17.1.3. To eliminate or reduce a subsidy or early retirement
        benefit or an optional form of benefit to the extent so doing would
        contravene Code Section 411(d)(6); or

                  17.1.4. To increase the responsibilities or liabilities of a
        Trustee or an Investment Manager without his written consent.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        18.1. NO ENLARGEMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS.

                  18.1.1. This Plan is strictly a voluntary undertaking on the
        part of the Company and shall not be deemed to constitute a contract
        between the Company or any Employer and any Employee, or to be
        consideration for, or an inducement to, or a condition of, the
        employment of any Employee.

                  18.1.2. Nothing contained in this Plan or the Trust shall be
        deemed to give any Employee the right to be retained in the employ of
        the Company or an Employer or to interfere with the right of the Company
        or an Employer to discharge or retire any Employee at any time.

                  18.1.3. No Employee, nor any other person, shall have any
        right to or interest in any portion of the Trust Fund other than as
        specifically provided in this Plan.

        18.2. MAILING OF PAYMENTS; LAPSED BENEFITS.

                  18.2.1. All payments under the Plan shall be delivered in
        person or mailed to the last address of the Participant (or, in the case
        of the death of the Participant, to the last address of any other person
        entitled to such payments under the terms of the Plan) furnished
        pursuant to Section 18.3. below.

                  18.2.2. In the event that a benefit is payable under this Plan
        to a Participant or any other person and after reasonable efforts such
        person cannot be located for the purpose of paying the benefit for a
        period of three (3) consecutive years, the benefit shall be forfeited
        and as soon thereafter as practicable shall be applied to reduce
        contributions by the Employer who was the Employer of the Participant as
        of the Participant's Severance Date. In the event any person entitled to
        payment of a benefit that has been forfeited in accordance with this
        Section 18.2. submits a claim for such benefit, payment shall be made to
        such person out of current forfeitures, or if necessary, such Employer
        shall make an additional contribution for purposes of paying such
        benefit.

                  18.2.3. For purposes of this Section 18.2., the term
        "Beneficiary" shall include any person entitled under Section 9.9. to
        receive the interest of a deceased Participant or deceased designated
        Beneficiary. It is the intention of this provision that the benefit will
        be distributed to an eligible Beneficiary in a lower priority category
        

                                       90

<PAGE>   97

        under Section 9.9. if no eligible Beneficiary in a higher priority 
        category can be located by the Administration Committee after 
        reasonable efforts have been made.

                  18.2.4. The Accounts of a Participant shall continue to be
        maintained until the amounts in the Accounts are paid to the Participant
        or his Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
        Plan is terminated, the following rules shall apply:

                           18.2.4.1. All Participants (including Participants
                  who have not previously claimed their benefits under the Plan)
                  shall be notified of their right to receive a distribution of
                  their interests in the Plan;

                           18.2.4.2. All Participants shall be given a
                  reasonable length of time, which shall be specified in the
                  notice, in which to claim their benefits;

                           18.2.4.3. All Participants (and their Beneficiaries)
                  who do not claim their benefits within the designated time
                  period shall be presumed to be dead. The Accounts of such
                  Participants shall be forfeited at such time. These
                  forfeitures shall be disposed of according to rules prescribed
                  by the Administration Committee, which rules shall be
                  consistent with applicable law.

                           18.2.4.4. The Administration Committee shall

                  with respect to the notice and forfeiture rules stated above.

                  18.2.5. Should it be determined that the preceding rules
        relating to forfeiture of benefits upon Plan termination are
        inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Code and/or ERISA, these
        provisions shall become inoperative without the need for a Plan
        amendment and the Administration Committee shall prescribe rules that
        are consistent with the applicable provisions of the Code and/or ERISA.

        18.3. ADDRESSES. Each Participant shall be responsible for furnishing
the Administration Committee with his correct current address and the correct
current name and address of his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries.

        and other communications from Participants shall be in writing, on forms
        prescribed by the Administration Committee and shall be mailed or
        delivered to the office designated by the Administration Committee, and
        shall be deemed to have been given when received by that office.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable

        make a telephonic communication or other electronic filing method
        available to Participants for certain elections, designations or
        applications for benefits under this Plan.

                  18.4.2. Each notice, report, remittance, statement and other
        communication directed to a Participant or Beneficiary shall be in
        writing and may be delivered in person or by mail. An item shall be
        deemed to have been delivered and received by the Participant when it is
        deposited in the United States Mail with postage prepaid, addressed to
        the Participant or Beneficiary at his last address of record with the
        Administration Committee.

        18.5. REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE. The Plan Administrator shall be

                              TOP-HEAVY PLAN RULES

        19.1. APPLICABILITY.

                  19.1.1. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the
        contrary, the provisions of this Article 19. shall apply in the case of
        any Plan Year in which the Plan is determined to be a Top-Heavy Plan
        under the rules of Section 19.3.

                  19.1.2. Except as is expressly provided to the contrary, the
        rules of this Article 19. shall be applied after the application of the
        Affiliated Company rules of Code Section 414.

        19.2. DEFINITIONS.

                  19.2.1. For purposes of this Article 19., the term "Key
        Employee" shall mean any Employee or former Employee who, at any time
        during the Plan Year or any of the four (4) preceding Plan Years, is or
        was --

                           19.2.1.1. An officer of the Employer having an annual
                  compensation greater than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in
                  effect under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) for this Plan Year.
                  However, no more than fifty (50) Employees (or, if lesser, the
                  greater of three (3) or ten percent (10%) of the Employees)
                  shall be treated as officers;

                           19.2.1.2. One of the ten (10) employees having annual
                  compensation from the Employer of more than the limitation in
                  effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A) and owning (or
                  considered as owning within the meaning of Code Section 318)
                  the largest interests in the Employer. For this purpose, if
                  two (2) Employees have the same interest in the Employer, the
                  employee having greater annual compensation from the Employer
                  shall be treated as having a larger interest;

                           19.2.1.3. A Five Percent Owner of the Employer; or

                           19.2.1.4. A One Percent Owner of the Employer having
                  an annual compensation from the Employer of more than one
                  hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).

                  19.2.2. For purposes of this Section 19.2., the term "Five
        Percent Owner" means any person who owns (or is considered as owning
        within the meaning of Code Section 318) more than five percent (5%) of
        the outstanding stock of the Employer or stock possessing more than five


                                       94

<PAGE>   101

        percent (5%) of the total combined voting power of all stock of the
        Employer. The rules of Subsections (b), (c), and (m) of Code Section 414
        shall not apply for purposes of applying these ownership rules. Thus,
        this ownership test shall be applied separately with respect to every
        Affiliated Company.

                  19.2.3. For purposes of this Section 19.2., the term "One
        Percent Owner" means any person who would be described in Subsection
        19.2.2. if "one percent (1%)" were substituted for "five percent (5%)"
        each place where it appears therein.

                  19.2.4. For purposes of this Section 19.2., the rules of Code
        Section 318(a)(2)(C) shall be applied by substituting "five percent
        (5%)" for "fifty percent (50%)."

                  19.2.5. For purposes of this Article 19., the term "Non-Key
        Employee" shall mean any Employee who is not a Key Employee.

                  19.2.6. For purposes of this Article 19., the terms "Key
        Employee" and "Non-Key Employee" include their Beneficiaries.

        19.3. TOP-HEAVY STATUS.

                  19.3.1. The term "Top-Heavy Plan" means, with respect to any
        Plan Year --

                           19.3.1.1. Any defined benefit plan if, as of the
                  Determination Date, the present value of the cumulative
                  accrued benefits under the Plan for Key Employees exceeds
                  sixty percent (60%) of the present value of the cumulative
                  accrued benefits under the plan for all Employees, and

                           19.3.1.2. Any defined contribution plan if, as of the
                  Determination Date, the aggregate of the account balances of
                  Key Employees under the Plan exceeds sixty percent (60%) of
                  the present value of the aggregate of the account balances of
                  all Employees under the plan.

                  For purposes of this Subsection 19.3.1., the term
        "Determination Date" means, with respect to any Plan Year, the last day
        of the preceding Plan Year. In the case of the first Plan Year of any
        plan, the term "Determination Date" shall mean the last day of that Plan
        Year.

                  The present value of account balances under a defined
        contribution plan shall be determined as of the most recent valuation
        date. The present value of accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan
        

                                       95

<PAGE>   102

        shall be determined as of the same valuation date as used for computing
        plan costs for minimum funding. The present value of the cumulative
        accrued benefits of a Non-Key Employee shall be determined under either:

                           19.3.1.3. the method, if any, that uniformly applies
                  for accrual purposes under all plans maintained by affiliated
                  companies, within the meaning of Code Sections 414(b), (c),
                  (m) or (o); or

                           19.3.1.4. if there is no such method, as if such
                  benefit accrued not more rapidly than the lowest accrual rate
                  permitted under the fractional accrual rate of Section
                  411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.

                  19.3.2. Each plan maintained by the Employer required to be
        included in an Aggregation Group shall be treated as a Top-Heavy Plan if
        the Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Group. If the Aggregation Group is
        not a Top-Heavy Group no plan in such group shall be a Top-Heavy Plan.

                           19.3.2.1. The term "Aggregation Group" means --

                                    19.3.2.1.1. Each Plan of the Employer in
                           which a Key Employee is a Participant, and

                                    19.3.2.1.2. Each other plan of the Employer
                           which enables any plan described in Subparagraph
                           19.3.2.1.1. to meet the requirements of Code Sections
                           401(a)(4) or 410.

                  Also, any plan not required to be included in an Aggregation
        Group under the preceding rules may be treated as being part of such
        group if the group would continue to meet the requirements of Code
        Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 with the plan being taken into account.

                           19.3.2.2. The term "Top-Heavy Group" means any
                  Aggregation Group if the sum (as of the Determination Date) of
                  --

                                    19.3.2.2.1. The present value of the
                           cumulative accrued benefits for Key Employees under
                           all defined benefit plans included in the group, and

                                    19.3.2.2.2. The aggregate of the account
                           balances of Key Employees under all defined
                           contribution plans included in the group exceeds
                           sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for
                           all Employees.

                           19.3.2.3. For purposes of determining --

                                    19.3.2.3.1. The present value of the
                           cumulative accrued benefit of any Employee, or


                                       96

<PAGE>   103

                                    19.3.2.3.2. The amount of the account
                           balance of any Employee,

        such present value or amount shall be increased by the aggregate
        distributions made with respect to the Employee under the plan during
        the five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date. The preceding
        rule shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which, if
        it had not been terminated, would have been required to be included in
        an Aggregation Group. Also, any rollover contribution or similar
        transfer initiated by the Employee and made after December 31, 1983 to a
        plan shall not be taken into account with respect to the transferee plan
        for purposes of determining whether such plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or
        whether any Aggregation Group which includes such plan is a Top-Heavy
        Group).

                  19.3.3. If any individual is a Non-Key Employee with respect
        to any plan for any Plan Year, but the individual was a Key Employee
        with respect to the plan for any prior Plan Year, any accrued benefit
        for the individual (and the account balance of the individual) shall not
        be taken into account for purposes of this Section 19.3.

                  19.3.4. If any individual has not performed any services for
        the Employer at any time during the five (5) year period ending on the
        Determination Date, any accrued benefit for such individual (and the
        account balance of the individual) shall not be taken into account for
        purposes of this Section 19.3.

        19.4. MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS. For each Plan Year in which the Plan is
Top-Heavy, the minimum contributions for that year shall be determined in
accordance with the rules of this Section 19.4.

                  19.4.1. Except as provided below, the minimum contribution
        (excluding amounts deferred under a cash or deferred arrangement under
        Section 401(k) of the Code and any Profit Sharing Contributions taken
        into account under Section 401(k)(3) or 401(m)(3) of the Code) for each
        Non-Key Employee who has not separated from service as of the last day
        of the Plan Year shall be not less than three percent (3%) of his
        Compensation, regardless of whether the Non-Key Employee has less than
        1,000 Hours of Service during such Plan Year or elected to make Pre-Tax
        Contributions to the Plan for such year.

                  19.4.2. Subject to the following rules of this Subsection
        19.4.2., the percentage set forth in Subsection 19.4.1. above shall not
        be required to exceed the percentage at which contributions (including
        amounts deferred under a cash or deferred arrangement under Section
        401(k) of the Code and any Profit Sharing Contributions taken into
        account under Section 401(k)(3) or 401(m)(3) of the Code) are made (or
        

                                       97

<PAGE>   104

        are required to be made) under the Plan for the year for the Key
        Employee for whom the percentage is the highest for the year. This
        determination shall be made by dividing the contributions for each Key
        Employee by so much of his total compensation for the year as does not
        exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), as adjusted in
        accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17). For purposes of this Subsection
        19.4.2., all defined contribution plans required to be included in an
        Aggregation Group shall be treated as one plan. However, the rules of
        this Subsection 19.4.2. shall not apply to any plan required to be
        included in an Aggregation Group if the plan enables a defined benefit
        plan to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) or 410.

                  19.4.3. The requirements of this Section 19.4. must be
        satisfied without taking into account contributions under chapter 2 or
        21 of the Code, title II of the Social Security Act, or any other
        Federal or State law.

                  19.4.4. In the event a Participant is covered by both a
        defined contribution and a defined benefit plan maintained by the
        Employer, both of which are determined to be Top Heavy Plans, the
        defined benefit minimum, offset by the benefits provided under the
        defined contribution plan, shall be provided under the defined benefit
        plan.

                  19.4.5. In no instance may the Plan take into account an
        Employee's compensation in excess of the first two hundred thousand
        dollars ($200,000) (or such greater amount as may be permitted pursuant
        to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code). For purposes of this Section 19.4.,
        an Employee's Compensation shall be as defined in Section 2.9. for
        purposes of Article 14.

        19.5. MAXIMUM ANNUAL ADDITION.

                  19.5.1. Except as set forth below, in the case of any
        Top-Heavy Plan the rules of Code Section 415(e)(2)(B) and (3)(B) shall
        be applied by substituting "1.0" for "1.25."

                  19.5.2. The rule set forth in Subsection 19.5.1. above shall
        not apply if the requirements of both Paragraphs 19.5.2.1. and
        19.5.2.2., below, are satisfied.

                           19.5.2.1.  The requirements of this Paragraph
                  19.5.2.1. are satisfied if the rules of Subsection 19.5.1.
                  above would be satisfied after substituting "four percent
                  (4%)" for "three percent (3%)" where it appears therein with
                  respect to participants covered only under a defined
                  contribution plan.

                           19.5.2.2.  The requirements of this Paragraph
                  19.5.2.2. are satisfied if the Plan would not be a Top-Heavy
                  

                                       98

                  Plan if "ninety percent (90%)" were substituted for "sixty 
                  percent (60%)" each place it appears in Section 19.3.1.

                  19.5.3. The rules of Subsection 19.5.1. shall not apply with
        respect to any Employee as long as there are no --

                           19.5.3.1. Profit Sharing Contributions, forfeitures,
                  or voluntary nondeductible contributions allocated to the
                  Employee under a defined contribution plan maintained by the
                  Employer, or

                           19.5.3.2. Accruals by the Employee under a defined

                             FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE
                           WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION
                         SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN


This First Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Western Digital Corporation
Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan") made this 30th day of June 1995, by
Western Digital Corporation (the "Company"), the sponsoring employer of the
Plan.

WHEREAS the Company has previously amended and completely restated the Plan as
of March 23, 1995; and

WHEREAS the Company has reserved the right to amend the Plan in Section 17.1;
and

WHEREAS the Company desires to amend the Plan in certain respects.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is amended as follows:

 1.      Section 5.5.1 is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                  5.5.1. As of the last day of any Plan Year commencing on or
         after July 1, 1994, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion,
         determine that each Employer shall make a Profit Sharing Contribution
         for such Plan Year on behalf of "Eligible Participants," as defined in
         this Subsection 5.5.1., in an amount to be determined by the Board. Any
         Profit Sharing Contribution made in accordance with this Subsection
         5.5.1. shall be allocated as of the last day of a Plan year to the
         Profit Sharing Contributions Account of each Eligible Participant in
         the same proportion that the Eligible Participant's Compensation for
         the Plan Year bears to the Compensation of all Eligible Participants
         for the Plan year, provided, however, that the Board of Directors may,
         in its discretion, provide for a profit sharing contribution to be made
         to each Eligible Participant's account in a uniform amount (expressed
         as a percentage of each such Eligible Participant's Compensation),
         subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law as a condition to
         maintaining the tax-qualified status of the Plan under Sections 401(a)
         et seq. of the Code. For purposes of this Subsection 5.5.1., "Eligible
         Participant" means for a Plan Year, each individual who is an Eligible
         Employee of the Employer as of the last day of the Plan Year. Unless
         the Company determines that Profit Sharing Contributions shall be made
         for a Plan Year in accordance with this Subsection 5.5.1., no Profit
         Sharing Contributions shall be made for such Plan Year under this
         Subsection 5.5.1. With respect to periods prior to the Plan Year
         beginning July 1, 1994, contributions by the Employer shall be governed
         by provisions of this Plan as in effect with respect to such periods.

 2.      Except as expressly provided herein above, the provisions of the Plan
         shall continue in full force and effect as set forth herein.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this First Amendment to the Western
Digital Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Plan to be executed by its duly
authorized officer on this 30th day of June, 1995.

        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
OVERVIEW
 
     Western Digital operates in an extremely competitive industry characterized
by short product life cycles, dependence upon a limited number of suppliers for
certain component parts, dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other
personnel and significant expenditures for product development. The hard drive
market is also subject to recurring periods of severe price competition, the
most recent of which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 and the
first quarter of fiscal 1994.
 
     The Company's hard drive product strategy is to be the first to market with
the highest capacity per platter hard drives at competitive prices. The
successful implementation of this strategy during the last three fiscal years
has resulted in significant increases in unit shipments of hard drives, with
attendant improvements in factory utilization and manufacturing efficiencies,
lower component costs and overall reductions in per unit manufacturing costs.
During fiscal 1994 the Company also implemented a "fabless" manufacturing
strategy for its microcomputer products business by selling its silicon wafer
manufacturing facility and entering into supply agreements with several
suppliers of integrated circuits. This resulted in an immediate reduction in
manufacturing costs, which significantly improved microcomputer products gross
profit margins during fiscal 1994 and 1995.
 
     These factors, combined with stabilizing industry conditions, resulted in
Western Digital improving operating income to $133.0 and $91.9 million in fiscal
1995 and 1994, respectively, after incurring an operating loss of $10.0 million
in fiscal 1993. Although microcomputer product operations improved significantly
from fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1994, hard drive product operations accounted for the
majority of the increase in operating income during this period. During fiscal
1995, hard drive product operations improved modestly, while continuing
improvement in microcomputer products operations, although at a reduced rate
from fiscal 1994, provided most of the increase in operating income from fiscal
1994.
 
     Western Digital's continuing focus on asset management, combined with the
improvement in operating income, has resulted in the Company strengthening its
financial position during each of the last three years. Key measures of these
improvements are as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
COMPARISON OF 1995, 1994 AND 1993
 
     The Company reported net income of $123.3 million for 1995 compared with
net income of $73.1 million for 1994 and a net loss of $25.1 million for 1993.
The increase in net income in 1995 over 1994 resulted from a 38% increase in
revenues, a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, and
higher net interest and other income. Partially offsetting these improvements
was an approximately two percentage point decline in gross profit margin. The
improved operating results from 1993 to 1994 resulted from a 26% increase in
revenues and an improvement in gross margin of approximately six percentage
points.

     Sales of hard drive products were $1.9, $1.4 and $1.0 billion in 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively. During 1995, unit shipments increased 49% which,
combined with a modest decline in average selling prices ("ASPs"), resulted in
hard drive revenues increasing 41% from 1994. Increased business with original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") during 1995 accounted for the majority of the
increase in unit shipments. During 1994, unit shipments increased 56% from 1993,
but declining ASPs reduced the 1993 to 1994 hard drive revenue growth rate to
32%. The revenue increase in 1994 resulted primarily from increased business in
the retail and distribution channels.
 
     Sales of microcomputer products were $191.0, $160.0, and $178.0 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Year-to-year variations in microcomputer
product sales were generally attributable to product introduction cycles.
 
     Gross profit margins were as follows:

    Hard drive products............................................  16.2%    19.1%    15.3%
    Microcomputer products.........................................  41.8%    33.7%    12.5%

    Overall........................................................  18.5%    20.6%    14.9%
</TABLE>
 
     During 1995, the Company increased its shipments of hard drive products to
OEMs, which typically require lower prices and a broader product mix (including
lower capacity hard drives) in exchange for high volumes. Overall hard drive
industry conditions also became more competitive during 1995 as the industry's
manufacturing capacity more closely matched demand and competitors continued to
shorten product development cycles. These were the primary factors which
contributed to the decline in hard drive product gross margin during 1995.
 
     The improvement in hard drive product gross margin from 1993 to 1994 was
the result of a significant increase in unit shipments which reduced per unit
production costs by lowering component costs and increasing manufacturing
efficiencies. As compared to 1993, the Company also increased its relative level
of business with retail and distribution customers that typically purchase
product in lower volumes, but at higher ASPs.
 
     The improvements in microcomputer products gross margins were generally
attributable to lower product costs resulting from the Company's fabless
manufacturing strategy implemented in January 1994.
 
     Research and development expense ("R&D") in 1995 increased approximately
$18.0 million, or 16%, as compared with the prior year and increased
approximately $11.2 million, or 11%, from 1993 to 1994. These increases were
primarily attributable to planned expenditures to support new hard drive product
introductions.
 
     Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased $17.1
million, or 15%, from the prior year and $22.8 million, or 25%, from 1993 to
1994 primarily as a result of higher selling, marketing and other related
expenses in support of higher revenue levels and higher variable compensation
plan accruals.
 
     Interest and other income was $12.0 million in 1995, comprising net
interest income of $8.9 million and a $3.1 million gain from the sale of stock
held for investment. Net interest expense was $5.8 million and $15.1 million in
1994 and 1993, respectively. The improvement from 1994 to 1995 was the result of
significantly lower levels of outstanding debt and higher average cash and
short-term investment balances. The $9.3 million decline in net interest expense
from 1993 to 1994 was due to significant reductions in outstanding debt.
 
     The provision for income taxes in 1995 and 1994 consists primarily of taxes
associated with certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries which had taxable
income. The Company's effective tax rate of 15% recorded in 1995 and 1994
results primarily from the earnings of certain subsidiaries which are taxed at
substantially lower tax rates as compared with United States statutory rates
(see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     At July 1, 1995, the Company had $307.7 million in cash and short-term
investments as compared with $243.5 million at June 30, 1994. During 1995, the
Company generated $121.3 million in cash flow from operations, with cash flow
from earnings, net of depreciation and amortization, and an increase in current
liabilities being offset by cash used to fund increased accounts receivable,
inventories and other assets. Capital expenditures totaled $54.8 million and
were incurred primarily for the expansion of media production and the retooling
of the Company's Malaysian facility into a hard drive manufacturing site. The
Company anticipates that capital expenditures in 1996 will total approximately
$125.0 million and will relate to increased hard drive capacity and normal
replacement of existing assets. Approximately $10.8 million was used to
repurchase 805,000 shares of the Company's common stock in the open market in
1995. The Company believes that its current cash and short-term investments and
anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all
currently planned expenditures and sustain operations during the next fiscal
year.
 
     The Company has an $85.0 million accounts receivable facility with certain
financial institutions. The facility consists of a $50.0 million arrangement at
Eurodollar or reference rates of the participating banks which expires in 1997
and a $35.0 million committed arrangement at a rate approximating commercial
paper rates which expires in 1996. This facility is intended to serve as a
source of working capital as may be needed from time to time.
 
     Notwithstanding the significant improvements in financial position realized
over the past years, the ability of the Company to sustain its improved working
capital management and to continue operating profitably is dependent upon a
number of factors including competitive conditions in the marketplace, general
economic conditions, the efficiency of the Company's manufacturing operations
and the timely development and introductions of new products which address
market needs.

                          WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION
 
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Western Digital Corporation ("Western Digital" or the "Company") has
prepared its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and has adopted accounting policies and practices which
are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates. Following are the
Company's significant accounting policies:
 
Fiscal Year
 
     Effective July 1, 1994, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June
30 to a 52 or 53-week year ending on the Saturday nearest June 30. Accordingly,
the 1995 fiscal year ended on July 1, whereas the previous two fiscal years
ended on June 30. All general references to years relate to fiscal years unless
otherwise noted.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of foreign
subsidiaries have been translated using the U.S. dollar as the functional
currency. As such, foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
of these accounts are reflected in the results of operations. Monetary and
non-monetary asset and liability accounts have been translated at the exchange
rate in effect at each year end and at historical rates, respectively. Operating
statement accounts have been translated at average monthly exchange rates.
 
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
 
     The Company's cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments,
primarily money market funds and commercial paper, with original maturities of
three months or less. Short-term investments represent investments in U.S.
Treasury Bills with original maturities beyond three months and less than twelve
months. These investments are considered held to maturity and valued at
amortized cost, which approximates fair market value.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
     The Company designs, manufactures and sells hard drives and microcomputer
products to personal computer manufacturers and resellers throughout the world.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains reserves
for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within
management's expectations. The Company also has cash equivalent and short-term
investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution or investment instrument and restrict placement of these
investments with financial institutions or investment instruments evaluated as
highly credit-worthy.
 
Inventory Valuation
 
     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost
is on a first-in, first-out basis for raw materials and is computed on a
currently adjusted standard basis (which approximates first-in, first-out) for
work in process and finished goods.
 
Depreciation and Amortization
 
     The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line
basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income
tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Goodwill and 

                                       10
<PAGE>   11
purchased technology, the recoverability of which are subject to periodic
evaluation, are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated lives which are fifteen and five to fifteen years, respectively.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
     The Company recognizes revenue at time of shipment and records a reserve
for price adjustments and estimated sales returns. The Company has agreements
with its resellers to provide price protection for inventories held by the
resellers at the time of published list price reductions and, under certain
circumstances, stock rotation for slow-moving items. These agreements may be
terminated upon written notice by either party. In the event of termination, the
Company may be obligated to repurchase a certain portion of the resellers'
inventory.
 
Income Taxes
 
     The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income
Taxes." SFAS 109 generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be
recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and expected benefits of
utilizing net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards. The Company records a
valuation allowance for certain temporary differences for which it is not
certain whether the Company will receive future tax benefits. The impact on
deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are applied to the
years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and
reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.
 
Per Share Information
 
     Primary earnings per share amounts are based upon the weighted average
number of shares and dilutive common stock equivalents for each period
presented. Fully diluted earnings per share additionally reflects dilutive
shares assumed to be issued upon conversion of the Company's convertible
subordinated debentures.
 
     Loss per share amounts are based upon the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents are not
included in the computation because their effect would be antidilutive.
 
Reclassifications
 
     Certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

NOTE 3 -- SALE OF WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY
 
     In December 1993, the Company sold its silicon wafer fabrication facility
and certain tangible assets to Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") for $111.0 million
plus certain other considerations, including the assumption by Motorola of
equipment leases and certain other liabilities associated with the facility. The
gain on the sale of the facility was not material to the financial position or
results of operations of the Company. Concurrent with the sale, the Company
entered into a supply contract with Motorola under which Motorola is supplying
silicon wafers to Western Digital through December 1995.
 
NOTE 4 -- DEBT
 
Senior Debt
 
     During 1994, the Company entered into an $85.0 million accounts receivable
facility with certain financial institutions. The facility consists of a $50.0
million arrangement at Eurodollar or reference rates of the participating banks
which expires in 1997 and a $35.0 million one-year committed arrangement at a
rate approximating commercial paper rates. During 1995, the Company renewed the
$35.0 million one-year committed arrangement with terms similar to the original
arrangement. The facility is intended to serve as a source of working capital as
may be needed from time to time. The facility, under which there has been no
borrowings, requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and
restricts the payment of dividends.
 
Subordinated Debt
 
     During 1995, $58.1 million of the Company's 9% convertible subordinated
debentures, due 2014, were converted into 4,026,623 shares of the Company's
common stock. In connection with this conversion, the Company charged $.7
million of unamortized issue costs to shareholders' equity. The remaining $.5
million of the Company's debentures were redeemed for cash.

NOTE 5 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 
Patents And Licenses
 
     Although the Company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications
in process, the Company believes that the successful manufacture and marketing
of its products generally depends more upon the experience, technical know-how
and creative ability of its personnel rather than upon ownership of patents. 

     The Company pays royalties under several patent licensing agreements 
which require periodic payments. From time to time, the Company receives claims
of alleged patent infringement from patent holders which typically contain an
offer to grant the Company a license.
 
Foreign Exchange Contracts
 
     The Company enters into short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets,
liabilities and future commitments denominated in foreign currencies. At July 1,
1995 and June 30, 1994, the Company had outstanding $110.0 and $30.5 million,
respectively, of forward exchange contracts with commercial banks. These
contracts generally have maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months. The
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and
recognized in the results of operations in the year in which the underlying
transaction is consummated and are not material for all periods presented. Costs
associated with entering into such contracts are amortized over the life of the
instrument. At July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1994, the carrying value of the foreign
currency contracts approximated their fair market value.
 
Operating Leases
 
     The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under long-term,
non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2000.
Rental expense under these leases, including month-to-month rentals, was $25.5,
$26.5 and $29.5 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
     Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of
July 1, 1995 are (in thousands):

</TABLE>
 
Legal Claims
 
     The Company was sued by Amstrad plc ("Amstrad") in December 1992 under a
complaint that alleges that hard drives supplied by the Company in 1988 and 1989
were defective and caused damages to Amstrad of $186.0 million. The Company
filed a counterclaim for $3.0 million in actual damages plus exemplary damages
in an unspecified amount. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses
to Amstrad's claims and intends to vigorously defend itself against the Amstrad
lawsuit.
 
     The Company was sued in March 1993 by Conner Peripherals, Inc. ("Conner").
The suit alleges that the Company infringes five Conner patents and seeks
damages (including treble damages) in an unspecified amount and injunctive
relief. If Conner were to prevail in its claims, the Company could be enjoined
from using any of the Conner patents found to be valid and infringed that are
the subject of this action as well as held liable for past infringement damages.
The amount of such damages, if any, could be material. The Company believes that
it has meritorious defenses to Conner's claims and intends to defend itself
against the Conner lawsuit. The Company has also filed a suit alleging that
Conner infringes two of the Company's patents.


                                       13
<PAGE>   14
 
     The Company was sued in December 1994 by Rodime plc ("Rodime"). The suit
alleges that the Company infringes one of Rodime's patents which relates to
3.5-inch hard drives. Based on the opinion of patent counsel, the Company
believes that the broad claims of the Rodime patent, if scrutinized in court,
will not withstand an attack on validity and believes the Company has not
infringed any valid claim of the Rodime patent. If Rodime were to prevail on its
claim, the Company could be held liable for damages for past infringement. The
damages, if any, are uncertain but could be material. The Company believes that
it has meritorious defenses to Rodime's claims and intends to vigorously defend
itself against the Rodime lawsuit.
 
     The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims
arising in connection with its business. There can be no assurance that such
legal proceedings and claims would be resolved without any material adverse
effect on the Company's business, consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
 
     It is management's opinion, however, that none of the above mentioned legal
proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, consolidated financial position or results of operations. The costs of
defending such litigation can be substantial, regardless of outcome.

     Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed at substantially lower
income tax rates as compared with local statutory rates. The lower rates reduced
income taxes and increased net earnings by $33.2 million ($.65 per share, fully
diluted), $27.4 million ($.60 per share, fully diluted) and $8.6 million ($.27
per share, fully diluted) in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. These lower
rates expire periodically through 2005.
 
     At July 1, 1995, the Company had Federal NOL carryforwards of $149.8
million and tax credit carryforwards of $18.5 million, which expire in 1996
through 2009.
 
     Net undistributed earnings from international subsidiaries at July 1, 1995
were $206.5 million. The net undistributed earnings are intended to finance
local operating requirements. Accordingly, an additional United States tax
provision has not been made.

Stock Purchase Rights
 
     In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect stockholders' rights in
the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of
the Company's outstanding common stock carries one Right to Purchase Series "A"
Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("the Right"). The Right enables the
holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital
or of the acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten days after a
person or group publicly announces it has acquired or has tendered an offer for
15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Rights are redeemable
by the Company at $.01 per Right and expire in 1999.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
     During 1994, the Company implemented an employee stock purchase plan
("ESPP") in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby
eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their salary
to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at 85% of the fair market value
of common stock on the date of grant or the exercise date, whichever is less.
Approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance
under this plan. Approximately 484,000 shares were issued under this plan during
1995. No shares were issued during 1994.
 
Profit Sharing Plan
 
     Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted an annual Profit Sharing Plan
covering eligible domestic employees. During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company
authorized 8% of defined pre-tax profits to be allocated to the participants.
Payments to participants of the Profit Sharing Plan were $11.3, $7.4 and $1.2
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
Repurchase of Common Stock
 
     During the year ended July 1, 1995, the Company repurchased 805,000 shares
of its common stock in the open market at a cost of $10.8 million.

NOTE 8 -- BUSINESS SEGMENT AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 
     Western Digital operates in one industry segment--the design, manufacture
and marketing of hard drives, integrated circuits and board-level products to
the personal computer industry. During 1995, one customer accounted for 11% of
the Company's revenues. During 1994 and 1993, two customers accounted for 24% of
the Company's revenues.
 
     The Company's operations outside the United States include manufacturing
facilities in Singapore and Malaysia as well as sales offices throughout the
world.
 
     The following table summarizes operations by entities located within the
indicated geographic areas for the past three years. United States revenues to
unaffiliated customers include export sales, principally to Asia, of $399.2,
$300.0 and $237.7 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.
 
     Transfers between geographic areas are accounted for at prices comparable
to normal sales through outside distributors. General and corporate expenses of
$49.6, $43.6 and $32.7 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, have been
excluded in determining operating income (loss) by geographic region.

                          WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION
 
                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
The Board of Directors
Western Digital Corporation:
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western
Digital Corporation as of July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended July 1, 1995. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western
Digital Corporation as of July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1994, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended July 1, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
