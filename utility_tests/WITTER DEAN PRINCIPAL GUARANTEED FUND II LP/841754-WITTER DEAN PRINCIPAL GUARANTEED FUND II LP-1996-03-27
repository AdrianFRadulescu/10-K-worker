         December 31, 1995 Annual Report
         for the Dean Witter Principal
         Guaranteed Fund II L.P.                      II and IV

                                               PART I
Item 1.  BUSINESS
         (a) General Development of Business. Dean Witter Principal
Guaranteed Fund II L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited
partnership formed to engage in the speculative trading of commodity
futures contracts and other commodity interests, including, but not
limited to, forward contracts on foreign currencies and options on futures
contracts and physical commodities.
         Units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership were
registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 33-
25041) which became effective on December 21, 1988.  The offering of units
was underwritten on a "best efforts" basis by Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
("DWR"), a commodity broker and affiliated corporation of the
Partnership's General Partner, Demeter Management Corporation ("Demeter"). 
The Partnership commenced trading on March 1, 1989.  On April 20, 1995 the
Partnership terminated trading and all open positions were liquidated. 
While the Guaranteed Redemption Date (the date on which investors are
guaranteed $1,000 per Unit) is not until March 31, 1996, the rise in NAV
above the guaranteed level presented Limited Partners with the opportunity
to obtain the return of their initial investment earlier than the
Guaranteed Redemption Date.  For this reason and the fact that pursuant to
the Partnership's Leverage Policy only 17% of the Partnership's assets
were available for trading, the General Partner determined it was in the
best interests of Limited Partners and of the Partnership to terminate
trading and to recommend that Limited Partners redeem their Units.  The
Partnership's net asset value per unit, as of December 31, 1995, was
$1,046.10, representing an increase of 7.30 percent from the net asset 
<PAGE>
value per unit of $974.93 at December 31, 1994.  For a more detailed
description of the Partnership's business see subparagraph (c).
         (b) Financial Information about Industry Segments.  Until it
terminated trading, the Partnership's business comprises only one segment
for financial reporting purposes, speculative trading of commodity futures
contracts and other commodity interests.  The relevant financial
information is presented in Items 6 and 8.
         (c) Narrative Description of Business.  The Partnership was in the
business of speculative trading in commodity futures contracts and other
commodity interests, pursuant to trading instructions provided by
independent trading advisors, as described in (a) above, the Partnership
terminated trading on April 20, 1995.  Until the guaranteed redemption
date, the Partnership will maintain cash for the benefit of unitholders
and will engage in no further business activities.
         (d) Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic
          Operations Export Sales.
         The Partnership had not engaged in any operations in foreign
countries; however, prior to the termination of trading, the Partnership
(through the commodity broker) entered into forward contract transactions
where foreign banks were the contracting party and futures contracts on
foreign exchanges.
Item 2.  Properties
         The executive and administrative offices are located within the
offices of DWR.  The DWR offices utilized by the Partnership are located
at Two World Trade Center, 62nd Floor, New York, NY 10048.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
         Demeter is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to
which the Partnership is a party or to which any of its assets are
subject.
Item 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
         None.

Item 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S PARTNERSHIP UNITS AND RELATED
         SECURITY HOLDER MATTERS

         There is no established public trading market for the Units of
Limited Partnership Interest in the Partnership.  The number of holders of
Units at December 31, 1995 was approximately 915.  No distributions have
been made by the Partnership since it commenced trading operations on
March 1, 1989.  Demeter has sole discretion to decide what distributions,
if any, shall be made to investors in the Partnership.  No determination
has yet been made as to future distributions.
         Limited Partnership Units are registered for sale to the public in
certain Canadian provinces.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Liquidity.  The Partnership's assets are deposited in separate
commodity trading accounts with DWR, the commodity broker, and prior to
the termination of trading were used by the Partnership as margin to
engage in commodity futures, forward contracts and other commodity
interest trading.  DWR holds such assets in either designated depositories
or in securities approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
("CFTC") for investment of customer funds.  Since the Partnership has
terminated trading, the liquidity risks associated with commodity future,
forward contract and commodity interest trading are no longer present. 
Partnership cash balances at DWR will be used to Fund future redemptions.

PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II
ANNUAL REPORT
1995
 
Dear Limited Partner:
 
This marks the seventh annual report for the Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed
Fund II ("PGF II"). PGF II began 1995 trading at a Net Asset Value per Unit of
$974.93 and increased by 7.3% to close the year at $1,046.10. Since its
inception in 1989, PGF II has increased by 4.6% (a compound annualized return
of 0.7%).
 
In January, PGF II recorded net losses as trendless price movement in a
majority of the markets traded was experienced. In financial futures trading,
short-term volatile price movement in both U.S. and international bond futures
resulted in losses for PGF II. Choppy movement in metals, agricultural and soft
commodities prices resulted in additional Fund losses for the month. During
February, PGF II recorded net profits as gains were recorded from long U.S. and
Japanese bond futures positions as prices moved higher during the month.
Smaller gains were recorded during February in currency trading as the value of
most major world currencies, particularly the German mark, Swiss Franc and
Japanese yen, moved higher versus the U.S. dollar. In March, PGF II posted
profits as long positions in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc profited from a
continued increase in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Additional gains were
recorded in interest rate futures as a result of holding long positions in
Japanese government bond futures.
 
In April, PGF II recorded net profits as trading gains in Japanese government
bond
<PAGE>
 
futures were recorded for the third consecutive month. Additional gains were
recorded early in the month from long positions in the Japanese yen as the
value of the yen continued to increase versus the U.S. dollar. Smaller gains
were recorded from long positions in energy futures as oil and gas prices moved
higher during April.
 
On April 20, 1995 PGF II terminated trading and all open positions were
liquidated. While the Guaranteed Redemption Date (the date on which investors
are guaranteed $1,000 per Unit) is not until March 31, 1996, the rise in Net
Asset Value presented Limited Partners with the opportunity to obtain the
return of their initial investment earlier than the Guaranteed Redemption Date.
For this reason and the fact that pursuant to PGF II's Leverage Policy, only
17% of PGF II's assets were available for trading, the General Partner
determined it was in the best interests of Limited Partners and of PGF II to
terminate trading and to recommend that Limited Partners redeem their Units.
 
All profits recorded after April 20, 1995 were the result of interest income
credited to the Fund more than offsetting the Letter of Credit Fee charged.
 
Due to the fact that PGF II has terminated futures trading, its assets are
currently being held in an account with Dean Witter Reynolds, where Dean Witter
is paying PGF II interest on 100% of its assets at a prevailing rate on U.S.
Treasury bills. PGF II's assets will receive such interest until Investors
redeem their Units or until the Guaranteed Redemption Date. No further futures
trading will be undertaken for PGF II's account. ALTHOUGH PGF II WILL NOT TRADE
AND WILL EARN INTEREST, IT IS OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE PAYING A LETTER OF CREDIT
FEE TO CITIBANK AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 1.125% UNTIL THE GUARANTEED REDEMPTION
DATE.

1995 and 1994 and the related statements of operations, changes in partners'

Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed Fund II
L.P. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in

DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
ORGANIZATION--Dean Witter Principal Guaranteed Fund II L.P. (the "Partnership")
is a limited partnership organized to engage in the speculative trading of
commodity futures contracts, commodity options contracts and forward contracts
on foreign currencies. The General Partner for the Partnership is Demeter
Management Corporation (the "General Partner"). The commodity broker is Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ("DWR"). Both DWR and the General Partner are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Dean Witter, Discover & Co. The General Partner had retained
Commodities Corporation (U.S.A.) N.V. ("C.C.") as the trading manager of the
Partnership.
 
The General Partner is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity
of the Partnership and income (losses) are shared by the General and Limited
Partners based upon their proportional ownership interests.
 
During April, 1995, the Net Asset Value per unit of the Partnership rose above
$1,000. The General Partner determined it was in the best interest of investors
and the Partnership to terminate trading and to recommend that investors redeem
their units. All trading was terminated and all open positions were liquidated
as of April 20, 1995.
 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements.
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION--Commodity futures contracts, commodity options and forward
contracts on foreign currencies are open commitments until settlement date.
They are valued at market and the resulting unrealized gains and losses are
reflected in income. Monthly, DWR pays the Partnership interest income based
upon 80% of the average daily Net Assets for the month that are allocated for
commodity trading and 100% of the average daily Net Assets for the month that
are not allocated for commodity trading at a rate equal to the average yield on
13-Week U.S. Treasury Bills issued during such month. As noted above, on April
20, 1995, trading was terminated and all open positions were liquidated.
Effective April 20, 1995, DWR is paying the Partnership interest income based
on 100% of all of the Partnership's average daily Net Assets at a rate equal to
the prevailing rate on 13-week U.S. Treasury Bills. For purposes of such
interest payments, Net Assets do not include monies due the Partnership on
forward contracts and other commodity interests, but not actually received.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER UNIT--Net income (loss) per Unit is computed using the
weighted average number of units outstanding during the period.
 
EQUITY IN COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNTS--The Partnership's asset "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" consists of cash on deposit at DWR to be
used as margin for trading and the net asset or liability related to unrealized
gains or losses on open contracts and the net option premiums paid or received.
The asset or liability related to the unrealized gains or losses on forward
contracts is presented as a net amount because the Partnership has a master
netting agreement with DWR.
 
BROKERAGE FEES AND RELATED TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS--Through April 20, 1995,
the monthly brokerage fee was equal to 35/48 of 1% per month of the
Partnership's adjusted month-end Net Assets, as defined in the Limited
Partnership Agreement, that were allocated for commodity trading. Transaction
fees and costs were accrued on a half-turn basis.
 
OPERATING EXPENSES--Through April 20, 1995, The Partnership incurred a monthly
management fee and was eligible to incur an incentive fee. Also, pursuant to a
Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement with C. C. and Citibank, N.A.
("Citibank"), the Partnership pays to Citibank a monthly Letter of Credit fee
equal to 3/32 of 1% of the amount available to be drawn under the letter of
credit. The amount available to be drawn under the letter of credit equals
$1,000 multiplied by the total Partnership units outstanding, which at December
31, 1995 and 1994 equals $4,938,128 and $24,352,041, respectively. The General
Partner and/or DWR bear all other operating expenses.
 
GUARANTEE--The Partnership has entered into an Agreement of Guarantee, which is
supported by the above-mentioned letter of credit, with C.C. and C.C. Guarantee
Corporation pursuant to which any Limited Partner who redeems Units as of March
31, 1996 (the "Guaranteed Redemption Date") will receive at least $1,000 for
each Unit redeemed.
 
REDEMPTIONS--Limited Partners may redeem some or all of their Units at 100% of
the Net Asset Value per Unit on the special redemption dates described in the
Limited Partnership Agreement or as of the last day of any month upon five
business days advance notice by redemption form to the General Partner.
 
DISTRIBUTIONS--The Partnership will not make any distributions until after the
Guaranteed Redemption Date, and thereafter will only make distributions on a
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of the General Partner.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
INCOME TAXES--No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying
financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting
income or loss based upon their respective share of the Partnership's revenues
and expenses for income tax purposes.
 
DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP--The Partnership will terminate on December 31,
2025 or at an earlier date if certain conditions set forth in the Limited
Partnership Agreement occur.
 
Citibank has the right, under certain circumstances, to cause the Partnership
to deposit it's Net Assets in a non-interest bearing demand deposit account at
Citibank until the Guaranteed Redemption Date. Such amounts will subsequently
be returned to the Partnership for distribution to the Limited Partners.
 
2. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
The Partnership's cash is on deposit with DWR in commodity trading accounts to
meet margin requirements as needed. DWR pays interest on these funds as
described in Note 1. Under its Customer Agreement with DWR, the Partnership
paid DWR a monthly brokerage fee as described in Note 1.
 
3. TRADING MANAGER
 
Until the Partnership terminated trading, the General Partner had retained C.C.
as the trading manager of the Partnership. Compensation to C.C. as trading
manager consisted of a management fee and an incentive fee as follows:
 
MANAGEMENT FEE--As of the last day of each month, the Partnership paid a
monthly management fee equal to 1/2 of 1% of the Partnership's adjusted Net
Assets, as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement, that were allocated to
commodity interest trading accounts which the trading advisors traded on behalf
of the Partnership.
 
INCENTIVE FEE--The Partnership paid an annual incentive fee to C.C. equal to
20% of the Partnership's "New Appreciation", as defined in the Limited
Partnership Agreement, of the Partnership's Net Assets as of the end of each
annual incentive period ending on the last day in February. Such incentive fee
was accrued in each month in which "New Appreciation" occurred. In those months
in which "New Appreciation" was negative, previous accruals, if any, during the
incentive period were reduced. In those instances in which a Limited Partner
redeems an investment, the incentive fee (if earned through a redemption date)
was to be paid to C.C. on those redemptions in the month of such redemptions.

DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
4. LEVEL OF ASSETS TRADED
 
Pursuant to the Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement, maximum Net
Assets allocable to trading were adjusted as necessary due to changes in Net
Asset value per Unit, current interest rates and the time remaining until the
Guaranteed Redemption Date. To accomplish this, C.C. reallocated assets among
the trading advisors and a non-traded reserve account. The assets not allocated
to trading advisors earned interest income at a rate equal to the average yield
on 13-week U.S. Treasury Bills and no management and brokerage fees were
charged on such assets. On April 20, 1995, trading was terminated and all open
positions were liquidated.
 
5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
Prior to the April 20, 1995 termination of trading, the Partnership traded
futures, options and forward contracts in interest rates, stock indices,
commodities, currencies, petroleum, and precious metals. Futures and forwards
represent contracts for delayed delivery of an instrument at a specified date
and price. Risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts and the
potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the
contracts. There are numerous factors which may significantly influence the
market value of these contracts, including interest rate volatility. There were
no open positions at December 31, 1995. At December 31, 1994, open contracts
were:

The unrealized gains on open contracts are reported as a component of "Equity
in Commodity futures trading accounts" on the Statements of Financial Condition
and totaled $0 and $483,674 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
<PAGE>
 
DEAN WITTER PRINCIPAL GUARANTEED FUND II L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONCLUDED)
 
Of the $483,674 net unrealized gain on open contracts at December 31, 1994,
$376,243 related to exchange traded futures contracts and $107,431 related to
off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts.
 
Exchange-traded futures contracts held by the Partnership at December 31, 1994
matured through June 1995. Off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts held
by the Partnership at December 31, 1994 matured through January 1995. The
contract amounts in the above table represent the Partnership's extent of
involvement in the particular class of financial instrument, but not the credit
risk associated with counterparty nonperformance. The credit risk associated
with these instruments is limited to the amounts reflected in the Partnership's
Statements of Financial Condition.
 
The Partnership also had credit risk because the sole counterparty, with
respect to most of the Partnership's assets, is DWR. Exchange-traded futures
and options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in
value settled on a daily basis. DWR, as the futures commission merchant for all
of the Partnership's exchange-traded futures and options contracts, is required
pursuant to regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
segregate from its own assets, and for the sole benefit of its commodity
customers, all funds held by DWR with respect to exchange-traded futures and
option contracts including an amount equal to the net unrealized gain on all
open futures and option contracts which funds totaled $5,224,820 and
$23,858,439 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. With respect to the
Partnership's off-exchange-traded forward currency and option contracts, there
are no daily settlements of variations in value nor is there any requirement
that an amount equal to the net unrealized gain on open forward and option
contracts be segregated. With respect to those off-exchange-traded forward
currency contracts, the Partnership is at risk to the ability of DWR, the
counterparty on all of such contracts, to perform.
 
6. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
 
Management has determined to terminate the Partnership as of March 31, 1996.
The Partnership will be liquidated and holders of Units as of March 31, 1996
will receive a distribution equal to the Net Asset Value per Unit on that date
multiplied by their respective number of Units.
