ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 
GENERAL
 
        Ultrak, Inc. (the "Company" or "Ultrak") designs, manufactures, 
markets,  and services video closed circuit television ("CCTV") products for 
use in security applications, general observation, medical and dental equipment
and automated manufacturing systems. These products include a broad line of
cameras, lenses, monitors, switchers, time lapse recorders, multiplexers, and
wireless video transmission systems.
 
     Prior to July 1993, Ultrak's Exxis Technologies, Inc. subsidiary marketed,
sold, and serviced personal computer products, including desktop and tower
computers, disk drives, CD-ROM drives, printers and monitors sold under its
private brand name [X] Smart Choice. Ultrak discontinued this business in July
1993. See "ULTRAK MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" and Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
     Ultrak is a Colorado corporation incorporated in 1980. Ultrak's
headquarters are located at 1220 Champion Circle, Suite 100, Carrollton, Texas
75006. Ultrak conducts its principal business operations at five locations:
Carrollton (Dallas), Texas; Broomfield (Denver), Colorado; Annapolis, Maryland;
southern California and Chicago, Illinois and has additional sales offices in
New York, southern Florida, Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     Effective April 1, 1994, Ultrak acquired a 56% interest in JAK Pacific
Video Warranty and Repair Services, Inc., a California corporation ("JAK"), for
total cash consideration of $573,000. JAK is in the business of providing
warranty and repair services for CCTV equipment for a line of products
manufactured by a Korean based company. JAK also has exclusive marketing and
sales rights for certain products in the United States. The operations of JAK
were merged with the existing operations of Ultrak's facility in southern
California. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Ultrak has an
option to acquire the remaining 44% of JAK for cash consideration of $500,000,
which will expire on December 31, 1995.
 
     In July 1994, Ultrak exercised its option, in accordance with the terms of
an Option Agreement, to acquire an additional 2.2% of the outstanding stock of
Dental Vision Direct, Inc. ("DVD") from the minority shareholders of DVD,
thereby increasing Ultrak's ownership in DVD from 80% to 82.2%. DVD is in the
business of manufacturing, marketing, and selling an intraoral video hand piece
(sold under the Ultracam trade name) and related accessories used by dentists in
their practices. Effective December 30, 1994, Ultrak acquired the remaining
17.8% interest in DVD from the minority owners for total cash consideration of
$5,000.

     On October 31, 1994, Ultrak's revolving line of credit with NationsBank of 
Texas, N.A. ("NationsBank") was increased from $12.0 million to $13.2 million.
The NationsBank revolving line of credit was further increased during February
1995 from $13.2 million to $15.0 million. On October 4, 1994, Petrus Fund,
L.P., of which Perot Investments, Inc. is the general partner, increased its
revolving line of credit to Ultrak from $6.0 million to $7.0 million and agreed
to further increase Ultrak's line of credit from $7.0 million to $8.0 million
upon Ultrak's achievement of certain net income requirements. In conjunction
with the amendments to both loan agreements, certain financial and operational
covenants were modified. All other terms and conditions of the loan agreements
were unchanged.

CCTV PRODUCTS; INDUSTRY
 
     Ultrak designs, manufactures, markets, and services video CCTV products for
use in security applications, general observation, medical and dental equipment,
and automated manufacturing systems. These products include a broad line of
cameras, lenses, monitors, switchers, time lapse recorders, multiplexers, and
wireless video transmission systems.
 
     Ultrak's target markets are wholesale distributors, installing dealers,
large end-users, mass merchants (for resale), manufacturing companies, system
integrators, and dentists. Each target market is reached through a dedicated
group of telemarketing and regional sales professionals as well as through
catalogs, magazine advertising, and industry trade shows.
 
     Approximately 70% of Ultrak's CCTV products sales carry its own brand names
(Ultrak, Exxis, [X] Smart Choice, Beck, Mobile Video Products, and Ultracam),
with the remainder having brands owned by others such as Mitsubishi, Sony,
Dedicated Micros, Panasonic, and others. Ultrak's own branded products are
manufactured to its design specifications by manufacturer suppliers located in
Korea, Japan, England, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, and the United States.
 
     According to a Smith Barney Shearson Electronic Security Industry Report,
dated January 25, 1994, by the year 2000, the CCTV industry is expected to be a
$755 million annual sales component of the expected $17 billion total U.S.
security industry. The CCTV segment of the security industry has experienced
rapid growth since the early 1980s. CCTV sales represent a significant portion
of the total security industry, trailing only intrusion detection devices and
fire detection apparatus in terms of sales. Included in the CCTV category are
CCTV cameras, lenses, monitors, switchers, time lapse recorders, multiplexers,
video transmission systems, and various types of peripheral equipment used for
CCTV installations. Ultrak's business is not generally seasonal in nature,
except that sales in December and January are typically 15-20% lower than other
months.
 
     Ultrak believes that it is an important factor within the CCTV industry and
that it is one of the three largest in terms of CCTV sales in the United States.
However, many of its competitors are divisions of much larger companies.
 
     Ultrak has trademark registration on its Ultrak, [X] Smart Choice, Beck,
Ultracam, the Witness, Video Butler, and BabyWatch trade names. In addition,
Ultrak has been issued a patent on its Ultracam intraoral hand piece and has
patents pending on a multiple operator dental system, the Witness, a security
observation system that records activity upon activation of an alarming input
signal, and several other devices.

SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTION
 
     Ultrak's product development staff designs and then coordinates with its
non-affiliated suppliers to manufacture certain of its private branded products
as well as coordinates and supervises the assembly and packaging of certain
products by its own employees. Ultrak has been and will continue to be
substantially dependent upon its manufacturer suppliers. Ultrak has exclusive
and non-exclusive sales and marketing rights for certain of the CCTV products it
sells, including certain CCTV cameras and systems manufactured in Japan and
Korea. Ultrak has in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,
short-term difficulties in obtaining some products from some manufacturers. In
general, Ultrak's suppliers are constantly developing new products that advance
the state of technology in security products and offer improved value. Ultrak
has in the past issued letters of credit or placed funds on deposit with its
suppliers to attempt to insure itself a constant and consistent supply of
products.
 
     Approximately 95% of Ultrak's purchases from its non-affiliated suppliers
are made in United States dollars with the remaining 5% purchased in Japanese
yen. To date, Ultrak has not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations
in the valuation of the Japanese yen. It is expected that the Company will
continue to purchase the vast majority of its products in United States dollars.
 
     Ultrak believes that it has close relationships with its suppliers. In some
cases, Ultrak is the exclusive or semi-exclusive marketer of its suppliers'
products in the United States. Ultrak's trading agreements with its suppliers
are both written and oral. In most of these relationships, Ultrak believes that
the relationship is as important to the supplier as it is to Ultrak. Thus,
Ultrak believes that there is a strong, mutually advantageous basis for the
trading relationship to exist and grow.
 
     Ultrak imports its private branded security products primarily from Korea,
Japan, England, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Because of foreign production lead times,
Ultrak normally makes purchase commitments to these foreign suppliers three to
six months in advance. Products ordered by Ultrak and manufactured by others in
Asia are shipped to warehouses of Ultrak located in the United States for
subsequent delivery to customers of Ultrak.
 
     Delivery times on these products to the United States vary from one week to
two months, depending on the mode of transportation used. Therefore, it is
necessary for Ultrak to commit to and carry larger levels of inventory than
would be necessary if it used strictly domestic suppliers.
 
     The nature of Ultrak's business is to ship most orders within 24 hours of
receipt of the order. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, Ultrak had approximately
$3,939,000 and $2,093,000, respectively, in backlog for its products which it
considers to be firm.
 
     Ultrak can ship its CCTV products from one of five warehouse locations
operated by it: Carrollton, Texas; Broomfield, Colorado; Annapolis, Maryland;
southern California; or Chicago, Illinois. Currently over 90% of all shipments
are made from the Carrollton, Texas, centralized warehouse. Inventory, accounts
receivable, purchasing, payroll, and other corporate business functions are
controlled on Ultrak's integrated computer system located in its Carrollton
headquarters. All sales locations are linked real time through a nationwide
network which allows for orders to be entered and shipped from multiple
locations.
 
     Approximately 21% of Ultrak's 1994 sales were to Walmart Stores, Inc. and
Sam's Wholesale Club, a division of Walmart Stores, Inc. No other single
customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales in 1994.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

     The Company's Common Stock (the "Ultrak Common Stock") became listed on
the National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Automated Quotation System ("Nasdaq") on January 18, 1994. Prior to that
time, Ultrak Common Stock was traded in the over-the-counter market and price
quotations for the two-year period shown below were reported on Nasdaq under
the symbol "ULTK." The quotations shown below, which are the range of the high
and low bid prices for 1993 and high and low closing prices thereafter, were
compiled by Ultrak from Monthly Statistical Reports supplied by Nasdaq. All
quotes for 1993 represent inter-dealer quotations, without retail markup,
mark-down, or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions
in the Ultrak Common Stock. All prices in 1993 have been retroactively restated
to reflect the one-for-six reverse stock split, which was effected on December
28, 1993.

* Retroactively restated to reflect the one-for-six reverse stock split, which
  was effected on December 28, 1993.
 
     The total number of holders of Ultrak Common Stock as of February 28, 
1995, was approximately 3,200, comprised of approximately 1,500 shareholders of
record and approximately 1,700 not of record.
 
     Ultrak has never paid any dividends to its common shareholders. Currently,
it is the intention of Ultrak not to pay any dividends to the holders of Ultrak
Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Management of Ultrak intends to
reinvest earnings available to common shareholders in the development and
expansion of Ultrak's business. The declaration in the future of any cash
dividends on Ultrak Common Stock will be at the discretion of the board of
directors and will depend upon the earnings, capital requirements and financial
position of Ultrak, general economic conditions, and other pertinent factors.
Ultrak's loan and security agreements with its financial institutions require
the lender's prior written consent to Ultrak's payment of cash dividends on
Ultrak Common Stock. To the extent allowed by Ultrak's loan agreements, Ultrak
does intend to pay dividends on its shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all of
which are owned by George K. Broady, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, and President of Ultrak. Annual preferred stock dividends in the
amount of $117,210 were paid to Mr. Broady during each of 1994, 1993, and 1992.

(1) Effective January 1, 1991, Ultrak acquired all of the outstanding common
     stock of CCTV Source, Inc. (CCTV). CCTV's sales and loss before income
     taxes for the year ended December 31, 1991 were $5,716,000 and $38,000,
     respectively.
 

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
 
  Results of Operations -- Continuing Operations:
 
     For the year ended December 31, 1994, sales from continuing operations were
$78,793,711, an increase of $26,381,740 (50%) over 1993. This growth was due
primarily (70%) to increased volume of sales of existing CCTV products to all of
the markets that Ultrak serves. New products introduced by Ultrak during 1994
contributed approximately 30% of the increase in sales.
 
     In comparison, cost of sales were $59,349,708 for the year ended December
31, 1994, an increase of $19,796,194 (50%) over 1993. This increase was in a
virtual direct relationship to the overall CCTV increase in sales. Gross margins
on sales increased to 24.68% in 1994 from 24.53% in 1993, primarily because of
new product sales at higher margins, offset by competition in the CCTV market
and a strategic decision by Ultrak to be an industry value leader.
 
     Marketing and sales expenses were $11,201,460 for the year ended December
31, 1994, an increase of $4,175,946 (59%) over 1993. This increase was due to
additional CCTV sales and sales support staff and related costs incurred to
support the increased level of CCTV sales, travel, and related costs and
increased marketing, advertising, and promotional costs.
 
     General and administrative expenses were $3,132,857 for the year ended
December 31, 1994, an increase of $954,934 (44%) from 1993 due to additional
administrative staff and related costs necessary to support the increase in
sales.
 
     Other expenses were $807,155 for the year ended December 31, 1994, an
increase of $172,538 (27%) over 1993. This increase was due primarily to
increased interest costs on borrowings offset by interest income on notes
receivable.

Results of Operations -- Discontinued Operations:

     On July 22, 1993, Ultrak announced that it would discontinue its personal
computer ("PC") products business segment and concentrate its resources on the
CCTV business segment. As a result of this decision, the operations and net
assets of the PC business segment have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.
 
     During the year ended December 31, 1994, Ultrak recorded an additional
provision of $190,000, net of income tax benefit, to reflect costs of
dissolution of the business as well as provision for expected settlement costs
of the remaining lawsuit relating to the discontinued operations.
 
     Sales included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
1994, 1993, and 1992 were $110,720, $19,232,836 and $9,677,585, respectively
(not included in net sales reported from continuing operations above).
 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources:
 
     Ultrak had a net increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 1994 of
approximately $142,000. Cash used in operating activities during 1994 was
approximately $3,517,000, primarily because of increases in accounts receivable,
inventory, and advances for inventory required by the significantly higher sales
volume. Cash used in investing activities was approximately $1,925,000 for
capital expenditures for furniture, fixtures, tooling, leasehold improvements,
and other fixed assets and acquisition of business. Cash provided by financing
activities was approximately $5,584,000, consisting of net borrowings from
Ultrak's bank and other lenders. It is expected that the Company should begin to
generate positive annual operating cash flows when its growth slows to a more
traditional level.
 
     During 1994, Ultrak advanced a net total of $699,000 on notes receivable to
three parties. The largest advance ($500,000) was to Veravision, Inc., a
California corporation ("Veravision"), for a working capital line of credit in 
consideration of interest on the borrowed funds and warrants to purchase 
Veravision's capital stock. Veravision, formed in 1993, is a manufacturer of 
dental camera products for which Ultrak has exclusive United States marketing 
rights. All of the notes have varying repayment terms, interest rates and other
terms.






<PAGE>   7
See Note H to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992.
 
     As of December 31, 1994, Ultrak had unused available lines of credit
totaling approximately $1,956,000.
 
     On October 31, 1994, Ultrak's revolving line of credit with NationsBank was
increased from $12.0 million to $13.2 million. The NationsBank revolving line of
credit was further increased during February 1995 from $13.2 million to $15.0
million. On October 4, 1994, Petrus Fund, L.P., of which Perot Investments,
Inc., is the general partner, increased its revolving line of credit to Ultrak
from $6.0 million to $7.0 million and provided for the further increase of the
line of credit from $7.0 million to $8.0 million upon Ultrak achieving certain
net income requirements. In conjunction with the amendments to both loan
agreements, certain financial and operational covenants were modified. All other
terms and conditions of the loan agreements were unchanged.
 
     Concurrently with the amendment to the Petrus loan agreement, the warrant
issued to Petrus to acquire Ultrak Common Stock was amended to reflect that the
warrant exercise price was reduced from $9.00 per share to $8.00 per share, and
the number of Shares of Ultrak Common Stock subject to the warrant was increased
from 154,762 to 200,000.
 
     Both of Ultrak's amended credit facilities contain financial covenants,
including leverage ratios, as defined, of not more than 2.75 to 1.0; current
ratios, as defined, of at least 1.20 to 1.0, working capital requirements,
limitations on capital expenditures and minimum net income requirements, among
others. Operational covenants contained in the credit agreements include
limitations on the sale of assets, prohibitions against liens on collateral,
limitations on indebtedness and contingent liabilities, prohibitions against
changes in management, payment of dividends and acquisitions of assets, among
others.
 
     Ultrak will continue to be dependent upon its bank and other lender
financing to fund its operations. Ultrak anticipates that its current operations
and future growth will be financed primarily through increased lines of credit
and internally generated profits. Ultrak believes such sources of funds will be
adequate for its projected needs for the next twelve (12) months. Ultrak may
attempt to raise additional equity capital if sales increase faster than planned
or if it is otherwise deemed advantageous to do so.
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992
 
  Results of Operations -- Continuing Operations:
 
     For the year ended December 31, 1993, sales from continuing operations were
$52,411,971, an increase of $23,547,493 (82%) over 1992. This growth was due to
increased sales of CCTV products to all of the markets that Ultrak serves.
 
     In comparison, cost of sales were $39,553,514 for the year ended December
31, 1993, an increase of $18,056,665 (84%) over 1992. This increase was due to
overall CCTV sales increases, new product sales, and new mass retail outlet
sales. Gross margins on sales decreased to 24.5% in 1993 from 25.5% in 1992,
primarily because of competition in the CCTV market and a strategic decision by
Ultrak to be an industry value leader.
 
     Marketing and sales expenses were $7,025,514 for the year ended December
31, 1993, an increase of $2,446,861 (53%) over 1992. This increase was due to
additional CCTV sales and sales support staff and related costs incurred to
support the increased level of CCTV sales, marketing costs to support sales, and
increased advertising and promotional costs.
 
     General and administrative expenses were $2,177,923 for the year ended
December 31, 1993, an increase of $667,565 (44%) from 1992 due to additional
administrative staff and related costs necessary to support the increase in
sales.
 
     Other expenses were $634,617 for the year ended December 31, 1993, a
decrease of $74,158 (10%) over 1992. This decrease was due primarily to interest
income on notes receivable offset by increased interest costs.
<PAGE>   8
     During the fourth quarter of 1993, Ultrak determined it was more likely
than not that a portion of its deferred tax valuation allowance was realizable.
This determination was a result of the profits from continuing operations in
1993 and the forecasted profits for 1994. A deferred tax valuation allowance
still remains for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
carryforwards, use of which are limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue 
Code.
 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources:
 
     Ultrak had a net decrease in cash for the year ended December 31, 1993 of
approximately $323,000. Cash used in operating activities during 1993 was
approximately $4,394,000, primarily because of increases in accounts receivable,
inventory and advances for inventory required by the significantly higher sales
volume. Cash used in investing activities was approximately $1,309,000,
primarily for capital expenditures for furniture, fixtures and other fixed
assets and funding of notes receivable. Cash provided by financing activities
was approximately $5,380,000, consisting of net borrowings from Ultrak's bank
and other lenders.
 
     As of December 31, 1993, Ultrak had unused available lines of credit
totaling approximately $5,410,000.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ultrak,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ultrak, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1993 AND 1992
 
NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Organization and Consolidation
 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Ultrak, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
  Inventories
 
     Inventories are comprised of goods held for resale, which are valued at the
lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
 
  Advances for Inventory
 
     Advances for inventory represents payments in advance for goods purchased
primarily from the Far East. Upon receipt, the advances are classified as
inventories.
 
  Furniture and Equipment and Depreciation
 
     Furniture and equipment are carried at cost. The provision for depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets ranging from three to ten years.
 
  Goodwill and Amortization
 
     Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is being amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from twenty to forty years. On an
ongoing basis, management reviews the valuation and amortization of goodwill to
determine possible impairment by comparing the carrying value to the
undiscounted future cash flows of the related business unit.
 
  Income Taxes
 
     Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method, under
which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
 
  Statement of Cash Flows
 
     For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, there were no cash
equivalents.
 
  Income Per Common Share
 
     Income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares result from the assumed issuance of shares
under the Company's incentive stock option plan, warrants and convertible
preferred stock, if dilutive.
 
  Reclassifications
 
     Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years to conform with the
1994 presentation.

NOTE D -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
     The stockholders of Ultrak, Inc., voting at a special meeting of
stockholders held December 17, 1993, approved, effective December 28, 1993, an
amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation and a concurrent
one-for-six reverse stock split of shares of the Company's common stock.
Accordingly, all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
reverse stock split.
 
     The amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation changed the number
of authorized shares of the Company's common stock from 50,000,000 shares
(before the reverse stock split) to 20,000,000 shares (after the reverse stock
split); eliminated the authorization of the Company's Class A Non-Voting Common
Stock, $.01 par value, Series A 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and
Senior Series B 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (none of which was
outstanding); amended the rights and preferences of the outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock to, among other things, increase the relative voting rights of
holders of that Series, and made other changes in the rights and preferences of
that Series to give effect to the reverse stock split.
 
  Preferred Stock
 
     The Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation authorize issuance in
series of up to 2,000,000 shares of $5 par value preferred stock, of which
195,351 shares have been designated as Series A, 12% cumulative convertible
preferred stock.
 
     The Series A Preferred Stock earns dividends at the rate of 12% per annum,
beginning January 1, 1991, payable quarterly. All dividends accrue whether or
not such dividends have been declared and whether or not there are profits,
surplus, or other funds of the Company legally available for payment.
 
     The Company may at any time redeem all or any portion of the Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding at the liquidation value of $5 plus unpaid
dividends. A holder of Series A Preferred Stock may convert all or any of the
shares into shares of the Company's Common Stock at any time at a conversion
rate equal to the original purchase price of $5.00 plus any unpaid dividends
divided by $2.40.
 
     Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders. Each Series A Preferred Share is entitled
to voting rights equal to 16.667 shares of common stock.
 
  Nonqualified Stock Option Plan
 
     The 1988 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan provides for options to be granted
covering 833,334 shares of common stock. Shares under grant generally become
exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning one year after the date
of grant, and expire after ten years.
 
     Option exercise prices are set by the Board of Directors on the date of
grant at the market price of the Company's common stock.
